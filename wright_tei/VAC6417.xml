            <head type="sub">OR, LOVE AND WAR IN 1860.</head>
            <head>A SORT OF PREFACE.</head>
            <p>JUST before the war, our country was almost without news. We were obliged to make the
               most of everything, in order to have excitement enough to live on. Many cultivated,
               rich, and ease-loving gentlemen used to spend their time in the National Capitol,
               and, to while away that time, as the over-full enjoyment went on, they were put to
               many straits for something to talk of.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1857, a party—myself among others—established a select court,
               criminal, civil, and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">élite.</foreign> The whole object and
               end, however, of this court, was to amuse and interest ourselves. We had a definite
               organization, and seldom varied from the established rules of an ordinary court. We
               had for our judge a portly man of about fifty—the most eccentric, good-natured,
               well-informed kind of fool you ever saw; more of a gentleman than Falstaff—less a
               drinker; more of a wit—less a knave: and, as Jenkins says; about the same to America
               that Falstaff was to England.</p>
            <p>Jenkins, whose real name was Rumor, and who fashions the bulk of this history, had
               been for many years a reporter; but, having recently come into the possession of a
               fortune, no longer followed his pursuit, except for amusement. Rumor had it, too,
               that about the time referred to he was in love with the Judge's niece, afterwards
               well known by the battles in the neighborhood of Loudon Heights.</p>
            <p>The other members of our court constituted the jury, plaintiffs, defendants,
               witnesses, et cetera. As you will perceive, if you read this history far enough, our
               court had also to do with courtships and marriages, and did really have contact with
               the outside world as much as was generally supposed at that period. I continued a
               member of this court until the war broke out, and then, being a Northerner, I
               withdrew, taking no further interest in the matter, only so far that I always
               remembered with great joy the pleasant hours I had passed. During all this long war,
               I was left entirely to my own conjectures about my former companions, and of their
               whereabouts. Neither did I know who, since that time, had taken charge of the
               marriages and courtships that were the life of Washington.</p>
            <pb n="iv-5" xml:id="VAC6417-00000003"/>
            <p>One day, not long ago, Jenkins, that is to say, Rumor, came into my office, and I was
               right glad to see him. He said he was broke—dead broke—and indeed he looked a good
               deal discouraged; but I gave him wine, and he rallied rapidly. When he was himself
               again, he said I was the cleverest man he ever knew, and that I might as easily get a
               monument to my greatness as any one, if I would only fix up his notes and publish
               them; for, he said, they contained not only the full history of the rebellion, but
               all the fashions, marriages, and courtships during the whole four years. I gave him
               more wine, and he said I was a good-looking man, and that no other should have the
               privilege in so great a work as that he was going to offer me, and that was, that
               when I was dead and gone my picture should be in the frontispiece. He unfolded a
               large bundle of papers and handed me a large basketful beside. "Good Lord," said I,
               "must I rewrite all these, in order to be great?" But he smiled, and said, "You, sir,
               that have read all languages; that have travelled all over the world; that have
               studied and labored for thirty years in literature; that know all men and value them
               so highly; that look from your aerial position; (I am very tall) you, to talk of all
               these?"</p>
            <p>When he tumbled out the basketful, I saw that the manuscripts were in phonographic
               characters, and told him I could not decipher them. But he said he would furnish me
               an interpreter, and all I had to do was to write. I thought I would give him another
               glass of wine, which, when he had finished it, he pronounced excellent, and then he
               went on,</p>
            <p>"Who wrote the best history of England? Shakespeare. Who the best of Scotland? Scott.
               And we all know who wrote the best history of knight errantry. They dealt in love
               affairs, and you know we prize them first. Now I will venture to say that there is
               not a man or woman this side of Jersey who does not feel a tingle of joy on learning
               the finale of some spirited amour; and, for that reason I want you to salt these
               things down."</p>
            <p>With that he tossed them into my arms, saying, "You know one of the rules of the club
               was that no member could refuse to do what was ordered by a superior." I took them,
               and he immediately translated a portion to me, beginning with the session of the
               Chicago convention. Now if you will be kind enough to read what follows, you will
               learn the things that Jenkins wrote.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE FRACAS IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE.—JUDGE UNDERHILL OF LOUDON HEIGHTS,AND ALSO
                     SOME OF THE DARK LIGHTS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ABOUT twenty of us were waiting in the office, and about forty others outside. We
                  were waiting for news from the Chicago Convention. I did not know at that time who
                  Rhett was, but was told afterwards that he was editor and proprietor of the
                  Charleston <title>Mercury.</title> Whilst the talk was going on in the office, I
                  heard a Mr. Jones ask how far it was to Chicago. The conversation turned on
                  politics, and a Mr. Smith became engaged in angry words with Jones. The latter
                  said he was in favor of freedom in the Territories, and the former thereupon
                  accused him of saying "a nigger is as good as a white man." It was like all
                  political rows, beginning in calm argument, but ending in violence and shame. Then
                  came the flourish of weapons, knives and pistols.</p>
               <p>At this instant Rhett and Johnson rushed upon them. Rhett said, "Gentlemen, what
                  would you do? Must such trifling words incite you to deeds of blood?" He took
                  Smith, and Johnson took Jones, and they were bearing them back, when Smith said,
                  "What, shall he deride my native state?" Jones replied, "I did not." "You did?"
                  says Smith. "You cast a slur on Breckenridge, and he and I are Kentuckians." "That
                  is too farfetched" said Jones; but thereupon Smith tore himself away from Rhett,
                  reiterating, "Coward, you say a nigger is as good as a white man." He flew at
                  Jones, but the crowd interfered and forcibly ejected him from the office.</p>
               <p>As soon as quiet was restored, Rhett said, "Did ever man take offence so easily;
                  did ever man so hastily come to a base conclusion. A dozen words, and then to
                  knives and pistols."He then called Johnson, and Johnson said, "Well sir." Rhett
                  being old, and somewhat excited, leaned on Johnson's arm, his hand on his
                  shoulder, and he facing the crowd, "This is indeed approaching war," he continued;
                  "all men, and on all occasions, meet now, but to discuss North and South. Brooks
                  bled poor Sumner for this, and for as trifling a matter as this between Jones and
                  Smith. Sumner spoke, Brooks took offence—not for what Sumner said, but for what he
                  himself inferred might have been spoken. Brooks loved offence more than even
                  justice, and so do we all. We have had no war for fifty years, and we have become
                  chronic. The Creator designs that there shall be a grand upheaval in this nation.
                  We have not learned to govern ourselves with moderation and reason, and the
                  scourge of war is already in embryo in every man's breast. These trifles which we
                  behold, are but its leakings; outbreaks preliminary to a mighty revolution."</p>
               <p>Now, when Rhett began to talk, we were all silent; for the wisdom of his words
                  showed us that we were in the presence of a superior man. Up to this time I did
                  not know Johnson, but was told who he was. He replied to Rhett by saying, "This is
                  through politicians, and, like their fellows in all countries, they have their
                  hobby for electioneering purposes. Like the Prussian king, who told his subjects
                  that the savages of England and France were coming, and that they should at once
                  invest him with absolute power; and he promised that if the country would give him
                  his desire, he would fill every man's purse with gold, and his stomach with beer.
                  The opposite party, however, wishing to retain the parliament, often came to blows
                  with the king's party, who invariably retorted to them: "So, you say a Frenchman,
                  or an Englishman is as good as a Dutchman." The king's party however succeeded,
                  and this style of argument is still the basis of all politics. In England, a
                  candidate electioneers by saying he will fill the stomachs of his constituents; or
                  by cautioning him that the infidel French are coming; or, that the barbarous
                  Americans need watching. In the South, we say slavery is wealth, give us more; and
                  our opposite party says a "negro is as good as a white man." Now this is all
                  nonsense. These are extreme and ultra views which no sensible man of either party
                  endorses. They are political fabrications. False, for villainous party purposes
                  only. What we want, Mr. Rhett, is concession."</p>
               <p>"Concession! dogs!" said Rhett, "for<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6417-00000004"/> thirty
                  years we have conceded all to the North; but, sir, till they get our slaves, or we
                  get the government, I swear by heavens, as I am a man, this agitation shall never
                  cease. Men like you are as detrimental to the whole country as to the South."
                  "Why, now, look you," said Johnson, "you are like Jones and Smith; like Brooks and
                  Sumner. Because I said that one word, concession, you infer that I am on the
                  opposite side, and might say some ugly things."</p>
               <p>"No, sir," said Rhett, "I infer nothing, though the South shall have her rights.
                  We have done nothing but concede. We have been battling like dogs for thirty years
                  to obtain even a decent footing in the West. Sir, the Free States are usurping
                  everything. The tide of these affairs will soon rise, till three-quarters of the
                  States will be free, and then what becomes of us? We can thank our stars for poor
                  Pierce and James Buchanan; but—suppose a devil with some shrewd sense be elected
                  from the North? That is the gist of our forebodings. I tell you, Johnson, sooner
                  than have this country overrun with abolitionism, I would have every man, woman
                  and child in it annihilated."<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

                  country. Rhett denied it. He said he only wanted the rights of the South
                  guaranteed, though ere he replied in full, the place was thrown into some
                  confusion by the entrance of Toombs, Floyd, Thompson, Wigfall, Davis, Slidell,
                  Mason, and Yancey, and immediately after them came Gen. Scott leaning on the arm
                  of Prescott. Johnson said, good humoredly, "Here are your disciples, only for
                  Scott and Prescott." When he said this, Rhett leaned over the railing to look at
                  Scott and Prescott, and he asked who that was on whom Scott was leaning?
                  "Prescott," said Johnson; "young Prescott, the son of a washerwoman." "The son of
                  a washerwoman!" said Rhett, and he drew down his eyebrows and scowled. "The son of
                  a washerwoman! Well, it is well that poor men do well in this country; and it is
                  ill that they do ill in others. But there is a tide in the affairs of nations, and
                  when it is at the flood, why, it gets no higher.</p>
               <p>"Cæsar rose from nothing, but the gods were insulted, and so great Cæsar fell, and
                  with him his country. Cæsars rise out of every dunghill in America, and they will
                  prove the death of us."</p>
               <p>Johnson turned to him calmly and said, "I, sir, am a tailor. I understand the
                  fashions of a cut. A goose, well tempered, may smooth a thing, but if it be too
                  hot, it burns. I know also there may be sharp things in a poor garment, and even a
                  goose may be made to feel the prick of them."</p>
               <p>Rhett was thrown completely off his bearings, and he looked at Johnson, surprised
                  at him; but Johnson walked away. Rhett stood for some time looking after him, and
                  then he said: "A tailor, a washerwoman's son; a pretty pass in this our great
                  republic. Am I, that am a fair gentleman, bewildered with the things I see, seeing
                  double, both the false and true, as truth; or is my native country mad? Mad! It
                  follows now an ape—a common ape must rise and set its nose for Congress, learn to
                  take offence and mimic gentlemen. O heavens! shall never beam the star of glory on
                  our fair land, and wills majestic rise to consummate the Southern Parliament?
                  Shall not my thirty years of constant prayer reach up to Him who notes a sparrow's
                  fall, and answer bring imperative—no North, no South, but one united whole; a
                  country's laws for all; not one the sole inheritor, nor property devoid of bond up
                  North that is down South employed? No, never. Low ambition rules the land. The
                  loudest clamoring politician sways the universal mob; villainous poison is
                  secreted under the name of Liberty. O Liberty! I sicken at thy oft repeated tale;
                  from my very soul I hurl thee into endless chaos."</p>
               <p>I think he said more, but, at this time, some bustle occasioned in the office by a
                  report coming from Chicago, I heard Cobb say, "You are right, Mr. Rhett." I have
                  known Cobb for many years. He is a stoutish man, and often repeats what others
                  say. He boasts a good deal for a man of his worth. "You are right, Mr. Rhett,"
                  said he, "those are my sentiments;" and then he added some oaths that I do not
                  like to mention. Afterwards he shook hands with Rhett, and continued, "Our few
                  heads are more powerful than were all the warriors and philosophers of the Roman
                  Empire. We need but to rise and shake our fists in the face of the world, and we
                  shall be the mightiest of nations. No one dares oppose us; only let us stick
                  together and get loose from these dolts and plebeians that are eternally robbing
                  us of our rights under the sickening name of Liberty. They tell us we dare not
                  secede, what say you?" and then he made oath, adding, "It is all gammon," using
                  such language that even Rhett and Davis looked ashamed.<ref rend="super"

               <p>Despatches were now coming from Chicago announcing Seward's rejection, and the
                  news interfered with the conversation. We observed two persons, Madame Ponchard,
                  and a man called Orsini entering the place. They were a mysterious pair. She was
                  apparently a woman of great wealth, and he a man of neat and plain attire, as if
                  he might be only an attendant. Yet both were reserved, secluded, diffident. She
                  recognized by nearly all of the great men present by a polite bow; he unnoticed.
                  As soon as they had passed indifferently aside, as if to await the news from
                  Chicago, we were still further interested by the entrance of another person—a
                  woman of strange and noticeable mark: a tall, serene person she was, and of an age
                  no man might question. She came in so boldly, and looked around with such
                  commanding mien, that we all stood still as if awaiting our doom. "Gentlemen," she
                  said, "why this silence? Methought this bustle and these murmuring voices were
                  indicative of something terrible, and that within this noble structure, I heard
                  oaths so abominable, that the very foundation of my woman's nature trembled in my
                  delicate form. But, lo! how soon is peace and quiet. How majestically sweet and
                  humble is man's nature, turned by the presence of modest, unassuming woman. I
                  thank my stars, gentlemen, that I have been the innocent means of assuaging this
                  raging tumult. These missions are my errands. I am to redress the wrongs of woman,
                  and to reform the uncultivated faults of man's nature. My name is Miss Lucy
                  Tabiatha Stimpkins."</p>
               <p>Thus saying, she drew from her pocket a bundle of papers and distributed them
                  amongst us, giving every man one. Some said it was Donna del Don Quixote; but she
                  heeded nothing round her, and went on speaking, "You will perceive, gentlemen,"
                  she said, "I am just starting a paper to be entitled 'The Journal of Progress,'
                  and I am to be the editress. I have long beheld the down-trodden condition of my
                  sex, and am prepared for the direst slurs you may heap upon me for my apparent
                  boldness. I have heard lectures by our eminent women on this subject, and I have
                  resolved to devote the balance of my days as the champion and adjuster of our
                  wrongs. You see, too, like the knight of the Lion heart, as some one of you has
                  been good enough to compare me, I pitch into all places of danger, that all men
                  may learn my power—my woman's power. But not like that knight do I invoke the
                  power of my lover; for I tell you frankly I love no man, having been thrice
                  married and thrice divorced; but I speak to Him who has power to give to the meek
                  and lowly according as their just rights demand. Though prayer is nothing without
                  work. I have put my shoulder to the wheel. My talents are my arms; my sex is my
                  shield; my cause is my Rosinante. By this prospectus, gentlemen, you will see that
                  I am the champion of freedom for all men, and for all women too. You are thankful
                  for your freedom; but you undoubtedly remember the women of the days of Lycurgus,
                  how they bared their breasts and demanded the liberty of their husbands and
                  brothers, or death. Then came the republic—the first republic. You thank those
                  women, and some day your children and your children's children will thank us. Not,
                  sirs, that we will bare our breasts;" (here some of the crowd said, "got none to
                  bare;" but she heeded not, going on,) "we take a more noble method of action, and,
                  we trust, more powerful than the sword. My object will be in the 'Journal of
                  Progress' to show you that the abolition of slavery is near at hand; to show you
                  that if it be done by war instead of peace, you have everything to lose, and
                  nothing to gain; to show you that Elihu Burritt, the learned blacksmith, has
                  demonstrated that you can sell your slaves into freedom by the sale of western
                  lands; to show you that woman comes among you as a ministering angel, to carry out
                  the great principles of human liberty. Now, gentlemen, with this brief statement
                  on my part, allow me to ask, will you subscribe for the Journal?"</p>
               <p>We all laughed loudly, but she went on, "Three columns shall be devoted to news
                  and letters, one to advertisements, twelve to temperance, sixteen to the abolition
                  of slavery, and twenty to woman's rights." When she had got thus far, the whole
                  office joined in roars of laughter; but she was still as calm as before. As soon
                  as quiet was restored, Rhett replied, "It is strange, madam, that every person
                  North runs on these same topics—slavery, temperance, and woman's rights. As soon
                  as a woman learns to read, she mounts the rostrum with adjectives numerous, and
                  topics worn threadbare, not to elevate or beautify rude man, but to disgust him
                  with the presence of woman. Miss Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins, I pity you. You have
                  harped upon these subjects until you are mad. You are indeed like Don Quixote.
                  These subjects have made you crazy, and<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6417-00000005"/> the
                  result of your crazy-headed lecturing (a great deal of exaggeration mixed with a
                  little truth) will make many, very many unhappy persons, especially females. If
                  anything makes me hate the North more than abolitionism it is your species of
                  women, We have none such amongst us in the South."</p>
               <p>"Exactly so," said she, "and to educate you to that higher sphere of life have I
                  come among you. I come to bear the brunt of your reproaches, and I am happy that
                  my modesty and delicacy do not quail before you. I belong to that class—I may say
                  race—of unselfish beings who can view slavery, temperance, and woman's rights from
                  a holier point of view. Sir, you pity me, allow me to reciprocate the sentiment on
                  your revered head."</p>
               <p>This was so easily spoken that the crowd set up another laugh, and some of them
                  clapped their hands. Rhett rallied, although he showed an inclination to turn
                  away. "Pity devil," said he, "but, since you have a face bold enough to argue, let
                  me tell you one thing as a principle in philosophy—and that is, that so much
                  boldness of Northern women is proof positive that man's nature up there has eked
                  out into woman, and hence the dastardly, cowardly character of all the members
                  they send to the national Congress. It is also the best assurance in the world
                  that in a few years the South will be entirely the master of the country."</p>
               <p>"I don't argue sir," said she, "I maintain my rights. I am champion for others.
                  You may fight and conquer us, you may extinguish an army of women, but, sir, our
                  doctrines, our woman's rights, shall finally vanquish you. Little girls shall be
                  taught to know their rights, and, coming to majority, they will maintain them.
                  They will make men sue, oblige them to stand trembling, to know and do their
                  pleasure. I look for ahead, sir, to the time when woman's voice shall ring in
                  yonder Capitol, and, too, when the black man, if he has talent, shall grace the
                  Senate with his brilliant tongue."</p>
               <p>Here a roar of laughter set in again, and the poor woman turned and left,
                  protesting at the top of her voice, that she was but a poor helpless woman, but
                  that she would meet them again in after times, with such editorials as were never
                  put to paper.</p>
               <p>As soon as the laugh was over, Rhett, somewhat excitedly, shouted out, "Welcome
                  war, thrice welcome bloody war. Our land is stagnant with peace. Folly is in the
                  vision of Northern millions, and welcome, welcome war!" Cobb rejoined, "That is my
                  prayer too. This country is rotten," as Hamlet says, "it is rotten, sir. Fanatics
                  grow out of washtubs. Dyspepsia is called a medium, a seer of spirits; a foolish
                  tongue is loosest hung, and random gab is set down for sound philosophy. My heart
                  is bent on war, as Shakespeare says, 'for bloody war.' I want to see every
                  Southerner, like Coriolanus, 'all smeared with smoke and blood,' emerging from the
                  putridity of these vile scenes to bequeath to coming generations a purer and
                  holier stock of men. These are my sentiments, Mr. Rhett, give us bloody war." He
                  then stalked about the telegraph office like a king, and said he had seen that day
                  the Prince of Wales, and he thought the British government better than ours.
                  "For," he said, "there their snobs and bootblacks have their ambition checked,
                  nipped in the bud, and it keeps them in their proper places."</p>
               <p>But, when he had got thus far he was confronted by Prescott, Scott having
                  previously gone out. "Why, how is that, Mr. Cobb?" said Prescott, "you would not
                  quell ambition?"</p>
               <p>"Yes I would," said Cobb, "I would wipe it out of human nature."</p>
               <p>"Then," said Prescott, "I am happy that you did not construct mankind. Ambition
                  for wealth, knowledge, ease, or even luxury, has lifted the common people of this
                  country to a higher point of excellence than in any other."</p>
               <p>"At the expense of people of higher birth," said Cobb.</p>
               <p>Prescott replied, "I cannot deal with theory—only facts. But, sir, I never knew
                  before the cause of your own deterioration in moral and mental acquirements."</p>
               <p>When he put this witticism upon Cobb, the latter said, "Do you say a nigger is as
                  good as a white man? Must I stand and hear a man blackguard my own State? You
                  should know, sir, that we have such a thing down South as chivalry, and it loves
                  liberty."</p>
               <p>"Liberty!" said Prescott. "Oh Liberty! how much men ask in thy poor name. Why,
                  sir, you have liberty. You make your own laws, and you unmake them at your
                  pleasure. Even have you liberty to enslave others and to use them at your
                  pleasure, and yet you plead for liberty. You are indeed very chivalrous. You come
                  up North and make us catch your runaway slaves and carry them to you. You killed
                  Northern men who entered Kansas, because they brought no slaves with them; you
                  killed John Brown, and he was merely the foolish champion of the rights of others.
                  Now, sir, for you are no child, you know that there is a crime amongst you, and it
                  is this that makes you sensitive."</p>
               <p>"So then," said Cobb, "you have turned abolitionist too. Now I swear that of all
                  we most desire down South, the greatest wish is for Abolition blood. We have
                  endeavored to abide by the constitution of our land, but now are we sworn that
                  whoever meddles with our slaves shall die."</p>
               <p>"Why sir, look you," said Prescott, "Abolitionists are so plenty you might drown
                  yourself in their blood."</p>
               <p>"A pretty boast," said Cobb, "and one for which I'd have thee whipped in
                  Savannah," and Rhett added, "or in Charleston either;" but Prescott said he was
                  glad he was in Washington, for such conduct as theirs was the result of the
                  accursed institution amongst them.</p>
               <p>When he said this Rhett and Cobb came near him, and Rhett said, "Gentlemen meet as
                  gentlemen, but when a cur comes in their company he must be kicked out," and
                  therefore some of the bystanders did kick at Prescott, but the crowd cried
                  "Shame," for Prescott was a small man with a pleasant face. When he had withdrawn
                  a pace, he added, "Behold this blood;" for in the scuffle some one had touched him
                  on the nose, and it bled a little. "These gentle drops do rush to the view of
                  modern chivalry appalled, and registering each a score of Southern widows, as the
                  debt to come of your weighty arguments; and you, sir Cobb, for a little, I would
                  punch the pith out of you." And then he seized him by the shoulder and shook him
                  until Cobb was nearly frightened out of his wits. The crowd however interrupted at
                  this instant by crying, "Shame! shame! can we not meet as gentlemen without these
                  eternal political rows?" We were also greeted at this time with news from Chicago,
                  and in an instant, were as silent as a house of mourning. The operator read aloud,
                  "Abraham Lincoln of Illinois unanimously nominated." This was cold water on the
                  whole assemblage of us. The Southern men were dumb with astonishment. Rhett's eyes
                  were set in their sockets. Davis hung his head in silent wonder.
                  Yancey—straight-haired Yancey, was more like a weather-beaten statue than a living
                  man. Cobb tossed his hands aloft, and, trembling in every nerve, his bloodshot
                  eyes were riveted upward. The die was cast. The great republic had thrown its
                  challenge to the world to stand or fall for human rights. Not Northern rights, nor
                  Southern rights, but human rights, and, sectional be the slur, still the issue was
                  begun.</p>
               <p>A fearful thing, oh, my countrymen! to oppose those who had always wielded the
                  power and who held ever their awful threat against a Northern President on
                  freedom's platform. The North had now but one object in view; that hereafter there
                  should be no more slave territory admitted into the Union, and the South had at
                  stake her ordinary interest. The North stood for principle merely. These ideas all
                  ran through every man's mind quicker than they can be spoken. Every one knew what
                  the others were thinking in this assemblage. Rhett first broke the silence,
                  without sign or gesture; for he stood there as frozen as the poles, and as
                  pallid.</p>
               <p>"Abraham Lincoln!" "The freedom of the Territories!" Again all was silent for a
                  moment, and then he went on: "Wealth and refinement, against the plebeians. Which
                  is most powerful, the North or the South? In England, wealth rules; in France,
                  monkeys; beggars, in Italy; ambition with a rag on its back is king of Germany,
                  Spain, and Ireland, and now, do their descendants ascend over us. The descendants
                  of these emigrants, these plebeians, have overpopulated the North, and they have
                  raised their heads to demand that we of the South shall be subservient to them.
                  Indeed, then the North is our enemy. I know this Lincoln, this boatman, this
                  rail-splitter, this hewer of wood and carrier of water. He is to hold the poniard
                  to our hearts and say, 'your slaves or your life.' We must knuckle to him. We must
                  sit and see these vermin undermine our houses, because we have comfortable beds.
                  No, no, by heavens!" and then he moved around. "In God's name strike out; put all
                  your wits to work, in secret, in public, anywhere, everywhere, meet, combine the
                  elements of your power. Live in constant effort. Let slumbering fires within your
                  breasts flame up. Strike out! We must, we will accomplish it! We struck on the
                  tariff, but that gave way. We struck on native Americanism, that lost. It might
                  have given us the balance of power for a short period. Then came Mason and Dixon's
                  line; then Douglass and the Missouri Compromise. But all, all have failed. We have
                  no more allegiance to the Union, and must secede. We will go by ourselves.
                  Peaceably if we can: forcibly if we must." He then said Lincoln was an unknown
                  man, and consequently, that his platform was his strength; that the whole fight
                  would now turn on the platform of the freedom of the Territories, but not on the
                  man. "This," said he,<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6417-00000006"/> "makes his election
                  sure. This is the whole reason the Republicans have taken an unknown man, and it
                  is this will be the death of us." He then said, "Davis, what shall we do?"</p>
               <p>Davis said, "We shall lose this election, God knows we shall lose it;" and the
                  tears started to his eyes, and he added, "Even the powers we now wield may be
                  turned against us."</p>
               <p>Rhett replied, "That power must be scattered to the winds beforehand," and Davis
                  said "That might be."</p>
               <p>Now, when they had said thus much, they looked at each other for a moment, as if
                  there was a reflection going on in each other's mind. Then Yancey clenched his
                  fist and said, "If they come against us"—(I thought he meant Abolitionists; for he
                  stopped there, and seemed to make oath toward the heavens)—"South Carolina will
                  secede as sure as yonder sun goes down," said Rhett. Cobb said, "So shall
                  Georgia," making a threat, and breathing an oath. "Mississippi will, I am sure,"
                  said Davis; and then Yancey and Floyd both made oath that the South would
                  secede.</p>
               <p>"Now, then," said Rhett, "must we know the cue of Scott and James Buchanan. Davis
                  and Cobb, will you go with me?" And then they withdrew a pace, and the latter
                  remarked with a low voice to Davis and Cobb, "This will be a dangerous business
                  for us. We must send men to see them at once, and inform them of this nomination.
                  Hark you! I know a man, the most ingenious, sensible kind of fool that ever lived.
                  He is so inquisitive, that he can ascertain every politician's secret thoughts,
                  and they all the while heeding little what he says, and not caring. This man we
                  will send to all prominent men, and ascertain what part they will
                  play—particularly, Scott and Buchanan. You know him. I mean Judge Francis
                  Underhill, of Loudon Heights," and they all smiled and took their departure.</p>
               <p>Floyd then took Thompson's arm, and whispered to him, "Our deadliest enemy lies in
                  the nation's offices, and it should be scattered. I mean the specie, the
                  Government securities, the national treasury, sub-treasury, customs, and
                  post-office funds." And then Thompson said, "That is a great power. Let us lay our
                  heads together in this matter," and they also departed.<ref rend="super"

               <p>During this affair, the strangest of all was that mysterious tall woman, who came
                  in silk and diamonds, with the long-faced Italian Orsini. If you will be kind
                  enough to recollect the circumstances of the National Hotel poisoning, nearly four
                  years ago, when James Buchanan nearly lost his life, you will remember that at
                  that time there were three foreigners in the Hotel. One of them died, leaving a
                  widow—a mysterious person of great fashion, and that person was Madame Ponchard.
                  She was said to own a large plantation somewhere; but she so seldom spoke to any
                  one, that no one seemed to discover who or what she was. She was so constantly in
                  the society of Floyd, Thompson, and Davis, and anon of Governor Wise's son, and
                  she seemed so greedily to devour the words of Floyd and Davis. Many rich men had
                  made advances to her on account of her supposed riches, but had all been defeated.
                  She had this day had an interview with the Prince of Wales, and now, during the
                  scenes in the telegraph office, she had steadily watched all that was said—many of
                  them looking at her to see if she seemed to make note of it, and which this
                  deponent holds as evidence that she and Orsini had some secret connection with the
                  origin of the great rebellion.</p>
               <p>Summing these affairs together—the things which I had seen, and the things which I
                  had long known to be talked of, I set myself about to look after the beginning of
                  what actually did result in one of the greatest wars that ever occurred. Not to be
                  thwarted, however, in my endeavors to search its most intricate purpose, I
                  resolved to inform the different members of our private court of the points I had
                  gained, and of the end I had in view. My object was, first, to acquaint the Judge
                  of the determination of Rhett, Davis and Cobb to use him as their tool in the
                  management of Scott and Buchanan. I had also in view the employment of Miss Lucy
                  Tabiatha Stimpkins as an agent to expose and frustrate, what I deemed the
                  villainous purpose of these would-be rebels. I also mistrusted the deep conniving
                  and secret power of Madame Ponchard. She was so mysterious and deep; so much
                  watched by all parties, familiar with Washington life, yet, so little was known of
                  her, that every person who knew her seemed to harbor a great suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>With this important disclosure, I now close the first chapter of this important
                  history, relying on you to proceed with the next for further information.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>WHEN I had the foregoing history set down, I told Jenkins that he must not forget
                  one of the most important rules of all great authors, which was that the leading
                  characters must be introduced in the first chapter. But he replied by saying that
                  this book would be unlike any other ever written, and not copied after anything
                  extant.</p>
               <p>"In the present age," he said, "most of us follow up a single narrative, and run
                  it to the end; like a colonel in a battle managing a single regiment. But we shall
                  do like great commanders, who divide their army into many parts, all intent on a
                  general end, managing them in such harmony that the lesser parts shall add to the
                  glory of the important whole." I told him that we would get too much egotism in
                  the book, if we kept on at this rate. But he said "That also must be so to be in
                  the fashion. Let us come to the work," and he immediately uttered these very
                  words, to wit:</p>
               <p>"I went, according to agreement today, to have another court-sitting at our
                  Temple; for I was anxious to tell the Judge what Rhett, Davis and Cobb had
                  proposed of him in the telegraph office. After waiting an unusual length of time,
                  and no one else coming, I ventured to ask some good folks near by if they had seen
                  Judge Francis Underhill, of Loudon Heights? And they answered no, that they had
                  not seen him since yesterday morning. I concluded then that something of a serious
                  nature must have transpired, and I immediately set out for the Jackson House,
                  where he resided. When I arrived near, I heard him in the midst of a speech which
                  he was discharging in the office to a promiscuous dozen of idlers. He is an
                  elderly man, and very stout in the waist, always wearing rich but threadbare
                  clothes. His low-topped shoes are always neat, showing fine silk stockings. He
                  always takes off his soft hat when talking, and bows through every sentence he
                  speaks. His politeness gains him hearers, and his egotism and general information
                  make his superiors, even, listen to him with respect. He had been a Whig in the
                  days of Harrison, and he still adhered to his doctrines, although the party was
                  extinct. When I came up, he nodded to me, and I asked him why he had not come to
                  the Temple? Said he, "Some persons of importance are to arrive soon, and I have
                  been requested to remain;" but he refused to tell me who they were, and he bade me
                  wait. He then resumed his speech, which was as follows:</p>
               <p>"It is a fault in this country, as it is in others, that parents study more how to
                  make rich matches for their children, than to teach them how to earn riches for
                  themselves. I remember when I discussed this matter with Daniel Webster, he told
                  me that the fault of all governments was, that they governed too much or too
                  little. All the avenues should be thrown open to the people, and such branches of
                  trade as are easily injured by foreign importation, should be protected by high
                  duties on imports. This would give all young men and women useful enmployment. The
                  factories would give them homes, and keep them at home, and the present migration
                  would be knocked in the head. I do not mean to injure your hotel, sir, but while
                  this country boasts of having so many and so fine hotels, and such a vast
                  patronage to them all, it also boasts that such patrons are a host of idlers, and
                  worthless beings, travelling from place to place to find profitable business. If
                  we made half the goods we consume, these quack lawyers, and quack doctors,
                  politicians, gamblers, clerks and idlers might have something decent to do, and it
                  would open the road too for woman's services. Women, instead of being bartered off
                  with their fits and infirmities to wealthy old bachelors, or instead of
                  auctioneering themselves off in public speeches, would find employment in which
                  they could be proud, independent, and happy. But all this physical and moral force
                  is thrown to waste by lack of a wholesome tariff. The money of the country is sent
                  abroad for goods, and our prodigal sons and daughters (the Judge is an old
                  bachelor), living at the top of the fashion, fly from place to place, endeavoring
                  to better themselves by marriages or strange adventures."</p>
               <p>Here the crowd laughed so violently,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6417-00000007"/> that
                  he was in a measure interrupted, but he retorted:</p>
               <p>"I know it all. It is all very well. If I have no sons or daughters, I might have
                  had, or may have yet. For twenty years I have been chased by the women. Anxious
                  mammas have come to me with no more concern for the welfare of their darling
                  daughters, than I value the toss of a dice box, and they have told me how ardently
                  their dear children admired everything I said or did. But no, as I said to Henry
                  Clay, these things show that there is something wrong in this country. My opinion
                  is that these hosts of idlers can never be exterminated but by a huge tariff or a
                  terrible war."</p>
               <p>The Judge then turned to me and asked if that was not the truth? I told him yes,
                  and urged him once more to come to the Temple; but the clerk called out, "No, not
                  yet; for here they come,"and just then some new arrivals came to the hotel, though
                  what the importance of it was, I yet knew not. There came in a carriage, an
                  elderly-like man and woman, accompanied by a daughter—a fairylike belle of
                  seventeen—who dismounted and entered the place. The gentleman registered his name
                  as Mr. Edge, wife, and daughter Victoria. The clerk distributed them to their
                  rooms, and we were left to reflect upon the apparent richness of their style,
                  combined with their seeming awkwardness.</p>
               <p>Some person present suggested that in-asmuch as the Prince of Wales was in
                  Washington, this Victoria might be some relation. The Judge and I moved up to the
                  desk, and the clerk said to the Judge, "Ah, Judge! we have somebody at last you do
                  not know, and is no relation of yours."</p>
               <p>The Judge always pretended to know all great persons, or, that they were distant
                  relations; and this clerk knew his weakness.</p>
               <p>"I am not sure of that," said the Judge.</p>
               <p>"Then why are you puzzled at the name?" said the clerk.</p>
               <p>"Because it is a strange name. It seems to me, however, I knew some people by the
                  name of Edge. Where are they from?"</p>
               <p>"From Ohio," said the clerk.</p>
               <p>"Possibly I may know them,"remarked the Judge. "Be not too sure."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! have you begun already?" said the clerk; and the Judge replied, "Ill
                  fortune on your tavern, that I have supported for the last twenty years by a
                  constant stream of fast marriages, if ere another day you do not tell this Edge
                  family that I am king of Washington."</p>
               <p>"And may, your stars forgive you," said the clerk, "for the big ones you have made
                  me tell in order to bring couples together. Not a month since, you blew riches
                  into the ears of a couple that could not pay their washerwoman. They really
                  thought each had a fortune, until they were married. This you did, on a wager of a
                  bottle of Bourbon."</p>
               <p>"No matter," said the Judge, "I will lay the corn that this Edge has brought his
                  daughter here to marry her off, and, what is more, we can have her at the hymenial
                  halter in a month."</p>
               <p>He had no sooner said this, than, on looking around, he saw entering the room the
                  business man, Mr. Edge. The porters were carrying in his boxes.</p>
               <p>"Now you shall see," said the Judge, "how I shall quiz this old man. Stand there
                  boys. Be careful with those trunks. You think a man's boxes are made for battle,
                  and you lam them and jam them until every nail comes out. It puts me in mind of a
                  trip I took to Ohio several years ago, in company with Daniel Webster."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Edge. "Why, that is my native State."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the Judge. "Then I suppose you are acquainted with my excellent friend,
                  Tom Corwin."</p>
               <p>"I have not that honor," said Edge.</p>
               <p>"I used to know some of the Edges in Ohio," said the Judge. "They were literary
                  people."</p>
               <p>"Then," said Edge, "They were not my relations. I am only a railroad builder. But,
                  if I am not too impertinent, what is your name?"</p>
               <p>"Francis Underhill, sir. I am called Judge of London Heights."</p>
               <p>When he said this, he stretched himself to his most dignified length.</p>
               <p>Edge looked at him with astonishment, first, because he seemed so familiar, and
                  next, because he had so accidentally fallen into the society of a man of such
                  seeming high rank; for he deemed him at least in possession of next to the highest
                  office our country had to give.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," said Edge, "I would not have been so familiar, only that I have
                  been all my life with plain, blunt men. I was, sir, like Ben. Franklin, brought up
                  a tallow chandler; but I deserted my business. I have saved up a little, and now I
                  seek to see and to know the world."</p>
               <p>"I admire your frankness, sir," said the Judge. "I shall be most happy, at all
                  times, to give you the benefit of my most distinguished acquaintanceship. Also, if
                  you please, you may say to your lady and daughter that my carriage is at their
                  service vice, and that I should be extremely happy to introduce them into the
                  highest circles of society."</p>
               <p>As he was going on in this strain, the three important persons, Rhett, Cobb, and
                  Davis, came in and called the Judge, who joined them. They all went out to the
                  sidewalk, where the three entered into their entreaty to the Judge to call upon
                  Scott and Buchanan, which we will refer to in a moment. It was, however, a great
                  mortification to me; for I had determined to acquaint the Judge with the designs
                  of Rhett, Davis and Cobb, before they came together. Though for the present let us
                  turn to the interior of the house.</p>
               <p>The clerk immediately told Mr. Edge who the trio were, and Mr. Edge was more
                  pleased than ever to think that he had already made the acquaintance of a man who
                  was counsellor and adviser for the heads of the nation. He was yet busy with his
                  baggage when the clerk winked to me. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Entre
                  nous</foreign>" said he, "he has brought his daughter here to marry her off. The
                  Judge knows hundreds of young bloods, and we must fix this thing up. We will have
                  a marriage in high life, good times, and plenty of champagne."</p>
               <p>But I checked him for making so light of such matters, and withdrew a pace, and
                  sat down to await the Judge's return; for, indeed, we were interrupted by the
                  approach of Mr. Edge, who inquired what kind of a man the Judge was.</p>
               <p>The clerk pointed out the Judge as one of the United States Judges, one of the
                  greatest men in America—told Edge, in fact, that since the days of Jackson, no man
                  else held so great a sway over the affairs of the Government. He had but to say
                  this or that must be done, and the nation's treasury was at his service. The clerk
                  even went so far in his enthusiasm in relating things of this worthless old judge,
                  as to say that the nation's purse had got to be almost wholly his own. "Why, sir,"
                  said he to Mr. Edge, "The judge once said he must have some celestial curiosities
                  for the national museum, and the next day a vessel sailed for China. He has,
                  indeed, only to say Build me a post route to Oregon, or a railroad to New Orleans,
                  and it is lobbied right through both houses of Congress, and the President signs
                  the bill as a matter of course. Only get the Judge's friendship, Mr. Edge, and
                  Washington is all yours."</p>
               <p>Edge rejoined that he thought that the Judge was no ordinary man, and that he
                  would be quite happy to have his wife and daughter get acquainted with so
                  prominent a person.</p>
               <p>The clerk told him the Judge was the most easily approached of any man in the
                  world, and also that he knew everybody in Washington that was of any importance,
                  which was, in fact, nearly true, thought it was equally true that the Judge was
                  tolerated in good society, mostly on account of his eccentricities and monstrous
                  pretensions.</p>
               <p>Edge was most pleased, however, to learn that he had found a man who could command
                  money. He was himself a speculator. He liked to sell stocks; to get contracts put
                  through; was interested in jobs that needed helping through Congress. He had
                  himself amassed a great fortune by this kind of speculation, beginning with one
                  single thousand dollars—and this thousand too, it was said, he came into
                  possession of improperly. His father had placed it in his hands for safe keeping;
                  but the son never returned it. The old man failed, and became grieved and the
                  conduct of his son, endeavored to better his remaining days by life in California,
                  but died on the way, thus giving the son full possession of the thousand dollars.
                  This money the son had invested in building a railroad bridge on the Miami. He
                  cheated the contractors in the grade of the bridge, and doubled his money. He took
                  another job on another road; again took advantage of the contractors; bribed the
                  inspectors, and doubled his money. By this kind of speculation, he had amassed a
                  large fortune, until, as he said, he had now set out to see and to know the
                  world.</p>
               <p>His wife had coaxed him away to Washington, for the benefit of Victoria, their
                  daughter. The mother was one of that good kind of women who are always called an
                  excellent wife and mother for a common person. She was a farmer's daughter, and
                  had been taught to read and write; had worked hard to help save her husband's
                  money. For the past few years, she had been relieved from manual labor, and took
                  to teasing poor dress-makers and milliners, and trying to learn to get into a
                  carriage gracefully, instead of climbing in as she would into a market wagon.
                  These things puzzled her wits so much that she resolved that her daughter Victoria
                  should be better trained in early days. Vickey had been sent to school in
                  Philadelphia, had acquired her education, and already acted as tutor of the
                  fashions to her mother.</p>
               <p>"Mother," she would say, "you always begin your letters in that way—now I take my
                  pen in hand, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et cetera.</foreign> Do you know it was
                  wrong? Why, I forgot, I<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6417-00000008"/> should not have
                  called you mother—I should have said ma! Now let me see, where was I? Oh! Dear ma,
                  we always begin at the back of a letter in fashionable society." Here she would
                  lisp a little, drop her chin, look interesting at her mother, and smile. She said
                  a great many things about fashionable society, such as she had learned in the
                  Philadelphia boarding school, always beginning and ending the sentence with "that
                  is the way it is in Philadelphia." She was, indeed, as sure of how things were
                  done in Philadelphia, as was the New England clergyman, who went to Paris several
                  years ago, of the fashions and wickedness of the French nation. He only staid one
                  night in Paris, and, in the morning, on looking out, he saw a red petticoat
                  hanging near his window. This was enough for him. He construed it into some
                  improper banter from a French woman, and thereupon left the country in disgust. On
                  his return home, he wrote an account of French high life and immorality, condensed
                  into two royal octavo volumes. People who have not been in France, say it was
                  good. So did Mrs. Edge say of her daughter's stories about fashionable high life,
                  and she had now made Victoria chief of affairs in the present adventure into high
                  life in Washington. Vickey was so elated therewith, that she was continually
                  showing her mother how things should be said and done.</p>
               <p>"Do you see, ma," she said, as soon as they had entered their private parlor, "we
                  are at once looked upon as persons of mark," and she drew her mother to the
                  window. They looked out, and beheld on the sidewalk Rhett, Davis, Cobb, and Judge
                  Francis Underhill. The latter at that instant happened to be looking upward, less
                  heedful of the rebellion than of the pretty belle gazing out of the window. Just
                  as Mrs. Edge looked out, Judge Francis dropped his glasses and smiled. Vickey
                  playfully kissed her hand to him and ran away.</p>
               <p>"Why, my child," said Mrs. Edge, "how can you do so to a stranger?"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw," said Vickey, "that is the height of fashion—at least in
                  Philadelphia."</p>
               <p>Her mother was about to give her a severe reprimand, but just then the clerk
                  appeared at the door to know if their rooms were satisfactory, to which they
                  replied in the affirmative. The clerk then also approached the window, showing
                  them the Capitol, the White House, and the Potomac, adding, "Here is Pennsylvania
                  Avenue, where you can behold all the costly fashions, and all the great people of
                  all parts of the civilized world." He paused a moment, and again continued, "Well
                  now, even here, here is Judge Francis Underhill of Loudon Heights," and they all
                  looked down to where the four were standing below talking. "That man," continued
                  the clerk, "that old gentleman with the silver spectacles, is Judge Francis
                  Underhill; one of the most remarkable men of any age. He is the boast of this
                  country. He is a man of literature, science, fashion, and integrity, he is all
                  that constitutes greatness."</p>
               <p>"There mother," said Vickey, "you thought he was just some common person; but I
                  know what it is to see people of rank."</p>
               <p>"Indeed that is so," said the clerk.</p>
               <p>"If the Judge were to have a procession to-day, it would be far more proper than a
                  procession for the Prince of Wales; he is so free, so jolly, and yet so grand. His
                  wealth too cannot be computed."</p>
               <p>The ladies both expressed a desire to become acquainted with so important a
                  person. Being informed that they could by passing their leisure moments in the
                  general parlor, they both expressed a full determination to do so. After some
                  trifling conversation about the Prince of Wales, the clerk departed, having
                  precautioned them as to the style and character of Judge Francis Underhill; that
                  it was through him they would reach the avenues to the good society of Washington.
                  He also told them that the Judge was very eccentric in his style; that he used
                  very highfalutin language on the most trivial occasions; but that they were to
                  take no notice of it, and assume the same style towards him as much as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>"Trust that to me," said Vickey. "We did that to perfection in the Philadelphia
                  boarding school. We girls compared ourselves to flowers, stars, rainbows, angels,
                  and congratulated each other on our nonsense, in quotations that were never heard
                  of."</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear child," said Mrs. Edge, "how did you learn that stuff?"</p>
               <p>"Learn it, mother!" said Vickey; "we made it in imitation of those beautiful
                  novels I told you of. It is so easy. A tear in the eye is a diamond; a crony is a
                  satellite; a love tickle, is an electric thrill; a plain compliment is an
                  adamantine pavement whereon our duller sense trips in fear and trembling up to the
                  genius of the immortal speaker; and then we sigh—thus—our bosoms heaving like a
                  cataract, or the billows of the ocean. At least, that is the way we did in
                  Philadelphia."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, Vickey," said her mother. "I never heard you speak so eloquent, and I
                  never until now felt so sure you could maintain the due distortion of our
                  family."</p>
               <p>"Discretion you mean, mother; but, you know, I always told you I never would be
                  myself until I got into high society."</p>
               <p>And then she laughed, as the clerk said, a mysterious laughter, and he further
                  added, "When I left them to their toilet, I thought she was indeed the strangest
                  girl I ever saw, and the prettiest."</p>
               <p>But here let us refer to the Judge's interview with Rhett, Davis, and Cobb. Having
                  myself been stationed so near that I could hear every word, and having also heard
                  the forty thousandth lecture on Southern institutions, State rights, and all that
                  sort of constitutional nonsense—secession, war, annihilation, subjugation,—and
                  heard it with indifference to every threat; and as I said before, standing myself
                  near enough to hear this party addressing the Judge in that manner, I quietly
                  awaited the full development of their plots and plans with him. Now, when the
                  Judge was informed by them that they had already organized, and that, as he
                  considered himself a Southern man, and as he had frequently expressed the same
                  sentiments that they held, they had selected him as one of a committee on very
                  important business, he was not a little surprised:</p>
               <p>"We must know," said Cobb, "the line of demarkation: who are friends and who are
                  enemies," and his position in Congress gave importance to all he said. "We have
                  known you long," he continued, "and the necessity of the case makes us plain with
                  you in all we say. Now it is not wise to ask a man his sentiments; but by
                  conversation we often learn what we desire to know. It is thus that we hope to
                  learn who is for us and who is against us. You have the advantage of long
                  acquaintanceship, and men will say in your presence what they would not in ours;
                  and you in turn can say what you like without offence or suspicion. You have that
                  faculty."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know I have," said the Judge; and he stiffened his lips like a member of
                  parliament.</p>
               <p>"Now then," said Cobb, "I want you, as the news of Lincoln's nomination is still
                  fresh, to ply men well to the task, to know what they will do in case the South
                  does secede. The whole thing must be done between now and the 4th of March. If
                  Buchanan does nothing, we are safe: if Scott goes with us, we are victorious."</p>
               <p>"Ah! I see," said the Judge, "you want me to be a tool for you. Do you think I am
                  the town's fool? You bellow and blow awhile, and then it will all end in smoke. It
                  was so in Calhoun's time. They came to me then; but they would not stick. It is
                  all bosh: though I will tell you this, if you would go in, as I used to tell Henry
                  Clay, tooth and nail, I could take the administration whichever way I like. But, I
                  will be no tool to go around peddling my opinions before such men as Scott and
                  Buchanan. I must first see the coast clear, and then I will advise my friends as I
                  think best."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Cobb.—"You misunderstand us Judge. I only want to know what these
                  men's predispositions are—to know if the thing is so and so what course to
                  adopt."</p>
               <p>"Ah, well!" said the Judge. "Ah! I see. But, for that matter I can soon ascertain,
                  but, I cannot lend myself to any scheme that might compromise my well-known
                  principles. You know I have been a whig since 1840."</p>
               <p>Cobb then assured him that they had organized on the evening previous, and that
                  the most prominent citizens in the Capital were bound together, and he also
                  pointed out the necessity of taking by violence if necessary, all the offices of
                  the Government, and acknowledged also that if Scott could be brought into the
                  fold, the whole thing could be fixed up in a week.</p>
               <p>When he talked this way the Judge got a little frightened, and also a little
                  puzzled; for he thought perhaps they were playing a joke on him. So betwixt the
                  scare and the puzzle he abruptly withdrew, and afterward assured me he was up to
                  the whole game.</p>
               <p>The others were now in a perplexity to think that they had discussed so great a
                  matter to one so heedless and unconcerned. It was evident that their position
                  rendered it dangerous, as yet, to attempt any overt act against the Government.
                  The magnitude of their intended attempt to dissolve the Union, made each one more
                  backward than his neighbor, and anxious for a fearless leader; to know the
                  position of Gen. Scott, was at this time one of the most anxious inquiries ever
                  seated on a nation's heart. That the South would secede was now believed by all
                  politically well-informed men in the country, but the agents of its success seemed
                  to be depending mostly on Scott and Buchanan. The North was praying for Scott, but
                  the South was ready with its vengeance on all who might oppose them.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6417-00000009"/>
               <p>Rhett, Cobb and Davis were at this period the head and front of the rebellion, and
                  they were restless, moving from place to place, bent on every invention to further
                  their ends. Immediately now Judge Francis had so equivocally promised them they
                  resolved on another and more expeditious method of accomplishing it—though more of
                  that hereafter. And again we will refer to the Judge, who had now made up his mind
                  to treat the matter as one of second rate importance. At present he was interested
                  in seeing me, and I am happy to say he found me in the office anxiously awaiting
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Come, come," he says, "those royal bloods have had me out in yonder burning sun,
                  trying to cram me, and play some game with me for my everlasting good nature. But
                  I understand the point of a joke, you know. I am too old for them. Wait, you shall
                  see."</p>
               <p>I then told him how they had spoken of him in the telegraph office, and of the
                  tool they designed to make him.</p>
               <p>"What!" said he, "do they rate me in such a manner? Then, indeed, this has been no
                  joke. It was in earnest. They wanted to send me to Scott and Buchanan to make a
                  fool of me. Indeed, this affair promises mischief. Well, let's have it. We need
                  mischief and a grand surprise. As I am a judge, I say this country needs a
                  surprise. It is the hardest up of any place I ever heard of. We have no
                  characters, and no chance to make any. Our best novelists and poets are played
                  out. Every body is a stick, a dolt, anything. Let's have a war. We will then have
                  characters. For twenty years I have visited this city, and God forgive me, I have
                  often been tempted to overstate the truth of things, just in order to have a bit
                  of news; but now it may be, we shall have news sufficient to warrant us in
                  speaking truthfully. Yet, I do not believe they will secede. It is all blowing. I
                  am a Southern man, I used to blow. I learned that of John C. Calhoun, but, as for
                  tricking me, or making me a villain, why let them go to Scott and Buchanan
                  themselves. No. Mind you. I am almost resolved to go and tell them a barefaced
                  falsehood; that I have been to Scott and Buchanan, and that Scott and Buchanan are
                  both in favor of secession. But, wait. I must study this matter. We shall see who
                  is fool for the other."</p>
               <p>He then pulled me along, and we marched into the general parlor, where we had
                  scarcely entered before we met Mrs. Edge and Vickey. The former was an excellent
                  type of a plain, blunt woman, attired in silk satin and diamonds. She had a very
                  substantial step. The daughter was a pretty blue-eyed girl, with black ringlets,
                  and tall, thin, and straight up an down.</p>
               <p>"Now let me," said the Judge,—and he turned toward them and bid them be seated.
                  "Now let me"—and he spoke to me in a whisper. "I will show you how to make them at
                  home,"—for really he was as much at home in this house, as if it were his own,
                  having made it his stopping place for the last twenty years, and having also
                  provided it with the choicest wines from his own plantation. He then turned toward
                  the ladies.</p>
               <p>"If I mistake not," said he, "this is Mrs. Edge and her daughter Victoria." They
                  nodded assent. "Mr. Edge, the large railroad contractor, is well-known by name to
                  myself, and, in fact, to every prominent man of the Capitol. But, I believe,
                  fortune has not favored us with so large a knowledge of his family, further than
                  that they are on a visit to lend the charm of their accomplishments to this city.
                  Excuse me; my gray hairs tell you that I am only speaking things that give me more
                  pride than pleasure, and that I desire to make you comfortable while you enjoy the
                  hospitalities of the place."</p>
               <p>They smiled and bowed an affirmative; feeling confident now that they were indeed
                  emerging into some of the upper circles. The Judge, pleased with his own style,
                  went on.</p>
               <p>"If you please, I will now take the privilege of introducing my excellent friend,
                  Mr. Jenkins," upon which he smiled and bowed, and they in turn smiled and bowed to
                  him, and Mrs. Edge, with a square plain voice, said, "I hope you are both quite
                  well. I am glad to see you and get acquainted. It is a nice spell of weather."</p>
               <p>Now I had indeed been astonished to see how the ladies were puzzled at the Judge's
                  compliments, and I was still more puzzled when Mrs. Edge answered him so plainly,
                  and we were both of us without anything to say for a moment.</p>
               <p>Vickey, seeing our predicament, and bringing her boarding-school tactics to bear
                  on us, now rejoined:</p>
               <p>"If I mistake not, you are Judge Francis Underhill of Loudon Heights?"</p>
               <p>The Judge bowed.</p>
               <p>"The country at large acknowledge the past and present ruler of its manifest
                  destiny. This other gentleman, whom I am sorry to have had the misfortune to have
                  never known, I take to be one of the satellites of your important glory. I am
                  indeed deed so happy with this adventure;" and again she smiled, she and the Judge
                  alternately bowing.</p>
               <p>I was puzzled to know if she were not poking fun at us, and I think the Judge was
                  too; for he hesitated a moment as if to say to me that, for once in his life, he
                  had found a more presumptuous fool than himself, or else one who understood him
                  more than he had ever been before in his life. After a moment, however, he
                  retorted:</p>
               <p>"Too much honor you give to one who has ever esteemed himself scarcely better than
                  a Congressman, and yet I accept it with more pride than had it been uttered by any
                  of the queens or potentates of any other country under the sun."</p>
               <p>He now thought he had sealed her up, but she came in as fluently as if she had
                  been taught in a theatre:</p>
               <p>"Not the compliment, sir," she said, "when its source could come back to me with
                  so dear a fondness from the lips of none other than the clearest-headed
                  philosopher that ever graced a nation. We have heard with unmistakable pleasure
                  the power you wield, and of the admiration and brightness of your lustre in the
                  society of our most devoted countrymen, and now chronicle it in our untutored
                  hearts—this happiest of all human events—the meeting of one never to be
                  forgotten."</p>
               <p>I knew the Judge was nearly at the end of his string, and was in hopes, too, that
                  I would get something to run on with him afterwards, for being quashed by a green
                  country girl.</p>
               <p>When I looked around to Mrs. Edge, I saw that she was breathless and seemingly
                  scared by the eloquence of the speakers.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said the Judge—the happiest of all human events to him, whose hoary
                  hairs have sprung from the dire cause of its long withholding. "I am at loss, not
                  for your ultimate joy, but for the part I am to contribute in every passing moment
                  you may sojourn in our city of magnificent distances."</p>
               <p>Again she replied. "Not so much your loss in that, as will be ours to accept and
                  maintain with due discretion to our uncultured minds. You know, sir, we come from
                  Ohio. You, I am informed, are of the first families of Virginia. We have come
                  amongst you to behold the greatness of great men and women. Like pitiless
                  housewives, we make but an unseeming part in the world of spectators around,
                  praying that the dazzling glory may so gently fall on our unexpecting vision, that
                  its radiance lift us into the winning paths where the heart of woman dallies in
                  her fondest dreams; where she lingers in the hope that some of her gentleness has
                  touched at the fount, the reciprocating omen responsive to her far off sighs and
                  endless melancholy."</p>
               <p>The Judge was now almost lost. He had never heard so vast a strain before; but
                  still he rallied:</p>
               <p>"We hope," said he again, "only for the relict of other days standing between it
                  and the consummation of an angel's wish."</p>
               <p>"Not age, sir," said she, "but the heart within makes the mighty difference, if
                  difference indeed there can be."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said he, "I tell you, young hearts often live in old men; but, in such
                  as have been married, or taken to politics, in them the heart dies. By the by,"
                  said he, turning to me—for he was entirely played out, and longed for a change of
                  the subject—"By the by, do you know, my excellent friend Buchanan told me this
                  morning he cannot remember having ever loved anything in all the days of his life.
                  Remarkable—'pon my word, remarkable."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said I, "he loves his party."</p>
               <p>"Just as I told him," said the Judge, "and, had he pursued the even tenor of man's
                  good nature, he had had a heart full of love to this day. But, ladies, I had
                  forgot myself, not having the heart to withdraw, I promised the senior member of
                  your family that my carriage should be at your service during your sojourn in
                  Washington, and I shall take great pleasure in introducing you into the highest
                  ranks of society."</p>
               <p>He always offered his carriage to everybody that stopped at the Jackson House. He
                  and his carriage, though both the worse for wear, had both become fixtures for the
                  hotel—the carriage having for several years degenerated into a kind of public
                  hack; still it sounded liberal to tender the use of it, and the ladies named now
                  thanked him cordially. Mrs. Edge told me a moment afterwards that she had been so
                  transported with the foregoing eloquence of her daughter and the Judge, that she
                  "could hardly tell whether she was herself standing on her feet or on her
                  head."</p>
               <p>The whole affair was now cut short by the entrance of the mistress of Loudon
                  Heights—Miss Ann Underhill, niece of the Judge. As she afterwards became one of
                  the greatest solicitudes of the country, and as her perils, hardships, struggles,
                  and sterling worth may long be remembered with kindly feelings by the whole
                  country, I must here tell you about her, however much I may be moved in so
                  doing.</p>
               <pb n="18-19 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6417-00000010"/>
               <p>Ann Underhill was an orphan, brought up by the Judge, and now in her twentieth
                  year. She had received excellent advantages; the Judge having spared no expense to
                  develop her naturally attractive qualities. He had her well educated, and had also
                  favored her with the best of society in this and other countries: add to this a
                  fun-loving, frolicking disposition, with due regard for reverence, backed by an
                  inherited fortune, and say that she was a sweet girl with auburn hair, rosy
                  cheeks, plump person, and real, innocent, pleasing beauty, who, seen but once, is
                  ne'er forgotten.</p>
               <p>As I said before, she now came into the room, running in and calling out "Oh!
                  uncle, uncle, come to the window—come and see," and she flung her arms around his
                  neck and dragged him hastily towards the street window.</p>
               <p>We all looked out and now beheld a crowd of boys, worthless fellows, coming down
                  the avenue. Whereupon we all drew near the window to see the attraction, and we
                  did behold a thing; it had a head, and cars, and such a tongue! may the stars
                  bedim our vision if ever was such a funny creature—a woman! Good Lord, a woman!
                  Miss Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins—in a bloomer! She came and stood on the porch near
                  us, and began about her journal.</p>
               <p>Some one outside the hall asked her if she was going to publish marriages in her
                  journal, and she answered by saying, "Marriages, marriages in my journal? I hope I
                  will fill it with better stuff." As there were many boys and idlers near her, we
                  heard them laugh, and shout so that the half she spoke was not heard by us. In a
                  little while, however, she told us she liked to see us merry; "but I am sorry,"
                  said she, "you don't cultivate your minds for more honorable ends."</p>
               <p>Some one again shouted "Publish the marriages!" but she was becoming so enraged as
                  to not answer with sufficient discretion to suit so base a crowd.</p>
               <p>"I'll not publish such stuff!" she finally screamed out; when some one near said,
                  "Call marriages stuff?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said she, "stuff," and she fairly squealed.</p>
               <p>Again some one said, "Very important stuff!"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, poor stuff," said she, and thereupon the laugh became so loud and
                  boisterous, that she stood still and became immovable as formerly, angrily
                  composed. "I have been married," said she, "I know what I say." ("Good! good!"
                  from the crowd.) "Ah! indeed, you may laugh; but I say marriage is stuff. I go in
                  for the cultivation of the moral and intellectual faculties. You may laugh. I am
                  resolved that marriages shall never be published in my paper; it shall stand on
                  fundamental principles. Reform, is my motto (Laughter.) Well, laugh on; I am not a
                  laugher myself; nor do I mean to be the cause of laughter in others. When my
                  journal shall have wiped out a thousand grogshops, then you may laugh; when I have
                  overturned slavery, then I'll laugh. Ah, go on! go on! You shall see me laugh
                  then, and I'll make the whole country laugh on the other side of their mouth when
                  I laugh. You and all your doctrines shall be vanquished then."</p>
               <p>Of course we laughed, and in a moment she handed some papers to a sort of
                  consort,—a thin-faced man, with long whiskers, who accompanied her, and whom she
                  called Professor, and who was called by the crowd Pro-fusser Jackson; and then,
                  with much sternness, she walked away, followed by the uneasy crowd.</p>
               <p>The Professor remained, and somewhat abashed, approached our friend Prescott, and
                  asked him to subscribe to the Journal of Progress. Prescott declined, and referred
                  him to Judge Francis Underhill, and sure enough the Judge subscribed.</p>
               <p>The Professor thanked him, whereupon the Judge said he was not aware that any one
                  was associated with Miss Lucy. The Professor said in turn, "Neither there was
                  until this morning. I was most miraculously thrown into her presence last evening,
                  and we discovered such an affinity of ideas, as induced us to go into
                  partnership."</p>
               <p>"What," said the Judge, "are you married, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you term the contract between man and woman marriage. Why, yes. But we
                  are married with freedom, under protest, that whenever either is desirous of
                  dissolving partnership, we can do so. We don't endorse the ancient scheme, 'for
                  better or for worse,' but, for better only, and if we find it no better, why, like
                  sensible creatures, we quit it." "An excellent doctrine," said the Judge, "and,
                  sir, may I ask what the future name of our editress is to be?"</p>
               <p>"The same as before," said the Professor, "Miss Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins. We are
                  not arbitrary. We keep our own names. The harmonial system gives us that
                  privilege, especially when both names are euphonious."</p>
               <p>We all expressed our approval, with which flattering indorsement the Professor
                  took his leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <head>GENERAL CASS.</head>

               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6417-00000011"/>
               <p>"Now I will tell you," said the Judge, "the signs of the times betoken much
                  difficulty to this country. In all countries—in all ages of the world, a long
                  peace has ever given rise to these spurious philosophies. Wise and unassuming men
                  keep in the background; but self-conceited, brainless, would-be philosophers,
                  inconsiderate of the facts of history which prove the system of social and
                  political life best suited to the elevation of mankind; and they start now with
                  their foolish theories as the foundation of something holy. Spiritualism,
                  free-love-ism, magnetism. Tut! Such folly; such nonsense. It racks my brain."</p>
               <p>"Why, indeed, Judge," said Vickey, "you surely believe in magnetism?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes; that of a fair lady, who can draw any man unto her."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said she, "and that men can magnetize one another."</p>
               <p>"Well, let them magnetize me; they will have a good time."</p>
               <p>"Now I know a man," said Vickey, "a Professor. He came on the same train with us,
                  and is stopping at this hotel. He besought me, if I found a man, a sceptic, to
                  tell him of it, and he would magnetize him."</p>
               <p>"Then I am his man," said the Judge. "Bring him on; let him put me to sleep. He
                  shall put me into the magnetized slumber." Here the Judge recollected himself, and
                  introduced his niece, Ann Underhill, to Mrs. and Miss Edge, and he and one of our
                  friends, Mr. Prescott, whom we will notice hereafter, took their departure.</p>
               <p>As the ladies had now turned to each other, I took advantage of the opportunity
                  and withdrew to await the Judge's return; for he and I had an important charge in
                  reference to the Prince of Wales' procession, which was set down to take place on
                  the day following.</p>
               <p>Now, it so happened that Vickey and Ann Underhill were favorably impressed with
                  each other, and Mrs. Edge was not ill pleased either.</p>
               <p>But, I must say here, in consequence of the many idle rumors afloat of the
                  melancholy affair that followed, in reference to Miss Underhill, that up to this
                  time I had never published any attachment to the Judge's niece, nor had I by word
                  or gesture induced any one to think so. She was indeed a pretty girl; I had said
                  the same to myself fifty times a day, but said nothing of it. I had seen now, for
                  the first time, Prescott look at her with some earnestness, and he had also with
                  as much fondness seemed to look on Vickey, whose greenness, or, in fashionable
                  parlance, extreme innocence, together with so good, natural wit had surprised us;
                  but that the Judge could be in love with Vickey—that was the novelty, and of its
                  discovery you shall now hear.</p>
               <p>On leaving the parlor, he called at the office, saying to the clerk, "I am done
                  with all this nonsense. I have seen an angel; and I cannot be in any way accessory
                  to a trick on her. We have given a lift to many stuck-up-faced young women, and we
                  have done so with a clear conscience; but, to this one—never! No! never!"</p>
               <p>"Well, now really," said the clerk, "if you really are a great man, you have at
                  last betrayed a weakness."</p>
               <p>"No, no," said the Judge, "I bid good-by to all my folly. Yonder belle has spoken
                  such words as only could come from the lips of Nature's queen; and I caution you,
                  if you ever speak of her, to do it with such prudence as a well-deserved person
                  may attain."</p>
               <p>At that the clerk laughed, immediately saying, "Why, why don't you tell her that
                  you love her, and not come to me?"</p>
               <p>"Tut," said the Judge, "I am an old man. I can admire beauty, intelligence, and
                  noble qualities, and esteem the person, yet; but I prate of love no more."</p>
               <p>At that he sallied out of the office, in company with Prescott—where, or for what
                  purpose, was yet unknown to me.</p>
               <p>While I sat there, I mused on the coming events of the country, and of the
                  probable future marked out for myself, with anything but satisfactory conclusions.
                  That there would be war between the North and the South, had been prophesied for
                  many years by many men. Andrew Jackson had, thirty years ago, by a single message,
                  set it off for an indefinite period. James Buchanan could do the same, but would
                  it result in much? Sooner or later, it must come. Then why not let it come at
                  once? Has not the great power that rules over the nations left the wayward clamor
                  of politicians to sway the people, until the present imbecile President is the
                  tool—the lowest degrading point of party love? A thing to mark the zero of man's
                  most ungodly weakness. Can these isms—these fanaticisms and follies go on, when
                  they thus spring from the idleness of man, and from the corruptions of his mode of
                  obtaining a living?</p>
               <p>An editress! A lecturer! Magnetism! Quack doctors! Quack lawyers! Behold what a
                  host of idlers, contributing not so much as one poor potatoe to their fellows'
                  existence. Idlers! and then I said to myself, what am I? A rich man's son, with
                  nothing to do! Indeed, I am not so much in worth as yonder poor porter, who
                  carries trunks and boxes for these careworn travellers. And then I said to myself,
                  I should marry, and convert the balance of my days to some use; but ever and anon
                  that hard-faced editress passed before my vision. Had not some poor fellow been
                  once caught by her? and might not I be likewise caught? The sumach hath a tender,
                  beautiful blossom, but when its fruit ripens, even its smell is death to the
                  passer by. The sumach makes us dread the hyacinth; and one Stimpkins strikes us
                  with dread at the approach of angels. Thus I mused, the while taking notes of what
                  was passing, and which, in fact, interrupted me by the strangeness of the scene.
                  But a moment before, the trio of ladies had been promenading the parlor,
                  apparently enjoying themselves as all transient acquaintances do in our
                  magnificent hotels; but now I beheld only Ann, the others having left, and she was
                  seated near the piano, not playing, but idly touching the keys. Near her stood a
                  tall and handsome young man, with such long hair as told me at a glance he was a
                  Southerner. He looked on her, but she looked not upward, and I heard him gently
                  going on in this strain. "We have such mild breezes from the ocean, and the vines
                  and evergreen forests ever nestling above us, shielding us from the burning suns.
                  Sometimes we rouse ourselves to certain action, to prove the genial things around
                  be not in dreams but present are. Sometimes from active sports, we pensive train
                  ourselves to mete out the deep devotion we owe for these endless blessings." And
                  then she replied, "O! I think 'tis beautiful to dwell in such a place!"</p>
               <p>"Not always beautiful," said he, "for even as we in the sunny South have that
                  which only bounteous nature can bestow to make us appreciate all the joys and
                  glories that man can attain, so does the contrast, with equal force, ply to soul,
                  if the highest of anticipations be not achieved. The sadness then of an
                  unappreciated nature, and the woe of a disappointed affection, reverts upon his
                  former dreams but to make all things desolate." From this on, his voice was
                  inaudible to me; neither did I hear the frolicsome Ann say another word. She
                  seemed to dally with the keys, as one absent in thought; her golden ringlets, like
                  so much sunlight, shielding from view even that which their own beauty
                  adorned.</p>
               <p>Why did I not know this man? How was it that the Judge had never told me? How was
                  it that he seemed so well acquainted with Ann, and yet she had never mentioned
                  him? Who was he, and what was his business? His language seemed fine, but I could
                  not catch another word. Her answers were short, but only to give me more
                  uneasiness. He finally drew from his pocket a splendid watch, saying, "The time is
                  indisputable, and though a moment is more prized than all the wealth of Crœsus,
                  yet it flies from my grasp. To-morrow, at ten." She nodded, but said nothing; and
                  then he bade her good-by and left. I was nigh rushing up to her to demand the
                  meaning of this affair, but hesitated for a moment, and she trilled a little on
                  the piano, and then up and ran out singing— <q>
                     <l>"A southern home in endless summer," etc.,</l>
                  </q> her voice so merrily sounding through the hall, that I almost forgot what had
                  just passed. When he had said ten, to-morrow, I knew that was the hour the Prince
                  of Wales procession was to begin, and I fully expected he had offered and was
                  accepted as her companion for the occasion. I had previously resolved to be that
                  companion myself, but now was fully resolved to say nothing about it to her.
                  Thinking there would be no court to-day, I was about leaving, but on passing out
                  in the hall, that large, wide, outside hall, I saw just before me that ever
                  present Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins, and her new-made husband, Professor Jackson.
                  They were rehearsing something, and did not see me; I withdrew to play a sort of
                  eaves-dropper. At the far end of the hall were Ann and Vickey, who were also
                  playing eaves-dropper to the scene. "You know," said Mrs. Lucy, "it is the same
                  eternal dread of woman's power that makes men unwilling to give us footing. But
                  these things shall not continue. I am resolved to vanquish all our enemies. I will
                  attack them in every place, and I will prove that mind, even if it be woman's, can
                  and shall master all the rudeness in man. To-morrow is to be the procession in
                  honor of the Prince of Wales, and you shall see; even boasting Briton's scion
                  shall knuckle to woman. He shall stoop to know my will and pleasure; mine, even
                  me, yet an unknown woman; and I shall so berate the down-trodden condition of the
                  women of England to him, that he'll never pass another happy day on this
                  continent. Now, I want to know if in your opinion it would not be wise to give him
                  such a philanthropic lesson?" "Certainly," said the<pb n="22 (Illustration) -23"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000012"/>
                  <figure/> Professor, "certainly, it would be excelent. It would be a valuable
                  contribution to the harmonial philosophy." "Well then, hark you," she said; "hear
                  my plans. We shall station ourselves somewere near the route, in the midst of the
                  crowd, and, as the Prince draws near, I'll rush forward and pretend to be knocked
                  down by the throng; falling even at his feet. Of course, he'll pick me up, and
                  I'll cry out, 'Where's the Prince! Where's the Prince! Let me his horns behold;
                  that boy, so unlike all men and boys, can draw to the view of his august body this
                  mighty throng of free-born Americans! Where is that Prince? Where's the Prince?'
                  and thus I'll rate until he, forsooth, tells me he is himself the Prince, and then
                  I'll scorn, saying, 'You! you the Prince? I thought you were a wandering country
                  boy, whose legs outran the body, coming here alone with scarce a head to hold the
                  two together. Proud scion of ancient Albion, I greet you with a woman's
                  tenderness. Know, sir, that my name is Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins, the champion
                  for the rights of down-trodden woman. In olden times you had in your own country
                  knights errant to alleviate the horrors of her sphere; but now, alas! you, too,
                  even as the men in this country, do seize upon the light avocations suited to her,
                  and you drive her to the most wretched misery! And then I shall tell him such
                  tales of horrors about the poor women of England, as shall vanquish all his
                  remaining joys." "Most excellent," said Professor Jackson, "nothing could be more
                  apropos. Its effect will endure for ages; it will teach the world to know that
                  woman's rights must and shall be respected." "But now, mark you," said she, "you
                  must be near, to see that when I throw myself at his feet, no harm comes to me;
                  you know the English are awful ill-mannered, and only possessed of snail-like
                  speed; now you must not let me be run over." "O! I'll look out for that; I'll see
                  to it," said he, and she then showed him how she would do, and the part he was to
                  play. I could not help smiling at such simple mockery, and was all on fire to
                  acquaint the Judge and other members of our court with the contemplated scene. The
                  girls at the other end of the hall were laughing, even so that I feared Mrs. Lucy
                  would hear them; but she did not. As soon as the way was clear, I started. In the
                  hall I picked up a slip of paper on which was written "To the most beautiful ——.
                  Be happy!" I dropped it at once, lest the fair ones might suppose that I myself
                  wrote it. I supposed Prescott wrote it, and it was intended for Vickey; but I knew
                  not. As I passed through the office, the clerk called me. "Do you know," said he,
                  "there's going to be war? Every corner is blocked by men in cautious conversation?
                  Such mutterings as I do hear, and every man has so much a bull-dog look. Even
                  priests and other pious people, in company and alone, do clench their jaws; and
                  from every man's mouth, even though he be silent, I do hear oaths terrible!
                  Methinks the very air hath a solemn sound, and the drum and fife, and fierce
                  rattle of musketry comes from afar off. Nor am I alone in these horrors; for e'en
                  while you waited yonder, strange and active men have come and gone in this hotel,
                  as never men did before. Every man has some great errand, some mission that needs
                  be done at once. Prescott comes for Judge Francis; some one comes for Prescott,
                  and while they whisper and nod, another comes, and they all hurry off together."
                  When he told me this, I was being troubled lest the Judge might fall in with the
                  seceders, and, of course, leave the city, taking with him his niece. With a
                  somewhat heavy heart I ventured out, determined to go to every place but I would
                  find the Judge. I fancied I had detected something of vast importance to the whole
                  nation respecting Floyd, Thompson, Madame Ponchard, or the Prince of Wales. Just
                  as I came to the corner of J Street, I met Judge Francis, who exclaimed, "O! such
                  things as I have heard! Come, let us to the Temple; we will assemble our happy
                  dozen to con over the strangest things ever heard of. Go, call our friends
                  together; we've caught a hare!" Now I noticed, when he came near, that he had
                  something concealed in his bosom, and it seemed very large; so I began to talk
                  with him, drawing nearer the while, till I got a peep, and I beheld that it was a
                  huge bouquet of flowers. Then I told him we should at once go to the Temple, but
                  he said, "By and by; go you, I will come after." But I said, "Why not let us go
                  together?" He hesitated a moment, and then told me he had a little business affair
                  down at the hotel. I knew then he was going to take the flowers to Vickey; but I
                  said nothing about it. So we each one set out to meet at the Temple; where I was
                  to give in my testimony—the most important history ever heard of.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>AFTER I had finished the last chapter, I looked back to the place where Miss
                  Stimpkins was saying she would make the whole country laugh on the other side of
                  its mouth, and I also laughed. The consequence was, Jenkins saw me laughing, and
                  he asked me how I liked the book thus far? I told him every one of his characters
                  seemed to have a good deal of selfconceit; and that he himself betrayed it a
                  little. "No matter," said he, "the book must be a true history of the country; if
                  we do manifest a little self-conceit, why, you must remember that we are only two
                  hundred years back descended from the English." I told him, too, that where
                  Victoria used such fine language, I thought it was overdrawn; but he said that
                  there are many country girls in his country as green in their public behavior as
                  she was, and yet have all the brightness, fluency and innocence that Vickey
                  manifested. He says, moreover, that the same country girls are the purest and best
                  that can be found in any part of the world. I told him. I would write it down so,
                  though I feared it would not be satisfactory for them to hear of it. Then I urged
                  him to tell me whether he married Miss Ann Underhill, and he said, "wait a
                  little."</p>
               <p>"No, no," said I, "before I write another word of this great history, tell me
                  whether you or the Southern gentleman got her?"</p>
               <p>He smiled a little, and then began as follows, to wit:</p>
               <p>After returning to the Jackson House, several of our members urged the Judge to
                  disclose his designs for our action, and when we had seated ourselves around for
                  that purpose, he drew forth a paper, and then vainly searched for his spectacles
                  in his pockets. Thinking they were lost, he at last exclaimed, "Is it possible I
                  have lost my spectacles!"</p>
               <p>I told him to never mind it; for he ought to be furnished with something better
                  than, silver spectacles.</p>
               <p>"Silver!" said he. "Indeed they were gold; fine guinea gold."</p>
               <p>Several of us shouted, "O, Judge!" and he replied, "Indeed they were; they cost me
                  twenty dollars."</p>
               <p>Some of us said, "O, Judge! twenty dollars!"</p>
               <p>"Well, no matter," said he, "I'll get another pair; but I cannot read this
                  paper."</p>
               <p>"Please you," said Mr. Prescott, "I found a pair of spectacles in the entrance to
                  the Temple. Will you try them?" and he handed them over to the Judge. We all
                  recognized them as his, and they were silver, and had been broken and tied on one
                  side.</p>
               <p>When the Judge put them on, he said, "Why, most remarkable—why, I can see with
                  these old things first rate." We all assured him they must indeed be his own, but
                  he said, "Of course they are since I have them on Mine had a flaw on one side, and
                  might easily, be taken by a casual observer to be the same."</p>
               <p>"Now, Judge," said Prescott, "I am sure these are your original spectacles, and
                  you are so much of a philosopher, you don't often notice the things you wear. You
                  are like Governor Walpole of Kentucky, who did not know his boots from his wife's
                  slippers."</p>
               <p>"Well, I confess it is somewhat so," said the Judge, being anxious to change the
                  subject. "What did you know of Governor Walpole? He was one of my most intimate
                  friends."</p>
               <p>"Governor Walpole," said Prescott; "I knew him to be a scholar and a gentleman of
                  the first water, and he was undoubtedly one of the finest linguists in the
                  country."</p>
               <p>"He was that," said the Judge, "and I believe he was one of the most versatile men
                  I ever saw. Indeed, they were a talented family. His father and my father both
                  graduated in the same college."</p>
               <p>As he was going on in this style, we began laughing, for we were posted in the
                  matter.</p>
               <p>"Now, Judge," said Prescott, "why do you make such pretensions? I do not know any
                  Governor Walpole; there never was any Governor Walpole. I was only drawing you
                  out."</p>
               <p>When we ceased laughing, the Judge said, "Indeed there was a Governor Walpole, and
                  I knew him.—No, I mean Governor Waldo.—Yes, Governor Waldo;" and he afterwards
                  adhered to it that there was a Governor Waldo. That is the manner in which he
                  would always get out.</p>
               <p>We could never make him own up to the falsity of his great pretensions.</p>
               <p>We then arranged our business, and, as the Prince of Wales' procession was to take
                  place on the day following, you may well imagine the anxiety we had in making the
                  necessary preparations. Previous to this I was to start out on my business, with
                  reference to the action of Floyd and Thompson. This began business for me early on
                  the following morning, while nearly all our members were allotted to their various
                  parts.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, as soon as it was daylight, I went to the Treasury to witness the
                  result. I had, in fact, barely stationed myself, when Floyd and Thompson came up
                  and halted even as the latter spoke.</p>
               <p>"Hold, Floyd, I would reflect awhile."</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Floyd.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Wherefore?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thompson.</speaker>
                  <p>—"If here were sentinels, as are in France, passing to and fro to guard the
                     nation's gold: or, if here were a dog—even a dog to watch it, some excuse could
                     I find warranting this deep design. But it is like despoiling innocence
                     unarmed, with arms equipped for thunderbolts. I do revolt at it."</p>
                  <p>"Ha, ha! read that," said Floyd, and he pointed to an inscription above the

               <p>After they had thus spoken, they entered the Treasury, and I felt sure now that
                  the national funds were indeed at the mercy of robbers. I was about to turn away
                  from the scene, when that very suspicious-looking woman, Madame Ponchard, was seen
                  approaching. She seemed in trouble; wrapped in profound thought; not noticing me
                  until she was within a few yards. Whereupon she looked to the ground, as if
                  searching for something, and then turned and retraced her course, joining, a
                  little distance off, the dark-eyed Orsini.</p>
               <p>Thus the great cloud of the rebellion was sending forth its scouts, its vultures,
                  to nibble at the feet and envelop a great,<pb n="26-27 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000014"/> unguarded, Christian people, and there was no law,
                  no arm of power to stay the approaching scourge. We could but look at the great
                  fabric and weep, as we stood so powerless to do it service.</p>
               <p>Thus was I waiting, reflecting, and watching, when who should approach, but the
                  Prince of Wales, and the Duke of New Castle, for their morning walk. When they had
                  approached near me, they asked what building that was? I told them it was the
                  National Treasury. The Duke said, "What! has this country a Treasury?" And the
                  Prince said, "It seems so, and without soldiers to guard it. Let us halt a while
                  and contemplate the novelty of this sign: <q>
                     <p>'THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE.'"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Quite interesting, is'nt it?" said the Duke.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, my lord," quoth the Prince, "that that sentence is the only thing of
                  all I have seen in this country, that I admire?"</p>
               <p>"Really, I think it has some significance. Ah! but what significance; that's the
                  puzzle—whether this property is all the people have got, and needs this sentence
                  to prove the title, or whether this sentence is to show foreigners the extent of
                  American enterprise, which is to say, this young nation has already saved enough
                  to buy one house."</p>
               <p>"My lord is jovial," said the Prince. "As for myself, I feel serious. Do you know
                  there is not another country in the world that leaves unguarded its national
                  bureaus? And this it is touches me. It is a kind of honor I looked not for; it is
                  a glory outmatching all the armies of France; it is an inward strength and full
                  composure; like Hercules, unmoved when the gods at common omens trembled."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, so," said the Duke. "Why, you are a metaphysician. Now, I took it, the
                  American boast was a fireman's parade, wide streets, and wooden houses. This
                  building is something, to be sure; but where is that score of botanical gardens
                  and botanical colleges—those zoological gardens, and their attendant
                  lectures—where are those mineralogical and geological colleges, with their
                  gratuitous instruction? where the astronomical observatories for the instruction
                  of ambitious young men? And this is the nation's Capital! I declare, it is very
                  amusing, very amusing indeed!" "I say, my lord," said the Prince, "this nation is
                  very young; it boasts that it is very young." "Ah, but that is not so; only young
                  in wisdom. It is nearly as old and nearly as powerful as it ever will be. It has
                  no noble type of character. For the lack of the places of instruction I spoke of,
                  in its National Capital, there is no place for the wealthy and intelligent to
                  assemble to form a model of Americanism; and, in consequence, those classes fly to
                  Europe to unmake their nativeism by a smack of foreign airs." "But how, my lord,
                  is it possible to have these great public institutions in a republic? The places
                  to be filled, would open only a new source for politicians." "Very wisely said,"
                  replied the Duke, "very wisely said; and hence it is, a republican government can
                  never raise the common people to a high state of civilization. The more elevated
                  are constantly pulled down to the level of the great multitude. Nature gives
                  genius to make it exclusive; but a republic will not sustain that which nature has
                  designed should mark the difference. Hence it is, genius and refinement in this
                  country is burdened with the contact of ignorance and slothfulness; it feels the
                  burden; it inwardly revolts at it. And yet, a day since, did I hear some Southern
                  gentlemen say that the national affairs are gradually falling into the hands of
                  the common mob, and that the more elevated are determined to cut loose, and
                  establish the supremacy they are entitled to. Add to this the fact that American
                  offices pay just enough salary to attract common jockeys, and not enough to meet
                  the demands of the great and good, and you have the weakness of the Government in
                  a nutshell." Now, as it so happened, while he was speaking, Floyd and Thompson
                  emerged from the Treasury and concealed themselves behind the pillars thereof, to
                  listen. "If not now," continued the Duke, "it will soon follow that the men who
                  come into power, will be little better than highway robbers. They will no more
                  regard that inscription on the Treasury, than they would the morning dew. It was
                  so in the Roman republic; men even violated their solemn oaths, and often took
                  paltry bribes as an equivalent for their influence. Finally, they became
                  themselves too great a corruption to live together; and there was a general
                  scramble for the spoils, in the pretence, and in fact, of the necessity of
                  founding another government." Thompson knew the Duke, and hated him, because he
                  was English, and because he and the Prince refused to visit Richmond, on account
                  of it being in a slave State, and he spoke to Floyd in a low voice, saying, "O, I
                  am cursed! O, I am cursed! Heaven has sent my enemy to chastise me. Had I
                  godliness in my<figure>

                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6417-00000015"/> cause, I would rush upon him and give
                  him a good thrashing. These monarchical prophecies of our country are of long
                  standing, and it makes my blood, boil to see, alas, that they are true." "It is
                  true, as you say," continued the Duke, "the things the Americans boast of are all
                  foolish; and the honor and honesty you infer from the absence of soldiers, is
                  indeed something worth while. That Americans never steal, and that Americans, in
                  business habits, never tell untruths, are their only distinctions that are good."
                  "And they are good things, indeed," said the Prince. "Such is the boast of other
                  nations—Jews, of gold; French, of fun; Britons, of banks, and Americans of
                  honesty." "'Tis well, indeed," replied the Duke, "that my lord of Renfrew cannot
                  be heard in this country; he'd make the people vain."</p>

                     people; that trusted one another. And yet this vow I make; if ever Americans
                     disprove their present honesty, no joy more will I take in seeing the face of
                     man." When he had finished speaking, he and the Duke went their way, the latter
                     admonishing him that it was Friday morning, and that whatever was done on that
                     day, would prove a failure; alluding to the vow the Prince had made. Thompson
                     thought he meant Floyd and Thompson's deeds, and he walked out and said to
                     Floyd. "You see, we are damned in the very onset. A base robbery!"</p>

                     saving that which would otherwise be lost? Why, Thompson, you yourself did
                     first propose to Cobb to take this stuff away." He held up gold bags and paper
                     bonds. "Is it better we throw it in the river, or leave it here to burn, or
                     take it to our homes, or fly with it to Canada, or pout and grieve that we took
                     it at all? Methought the founders of a new nation had more pluck. Is not the
                     state dead? And—we the trustees?" "So the state is dead," said Thompson; "the
                     state was our mother, and we have rifled our dead mother's pockets."</p>

                     look if any one was near, the while holding on to Thompson's sleeve, and he saw
                     me, and said, "Hallo, fellow! what are you doing here?" "Nothing,' said I,
                     "only halted to hear the Prince and the Duke." "Scoundrel!" said he, "you lie,
                     you are an caves-dropper," putting therein a fierce oath. Now I had, all the
                     while the Prince and Duke were talking, been seated on the curb-stone, making
                     believe my boot hurt me, so I could hear what was said. Floyd and Thompson came
                     up to me, even while I sat there, and the former caught me by the collar. "What
                     would you do?" said I, rising; but Thompson caught me too, and I struggled to
                     get away, fearing bodily harm. "You'll do no more harm to us!" said Floyd, and
                     he swore again. They thee a pulled me over backward, my feet catching against
                     the curb-stone. "You dog!" he continued, "I know you, you are poking your nose
                     into everything?" But while he was speaking, I seized Thompson by the throat
                     with one hand, and shook him. He was very cowardly and broke loose, standing
                     aloof; and Floyd instantly drew a knife.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>I had, in the meantime, worked myself into a better position, and now sprung up.
                  He was frightened—not daring to strike me with his knife.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said he, "we are more than two hundred strong. Before two hours hence, you
                  shall be a marked man; consider this is you please." I made no reply, and they
                  started to walk off, and again he retorted, "You cannot arrest us. The very
                  officers to whom you would apply, will put the seal on you."</p>
               <p>I stood there waiting for some time, not making any answer, and, in fact, until
                  they had disappeared. On my way back, I stopped at the market-place, near the
                  outer posts thereof, where I heard a voice which I recognized as the Judge's. On
                  drawing still nearer, I beheld him alone, with flowers uplifted, evidently
                  contemplating a rich interview with his Victoria. In view of the novelty of the
                  scene—to see and hear the Judge, with such a bouquet, and by himself rehearsing—I
                  halted a moment.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful!" said he, musing with a low voice, "beautiful flowers! Thou shalt deck
                  a fairy form. Thou shalt grace a queen. Behold the lily and the rose, so fair, so
                  sweet, outmatched by the lady I love! Aye, ye precious little diadems! precious
                  warblers on that bosom! O! what tides in my emotion rise! Beautiful. Victoria!
                  Victoria! My angel of glory! Daisies, lily blossoms that warble on such fairylike
                  bosoms, do I love thee? Oh thou fairest of the fair, behold the tenderness of
                  these! inhale their fragrance! compare their exquisiteness with my fond
                  appreciation! Old, thou hast made me a child! This heart, pure, as adamant—it is
                  thine, and thine only. Ah, dearest! thou hast fear of my quality, and dreamest
                  that the tender of my love is but a dream! Dream on, blessed angel, these blessed
                  flower! shall make thee dream forever! Come, sweet flowers! envious mortals! thou
                  shalt play at the lips—press on the heaving bosom! Oh, that the glory of coming
                  hours were here! Now, let me rehearse:—</p>
               <p>"'Madame, my carriage waits at the door. Will you accompany us to the procession?
                  We have a place. Oh! ah! shall I have the honor? Will you sit by me? Ah! allow me,
                  my dear! Here are flowers. Take them, their natural perfume evaporating toward the
                  great expanse above, like the lone heart never captured, giving love to the
                  imagery of an unheard of beauty! Take them, I pray you! feed upon their sweetness;
                  no age is there. Some of them are curled and wilted; but, ah! the perfume is even
                  as sweet as from the infant bud. Ah, indeed, my lady faints; poor child! The fatal
                  deed is done; the battle fought and won! Be happy, oh thou, my dearest dear!'"</p>
               <p>As he was still rehearsing to himself and examining his flowers, and alternately
                  bowing and cramming them to his nose, and then viewing them, I was myself so much
                  agitated, that it was almost impossible to remain silent. On looking over the way,
                  I saw Miss Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins approaching directly toward the Judge, and I
                  saw too, that she beheld him in his ecstasies with the flowers. Behind her, and at
                  a little distance, came Professor Jackson.</p>
               <p>When they drew near, she bid the Professor halt. The moment that she had
                  approached near enough to the Judge to hear his folly, and see his antics, it was
                  evident that she was enraged. After witnessing it a short time, she suddenly stood
                  before him, face to face.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" said she. "Judge Francis Underhill—a man of your years?" He
                  started up, confounded.</p>
               <p>"I am but a boy, madam," said he. "My hairs are white, it is true; but my heart is
                  like an infant's."</p>
               <p>"I venture to say," said she, "if there be war, your age would exempt you without
                  a jury. More should you think of your grave than of a fair dulcinea." <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"More the sexton seek,</l>
                        <l>Than this maiden meek,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> said the Judge. "Nay, Miss Lucy, you interpret from the frozen cinders of
                  your own impulses. But who that has felt the genial flame, would not, for a single
                  moment's glorious ease with the lady of his love, confront the cold philosophy of
                  a frowning world. Oh madam! I mean Miss Lucy Tabiatha, when you feel and know the
                  fervency of a dear sweetheart; to know that its recipient is touched by the same
                  chord of matchless tenderness, and hath but craped this mortal part to make one's
                  self reveal exquisite joys within its compliment—too much, too much for the nerves
                  to bear—Ah! you smile Miss Stimpkins! Question you my love? If ever man for woman
                  vowed, then I to mine am resident always. Age is fire, and I have age, hence, I am
                  warm; and these [touching the flowers] gentle emblems shall decorate her matchless
                  beauty;" and thus saying, he walked away, not giving her a chance to answer.</p>
               <p>Miss Lucy was discomfited at this sudden departure, and immediately addressed her
                  consort, Professor Jackson. "Professor Jackson," said she, turning sharply towards
                  him, "heard you that attack upon woman's rights? Will you stand and hear me
                  vanquished? What right has he to meddle with the fundamental principles of human
                  love? Where is the voice of his fair one? Is there none to warn her?"</p>
               <p>The Professor suggested that there might be some misunderstanding about the
                  congeniality of the two persons.</p>
               <p>"No, sir. No, sir." she replied. "I neglected to be true to the rules of my own
                  doctrine. I let my feelings move me. I was overcome. But yet, I shall vanquish
                  him. I shall show him these boasted<pb n="30-31 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000016"/> affections are but promptings of sin. I shall teach
                  his fair one to rely only on moral and intellectual principles. I shall teach her
                  that this thing called love, is all moonshine. Professor, I have more advantages
                  than he ever dreamed of. Talk of reclining on bosoms, I shall recline on the
                  Prince of Wales, and make my enemies bite their fingers; for I have enemies—so had
                  Bonaparte, and so had Cæsar." "It is so," said the Professor, and they left
                  together.</p>
               <p>I had indeed been anxious to come forth and personally witness the past contest;
                  but, having my clothes soiled as before mentioned, and being anxious to return for
                  a change, I waited a moment so as not to be seen in my present condition. Scarcely
                  was quiet restored, when I heard a noise as of some one, weeping, and turning to
                  look, I beheld there the identical man who had been conversing with Ann Underhill,
                  on the previous occasion. He was leaning against the Jefferson Archway, twirling
                  his little walking-stick in his fingers, his head leaned backwards, and the heel
                  of his boot playing upon the other. Half-way between song and speech, he then
                  turned and went on in this fashion: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I will away, away to th' wild lagoons</l>

               </p>
               <p>Diamonds glittered on his shirt bosom and on his fingers; he seemed like the kind,
                  intelligent, and darling son of more than common folks. On the instant I regarded
                  him as a rival, but when I beheld the deep solemness of his nature, I was won over
                  to him. "My friend," said I, "I am moved with pity to the strangeness of this
                  melancholy." He looked up, and when we faced each other, we recognized that we
                  were brothers of the same society, though we had never before offered each other
                  any salutation. "My brother," said he, "I am cast down. Such things run through my
                  brain as would move a world to tears. I see the progress of events, and I know
                  that all the glory and peace of our country is at end. Woe on me that I have lived
                  in this scourging period." I took his hand and he rose up. "Though nations fall,"
                  said I, "and religions perish in envious broil, one thing alone will ever endure,
                  whereby men can faithfully rely upon the confidence of each other. Tell me,
                  brother, what is this that, wears so heavily on your mind."</p>
               <p>"This is the substance of my sorrowing," said he: "Peace and respect no Southerner
                  now has, even in the Capital of this great country. Everywhere am I pushed into
                  the pitiless storm; abuse is heaped upon me alway. This is a deeper grief than you
                  premise. When first I came, to Washington, I loved it as a Northern romance, and,
                  much in hope, my joys were lifted up. Cares of home I banished, and the luxury of
                  ease I sought out. In all concourse, I made free the confidence I did expect from
                  others, oft dilating with right good will on my own good fortune. For, till now I
                  called it good, and now I deem it not so. You may know, my dear sir, I was born of
                  wealthy parents in Louisiana. My father was the largest planter in that State; he
                  owned eight hundred slaves, and his wealth was the chief support in employment of
                  three thousand men. When I was a boy of fourteen, my mother died. My father being
                  young, married again; but, not content with a woman of his own country, took her
                  from that ever-renowned land of the poets, Italy. She was my tyrant; often after
                  she came did I wish that I had never been. These trials were not unknown to my
                  excellent father. He had employed for my instruction the best English and foreign
                  teachers, who became enamored of my future promise. My father desired that I and
                  my step-mother should be kept apart, and he resolved to take her to Italy to live;
                  himself to spend his time equally in the two countries. When he acquainted me with
                  this fact, my sorrows knew no bound. My father was a great and a good man; he was
                  all I had in the world to love; but I never said him nay. No, I never!
                  Accordingly, when I was in my eighteenth year, my father having appointed all the
                  necessary officers of his estate, came to tell me the time had come. The last
                  words he said were: 'More, I desire, my son, that you be good than great. The good
                  may be crossed awhile, but in time their joys will be eternal.' He folded me in
                  his arms—we separated! I never saw him since, although I have since spent many
                  years on the continent of Europe, and searched every conceivable place where such
                  a man could live." When he finished speaking, the tears were fast falling on his
                  cheeks, and I knew not in what way to comfort him. His appearance showed me that I
                  was in the presence of no ordinary man, and one the most deserving sympathy I ever
                  met with. "Indeed," said I, "this is worse than death; for it is the burial of all
                  peace of mind. Heard you never a<figure/>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6417-00000017"/> word that could lead to the whereabouts
                  of your father?" "Several times, and in several places were they seen together,
                  and even for two or three years, all the way from Paris to Naples. The last I ever
                  heard was that they left Europe for America, more than four years ago; but whether
                  they ever arrived, I know not. I returned and took possession of the estate, and
                  have since managed it. Now I have more grief to add to it, it is the threatened
                  aspect of our country. As I said before, I had only a father to love, and when I
                  lost him, I lost all. You must know, sir, the position I was enabled to take in
                  foreign countries, and my most remarkable mission threw me into the best of
                  society, where, alas, I received the severest blows ever dealt to man. People
                  pitied me for the loss of my father, and while they pitied, they sneered at the
                  slavery in my native land. They even insinuated the death of such a man as my
                  father, was nothing more than the retributive justice of heaven. I plead my
                  country's cause; its laws excused for the manner of its long-standing custom,
                  estates descending with all appurtenances, and content and comfort amongst the
                  slaves in full requirement. I could bear such goading sympathy, for I was in
                  search of my father, until I had exhausted all hope of ever seeing him more. Then,
                  as I said, I returned. O! what joys unspeakable within my breast when again I
                  reached my native land! All the castles of monarchies, the arts and sciences of
                  Europe, and all the elevated and noble people whom I could have loved but for
                  their eternal sneers against this country; all, all I now gladly exchanged for my
                  glorious land of liberty! I settled on my estate in comparative joy, my heart so
                  full that even the greatest of Abolitionists would have found me a kind and
                  honorable friend; so great was my joy to meet my countrymen; so much I hated the
                  noble families of France, England and Italy for their abuse to me, for that which
                  I could not help, nor were the cause. But my retirement could not last long; my
                  ardent nature sought enjoyment. I came here to mingle with the choicest of my
                  countrymen, and I have given many compliments. In return I am sneered at for the
                  slaves I own and cannot get rid of. The conflict of two terrible parties is about
                  to begin. Then will my former boasts of my country in Europe be turned to
                  mockery." "Indeed, sir," said I, "you have touched something which would move all
                  the honest and great men of our country." I then told him who I was, that I had
                  been a long time a local reporter, but that having acquired a great fortune, I now
                  amused myself merely going about taking notes, which I rehearsed before the courts
                  of Judge Francis Underhill. "Underhill!" said he, and I told him yes. He then
                  said, "I have heard Miss Ann Underhill speak highly of her uncle," but we
                  thereupon ceased to speak more of the Underhills, nor did anything pass between us
                  tending to show that either of us mistrusted the rivalry, and we then returned to
                  the Jackson House to get ready for the procession.</p>

               <p>I TOLD Jenkins I longed to hear more about Miss Ann Underhill, but still I was not
                  forgetful of the fact that he had neglected to tell me whether he himself married
                  her. Said he, "I was telling you as fast as I could, but you know it is the
                  fashion of modern authors to tell anything except what they have to tell, in order
                  to make a book as large as possible. I know one author," he continued, "who took
                  up the waste papers that he had rejected from different books of his own writing,
                  and when he saw what a huge pile there was, he said to himself, 'what shall I do
                  with it?' So, wishing to make the most of his name, he sent them to a publisher,
                  and had a book made of them, and it had a good run. Another man took his cue from
                  it, got a history of the sewers of Paris, and some police reports, put them in a
                  bag, shook them up a few times, then took the papers out and paged them for a
                  book. Being at a loss for a name for his book, he turned to his publisher and
                  said, 'Ah! Les Miserables,' and then he went home determined to abandon the
                  project. But the bookseller went on with it, and it is said that many people read
                  it, and never discovered the joke."</p>
               <p>"Well," said I, "well, Jenkins, you will not try any such game as that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" said he, "but, in the language of Falstaff, 'shall I not take mine ease
                  in mine own book?'"</p>
               <p>When he said this, I made no further argument, and told him to go on with the
                  transcription. He told me to begin, saying:</p>
               <p>"Having resolved to attend the procession, and fixed upon a ride with Judge
                  Francis, I immediately repaired to the hotel to acquaint him with the
                  determination. The Judge at once ordered out his carriage and horses, informing us
                  that everybody was welcome in it. It was more than twenty years old, and so were
                  his horses, and they were attended to by the same servant that had done so for
                  more than twenty years. The carriage had had many breakdowns, and was pieced and
                  patched in every side and corner. Many painters for many years had painted the
                  various repaired parts, and it was of many colors. Some of the silver mounting was
                  gone, some was loose; and the broken bolts had been replaced with monstrous nails,
                  splitting the boards here and there, and bearing many gashes withal. One horse had
                  turned old faster than the other; one very fat; the other lean. The reins and
                  harness had often broken on a midnight ride, and been with ropes made whole. The
                  cushions of the carriage had shed their stuffing, and the cover thereof had been
                  gone for many years. And yet, to the Judge, the whole concern was as perfect as on
                  the day he bought it. It had, like a wife, grown old by such slow degrees, that
                  the owner never knew it. Every part of it too had a history; the Judge could talk
                  a month on its scars. He would say, "Behold you that dash board? What a rent is
                  there! That occurred one pleasant day in June, as I was going in company with
                  Henry Clay to the races," and then he would fashion out how it was done. "See that
                  twisted bolt?" he would again go on. "Daniel Webster had often urged me for a
                  journey to Mount Vernon. I shall never forget that memorable day," and so he
                  continued; in all probability not the quarter part was true. But he boasted so
                  much of his great associations, that he at last believed them himself. So, when we
                  had expressed our desire to go to the procession with him, not knowing he was to
                  have many ladies, and when the carriage was ready, and while the Judge was yet in
                  the hotel, not less than eight of our court members climbed into it, determined to
                  have at least one more good time, whether there be war or not. Now, while we were
                  climbing in, there came by that everlasting Mrs. Stimpkins and Professor Jackson,
                  and they thought it was some public conveyance, and that they might avail
                  themselves of the opportunity of riding to the procession, where they could then
                  dismount. Accordingly, she jumped upon the steps of the carriage, saying, "I think
                  a gentleman would at least give a seat to a lady!" and we all cried out,
                  "Certainly, madam, come in!" and in she came, followed by Jackson, the gifted
                  Professor. We were all wondering in our own minds what the Judge would say when he
                  came out and beheld no place for himself. What was our astonishment, however, at
                  seeing him at last, with Vickey and Ann Underhill on each arm, followed by Mr. and
                  Mrs. Edge. "Ah!" said the Judge, "nearly full!" and he smiled; for there was not
                  room for the smallest thing more to get in. "Quite full, sir!" shouted Mrs. Lucy
                  Tabiatha Stimpkins; "you can't get in here, sir! Go ahead, driver, crack up your
                  old skeletons!" We, who had taken first possession of the carriage, were about to
                  leap out, and yet trying to smother our laughter; but the Judge was too clever for
                  us, and he said, "Keep your seats, I pray; I was never so pleased in my life. Here
                  comes another carriage; we are provided." He bowed and laughed heartily, and so
                  did many of us. In a few minutes, he and his party were in another carriage, and
                  we were started on. "I told you, Professor," said Mrs. Lucy, "that the time would
                  come when I should vanquish that Judge. He fancied he could overcome me on all
                  occasions as he did at the market-place." Thus she went on for some time, but we
                  were brought to a change by meeting Judge Walker, who motioned to me that he would
                  speak a word. So he got on the step of the carriage and told me some important
                  matters he had for me, and then he asked where we were going, and I told him.
                  "Why, have not you heard that?" says he, "it's not to be to-day!" "How so?" says
                  I. "Why," he said, "it is not consonant with the feelings of the royal family to
                  go to receptions or any other place on Friday. They fear there will be no good
                  come of it, and so the President postponed it until to-morrow." When he said this,
                  he bid me good-day and left.</p>
               <p>Now, Miss Lucy had been so earnestly talking all the while to the Professor, that
                  she heard not a word of it. I told all my companions of it, and told them to say
                  nothing; that we would give our Lucy a ride. We resolved at once to drive far<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6417-00000018"/> out of the city, and then discharge her
                  and the Professor, and let them have the benefit of a walk back to the
                  Capital.</p>
               <p>As soon as we were clear of the street crowd, I made the driver drive—(and he did
                  drive). In a few moments we were out of the city, on the Georgetown road. Miss
                  Lucy was alarmed, and shouted, "Where are you going? What is the matter?" But we
                  heeded her not, and urged our driver to go the faster, the horses being kept at
                  full gallop. Some of us would say, "Madam, you are right; it is a very fine day."
                  "How far did you say you were going?" and such like, as if we did not hear what
                  she was saying. Thus we flew over hill and dale in breakneck style, all of us
                  laughing fit to kill. "Mrs. Lucy and the Professor now began to look terribly
                  afraid; soon, indeed, they thought we were playing a sad joke at their expense.
                  After a while, we turned up Miller's Lane, where all was dust and hot sunshine;
                  poor Lucy, quite enraged, shouted with all her power, "Where are you going? For
                  heaven's sake, stop! This is the wrong stage? Let us out!" After we were half a
                  mile further on, we succeeded in understanding her, and halted to let the pair
                  dismount.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I thank you," she said, as soon as she reached <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >terra firma;</foreign> "you might have told us this was a country stage. We
                  took it for a carriage going to the procession. You have no regard for helpless
                  woman. You are very smart, gentlemen, I dare say. You can snicker, and play the
                  nice gallant to doll-faced misses, but you don't see nor hear a woman of
                  sense."</p>
               <p>She then turned and looked fiercely at her consort, Professor Jackson, and started
                  him out of countenance.</p>
               <p>"Professor Jackson, I am astonished at you! Have you, too, no regard for the
                  rights of poor helpless woman?"</p>
               <p>But ere we had time to hear her full lecture, and in the midst of our laughter, we
                  turned our carriage and began to retrace our course. What then was her amazement;
                  what her heart-burning anger when she saw and knew that the whole thing had been a
                  joke on her and the Professor. Here lay several miles between them and the city,
                  to be walked over in the burning sun, and amidst clouds of choking dust. We had
                  little pity for her, though, because she had so rudely come into our carriage;
                  yet, we were heartily sorry for the poor Professor, who now must needs withstand
                  her storms all the way back. We also justified ourselves on the ground that the
                  day was a holiday, and we were entitled to have some sport.</p>
               <p>What was our astonishment to find, on our return, that an equally important joke
                  was being played upon the venerable Judge. The clerk and Prescott had laid a wager
                  on the result of the Judge's being magnetized. The wager consisted of a dozen of
                  sparkling catawba, and the nature of the wager was that no trick could be played
                  upon the Judge, to make him acknowledge that he was beaten in a joke. The plan
                  was, for the whole party, after the Judge was seated in the parlor, to withdraw
                  and leave him sitting there. If the Judge continued stitting an hour, under the
                  belief that the magnetizers were standing behind him when they were not, or if he
                  would own up that he had been sold in the matter, then the clerk lost. The Judge
                  knew nothing about the bet. He agreed, however, to sit to be magnetized; and at
                  the end of the hour they were to fire a pistol, and he was to get up and show them
                  that they had failed. The magnetizer was promised something handsome for his
                  services, but he had to agree to the plans of the party.</p>
               <p>So when all the party was in the parlor, the magnetizer opened the affair by a
                  short lecture, beginning, of course, with the beginning of the world; passing
                  through the old fogyism of man in not believing in magnetism, and blowing on its
                  powers and usefulness. He then told us that everybody could be put in the magnetic
                  state; that if it could not be done by one person, it could be done by a number of
                  persons all acting on the same subject at the same time. He then informed us that,
                  with this brief statement, he was ready to begin.</p>
               <p>The Judge smiled, and shook his head to signify his disbelief.</p>
               <p>If you never saw a magnetizer, I will tell you how he does it: he makes down? ward
                  passes toward you and around you, until you go to sleep, as it were, with one eye
                  open; that is to say, some of your external senses are asleep, while your internal
                  senses, or reflection, are in cognizance of the magnetizer; and so, losing
                  consciousness of yourself, you obey him.</p>
               <p>When several persons magenetize a single subject, one makes the passes upon the
                  subject, another stands, behind the one, withdrawing, as they say, the magnetism
                  from one source. Its merits, however, and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">modus
                     operandi,</foreign> are generally described by its adherents to be the
                  withdrawing of the electricity in the system. It is also said that natural sleep
                  is produced in exactly the same way; that is to say, the daily toil and the
                  contact with outside objects, withdraw so much fire from the system, in the course
                  of a day, that the person goes to sleep.</p>
               <p>With animal magnetism, it is claimed, the subject may be so reduced that there is
                  no communication with the sensitive nerves, and that the motor system can also be
                  made as rigid as a frozen corpse. One of the chief arts of magnetism is,
                  therefore, to impress fully some startling facts upon the subject, before
                  beginning the operation.</p>
               <p>As started, therefore, the present lecture of the Professor having partially
                  frightened the Judge, and he being resolute to show us that he could not be put to
                  sleep, became passive to our design. He was, therefore, placed in the centre of
                  the parlor, his back toward the door. Behind him we stood in single file, and
                  began the downward passes—the Professor being next the Judge. The Judge was told
                  to sit still until we had him in the magnetic state, and that we would fire a
                  pistol and see if he could arise at the end of the hour.</p>
               <p>When we had given a few passes, we one by one passed out into the hall, until all
                  of us were gone, leaving the Judge sitting in the parlor alone. He thought that we
                  were still operating upon him, and he was waiting for the signal.</p>
               <p>The gong now sounded for dinner, and if there was anything that the Judge hated,
                  it was to be kept from his dinner; but still he was determined to sit it out, to
                  show us that he had beaten us at our own game.</p>
               <p>We went to dinner and made a good deal, of merriment at the table. The doors were
                  thrown wide open, and we could all sit at dinner and see the Judge in the parlor,
                  where; he could hear our noise and laughter. He envied the folks at the table
                  undoubtedly—not knowing that so many of them were ourselves—being himself of a
                  merry disposition, especially about the time the heavy wines come around. So for
                  one whole hour we kept the Judge sitting there, and then, after we had finished
                  our dinner, desired some one, to fire off the pistol, and so make the Judge own up
                  that we had played a joke on him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the pistol was fired; the Judge rose up, turned around, saw us, and,
                  of course, realized at once the true state of the case. We cheered him heartily,
                  and in he came, saying:</p>
               <p>"If it had not been for that pistol, I might have slept all day."</p>
               <p>"Good!" said the clerk, "he won't own up; I have won!"</p>
               <p>"Why, no!" said Prescott, "we magnetized him; so I have won!"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" said the Judge, "nobody has won. I took my regular sleep, and when the
                  pistol was fired off, I awoke. It was, indeed, my trick on you all. I only sat
                  there to take my usual sleep while you were at your sports."</p>
               <p>Although we knew he had not been to sleep, Prescott did not wait for the laughter
                  to subside, but ordered in the sparkling catawba. In a few moments, however, we
                  were aroused by the solemn realities of the great nation, of which we were yet
                  happy members. One, two, three rapid shots of cannon rang in our ears. The
                  decanters started, and the glasses, half raised, fell back. "What was that?" "What
                  was that?"</p>
               <p>Prescott arose. "Ladies and gentlemen," said he, "we are still free in our light
                  enjoyment. It is not so in all countries, and it cannot be so long here. I hope
                  that we may ever esteem these happy privileges, and never view the departure of
                  our present enjoyment. We have no cause for rebellion, and yet this very city is
                  in the hands of men projecting one; not against the city, but against the freedom
                  of man. One man alone, out of so many millions, has the hardihood to oppose them—I
                  mean General Scott. He foresees trouble, and yonder cannon are all the few he can
                  scrape together. I think he is determined to keep the national Capital, though
                  only himself do stand to battle. He has just had an interview with the Cabinet,
                  and these are his messengers."</p>
               <p>When he had said this, he turned and left, and I myself followed. Several of us
                  who had charge of the Prince's procession, having been sent for to attend to the
                  arrangements. But as the whole affair is related in the next chapter, the reader
                  is referred to that.</p>

               <p>IN order that you may appreciate our description of the Prince of Wales'
                  procession, I must first introduce to you our action in the Cabinet, which was,
                  however, an informal meeting; Prescott, myself, and several others being among the
                  number. As you are all conversant with the general form of cabinet meetings, I
                  will at once begin with the interview with James Buchanan. He was, when we
                  approached, in the grounds in front of the White House, but with us, immediately
                  retired within, when Prescott handed to him some Charleston papers, saying, "Here
                  is something straight from Charleston; see, it smells something of gunpowder." He
                  then handed the Charleston <title>Mercury</title> to the President, and added,
                  "the Southerners, you see, want some British royalty here to sit on a Southern
                  throne and wield their affairs of state, where cotton is king."</p>
               <p>The President made no reply, took the papers, and then passed them around to
                  several persons, Davis among the number. Davis, however, being cunning, was
                  anxious, if possible, at that time, to make the appearance of the projector of the
                  rebellion as insignificant as possible; He therefore replied to Prescott, "When we
                  attempt to muzzle the gas of newspapers, we may suffocate ourselves. We have
                  indeed more important business on hand than the discussing of editorials."</p>

                     that when our house is on fire, it is not wise to discuss its original cause.
                     In all candor I would ask, Does any man suppose that there will be war, or even
                     secession? Agitation may be dangerous, but we have power, by concession, to
                     heal all grievances."</p>

                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"I hope so! Oh, I pray that it may be so!"</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Several questions were then brought up, not, however, relating to the most
                  important affairs before the country; and then, after a little informal
                  conversation, some of the party left. Buchanan, however, stood there alone.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the mystery of these things!" he said, "the mystery and vague forebodings; a
                  word is spoken, and men appear and disappear but to fill me with unspeakable awe
                  and dire confusion. Nothing in this country now has a head or tail. Men's actions
                  are without meaning. They stilt and stiltify one another, making me their
                  spectator for punishment. I am a very stumbling block where both parties come and
                  break their shins, myself getting all the blows. Misshapen Richard complained that
                  dogs barked at him, but I have all my countrymen, and yet I am President of the
                  United States. What have I done? Wherein is my fault? That I love my country too
                  well? That I will not take sides? Why, bless me, have I not explained the
                  Constitution? Will not my country understand me? I do protest these things shall
                  not be. I will write another message, and I will so illustrate the Constitution
                  that no man may gainsay me more."</p>
               <p>This he spoke, in a great measure, to himself, but somewhat toward Prescott and
                  myself. Prescott was anxious to make a reply, but I checked him a little out of
                  respect to the position we were in, and also because at this moment General Scott
                  approached and entered the place. As soon as Scott had passed the salutations of
                  the morning, he at once broke forth in plain English, telling him to reinforce<figure>

                  him plainly that it must be done.</p>
               <p>But Buchanan wavered in assent, suggesting that "it might at this time be
                  unnecessary."</p>
               <p>"It is necessary," said Scott. "A small force of men sent there in time, would
                  save the country from shedding one drop of blood."</p>
               <p>"I take it that that would only be a menace to the South," said Buchanan. "Davis
                  says so; so does Cobb, and so does Rhett."</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Of course it would be a menace. Jackson menaced them once before, and even for
                     that the South, in the end, took sides with him. Wavering minds always choose
                     sides with the Government. There are ten such wavering minds in the South, at
                     the present moment, to one secessionist. If you keep silent, these minds will
                     all follow in the beat of their leaders."</p>

                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Have you any evidence that the South will secede, or that there will be any
                     disturbance?"</p>

                  <speaker>Scott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Governor Gist is already arming his State. All assemblages in the South now
                     gleam with swords and sparking bayonets. To be even thought to be a Republican,
                     down South, is now but to meet certain death. Everywhere South has the threat
                     been made that if Lincoln be elected, secession shall result from it; and if
                     need be, by force of arms. And yet we sit in silence, even countenancing the
                     fall of our country by our inaction."</p>

                  <p>"I find no precedent in history of reinforcing the forts; neither is there
                     aught about it in the Constitution."</p>

                  <p>"The Constitution!" And when he said this, he looked so fiercely at the
                     President, that the latter turned pale. "The Constitution! I've brought down a
                     few guns to this city, and I shall fight for it whether it is in the
                     Constitution or not!" Scott rose up, and I saw he was filled with a deep,
                     burning fire; his massive brows fell, and like a lion to a lamb, he gazed on
                     the trembling President.</p>

                  <speaker>Scott.—</speaker>

                     custom-houses the property of the nation? Are you not bound to protect them,
                     whether any section likes it or not?"</p>

                  <speaker>Scott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"If you cannot get that, why, get a Cabinet that will consent with you. This
                     should be done at once. Toucey is sending the navy off to foreign countries.
                     Floyd is sending the army to the western frontiers, and Cobb, through Floyd and
                     Thompson, has sunken the treasury from eighty millions to twelve, and now they
                     have stolen even the remainder. Really, sir, this is no time to be reading the

                  <speaker>Scott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"It must be done; only show a little spirit, and nine-tenths of the people
                     South will stand by us."</p>

                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>

                  <speaker>Scott.—</speaker>

                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Oh, you can rely on it." When this was concluded, Scott seemed much pleased,
                     and took his departure.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Jenkins," said Buchanan, after having hung his head awhile, and fingered
                     his vest button, "Mr. Jenkins, I am going to write a message, and I want you to
                     be my amanuensis. It shall be filled with the soundest arguments. Everything in
                     the Constitution shall be laid down so plain a child could understand it.
                     Moreover, I shall tell the South in plain words that the election of a plain
                     man like Lincoln, is not cause enough to justify secession and rebellion."</p>
                  <p>Just then, when he got thus far, Floyd came in, and stood listening; Buchanan,
                     not seeing him, went on:</p>
                  <p>"Fort Moultrie shall have two hundred men, and Sumter three hundred, and so
                     shall I garrison every place in the South. And in some places I will put shrewd
                     detectives, to keep me well informed on all dangerous doings among these
                     firecaters. Indeed, it shall so turn out to my thankless countrymen that I am
                     not only a peaceful man myself, but the cause of peace among other folks. Come,
                     Jenkins, I will ask my Cabinet nothing; I am going to stuff the Southern
                     forts."</p>
                  <p>Right before him now stood the unflinching Floyd, the man of oaths, the cunning
                     Secretary of War.</p>
                  <p>"You will?" said Floyd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Floyd.—</speaker>
                  <p>"What now, Mr. President? Are you planning the death of the nation, and a
                     gallows for yourself?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Why, indeed, sir?"</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Floyd.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Fear not, I mean no harm, neither does any Southern gentleman. I am not only
                     your friend, but the friend of my country. Intimidate the South, and all is
                     lost. Compromise, give the South plenty of time, and all will be well."</p>

                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"In this extremity, what shall I do? There is a millstone about my neck, and I
                     am to brave the ocean, or, in failing, die. Two elephants are pulling me in
                     opposite ways, and I am half ripped in the middle by their powerful tension. I
                     cannot go with one, for the other pulls me away. One threatens eternal
                     execration, and the other death. What have I done that I must die? Not my life
                     do I begrudge, though I don't want to die, but to go by the Constitution,
                     that's my matter. Now, in truth, I have just promised Scott to reinforce the
                     forts."</p>

                     Reinforce the forts, and every man, woman, and child will be in arms. To
                     intimidate such men, ay! but to raise a hand against them, is to destroy one of
                     the greatest nations! We protest against force; we are sworn to the stand, to
                     demand a guarantee for our institution, and we will have it, peaceably, if we
                     can; forcibly, if we must. Blood, blood be on the head of him who dares
                     transgress the rights of these Southern sons of chivalry!"</p>

                     am resolved to write a message. I will show the whole country how the matter
                     stands; that there is nothing against secession in the Constitution, and that
                     there is no law empowering the President to make war against any section of the
                     country. I will also employ Bishop Hopkins to write a sermon on slavery, to
                     prove its right and holy origin. I will arouse the democratic party to rally
                     round the Constitution, and, if chance be that Breckenridge be elected, this
                     muddle will all blow over. Come, I am in humor for it. Get me the decisions of
                     the Supreme Court, and bring in the Constitution."</p>

               <p>When he said this, he hobbled up to a mirror and did adjust his cravat, saying to
                  us, "Excuse me, gentlemen, a moment," whereupon we withdrew, Floyd assuring him
                  that his remarks were just the right sort of stuff for these times. In the hall we
                  met Cobb, Rhett, and Davis, though when we told them Buchanan wanted to adjust his
                  cravat, they did not enter, but, in company with Floyd, walked off. They went down
                  the winding stairs toward the lower grounds of the palace, and even as they passed
                  on the lower step, I heard a voice of a woman, who said, "Go; no more: go at
                  once." I turned to look, for it had a sepulchral sound—dramatic and touching; and
                  I beheld Madame Ponchard and Orsini, with the papers in their hands (newspapers),
                  and I took them to be the same that Prescott gave to Floyd and Davis. The thought
                  flashed over me in a moment that they were reading of the offer of ten thousand
                  dollars reward for Lincoln's head; and when I mistrusted what country people they
                  were, I trembled in breathless apprehension.</p>
               <p>"That is short the mark," said he.</p>
               <p>"Patience," said she, "patience, sir; in the name of all that is sacred, I charge
                  you say no more, but go at once."</p>
               <p>"But if the place was known?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Follow them," said she. "I am off to the Senate. Remember, too, that admonition.
                  Now, no more."</p>
               <p>"I am yours to command," said he, and he bowed and left; but she came up and
                  entered the mansion, and passed through the hall, but where, or for what purpose,
                  I at this time knew not. These were the most words I had yet heard either her or
                  Orsini speak, though I had known them by sight for several years, and had seen
                  them so constantly in company with the most respectable people of Washington. They
                  had, in fact, become to me like a could, coming and passing wherever good or great
                  people were assembled. On this occasion I endeavored to follow her, but she soon
                  mysteriously disappeared.</p>
               <p>A few minutes afterwards, I heard loud rapping at a door—a most unusual sound
                  there—and I sought for the cause. It was Prescott trying to get in Buchanan's
                  room. I told him the old man was fixing his cravat, and that we had better wait
                  awhile. Just then the door opened, and the man himself appeared before us.
                  Prescott introduced his business at once, saying that news had just been received
                  from South<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6417-00000021"/> Carolina that three
                  commissioners were to be appointed to come to Washington to demand the State's
                  withdrawal from the Union, and to settle for the National property within that
                  State, and that, in the opinion of Scott, the men in Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter
                  should be at once reinforced, and furnished with supplies, as the men already
                  there could easily be starved into a surrender.</p>

                  <p>"But I tell you, Scott's going wrong end foremost about the matter. He is a
                     soldier, and he wants to fight; he knows no other way to settle anything. Tell
                     him I have reconsidered the matter; that reinforcing the forts would
                     precipitate us into war on the spot. Also, go and telegraph all over the
                     country that I will not do a thing against the South. This will quiet them; it
                     will satisfy them I am determined to stand by the Constitution at all

                  <p>"But suppose we wait till they are in position to demand; they will say, 'Give
                     us the forts, or we will starve the garrison?'"</p>

                     watchman. Before we employed you, you made solemn oath you would take care of
                     our common property, and we look to you to fulfil your obligation. You have no
                     right, sir, to barter off the nation's things to any section, and yet your
                     inaction is the doing of it. Therefore, to suffer it to be so, is to violate
                     the trust we gave you—to violate your oath!"</p>

                  <p>"If this is abuse, sir, you have it in a milder form than you will in five

                     plunging the country into war, and, if it once begins, hundreds of thousands
                     will be butchered by your impotent criminality. Say not that you know not how
                     to avert this dread calamity; for General Jackson showed you. Say not that you
                     have no one to help you; for you can make your own Cabinet. Say not that you
                     lack in money; when you put thieves to watch over it."</p>

                  <p>"You would find that there were two powerful parties pulling at you, and that a

                  <p>"Why, sir, the nation never reads the Constitution. It has the sense to tell
                     what justice is, and it has feeling to tell what dismemberment would lead to.
                     It is the bond of party, and the technicalities of law that have confounded
                     you."</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Indeed, you almost convince me; almost am I resolved to join the cause of
                     bloody carnage."</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prescott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"You have no chance. You are here to do the country's will, and we look to you
                     to do it."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"And I will. In fact, I was right with Scott. Go, tell him I will reinforce the
                     forts at once; a ship shall be despatched to provision our soldiers there. Oh,
                     our poor soldiers!"</p>
                  <p>When he said this, Prescott seized his hands, and wished him many blessings, on
                     which he took his departure. "Now this is the last time," said the President to
                     himself, "the last time I will change my resolutions. I will be as firm as the
                     everlasting hills."</p>
                  <p>I saw that his cravat was not on straight, and I turned him round a little, and
                     fixed it for him. Just then Davis came in, but Buchanan kept on talking; not
                     seeing the former.</p>
                  <p>"I will not move one jot from this, though the heavens fall. The bloody hand of
                     Mars shall threat and cower these fire-eating Southern bloods, till they
                     trembling pray me mercy. I will so engulf them round with soldiers and large
                     cannon, that even a breath of wind will tame them. Then shall come my message,
                     and Bishop Hopkins' sermon, like a clap of thunder——. Ah, Mr. Davis!" And he
                     saw Davis, the latter smiling at him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Davis.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Why, sir, what humor's this?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Ah, indeed, what humor is it?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Davis.—</speaker>
                  <p>"To reinforce the forts?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"I must; the curses of the country are on my head."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Davis.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Why, now, indeed, you much mistake the country. To reinforce the forts, is to
                     arouse every manly feeling in the South. It is to threaten with a straw that
                     they may laugh to scorn such mockery in us. They are the embryo of a great
                     nation, called into being by these woful threats from an unmannered and
                     impotent people. They may be led or pacified; but driven, never! No, never!
                     Reinforce the forts, and you, sir, ruin this great republic."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Woe, woe is me! The curse is on my head! Take me to my chamber. Send for
                     Bishop Hopkins, ay, and Wigfall. Excuse me, gentlemen, I can bear no more."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Thus saying, he went out, having appointed a time for me to call and write his
                  message.</p>
               <p>"Poor old man!" said Davis, "he takes these things entirely too serious for any
                  good. I'd lay a wager of fifty niggers at a slap there will be no secession, no
                  war, nor no trouble of any kind."</p>
               <p>I remembered that he had told Judge Francis that there would be secession, war or
                  not; and that it was his determination to keep the thing a little quiet, till they
                  had the cards shuffled. But I betrayed nothing, merely adding that I knew of no
                  grievance nor any damage, either of principle or property, that any State had
                  suffered, and that I could not believe men were so far forgetful of their country
                  as to seek its destruction.</p>
               <p>"Of course not," said he, "it is the merest balderdash, smoke, folly. But what
                  hint did he drop about the message?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, many, many" said I, and I told him how the President had been pulled about by
                  the two parties.</p>
               <p>"Good! good!" said he. "I hope they'll keep him at it; 'tis all we want."</p>
               <p>Before he spoke more, Madame Ponchard passed through the hall, and he addressed
                  her, and they walked off together. Now I was alone. I had attended a Cabinet
                  meeting, and it was no meeting at all. More than ever was I forced to reconsider
                  what the Duke of New Castle told the Prince of Wales—we had no government at all.
                  Every Cabinet member came and left, as did any body else, and Buchanan was only
                  tormented thereby. I threw myself into an easy chair to contemplate the apparent
                  coming horrors of my country, and the real weakness of our government. How much we
                  need a man of firmness for such an office as President, and how little do the
                  people weigh his qualifications while he is a candidate. If he be indeed the
                  chieftain put forth by some ignominious convention—the people vote him in. But how
                  could it be otherwise? Great men, that are well known, can never be President
                  here. They would not put the convention into foreign missions, and fat jobs—and
                  so, the convention will not nominate them. It seemed evident to me also, that if
                  there be secession and war, it was not about slavery, more than it was about the
                  spoils of office. I was familiar with the corruption of the privileged class in
                  England, where a single landlord can interdict the privileges of a railroad
                  company, and menace a whole county into his whims; and this disgusted me more than
                  the other. But as for France and Germany, I had only the spectacle of Government
                  living wholly on the extent of its robbery of the people's rights. With all these
                  horrors before me, I still acknowledged in my heart one great advantage in our own
                  government; that was, that a fool or a villain could only serve four years. But
                  while I thus pondered over the affairs of State, I had taken from the table before
                  me a copy of the Constitution, and the decisions of the Supreme Court, a fact, no
                  doubt, that accounted for the nature of Buchanan's mind. On the margin of a leaf
                  was the following curious poetry: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Oh, so long and dreary pass the hours,</l>

                        <l>Oh, so cold and cruel seem these flowers,</l>

                        <l>I have a love so gay and fair,</l>

                        <l>That charms the heart of an old man;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">A love, that maketh so merrily,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The next verse explained it all: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Long have I waited, O my fair one,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Long have I stormed the battle,</l>
                        <l>Almost faltering, almost fainting,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">But you have come with your pretty prattle,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To tease and to tussle,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">Happy in glory, happy Victoria!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>No doubt could be raised as to the author of the letter, and I knew also that it
                  had been just written; for the Judge had occupied that seat when I entered the
                  mansion. Hastily I tore off the scrap and pocketed it, intending it for futher
                  examination before our private court, which was to meet that very night. I then
                  left, passing down the avenue. In a little while, I fell in with young Wadsworth,
                  my expected rival, who greeted me with much cordiality and friendship, bidding me
                  come and see an object of commiseration near by. He took my arm, and we passed
                  down toward the Treasury, where we approached a man, indeed an object of pity. He
                  was sitting on the grass, leaning<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6417-00000022"/> over on
                  one elbow, dusty, threadbare, and apparently wearied; his hat far down on his
                  eyebrows.</p>
               <p>We asked him if we could do anything for him, and what his misfortune was? He
                  slowly looked upward, and I recognized him at once as Professor Jackson. "Alas,
                  alas!" he said, "I do need pity. I am an object of commiseration. This, indeed,
                  proves woman's greatness. She picked me up and married me in a day; but I am no
                  more in control of her affairs than a thumb paper. She sets me down on a corner,
                  or lugs me all day through different streets, and, moreover, since I find her out,
                  she is quite old and ugly. Alas, alas! I have dreamed for many years of many
                  maids, and now have I been snapped up by one whose face reminds me more of an
                  abandoned tan-yard, than a woman. And yet, why do I grieve? Is this not the cause
                  and effect—that our two genial natures ran together like water? Our money went the
                  same way—all into one purse—and that purse is hers. She has my hard-earned hundred
                  and sixteen dollars. Alas, the day!"</p>
               <p>Even while he spake, his wife came upon him, hearing his last words, "Alas, the
                  day!" and then she spake:</p>
               <p>"Professor Jackson! you are indeed a perfect Sancho Panza. That famous squire was
                  ever discouraged; ever fearful that the glorious promises of his master would
                  never be realized. So is it with you; not that I am your master, for I only hope
                  to stand on equal grounds with all men; but you, you cannot estimate what we have
                  already achieved. If we were overcome at the market-place, did we not vanquish the
                  same opponent in crowding him out of the stage? Then, too, shall we not tomorrow,
                  at the procession, make the most decided victory for woman's rights that has been
                  since the days of Lycurgus? Only a little while more, too, and the 'Journal of
                  Progress' will be out, which will of itself strike terror to the heart of all
                  oppressors. The down-trodden slaves of the country shall have their liberty; and
                  the bondage of woman will be torn asunder."</p>
               <p>When she began to talk, Jackson rose up, but still held down his head.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," says he, "as for vanquishing the Judge by crowding him out of
                  the stage, my opinion is, we have been vanquished ourselves by that rascally
                  driver. My eyes are so filled with dust, I scarce can see, and I am almost
                  overcome with the heat. And for the 'Journal of Progress,' I know I am in a
                  hundred and sixteen dollars, else I would go take a bath, and get a good
                  dinner."</p>
               <p>"Professor Jackson! Is that so? Now am I much mistaken, indeed! You told me you
                  had been lecturing on woman's rights for seven years; and now, when we are near
                  the pinnacle of fame, you needs must grumble for, a dinner! I never eat but one
                  meal a day, and that consists only of bread and water, at four o'clock in the
                  morning. And this is itself a great triumph; it shows the ascension of mind over
                  matter; it is the genius to which all men must knuckle. Only be patient, and you
                  will have cause yet to be proud of your wife. Methinks, when I see these
                  doll-faced women, that men chuck under the chin, and call pretty and sweet; what a
                  work is yet before us! When man can behold the eagle-like vigilance of the woman
                  of intellect, and love he for that, instead of for the face she wears, or for the
                  idle love-talk she twaddles over, then can we glory in our cause. Man shall be
                  taught to bow and smile to knowledge, without regard to the form and features, and
                  woman, too, shall learn that a pretty face and gentle voice are but silly items in
                  that greater day. But, sir, we have work to do; there are sufferers, whose wrongs
                  are crying out to us, and we must not tarry here. There is a law in this land that
                  taxes women, ay, widow women, women of wealth, and yet deprives them of voting.
                  Shall we idly stand while these women suffer?"</p>
               <p>He assured her over and over that she was right, and that hereafter he would
                  complain no more till their great mission was accomplished.</p>
               <p>As soon as they went away, we resolved ourselves into a committee to decide how
                  nearly they resembled Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and we found them to be nearly
                  identical; so much so that it would be impossible to write down their adventures,
                  without the writer being censured for playing a caricature on those illustrious
                  personages. My friend Wadsworth told me also that this was an excellent
                  illustration of the nature of the human mind. "When it pursues one thread of
                  philosophy," said he, "it invariably results in monomania. This poor woman has
                  harped so much on woman's rights, that she feels and sees nothing else, giving all
                  her energies to carry out a mere phantasy; neither does she suppose for a moment
                  that she is deluded. She imagines she can turn the tides of man's imagination, and
                  make him love and idolize females of her appearance. She has not the face nor
                  voice to gain admiration and love, and, frantic with slight, she blows her horn,
                  to call man's attention to the attributes she does possess. I do really pity such
                  a woman."</p>
               <p>"But how is it," said I, "that such a man as Jackson, who is not devoid of
                  knowledge, falls in with her and seems to appreciate her?"</p>
               <p>"For two reasons," said Wadsworth: "Firstly, nature never afflicts with a malady,
                  but she has also provided a remedy. You shall see; he will soon become displeased
                  with her, and his displeasure will either drive her into such madness as will be
                  her death, or she will behold the folly of her conduct, and so abandon it.
                  Secondly, there is no one else for either of them to love; what he lacks in
                  manliness, she has; and what she lacks in modesty and backwardness, he has, for he
                  needs a leader; and so, too, are such people the end of the propagation of the
                  species. They are the line where nature has set her everlasting seal. They feel
                  this, and hence their wail and cry of anguish. They feel that they are a separate
                  race, and hence their jealousy of rights and privileges."</p>
               <p>I told him I coincided with his views, but ere I had time to say more, he
                  interrupted:</p>
               <p>"But, as I was going to add, this monomania is but a small part of that with which
                  the whole human family is afflicted. What more is an Abolitionist? What else is a
                  politician? They are all Don Quixotes. They harp on a certain topic, till they
                  want to bring all the world over to their side. They take up their cudgels at the
                  sight of every windmill. Why should the North meddle with the South? Or the South
                  disturb herself about Lincoln? Lincoln could not harm the South if he were
                  elected, even if he tried. And yet hereon are topics sufficient to drive a nation
                  to war; to destroy a million men. This is all a monomania; a madness. It is the
                  folly of man; he will not control the reason he has. And this is a weakness with
                  which all men are afflicted; it extends from the highest to the lowest of the
                  human race. Man cannot control himself. Of all animals, he is the weakest in this.
                  God has given him reason, and it is an engine that runs away with him. Only one
                  man in all the world is sane, and he it is who can govern himself; but who will
                  find him?"</p>
               <p>Now, when I beheld that my friend was inclined to reason, I felt that the strength
                  of soul within me, which mostly lies slumbering in all men, received a new impulse
                  of vigor; for it is good, amidst all humor, that the chords of sympathy are
                  sometimes touched by seriousness. I replied:</p>
               <p>"How can such a man be? Man loves that thing most which is most in his mind. He
                  who has not travelled, values his house greater than a king's palace; and his
                  neighbors, he estimates, are above all others. His house and his neighbors are his
                  scales, wherein he weighs all things. So is it of sections and of nations. The
                  North and the South have learned that their scales do not agree; but who shall say
                  which is right? Let them exchange their abodes, and the light of humanity will be
                  upon them. Glory be to him who has travelled, for his fetters are off, and he sees
                  with a new vision. Wherefore is the prejudice of religion? and who shall say which
                  is right, save Him who knoweth them all? Neither can any man say he is a
                  philosopher, or a poet; for time, and the judgment of others prove all
                  things."</p>
               <p>Then he asked me how it was possible for man to be happy, and I answered:</p>
               <p>"Only by doing all that he has power to do. He must work hard all the days of his
                  life and do all the good he can; but most of all his essentials, it is required of
                  him that he be not himself, and that he be himself also; for when he sees his
                  fellows, he must forget himself in the sympathy he owes them; but when he sees the
                  rain fall, he must remember himself in the law he cannot govern, rejoicing in the
                  things he knows, and in the things he knows not of. When his house is on fire, he
                  shall not grieve, remembering that not a hair of his own head was burned. When his
                  wife is sick, he shall remember that he has willing hands and a good
                  understanding; and he shall thank God that he has used them rightly, whereby he is
                  enabled to alleviate her suffering. When he reads a tiresome book, he shall go to
                  sleep; but when his boots pinch his feet, he shall sell them, for they are not
                  worth a curse; neither shall he curse anything under the sun, for all things are
                  of some good. When he writes a book, he shall not write to please others, but to
                  inform them, and to please himself; for his vanity, as well as his stomach, loves
                  a glorious feast—or no temptation. All these things he shall do, and as many more
                  as there are stars in heaven, else he cannot be happy."</p>
               <p>So, when I ceased speaking, he said I was more comfort to him than was any other
                  man he ever met. He said he could almost be happy, were he always with such a
                  man.</p>
               <p>"I have a great plantation," said he, "in fact, I scarcely know how much I am
                  worth; so vast are my possessions. But you have drawn a black mark across it<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6417-00000023"/> all. You have, in a few sentences, shown
                  me the vanity of all earthly treasures, and you have held up to my vision that
                  priceless boon in the human soul, which can carry man over all the ills of life
                  triumphant. Long have I been oppressed. I have neither mother nor father, sister
                  nor brother. I have had not one to love. My heart is famished and broken. My grief
                  has become the bulk of my observance; I need to have it chased away. Herein is the
                  superiority of wisdom over riches; for the latter cannot comfort me. Now I pray
                  you that you speak more, and that you teach me to forget my sorrows." Said I, "No,
                  this thing could not be; to stand and talk would not do." Then I told him if he
                  had no objection, I would compare him to a lunatic; and I told him it has been
                  proved, by facts, that lunatics, put together, cure each other. The philosophy is,
                  that the constant diversion of the mind, is its greatest strengthening power; that
                  in life, as in a book, constant changing scenery is the style to which all men pay
                  homage. With that I took his arm, and we started, down the avenue, but scarcely
                  started, ere we beheld approaching Victoria Edge and Ann Underhill. They were
                  clothed in the richest attire man could invent; and their jewels were without
                  number, blazing in the evening sun, so that we could scarcely behold their smiling
                  faces. Two such gems of beauty never flattered man before: two such queens as
                  auburn Ann, and rosy-cheeked Vickey. The latter swung in one hand a huge bouquet
                  of flowers, and with the other managed her clouds of drapery, that her stain
                  gaiters, were seen to pat most saucily on the stones beneath her as she moved
                  along. But Ann no fixture had; a changing scene of mirth and good-humor, playfully
                  hiding that deeply seated soul of sympathy, whereon but to gaze, is paradise to
                  man. Only one thing seemed wrong—for Vickey to have so huge a bouquet, with nearly
                  all the flowers scarlet. There could be no doubt in my mind who gave her the
                  flowers; I had seen the Judge with the same.</p>
               <p>Now when two persons meet, they must turn aside a little, otherwise they cannot
                  pass. So also, when two people meet two others, there are two pairs face to face.
                  In this condition my friend Wadsworth came up to Vickey, and I to Ann; and every
                  one of us seemed reluctant to turn aside. Vickey said, "Behold the twin Apollos!"
                  and Ann quickly added, "versus grace and beauty."</p>
               <p>"Why not?" said Wadsworth, "why not take upon ourselves that which the ancients
                  did; each one claiming to be some figurative character, so that, in after ages,
                  visitors to Washington may say, 'here indeed, they were?' Let this avenue be the
                  loitering place; let the Jackson House be the mansion, at the windows of which we
                  sigh for the fair ones within. Then we have your uncle, who shall be a grave and
                  jealous protector, and you shall at times steal from under his care, and we shall
                  attempt to fly with you, but become thwarted in our endeavors."</p>
               <p>"Now I do think that would be delightful!" said Ann, "only you might never be
                  thwarted. We might be forever carried off, and our acknowledged protector might
                  become despondent, and die of a broken heart. We, too, might hear of his
                  misfortune, and we might grieve so much as to make you miserable ever after: to
                  think that our protector had taken us in infancy, shielded us from all harm, and
                  that he had taught us to love him in spite of all his oddities. It is a subject
                  too scared to jest upon."</p>
               <p>Although she smiled, yet I had never heard her speak so seriously before, and I
                  was thrown off my guard; for I thought she intended it as a hint to both of us. On
                  relating this afterwards in our court, to the Judge, he said of her: "An excellent
                  girl, as I am a judge, she has no superior on the face of the globe."</p>
               <p>I never gave him any definite answer as to the replies that we made or the
                  conversation that followed. Now, although we paired off with the ladies, I
                  endeavored to persuade Miss Underhill to walk faster, so that Wadsworth and Vickey
                  could the better converse with each other; yet I discovered that, my persuasion
                  was entirely ineffectual. Perhaps Miss Underhill liked to hear the sound of his
                  voice.</p>
               <p>We were, though, presently diverted by the most mortifying news ever given to the
                  country. Newsboys were running up and down the streets, shouting out that Floyd
                  and Thompson had robbed the National Treasury; and I am sure that there was no
                  man. North or South, of all the thirty millions, but felt ashamed. Even the
                  agitators of secession were horrified, beyond expression, to learn that two of
                  their important leaders must ever stand the brand of thieves. Cobb, Floyd, and
                  Thompson were the perpetrators; yet they walked the streets as usual, and not an
                  officer interrupted them.</p>
               <p>Nor was this the end of the shame. Wherever we looked, wherever we walked, these
                  boasters of ruin, these worthless politicians thronged the Capital, to spit their
                  virus in the face of good-natured, honest people. You could not walk alone, nor
                  could you accompany a lady in the streets but profane oaths saluted your ears and
                  these from the men that would presume to destroy a nation, and found another. And
                  thus it was with us; we longed to leave the street.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>BEFORE going further, I told Jenkins it was essential that he should inform me
                  distinctly whether he married Ann Underhill or not. He then said that he had been
                  telling me as fast as it was possible for a matter of this kind to be related, and
                  to do it in a systematic way. He then went into some further explanations as to
                  the secret of relating a serious incident that had a very important connection
                  with the future misfortunes that befell Ann Underhill and thereupon told me to
                  proceed as follows:</p>
               <p>When it was nearly night, I promised to call upon the President, whom I did really
                  pity, on account of his having been nearly deserted by everybody. I had also to
                  complete arrangements for the reception of the Prince of Wales. But yet another
                  more important matter, though yet unknown to me, was to be accomplished that
                  night, and which was to throw everything I had ever done into the shade. And this
                  it was:</p>
               <p>On my way down to the Jackson House. I was touched cautiously and quickly on the
                  shoulder, and, on looking around, I beheld Prescott; he was motioning silence,
                  even while he urged me to follow him. When we had withdrawn a little, he asked me
                  to come to the Capitol grounds, where no ear could hear, and he would there unfold
                  the greatest secret plot ever formed by man. "I cannot trust myself," he said,
                  "lest the very air I breathe inform other men." He was pale, excited, and in
                  earnest. Indeed, jest and folly no more mingled in the bombast of politicians. The
                  thunder seemed as if beginning to move the whole earth. Prescott took my arm, and
                  his very touch was unlike it had ever been before. Others passed us, and they too
                  had felt the approaching storm; even like wild men, and fierce with fear and
                  firmness, all coldly gazed one on another. Even so short a while before one could
                  not walk the streets but he heard the oaths and political harangue of
                  Southernfire-eaters; but now, no more noise was there. This it was gave it
                  meaning; that put the seal of certainly on it.</p>
               <p>"Believe what I say; question nothing;" said Prescott, as soon as we had seated
                  ourselves in a lonely part of the Capitol grounds. "We may be heard, and if so, it
                  is our death. In the basement of the Capitol, where the statues are, I discovered
                  the plot. See! listen! I had loitered there, beneath the caskets' base, in view of
                  Commerce, the while in pensive mood, when rumbling voices caught my ear. I looked;
                  'twas Rhett, Davis, Cobb, Floyd, Thompson, and others I could not see. So strange
                  to see them there, I dodged my head below the rim, and waited. Soon they were
                  beside me; and there they formed the solemn league, pledging all, soul and body,
                  to God, for the performance. Some parts I caught, and some I lost; a woman's voice
                  I heard, but I dared not move. They do suspect Lincoln's election, and thus
                  provide: All their doings to be in secret; no man admitted, but those known beyond
                  a doubt. That the whole rôle is to be, played before the 1st of March; that every
                  office North and South shall be at once brought under their control. They then
                  resolved to meet to-night, to specify their modes of action, and due appointments
                  mark out. When they had concluded, and decided where to meet, I feared for my
                  safety, lest they should discover me. They were then moving on toward me; no more
                  than half a dozen yards distant. I sprang to my feet, and ran toward the lower end
                  to escape at the eastern entrance. They were amazed at first, but soon gave chase.
                  The door was locked, and I could not escape. For a moment I was panic-stricken;
                  the flash of knives was in the darkness, and earnest whisperings rushing forth.
                  Close in the corner I backed, and outward fell a prop, where the workmen had
                  placed it for the night. With a goodly spring, I leaped over the side trench, and
                  made my escape. At once I went and told Scott, and he<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000024"/> told others. It is now urged on me to play the spy;
                  to attend their meetings, and there discover more. I am myself so small a man, and
                  not having much strength, I am afraid to do it."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said I, "I will go with you. We will assume a good disguise. You
                  shall be Governor Wise's son, and I will be Houston's adopted boy." I thus told
                  him how it had been with me when I beheld Floyd and Thompson at the Treasury; also
                  telling him that both Scott and Cass had advised me to keep it secret.</p>
               <p>We were not long in arranging our plans of dress and mode of speaking, both of us
                  having been reporters for a long time, were as familiar with the style of language
                  of other folks, as if we knew none of our own. Accordingly, we started for our
                  separate places of residence, to adjust our clothing; but when we came out of the
                  Capitol grounds, near the gateway, we beheld that ever hideous-faced Yancey. Like
                  a sentinel, he seemed, as if watching the face of every man that passed. Prescott
                  tightly gripped my arm, but I, to divert the distended ears of him who followed
                  us, chattered and laughed freely about ladies' hoops and length of trail. In a
                  little while we succeeded; Yancey fell back and retired near the gate once more.
                  It was evident now that the man they had seen in the basement of the Capitol was
                  to be killed, if they could find him. Their very first compact in secret formed
                  was thus discovered, and it will be seen hereafter that every one of them now this
                  believed a Judas was amongst their number, and that he had induced Prescott to
                  station himself in the aforesaid place. Suspicion fell heaviest, of course, on
                  Toombs, Cobb, Floyd and Yancey, and so great were the others' convictions, that it
                  was resolved none of these four should ever hold any position of trust in the
                  contemplated rebellion.<ref rend="super" target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005"

               </note>
               <p>I cannot say I was fearless in our projected spy business, for I knew every
                  Southerner would be armed, and that death would surely follow the discovery of us
                  amongst them. And yet, my risk was nothing compared to Prescott's. One thing that
                  made it more dangerous, was the place of meeting; which was, the garret-floor, or
                  dissecting room in the old medical college. They would not trust themselves to
                  meet at either of their private residences, lest the women ascertain their
                  business, and so betray them. In the above place, however, they knew no woman
                  would enter. They therefore called on the old negro janitor, and told him they
                  were doctors; that they had a body to dissect, and that it would occupy several
                  evenings. They told him also, that the corpse was of a well-known person, and that
                  it must be with the greatest secrecy; that he died with a strange and very
                  dangerous disease; that he himself must not venture near the dissecting room until
                  they were through. They told him they were so much afraid that somebody would get
                  the same disease, that he had better give them the keys of the two upper floors,
                  while he guarded the lower ones himself. So much they frightened him, that he
                  said, although he had carried many bodies up-stairs, he would not carry this one
                  up. They told him, however, that they had a man hired to do it. Then they told him
                  what a vast number of doctors had assembled to witness the dissection, but that
                  they had decided only to admit such as had tickets; a rule he was himself to
                  strictly carry out: showing him a three-cornered blank paper. All of this,
                  however, neither Prescott nor I knew of. Accordingly, although we were disguised
                  very well, when we applied at the college, we were confronted by the negro. He
                  wanted to see our tickets. He told us the doctors were doing something up there,
                  and nobody else must come in, except they had tickets. Prescott asked him where
                  the ticket office was? "Don't know!" said he, "s'pose on the back of this; one of
                  the doctors dropped his and I picked it up and saved it for him." He then showed
                  the little three-cornered paper; it had been cut from some scribbled piece of
                  paper. Prescott detected at once it was the shape that made it all right, and he
                  told the negro that he could tell by the back where the office was, and that we
                  would go and get tickets at once. We then withdrew, it being nearly nine o'clock,
                  fearing we should not get in that night; but we dreaded more than anything else,
                  that during the present evening some rules and signs would be adopted which would
                  forever after exclude us. Now was our time, before it had taken full form, to get
                  in. In a few moments we prepared our tickets and went in. But what was our
                  astonishment, when applying at the third story door, to be confronted by another
                  sentinel, who demanded, "Who sent you here?" We knew not what answer to give; for
                  we saw that our answer would betray us. Yet we knew from the manner he spoke the
                  sentence, it was a hailing sign of a secret order, and that he was new in his
                  office. Prescott thought a moment, hesitating, but replied, "I have forgotten the
                  right answer, but I know I was sent by Ex-Governor Wise, whose son I am." "Oh, all
                  right! Is this man all right?" Prescott told him that I was Jim Houston, adopted
                  son of the Governor of that same name. "Go on up," said he, "but remember the
                  answer next time; you should have said, "I came to dissect the body.'" "Oh, yes!"
                  said Prescott. Thus we passed to the fourth floor, where were two sentinel within
                  hearing of each other. It is needless to say, our hair was on end. We were
                  desperate. The first sentinel said, "What is to be done in the college to-night?"
                  His pronunciation showed us it was also a sign. Should we speak, or should we wave
                  a hand? We knew not. We trembled from head to foot. One thing alone could save us,
                  and that was to presume on the sentinel being new in office.</p>
               <p>Prescott said—for he remembered he was to imitate a Southerner—"Damn me if I
                  remember; we had the three-cornered tickets; and then the next was, 'Who sent you
                  here?' 'I came to dissect the body.' And then comes, 'What's to be done in the
                  college to-night?' D—d if I remember; but I know I am ex-Governor Wise's son, and
                  that this fellow is Jim Houston, and that we don't care a cursed damn about these
                  signs and answers, but we came here to play the devil with the infernal d—d Black
                  Republicans."</p>
               <p>"You can go up," said the sentinel, laughing, shaking us both by the hands, at the
                  same time telling the sentinel above to let us up—that he could vouch for us. "But
                  remember the answer," said he, "the next time you come; you should have said,
                  'That body must be buried so that no trace of it will remain in the memory of
                  man.' The next question is, 'Will you be coming down soon?' Your answer is, 'Not
                  till I have so provided against its disease, that no other will ever die of the
                  same, I hope.'"<ref rend="super" target="#note_006" xml:id="return_006">*</ref>

                  <p><ref target="#return_006">*</ref>These were the correct questions and answers of the then secret order which
                     organized the rebellion.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"I told you," said Prescott to me, "you and I could never learn that d—d
                  lingo."</p>
               <p>"I do know it," said I; "you have not given me a chance," and I also put on an
                  oath. Again the sentinels laughed, and we thanked them. Half a minute more, and we
                  were in the dimly-lighted hall. Oh, what a blessing this was to us!—a few little
                  untrimmed candles only. Eighteen persons were in the room; we made twenty. Three
                  more came in afterward. The meeting was organized; Toombs in the chair; Davis was
                  speaking; the others were seated on the dissecting tables. Davis dwelt at some
                  length on the impossibility of ever harmonizing the antagonistic principles of the
                  North and South, until one should overcome the other. He said a protective tariff
                  would build up the free States; every city and village in the North would
                  ultimately become a place of manufacture, and consequently of capital. But, on the
                  other hand, free trade alone could develop the wealth of the slave States. Next he
                  referred to the stigma of slavery. He said that we (the slave-owners) were to
                  blame for that. Power and might make right amongst nations. When Great Britain was
                  the most powerful nation, she took from the weaker powers what she wanted, then
                  made a law for it. We can now do what she used to do. We only need put our hands
                  forth, and the thing is done. All the important offices of the United States are
                  ours. The navy is ours, and so is the army. The money is ours, and the best men of
                  the country are ours. Now let us see," he continued, "for we take it for granted
                  Lincoln will be elected; we have four months to accomplish this in. We demand,
                  that, as he is illegally elected, in consequence of being sectional, the
                  constitutional obligations of the States are violated. Therefore some other man
                  must fill the chair; and the present incumbent of that and other offices can
                  decide that, above the vote of the electoral college. I will suppose, for
                  instance," said he, "that within a month we decide upon officers to fill the
                  coming vacant seats. On the 15th of February they are all installed; everything
                  warranting power throughout the whole country is given into their charge. What
                  folly, I would ask, would it be for Lincoln to come here half a month afterward to
                  claim the office of President! You may suppose, however, we shall meet with
                  opposition, feeble though it be; yet that very opposition shall be turned to our
                  advantage; for it furnishes us with a treaty power with each State in which a
                  revision of the Constitution will follow, guaranteeing our rights to slavery
                  throughout the whole country, and forever after apportioning the number of
                  representatives in Congress exactly equal between the slave and free States. We
                  can even demand a revision of the suffrage law, limiting the voters in each State
                  to persons of some considerable income. This will give us a respectable governing
                  class, without the evils of monarchy; and it<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000025"/> will silence forever the harangue of unprincipled
                  politicians."</p>
               <p>When he ceased talking, there were several others tried to get the floor, each one
                  only asking the privilege to suggest one word. Floyd succeeded, however, in making
                  the next speech. He recommended that we pursue a strict line of justice according
                  to the Constitution; that we ever hold in reverence the high moral character of
                  our Revolutionary fathers.</p>
               <p>Slidell spoke next. He understood the thing very differently; he thought the
                  Southern people of a better stock than the Northerners, and he proposed,
                  accordingly, that the Southern or slave States withdraw from the Union.</p>
               <p>Hardly had he said this, when up jumped a dozen others, denouncing such a
                  suggestion as altogether at variance with their designs. This confusion brought up
                  the chair—Toombs—who decided against any new projects. He said: "We have formed
                  ourselves into a nucleus for a new government on a new principle for the United
                  States of America. Every member admitted here is sworn to that. We will not
                  tolerate any dissent. Whoever speaks on this floor, must understand that any
                  variance from our purpose is at his peril. Speakers must confine themselves to the
                  fact, that we, ourselves, are the beginning, the preliminary government spoken of,
                  and that the object of our meeting is to determine the manner of effectually
                  establishing the new government."</p>
               <p>"That's the talk!" "That's the talk!" shouted a number of others as soon as Toombs
                  took his seat; and immediately after Cobb presented the following well known
                  resolutions:</p>
               <p>"That companies of minute-men be formed and drilled, to the extent of one hundred
                  thousand men, apportioned in different Southern States according to
                  population.</p>
               <p>"That, to carry out this organization, a secret embassy be sent to every
                  State.</p>
               <p>"That such embassy be empowered to form branches to this government.</p>
               <p>"That it shall be in the power of this government to call from said minute-men
                  twenty thousand, equipped for war, to the city of Washington, to be used for any
                  purpose the president and secretary may direct.</p>
               <p>"That, as fast as branches to this government are formed, they shall send and
                  maintain one member in the general body."</p>
               <p>These were adopted by acclamation; but it was afterward decided that the written
                  signature of every one present should be attached; and that copies of the
                  resolutions should be furnished to the travelling embassy. As soon as this
                  decision was made, Prescott and I began to tremble for our safety; for we were not
                  certain but some of the men present knew Wise's son and Jim Houston. Besides that,
                  we would be forgers of these men's names. In a few minutes the paper was ready,
                  and three or four of the obscure candles were brought near the desk, or rather
                  dissecting table, and quite a light thrown on each singer's face. Toombs signed it
                  first, saying at the same time, that this was the greatest thing ever done by man;
                  that he would have even sold his life for the privilege of putting the first
                  signature.</p>
               <p>Then came Davis, remarking that he was still watching over the dying body of a
                  great man, but that he christened this infant government with his signature with
                  the greatest happiness ever known to any one on earth. He felt that he was indeed
                  making a covenant with the Almighty God. After him came Cobb, Floyd, and others,
                  every one of whom made some remarks. Not one was signing in silence. Should we
                  make a speech?—walk up before all these men and say nothing? Why, they would
                  suspect us at once. Then, too, Prescott, stuttered a little when excited, and many
                  men knew him by that. These fears came upon us with much force; and as we leaned
                  together, rapidly counselling on it, Prescott said he had a notion to make believe
                  he had a fit, and so get carried out by me. I told him his whiskers and wig might
                  come off; that we had better come out and blow on the whole concern. He said they
                  could kill us and sell us to the doctors, and no one would ever know it; that was
                  the reason they had chosen this place. He told me to look at the door; and there,
                  behold, with sword drawn, stood that mysterious Orsini! We next observed that
                  nearly every one had on side arms.</p>
               <p>Now it takes some time for twenty-three men to sign a paper, especially if each
                  one makes a few remarks beforehand; and yet the time on this occasion flew faster
                  than ever before. Already were different ones looking at us, seeming not to know
                  us. We were almost desperate. We went forward. Oh, if Prescott should stutter! All
                  eyes were on us. Prescott took the pen, saying, "Though the father set the seal,
                  the son with maddened heart puts down the signature." He signed; and when they
                  beheld his name, they shouted loudly, "Good on John Brown!" Toombs remarked, "I am
                  indeed so happy to see you! How you have changed! I'd never have known you."</p>
               <p>Now I came, and I said, "May my godfather rejoice; for his son is at the zenith!"
                  In a moment more I was hailed on all sides: "How are you, Jim?" "Why, what's the
                  matter?" "What's come of your big belly?" Of course, I said but little, laughed
                  heartily, and cautioned them to heed the grand object of the meeting. Now, while I
                  talked thus, Floyd looked at me, and I thought he knew me. I put one hand in my
                  pocket, as indifferently as possible, and seized a huge knife which I had
                  provided, in case of emergency, and I fully resolved, if he said aught, to strike
                  it to his heart, and shout out "Traitor!" and in the melee make good my escape.
                  But he did not; he gradually, ceased, and became absorbed in the affairs of the
                  meeting, and more especially in giving in a report of his affairs with the defunct
                  republic. "I have to report," said he, "the transfer of one hundred and fifteen
                  thousand guns to Southern forts in order. Of the sale of forty thousand muskets,
                  at two dollars each, to two depositories South. These muskets were of approved
                  patterns, and cost the late United States Government twelve dollars each. There
                  are still at my disposal twelve hundred cannon, besides a number of other heavy
                  ordnance, and I ask you all what I shall do with them?"</p>
               <p>In less than five minutes it was resolved to place them at the service of the
                  minute-men. This was the chief of all that was said or done during our stay, but
                  occupied us until after one o'clock in the morning. Prescott and I knew that when
                  the meeting broke up there would many come to us to engage us in a good greeting,
                  and accordingly we resolved that at the first opportunity we would make our exit.
                  Just before closing, Toombs called attention to the necessity of guarding against
                  traitors. He said that every man should be vigilant, and, if he had any suspicion,
                  he should out with it at once. That there had been an occurrence at the Capitol
                  which made it essential to look out sharply. He would also state, without any
                  suspicion or imputation to any one present, that there might be a Judas amongst
                  us, and that that Judas might provide for our entire capture at the next meeting.
                  He proposed, therefore, that the time and place of the next meeting be not made
                  known more than an hour beforehand, and that it be made known by members calling
                  for each other; and that, when a person is called for and can not go, he shall not
                  be told where the meeting is; neither shall the person so calling go to the
                  meeting himself, lest he be followed. This would make it positively select and
                  safe. And so his suggestions were endorsed, and he and Davis were appointed to
                  make out the time and place. Toombs then urged every member to subscribe his
                  address; and this, too, was endorsed. The members now went forward and put them
                  down. Says I to Prescott, "We'll put ours down, Thirty-seven J street—that large
                  boarding-house." "Agreed," said he, in a whisper. It did not occur to us that the
                  proprietor of that house might be present. I wrote the names myself. "Why, are you
                  at my house?" said a rough voice beside us. "Certainly," said I. "Why, when did
                  you come?" said he. I answered, "This evening." "Not before I came here," said he;
                  "and I came here since you!" Prescott and I felt that our time was near an end. I
                  almost choked as I replied, "That four-story brick—do you keep that house?"
                  "Which?—oh! ah! are you there? That is Twenty-seven. Ha! ha! ha! Why, do you know
                  what kind of house that is?" "Bah!" said I, and Prescott, and I were drawing
                  toward the exit. All eyes were turned on us, and some whispering began amongst the
                  members. Cobb shouted out, "Who brought those men here? How do you know they have
                  signed our compact?" Who knows them? Are they traitors?" The word traitor rang all
                  over the house. "Traitors! Traitors!" Toombs called out "Order!" but all was
                  instant confusion. Orsini stepped aside to see some sign from either Floyd or
                  Davis. We started quickly outward, and in a twinkle Orsini's sword flashed. I
                  dodged, and the blade shaved my crown, cutting quite through my hat. Prescott was
                  ahead. We cleared the sentinels at a bound, one of whom snatched at my coat-skirt.
                  Pell-mell they came; the stairs and halls all dark. Quicker than the breath of a
                  frightened dove we were in the street. And our pursuers were locked in the
                  college. The old negro had been asleep in the hall, and when we ran over him he
                  woke and sprang to the door, shutting himself inside, thinking that robbers were
                  about to break into the college.</p>
               <p>Thus abruptly Jenkins ends this chapter; but he says there is more of the story
                  further on.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>BY way of beginning where the last chapter ended, Jenkins says that he and
                  Prescott wended their way to their homes about as fast as could be reasonably
                  expected of them. He then adds:</p>
               <p>I was as much puzzled what to do with our information as I was frightened about
                  our personal safety. Our Government was so rotten at this time that there was no
                  one with whom we could trust our secret. Scott and Cass were true to the national
                  Government, but their power was little. Seward, Lovejoy, and others were true, but
                  they had no more power and influence over national affairs than they had over the
                  sun.</p>
               <p>Now, when I returned to my room and reasoned on the approaching crisis; when I
                  beheld how entirely one-sided seemed all the wealth and influence of the country;
                  when I remembered how surely the Democratic party of the North would take sides
                  with the slave party of the South, I did really feel that the glory and power of
                  the great republic was about falling forever. If so, what madness would it be for
                  Prescott and myself to tell the things we knew! This, you may be sure, was not a
                  condition to please, nor was it such as would Iull me to sleep; and so I rolled
                  and tumbled until I thought it was nearly dawn, when I began to doze; and then,
                  alas! I was aroused by still another dreadful omen.</p>
               <p>Voices, strange in that place, yet voices familiar to my well-trained ear, were
                  heard in the hall, and in earnest accents. I knew that they were the voices of
                  Madame Ponchard and Orsini. I knew also that no person had any business in that
                  end of the hall at that hour of the night; and, raising myself cautiously in bed,
                  I listened. I heard her say, "No more! no more! Trust me to do what I say, or in
                  my anger forth shall come the story of the poisoned water."</p>
               <p>And then he earnestly whispered, "Why, Madame, by that you became possessed of
                  immense wealth! You would impugn yourself."</p>
               <p>"I know my part," said she, "and that you were the murderer."</p>
               <p>"But, it was too——" said he; but she cut him short by commanding "Silence!" and
                  the mandate, "Do as I bid!"</p>
               <p>This conversation, though almost in whispers, was distinct, yet I had not heard
                  sufficient to gather the thread of their discourse. I then heard a slight rustle
                  outside, but did not hear them depart, though the sounds ceased. I rose, went to
                  the door and looked out, but no one was there; and as my boots (having been placed
                  in the hall in order to have them polished) were still standing there, I could not
                  conceive that the intruders had been there for any purpose of thieving. Again I
                  returned to my bed, but with breathless anxiety. After some moments of uneasiness,
                  I extended my hands outward, and violently rang the bell. In another minute the
                  hotel servants were running to me. I threw open the door, and we all sought to
                  find the said persons, but they were gone. The clerk said somebody ran out of the
                  hotel by way of the ladies' entrance, but we could ascertain no more.</p>
               <p>It was now almost morning, but I retired, weary and oppressed, and soon fell
                  asleep. When I awoke it was after sunrise, and I felt considerably refreshed. I
                  remembered now that this was the day of the reception of the Prince of Wales, and
                  that I had many things to do; that I must go with Prescott to see Scott; that I
                  had to re-read to the President his own message; that I wanted to see Ann
                  Underhill and Vickey, and also the Judge. My servant told me the bootmaker had
                  sent home my new boots, and he wanted to know which I would wear. I told him the
                  new ones, and I asked him if the old ones were to be found; and he said, "Yes, I
                  have just polished them." Again I was puzzled about the scene I had heard during
                  the night, but I banished it, for I was resolved to have a good time to-day,
                  whether I was to be killed or not.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, I sallied forth, having previously armed myself with a six-inch
                  Colt's revolver and an excellent bowie knife. This was the first day of my life I
                  carried deadly weapons. But the condition of society rendered-life as insecure as
                  it is in Christian Italy or Spain. I knew plenty of criminals, but I dared not
                  report them to officers of Government, for they were all in partnership. So, I
                  must need defend myself; and, being withal a man of great physical strength, I
                  felt not at all inclined to avoid a contest, just in order that I might see what
                  execution I could do. When I entered the side-room for my breakfast, I ordered the
                  door opened, for it was quite warm. Right before me, in the ladies' drawing-room,
                  stood Wadsworth and Ann Underhill; she was again at the piano, and he standing by
                  her side. He was certainly in grief for the deplorable prospects of the nation,
                  and she was more serious than common. "Can it be," I said to myself, "she is so
                  fond of him? To all others she is so gay and frolicsome, but before him she is
                  shorn of all the glitter of earthly things. Her accomplishments are gone; her
                  winning speeches are finished, but more gentleness she hath. Oh, what a comment is
                  this on the frivolous show that maidens sigh for! So powerless she droops, when
                  once the genial flame comes o'er her. And he, too; his rhetoric and philosophy,
                  and his foreign travels, are all blotted out. As simple as doves and as
                  harmlessly, do the great and good in tenderness strip themselves to the naked
                  heart; and when once seen, all the world cannot cancel their happiness. They may
                  be crossed and tossed and tried in all ways, but never, never can the sweetness of
                  their joys grow less, or for a moment fade from memory." As I pondered on this,
                  the while beholding the only idol I had ever prayed for, the only one whose
                  happiness I prized as highly, as I did my own; and, too, beholding a man that had
                  in so short an acquaintance bound me to him more sacredly than had any other I
                  ever met, I felt that it would matter little whether I was killed in some street
                  affray or not. The darkest of forebodings swept over me. Every way was my ill
                  fortune, certain. Not that I would stand in the way of two true lovers. Not that I
                  would kill myself. I would conceal my feelings, or go so far away they would never
                  hear of me, all in order that they might not be unhappy. But whether they do truly
                  love—that was my question. I said to myself, "when I was young, reading of love
                  affairs, Why do not lovers ask and answer as they would for a pair of gloves? But
                  I how feel the sacred barrier the Almighty hand has before me. It is a theme on
                  which the tongue cannot come. True love makes us all dumb; it has no explanation.
                  The Great Unseen moves us as if we were chess-men. If we are stubborn, we fall;
                  but if we go as we are moved, we come to glory. Tears started to my eyes, but I
                  banished them. Why shall we weep? to-day is a festival, to-morrow we die. Shall my
                  death make others grieve? No, 'tis better I live and die a bachelor, for then I am
                  in possession of my whole self, and there is no loss when I am gone.</p>
               <p>But while I pondered thus, and thus breakasted, there came up through the hall
                  Judge Francis. With his fingers clutched round the necks of half a dozen bottles
                  of sparkling Catawba, and his hat set up so trim and gay, he shouted, "Glorious be
                  the day!" and he held up the bottles and winked right merrily. "Once in a while,"
                  said he, "the man is bowed down, but ever follows a bright morning's sun, and it
                  has such a face, no thought of grievance enters there. Say, you Mr. Jenkins, some
                  men are happy before they become men, and some are happy about that time, but
                  others do not receive their happiness till the show of silver waves on the wise
                  old head, and then, all the stored-up energies of a long life come rushing in a
                  perfect torrent through his every nerve and fibre. These bottles—you see how dingy
                  they are—I have for five-and-twenty years kept stored away, ever having bound
                  myself that only one thing in all the events of life could induce me to bring them
                  forth. And now, behold, with what pleasurable alacrity I wring their necks!"</p>
               <p>I burst out laughing, asking if he was going to marry; and he said,</p>
               <p>"What! a man of my age? I would not think of such a thing."</p>
               <p>"I thought not," said I; "your gray hairs incline you more to the grave."</p>
               <p>"Oh! not that," said he, "for I am yet quite young; so young, indeed, that if
                  there were to be war I venture they would have me on the roll. Do you know, Mr.
                  Jenkins, what a strange thing is love? When I was twelve years old, no higher than
                  to a lady's waist, I always fancied girls of seventeen. Well, when I was
                  twenty-five my fancy went for girls of seventeen also; and now that I am almost a
                  middle-aged man, it still runs on seventeen. Indeed, I think love has more
                  philosophy in it than most men imagine."</p>
               <p>When he said this he had come near me, and, looking up, saw his niece and
                  Wadsworth in the parlor, and I thought he was displeased, for he said, "I am sure
                  I care no more about that than you do. But come," and he pulled me after him. When
                  we arrived in the ante-room we<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6417-00000027"/> met Mr.
                  and Mrs. Edge, to whom he began about his wines. I was anxious to get up to the
                  White House, and took this opportunity to leave them. I met the clerk in the
                  office, and told him to have an eye and ear on the Judge, so he could relate his
                  affairs to me afterward. He told me he would, but he directed me to pass through
                  the verandah and there behold such another scene as I had never dreamed of. I did
                  so. Vickey was weeping, and Prescott, having just left her, was passing down
                  toward the avenue, where the great throng of visitors were wending their way in
                  the most smiling confusion. I stood in this position for a moment, thinking of
                  Vickey weeping, thinking what an eventful day this was to Washington, and thinking
                  of Prescott, now limping on before me. In half a minute more he halted, examined
                  his boot, then returned, still limping. "I have something in my boot," he said, as
                  soon as he drew near, going to the other end of the verandah. I followed near, and
                  saw him seat himself and withdraw his boot. He winced. The thought of a poisoned
                  boot came to mind at once. We then examined the boot, and near the ankle, where
                  the leather is soft, we found injected a small instrument, the size of a pin's
                  point. Could it be this was charged with poison, and meant to be an instrument of
                  death? Certain we were that it was a manufactured instrument. It was pointed at
                  both ends; it looked like type metal. I then told Prescott about the persons I
                  heard in the hall at night. He said he heard nothing of it, but that his boots
                  were also left standing in the hall. Again we entered the hotel, and I rang for my
                  servant, and ordered him to bring my boots. As soon as they were brought, Prescott
                  and I went into the ante-room, and there examined them. Exactly in a similar part
                  of the boot was an instrument identically the same. As we were examining these
                  little weapons, one of them came off at the end, and a bluish water escaped. "Now,
                  I know a man," said Prescott, "can tell us what this is. He is an old man in
                  Mark's drug store, a German, who can tell you the simples and the components of
                  all things. The object of these was, no doubt, to be our death; but my skin, from
                  having been a barefoot boy, requires a stronger, machine. Had that point entered
                  the skin, the top would have come off, and this fluid would have entered."</p>
               <p>We immediately repaired to the drug store, and sought out the old man referred to.
                  He took it in his hand, then laid it on a watch crystal and readjusted his
                  spectacles. He looked at us with some amazement, saying, "Where did you get it?"
                  We told him the nature of the case made it necessary not to tell at present. "I
                  have not seen one of those in forty years," said he. "They are called King's
                  Capsules. It is an Italian invention, and is an excellent illustration of what
                  degenerate nations busy their brains with. Instead of steam and telegraph, they
                  take to these things." He then inverted another glass over it, stopping the seam
                  with a solution of iron and flowers of sulphur. With a quick motion he jarred the
                  capsule asunder, and the liquid that escaped turned to bright red fumes. "The
                  quarter of that," he continued, "injected in an abrasion of your skin, would
                  produce death in one hour. It is concentrated hydrocyanic acid. You should be
                  given over to the authorities for even having such a thing in your possession." We
                  told him how we found them, and also asked him if there could be any danger of
                  Prescott having, been already poisoned; but he said no; that, as it had not
                  entered the skin, nor been broken, he need take no trouble about it. We told him,
                  too, that we had no positive evidence who put them in our boots. We were, of
                  course, somewhat concerned at this attempt at our destruction, and especially so
                  since there was no way of redress. Prescott had been already that morning to
                  advise with Scott about the remarkable meeting we attended the night before; but
                  he had obtained only the same misfortunate suggestion, "No power to do anything.
                  Those in office will do nothing. The President still keeps the Secretary of War in
                  his Cabinet, though he knows he is using the nation's arms for the nation's
                  overthrow." And then Prescott went on, "We can do nothing with them for their
                  resolutions last night. It is a free country. They are free to speak what they
                  will, and they are free to do what they will. Hence there is no treason; but even
                  if there was, there are no officers to try them. So, why shall we grieve or bother
                  our heads about the matter? See these crowds of thoughtless people, flocking here
                  to see the Prince of Wales; how little they dream of the threatening wand waving
                  over them."</p>
               <p>Shortly after this we separated, he for his own affairs, and I for the Mansion,
                  where I arrived in a few minutes. The President was waiting for me, and I saw at a
                  glance, as he rose to shake hands, he was pale and fatigued. "Come," said he,
                  after we took our seats at the desk, "you that are gifted in the use of words and
                  the framing of sentences, see what I have penned this morning, in a lonely hour.
                  Perhaps you can set it in a good shape, and give it to the country at large, so
                  they will not torment me with their criticisms for my official conduct."</p>
               <p>I took the paper up, and read the following lines, which he said he thought should
                  precede the message: <q>

               <p>He eyed me for some time, evidently wishing me to say something appreciative of
                  this poetical feat, while I was as anxiously trying to discover some means of
                  withholding it from the public. I had no doubt, however, now about the condition
                  of his mind. But I knew, if I disclosed it to the country at large, it would be a
                  serious misfortune, if not result in the entire destruction of the republic. I
                  told him it was certainly the truth, and but for its arrangement it should be
                  inserted as a preface to his forthcoming message.</p>
               <p>When I thus encouraged him, he started up: "I tell you," said he, "even yet the
                  country may be saved, if it will hearken to our counsel. I have here a letter from
                  Bishop Hopkins, and here a sermon from Boyden, of Hopedale, Virginia, on the
                  'Epidemic of the Nineteenth Century; the Sympathy for the Enslaved.' With these
                  and the Constitution the country must stand." I took the productions spoken of,
                  and was about to peruse them, when in came the two reverend gentlemen authors
                  alluded to. Very cordially Buchanan received them, and gave me an introduction.
                  Hopkins at once took up his letter, remarking, "In this will you find all the
                  substance of the dispute; and I have so argued it that I almost persuaded myself
                  black is white. The primeval condition of the black man, the stigma the Creator
                  put upon him when he slew Abel, have I so set down that all parties cannot but see
                  the wisdom of the All-wise Ruler of the universe in giving them over into eternal
                  bondage to the white man. I have shown the glory of God in the elevation of the
                  white man, whose triumphs have been the only contribution to civilization,
                  religion, and liberty. I have here pictured this same white man in his glory and
                  ease, seeking out the degenerate African, and bringing him over here and teaching
                  him to toil, and to behold the beauties of Christianity. I have shown how the
                  black man is to be enlightened; and how, by doing the drudgery of life, he gives
                  the white man time and liberty to ascertain the laws of God. In fact, I have so
                  explained, the degradation of labor, that even the men in the free States must
                  acknowledge the blessing of our Divine institution of slavery." And with much
                  pride the reverend father slapped the paper on the desk, and pouted his lips as if
                  the argument was finished.</p>
               <p>"Truly has he spoken," said Boyden," and in the same chain of argument I have here
                  a sermon on the hardships of the owner of the slave. I have shown him, with all
                  the cares of his slaves on his own back, while the slave goes scot free of all
                  concern. The master I have shown with Christian care watching over his slaves,
                  giving his whole life to their, service. In fact, I have proved him to be the
                  greater slave of the two; and proved also, that, whoever meddles with his property
                  deserves an ignominious death; and, moreover, that all the hatred against a
                  slave-owner springs from the fact that he can accumulate wealth easier and faster
                  than the man who hires his labor done." And he smiled, as if his triumph must go
                  before the world for all time.</p>
               <p>"But have you proved that the poor should be contented with their lot?" said
                  Buchanan. "That too much freedom in this country is what is doing all the
                  mischief? That such ignorant people should not be taught to aspire to liberty till
                  they could understand the Constitution?"</p>
               <p>Both the divine gentlemen assured him they had done so, and he seemed much
                  pleased. Soon after this they reverend doctors left us. Buchanan then said he
                  intended to have these sermons both published<pb n="54-55"

                   The President then assured me that he felt very much better and stronger
                  than he had for many weeks; and he told me that, since this was the day of the
                  reception, he had concluded to do nothing further about the message at present,
                  signifying that I might leave him. I told him I had important matters to relate to
                  him, bearing upon the condition of the country. "If you please," said I, "we will
                  sit awhile, and you shall hear something terrible." He looked anxiously at me, for
                  he was in a mood to be frightened, and I then related to him all I saw on the
                  previous evening; of the resolutions; the minute-men; the determination to seize
                  the whole Government; and then of our detection and final escape; and of the
                  attempt to poison Prescott and myself. When I finished, I saw he was deathly pale,
                  with large tear-drops in his eyes, and he remarked, "Alas! alas! 'tis done! I am
                  the last that will ever be President of these United States."<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_008" xml:id="return_008">†</ref>
                   He bowed his head on my shoulder and sobbed for a moment, then, raising
                  himself upward, continued: "When I came into office, it was reported that this
                  same party attempted to take my life by poisoning the National Hotel, in order
                  that the whole Government might come into the control of my friend Breckenridge. I
                  never believed it in full till now."</p>

                     place, which is to say, that I, the writer of this invaluable history,—am
                     obliged to shame the name of my country by stating that Buchanan's purpose
                     was carried out, and that every democratic paper in the country published
                     the two sermons referred to; many of them eulogizing the articles as the
                     ablest productions that ever came from man. Though I do it, it almost draws
                     forth tears of blood. So degenerate is my country. Almost as bad as the
                     British cramming opium down the heathen's throats with their swords' points,
                     and England's home Christians the while, blinded by national gain, lauding

               <p>"Then did Providence avert that fell calamity to this nation," said I, "and it now
                  remains, with these warnings before us, that we arm ourselves in time to prevent
                  the nation's overthrow."</p>
               <p>"No," said he, "no! No more arming. To arm against these men is but to give them
                  arms. Only one mode can avert the coming storm; we must concede to the slave
                  States their full and honest demands."</p>
               <p>This was the substance of all we said about the matter on this occasion, it being
                  high time for me to leave. Accordingly, without much form or ceremony, he having
                  told me that he should not mature the message until after the election, which was
                  to be in two days hence, I took my departure, carrying orders to the different
                  diplomatic corps about the reception and procession. I then hurried down to the
                  Jackson House, where we were to get positions in the Judge's carriage, as much for
                  the purpose of seeing Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins as for seeing the Prince and
                  Duke. What was my surprise in not finding Wadsworth or Prescott, though we had all
                  talked of going together. The Judge, with new gloves and hat, was promenading on
                  the verandah with Mrs. Edge, talking with more importance than I had ever seen him
                  before. The clerk winked at me, called me aside, and told me this story: "Do you
                  know," said he, "that old fool thinks he is engaged to Miss Edge? And that Miss
                  Edge thinks she is engaged to Prescott? I crammed her," he continued, "that
                  Prescott so understood it, and so did her father and mother." I told the clerk to
                  tell me all about it. "Very well," said he; "I found her in the parlor a little
                  while ago, and asked her when her marriage was to come off. She laughed, and
                  seemed a little surprised. Then, as I said before, I crammed her—told her all the
                  city was on tip-toe about it. She said it was strange, very strange, that she
                  should be engaged and not know it. 'Why,' said I, 'who ever heard tell of a
                  gentleman of high rank speaking plainer than he does? And you have yourself so
                  virtuously answered him, that all the city is alive with your praises.' 'Well,'
                  said she, 'that's not the way I like it, nor is it the way they do in
                  Philadelphia.' 'Why,' said I, 'do you know what Prescott's worth? He is worth half
                  a million.' 'And does he,' said she, 'really call this an engagement?' 'Of
                  course,' said I; 'did he not so express himself to you this morning?' 'Oh, no!'
                  said she; 'he said nothing of love. He talked only of the affairs of the country,
                  and he did so fervently portray the coming downfall, that I wept most bitterly. I
                  never heard such fluent words in all my life, and I was so charmed withal I
                  remember nothing he said. And then, when he went away, I almost sighed that he was
                  gone.' And then I told her that he told me he slept not a wink last night; that,
                  as oft as he began to doze, her own dear form appeared beside him, and he thought
                  the music of her voice came also. 'Now,' said Vickey, 'this is strange—very
                  strange indeed;' and, half weeping, she withdrew. In another moment Prescott came
                  in, and he spoke kindly to her, of the promise of a fair day. Then she said,
                  pleadingly and prettily, 'Did you tell the clerk you did not sleep last night for
                  those roguish thoughts?' 'I did,' said Prescott; 'and they rest seriously on my
                  heart'—for he thought she meant the affairs of state. Now, when he told her this,
                  the tears started afresh to her eyes, and she, smiling the while, went out,
                  saying, 'You need not speak so coldly.' Prescott knew not what to make of her
                  conduct, and so he asked me. I told him she was in love with Wadsworth, and that
                  her sympathies were perhaps inclined to consider that, if there is to be a
                  national conflict, he may suffer seriously. 'Does she love him?' said Prescott;
                  and I answered I feared so. Thus the matter stands," continued the clerk. "I have
                  made love for them all this morning, and may the graces forgive me for the lies I
                  told." I told the clerk, that if I were inclined to write the history of love and
                  war in Washington, I would hardly dare to tell the truth, lest the perfect
                  parallel of these eccentric affairs might make people call it a novel of the first
                  water. But I hope, I continued, that the Jackson House will not acquire too much
                  notoriety for making ill matches. Before I said more, he stretched himself upward,
                  looking through the window. "As I am a clerk, I do say!" said he, "if yonder does
                  not go the Professor and Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins. Say, I will follow them, to
                  learn the stand they make; you bring on the company. We shall see her prostrate
                  herself before England's king expectant." And sure enough, he started out and
                  after them. I at once started for the Judge, and found him in the out-hall,
                  standing face to face with Vickey. In one hand his hat, and in the other a huge
                  bouquet of flowers. He was bowing, saying, "As often as they perish, you see, I am
                  ready with another, fair accompaniments to the fair. Accept them, and in every
                  tinge of color, in all the mingled fragrance, and in these promising buds, behold
                  how sweet a thing is the passing moment, how kindly and tenderly must we cherish
                  that which from nature springs; for lo, a breath, a careless breath, may soil and
                  blemish it. Take them, though I do envy them their biding place."</p>
               <p>"Why, really, Judge," said she, "one would think you are in love, for the many
                  kind remembrances you give me. You almost make me dream of such things
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed, dearest!" said he. "I hope we understand each other, and that the
                  idle talk of common lovers may not find a place with us. We must conduct ourselves
                  in the true path of noble personages."</p>
               <p>"Oh, forgive me!" said she, taking the flowers. "I could not be idle-spoken to
                  you;" and she kissed him and ran away, but, ere she went far, she returned,
                  saying, "Now, Judge, I tell you, these flowers are beautiful, and I thank you
                  heartily. With these I shall indeed vie with the Prince's mother, Victoria! Oh,
                  would it not be an excellent joke, when the Prince passes, I toss these flowers to
                  him, with the inscription, From Victoria!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! but, dearest, they were culled for thee!"</p>
               <p>"But only for a joke, you know. You could easily replace them with others, and
                  then I should prize the second ones higher for having parted with these."</p>
               <p>"Really? Why, do you know that over each of these tiny blossoms I have in my
                  dreams seen you pondering to catch my lapsing thoughts, to dive to the mysteries
                  and richness of my heart? And would you toss them away so thoughtlessly?"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, no—I would not; I will keep them as happy memories;" and she kissed
                  at the flowers, and playfully ran off.</p>
               <p>"Oh, what a treasure she is!" said Judge Francis. "For fifty years I have not
                  known what it was to live. On, on in my grovelling way for half a century,
                  ignorant of the joys of love till the spark is turned to a flame by a rosy,
                  romping girl of seventeen. Glory be to the heavens, to the stars, to the moon, the
                  fates, cupids, and all the blunderbusses of the spiritual fire, to think that the
                  little spark in my breast lived so long without anything to feed upon! But oh,
                  what a rapid growth it has! First it quickeneth the breath when its idol speaks;
                  then it fluttereth the heart, and hot burnings come to the cheek; then to the
                  extreme parts of the person it finds way, and chords in full time all the elements
                  of the thing man, till his aged limbs are quick, his mind vigorous to overflowing,
                  and needs must vent itself in squibs of poetry, and a plentiful vent of flowery
                  romances."</p>
               <p>Now, when I saw Vickey was gone, I came up behind the Judge, even while he was
                  speaking, and I told him he seemed to be discoursing on love.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" said he, "I was just speaking of the growth of this country. What a
                  rapid growth it has had! But, sir, I fear me 'tis near an end now."</p>
               <pb n="56-57 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6417-00000029"/>
               <p>Just then the clerk came running in, and told us to start at once, or the
                  procession would be over before we could arrive. So, accordingly, we were soon
                  ready for the Judge's carriage, but neither Wadsworth nor Prescott came. Mr. and
                  Mrs. Edge, Vickey, the Judge, and myself, were all. When we were out on the walk
                  waiting, I drew near to Ann, and, as a faithful recorder of events, I will write
                  down what passed between us, that the world may judge accordingly. She looked at
                  me roguishly, and, smiling, said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jenkins, you come too near me—entirely too near!"</p>
               <p>"Too near for what?" said I. "Cannot you breathe?"</p>
               <p>"Don't talk to me; my head aches," said she. But I replied that, to talk was to
                  divert; that diversion was good for headache. That, therefore, I must talk to cure
                  her.</p>
               <p>"No, I will not have it cured; I love headache," said she. "'Tis good company when
                  I am melancholy. I wish I had a Prince for a beau, then I would give him headache.
                  You taught me; you aim at the heart, and that makes headache. Now, I pray you, do
                  not stand so near me; people will think I am fond of you. But I have no heart for
                  anything but a Prince. You tease me because you happen so much in my company.
                  Woful circumstance!"</p>
               <p>Then I told her, if she was not affecting all this, she could herself step a
                  little back, because she stood as near me as I did to her.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I would not humor you so much," said she, pettishly, "as to step back at
                  your command. I might cherish your regard too much. Anger shall be my study, and
                  you shall nurture it with your presence." Then on the toe of her little shoe she
                  dotted with her parasol, the while smiling beneath the auburn curls that swung
                  round her down-turned face. For the life of me I could say no more, for the
                  rapidity of my thoughts kept my tongue still. "Oh, but this shoe hurts my foot!"
                  said she. "Do you know, Mr. Jenkins, I want to have a game of cards to-night. You
                  shall be my partner, and teach me how to cheat. You shall teach me how to sit
                  silent, so as to hide my hand. When you play hearts, I'll play spades to bury it
                  with."</p>
               <p>But before she got further with her run on me, the carriage was drawn up before us
                  and we all got in and started. By this time the streets were filled with people,
                  and we were with some difficulty conveyed down to the open lot opposite the old
                  Methodist church—the very spot, too, chosen by Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins and
                  her husband, Professor Jackson. The former was dressed better than I had ever seen
                  her, but the latter, the real picture of a downcast man, with his long, faded
                  beard and uncombed hair, his clothes rather seedy, struck our attention most. Only
                  a few days married, and yet he was going all to wreck. But no wonder, when we
                  remember what a wife he had. But on this occasion we had no time for philosophy. A
                  loud huzza up the street told us the Prince of Wales and Duke of Newcastle were
                  coming. They had to pass through this square to the street below ere they could
                  take carriages to the Mansion, and of course the crowd was immense. Pretty soon a
                  gang of police opened the way, and the veritable heir-apparent to the throne of
                  Great Britain appeared before us. Quickly now Mrs. Lucy sprang in before a young
                  little man whom she took to be the Prince, but who was really only a servant. She
                  pretended to stumble, and did fall at his feet, crying out, "Save me! save me!" In
                  a little while the young man caught hold of her, and in a blundering manner helped
                  her up. All was excitement; the police rushed to the spot to see that the Prince
                  should not be overcome with joyous greetings. Mrs. Lucy shouted at the top of her
                  shrill voice, right in the face of the chap that helped her up, "Which is the
                  Prince? which is the Prince? You are so young, sir, and so noble in your bearing,
                  you make me bold of speech. Pray you, sir, which is the Prince?" And the chap
                  hesitated, and said, "Why, madam, see, you are in the way!" But she continued
                  right on, "I know he's a thing divine, with huge horns, a donkey's head, and rich
                  robes round his body. Quick, boy! which is the Prince? I'll win a smile, a
                  princely smile, a special legacy to outboast other women with." Again he was
                  trying to say something, but she heeded not. "No, sir, I am not insensible to my
                  assumed satire; your own nobleness has a voice to speak without words. I
                  congratulate you, sir, on your exalted prospects. Here, sir, keep most sacred
                  this, the parting kiss, bestowed by woman, independent woman. In this great
                  republic women are beginning to speak; they are rising above the slave-bound women
                  of your old, worn-out monarchism. Again I kiss your hand, that you may boast that
                  this was done by one whose fame shall reach round the world, even Mrs. Lucy
                  Tabiatha Stimpkins."</p>

                  <figure>
                     <head>"Does not my beauty elicit your protection?"</head>

               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6417-00000030"/>
               <p>"Stand back there, woman!" shouted the police. "Make way for the Prince!" and in
                  another moment the Prince and suite were past. Mrs. Lucy was pushed aside,
                  beholding what a fall hers had been; for the police shouted to her, even while she
                  kissed his hands, "That's not the Prince! Let that servant go!" And the servant,
                  too, tore his hand away from her, and gave her a severe push out of the way. As
                  soon as she had extricated herself a little, she said, "O insult profane! What
                  lack of gallantry do men possess! Calls not the modesty of my poor sex for a hand
                  to shield me? O Effeminacy, die! Genial, helpless, modest woman, die! Rude man
                  plants his stern muscle on us, and we are dashed about as beasts. Professor
                  Jackson, how dare you!"</p>
               <p>"Why, madam, I have done nothing!"</p>
               <p>"I know that, to my sorrow," said she. "Why did you not point out to me which was
                  the real Prince? What is the Prince, that I should not go to him and speak as I
                  would to any one else? Was I not created by the same God? Do I not live on the
                  same planet? But you, Professor—you have been the stumbling-block to the whole
                  affair. I never heard that in our new philosophy the husband was to desert the
                  wife in the hour of danger." He endeavored to excuse himself, by saying that the
                  police kept clearing the track, but she told him she would not yield the point;
                  that, had Jackson stood his ground, the adventure had been a decided success. "But
                  I care not," she added; "the chap I spoke to heard my speech, and I am sure it is
                  as much as he can digest at one time. Of course, he is a servant of the Prince's
                  suite, and he will carry it all back to England, where, in due time, he will
                  discharge it to the utter amazement of English women, who have not yet awakened to
                  their just rights."</p>
               <p>We heard no more; the procession was past; the crowd was flying on before, and we
                  ourselves had wheeled round, making way for the President's mansion. Of course, we
                  had not been idle spectators of all that had just passed before us. We had laughed
                  ourselves tired; we had seen the plain, unassuming Prince; too young, of course,
                  to show much signs of promise; and we had seen how he had been seen by American
                  citizens. Yet some darker visions passed before us. One young lady, who, we knew,
                  once hoed corn in the fields, but who was now rich through the prosperous avenues
                  of a republican government, sighed as the Prince passed, "Oh, I wish we had a
                  privileged aristocracy here!" By her side stood a rude Scotch woman, who retorted,
                  "And if we had, your nose would be still at the grind-stone instead of here. You
                  know not, young woman, what you sigh for." Then there were plain farmers standing
                  near; and they said, "Is it possible the British people wear the yoke of such a
                  boyish royalty?" Again another retorted, "And why not? They love such a yoke, for
                  it is light, and gives them rest from the muddle of politicians." But now that the
                  procession was over, all were merry, and scampering off in their several
                  directions. Just as we rounded the corner below the church, I heard some one
                  calling, and, on turning to look, saw Prescott. He was beckoning for us to stop,
                  which we did, and he came running up. Tears were flowing down his cheeks, and so
                  hurried was his speech, and withal stuttering, I could hardly tell-what he wanted.
                  But he told me for God's sake to excuse myself from the company, and follow him.
                  Ann, who had been till now exceedingly merry, was frightened, and so were Vickey
                  and Mrs. Edge; but Judge Francis asked for some explanation. "Excuse me," said
                  Prescott, "this is neither time nor place for me to explain myself. In due time
                  you shall know all."</p>
               <p>I at once dismounted, and followed him, ever remembering the lingering look of
                  gentle Ann. When we reached the avenue, only a few paces, in fact, from where I
                  joined him, he stopped short, saying,</p>
               <p>"My cousin, James Odell, is killed—murdered at the Planters' Club Rooms."</p>
               <p>"What!" said I, "is it possible?" and he assured me that it was even so; that he
                  had just come from viewing his mangled corpse, and that the inquest was about to
                  take place, urging me to go with him. "They mistrusted," said he, the tears
                  coursing down his cheeks, "it was he who played eaves-dropper at the Capitol. He
                  has been killed instead of me."</p>
               <p>No doubt it was so, for the two were alike—as nearly alike as possible. He had
                  been inveigled into a quarrel, and then stabbed. We took a carriage and hastened
                  to the spot called the Planters' Club Rooms, in front of which was already
                  assembled a large crowd of people. In a few moments we were in the presence of the
                  corpse—apparently a young man twenty-five years of age. He was stretched on the
                  floor, a pitiful and horrid sight, except his face, which had all the innocence
                  and beauty of American youth. The coroner's court was already in session. The
                  examination of the body had just been commenced. First the pockets were examined,
                  and in them was found three thousand dollars. What a comment was this! Americans
                  kill Americans, but not for money. Not in all the city was an American who would
                  have rifled these pockets. Oh, most wrongly-imputed money-making nation, what a
                  libel is this on the robbers of foreign lands! And yet, oh, what a boast if in one
                  fell moment man crosses the sacred threshold of public opinion to meet with
                  instant death. But hear ye, ye electors of judges, what a power party has!</p>
               <p>Now, when the evidence was rendered, the verdict of the jury was given in these
                  words, to wit:</p>
               <p>"That James Odell came to his death by stabs inflicted on his person by sundry
                  gentlemen of the club of which he was a member. The jury further declare that the
                  said James Odell used these words:</p>
               <p>"The Southern fire-eaters are bringing mischief on the country, and if I had the
                  power I would hang every one of them;' which words we deem so offensive, that he
                  met the death he deserved."</p>
               <p>This was indeed as shocking as the mock trial of Brooks for his attempt to murder
                  Sumner. It was no law at all, no protection to life, and why not? Because the
                  coroner's jury looked through their party spectacles. What chance had Prescott and
                  I, if we should in any way betray what we knew of the secret meetings of the
                  seceders?</p>
               <p>As fortune would have it, however, this meeting had brought out Iverson and
                  Wigfall. Even while the foregoing scene was being enacted, I overheard the former
                  say to the latter, that if he would come to his house at nine o'clock that night,
                  he would take him——</p>
               <p>Further than this I heard not, but supposed it to be the secret meeting of the
                  seceders. At the time, however, I heeded it little, having the sight of the
                  unfortunate victim before us. The coroner took charge of the valuables, and
                  ordered the corpse to be buried properly, and then the crowd dispersed. While on
                  this subject I will state, that on the following day Prescott and I alone followed
                  the remains, which were conveyed by the grave-diggers to the final resting-place.
                  But yet, though his death was horrid, and our grief without remedy, similar scenes
                  were already begun all over the Southern States. Every paper teemed with notices
                  of men being shot or stabbed on the spot, for expressing their sentiments in the
                  South. Vigilance committees and minute-men had sprung into existence in a day, and
                  were already visiting death on every one opposed to Southern sentiments.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>ON our way back from the funeral, and when near the railroad station, we saw my
                  friend Wadsworth, who came out to meet us. On his observing our melancholy
                  appearance, we told him of the murder done. "Ah, indeed," said he, "this was a
                  horrid deed. And yet me seems to feel this is but the beginning of a reign of
                  horrors greater than were ever known, Oh, that the people North and South knew
                  each other! Oh, that politicians were blotted from this fair land! Oh, that the
                  South knew the North would not harm their slavery! Oh, that the North knew the
                  slaves were content! But, sirs, blindness, madness rules. They have ears, but hear
                  not; eyes, but see not." So saying, he took my arm and walked into the station,
                  pointing to thirty or forty boxes of goods. "See here," said he, "this is my
                  winter's supply for my slaves. Think you they will rebel against me in order to
                  get their freedom? Here are boxes of hats and bonnets; boxes of excellent cloth,
                  for coats and trousers; and here is one of satin and silk, to adorn them with when
                  going to church, or perhaps to the dance, or may-be to play their pranks with
                  Cupid's bower. Why, sir, should you behold the greeting they give me, and should
                  you know their own love of dependence instead of independence, you would say, Man
                  is foolish to grieve about such oppression. But the vainest and simplest
                  philosophy ever broached by any politician is this mooted secession. Under the
                  General Government we are protected in our slaves; but if the South secedes and
                  forms a separate government, it will never be protected by the North. It is
                  throwing off protection, and making an enemy on the border. As for<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000031"/> the grasp at the western Territories, it is the
                  fable again of the dog crossing the river with a mouthful of meat; he saw the
                  shadow, and dropped the real to catch that which was nothing."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," said Prescott, "you speak with great judgment. I would that your
                  wisdom were common amongst Southern gentlemen." And when he said this, he extended
                  his hand as a friendly greeting.</p>
               <p>Now when they had shaken hands, Wadsworth said, looking at Prescott, "I see you
                  wear a ring of an exalted degree."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I found this," said Prescott; "it was in the hall of the hotel where I live.
                  I supposed it was of little value, and belonged to some of the servants; but on
                  inquiry, I found such was not the case." He then took it off his finger and handed
                  it to us, that we might examine it. It was an exceedingly old ring, with sets of
                  precious stones to form an eye, and had many signs engraved on it.</p>
               <p>"That ring can be traced to the place whence it came," said Wadsworth, and then I
                  too remarked that I could read the meaning of all the characters.</p>
               <p>"Then," said Prescott, "take the ring, for it is nothing to me; perhaps through
                  these mysterious characters you may restore it to its owner."</p>
               <p>I then told them both that I believed Madame Ponchard or Orsini had dropped it the
                  night before; and if it had been either of them, I doubted whether they came to it
                  by fair means. Wadsworth then took it, saying that he would undertake to unravel
                  the mystery; that, small and insignificant as it was, this ring had once come from
                  persons of more than ordinary standing among men.</p>
               <p>Soon after this we parted, each taking some separate course, and all under promise
                  to meet at night at the Jackson House. This promise I, however, made with a mental
                  reservation, secret in my own breast. I resolved at once I would meet with the
                  secessionists even at the peril of my life. I must say, however, as I left
                  Prescott and saw him turning up toward the observatory, I really felt as if it
                  were doubtful whether we should ever meet again. That we were known to be the
                  persons who entered the college on the previous evening, and that the leading
                  secessionists had determined to kill us or hire our killing, we had no doubt. All
                  they wanted was an opportunity, some sort of pretext; and these were just what we
                  wanted to avoid. For my own part, I resolved to be somebody else, to play a deep
                  disguise. But what should I assume? Whom should I personate? Of course some
                  foreigner. I had it; I would be the correspondent—Clarkson—of the London
                     <title>Times.</title> This thought I matured at once, and, to complete my
                  arrangement, went to an old acquaintance and purchased a fine pair of horses and a
                  carriage. Next I got a servant and dressed him in livery, from Steinberg's
                  clothing store. By the time I had this all completed it was near night, and I
                  hastened to make my entree into Washington effectual, by going out of it first.
                  Accordingly, I drove up to Georgetown, and telegraphed to the Jackson House that
                  I, James Clarkson, would be there with my carriage and pair by eight or nine at
                  night, with letters to his excellency, the President; and a letter to Yancey also,
                  asking the proprietor to be good enough to send word to the latter to meet me on
                  my arrival. I then, while in Georgetown, forged a letter from Sir Edward Boyton to
                  Yancey, for I had known Boyton's son, who had been on a year ago to visit some of
                  his friends in America, and who had also passed a short time with Yancey. Thus
                  equipped, and armed in every pocket, I once more set out for the Jackson House,
                  where I arrived exactly at nine at night. Sure enough, Yancey was on hand, and
                  came and very cordially assisted me out of my carriage. My livery servant being
                  too Dutch to tell anything he knew, accompanied the horses to the stable. But who
                  should accompany Yancey to receive me, but Floyd, the man I hated most, and most
                  wished to avoid. Yet I was well disguised. Instead of light sandy hair, I now had
                  jet black; my whiskers were shaved all off, save a bunch on each cheek, English
                  fashion; and my nose I had stained to a cherry red.</p>
               <p>I shall never forget how kindly Yancey and Floyd took me by the hand, and with
                  what fervency they welcomed me to the Capital of the United States. They told me I
                  should have put up at Willard's, in order to see the real hotel system of America;
                  that they feared I should not be as comfortable at the Jackson House as one of my
                  exalted position should be. I assured them, however, that I had friends coming in
                  a few days, and that I was desirous of being with them. I told them also that the
                  exorbitant prices of Willard's made me refrain from so great an indulgence.</p>
               <p>"That's just like you English!" said Floyd. "You are so very economical. Why, do
                  you know, in this country every one of us must have the very best, even if we
                  become bankrupt next day."</p>
               <p>"But, sir," said I, speaking slowly and with some impediment, like a member of the
                  British Parliament, "but, sir, you-a must consider-a that in Hingland we 'ave-a
                  less-a hopportunity to replace-a-a a fortune when we-a 'ave been so 'eedless to
                  'ave spent it so thoughtlessly-a." Now, when they saw how beautifully I got
                  heedless and thoughtlessly in so close proximity, they were in ecstacies to know
                  if I were not a member of Parliament. I assured them I was not, but that I had
                  often been there. Our conversation was, however, soon terminated; the clerk
                  touched my arm, and signified that I might go to my rooms, and I invited the
                  others to accompany me. Accordingly, after I had given strict orders, English
                  fashion, that my horses must have all the attention and care, and that anything
                  would do for myself, we all marched up to my beautifully ventilated apartments. I
                  then told them, in the same parliamentary drag of unmeaningly-connected words,
                  that they could not suppose any ordinary matter would bring me to this country;
                  that I was almost prepared to tell them about the contemplated dissolution of the
                  republic, and of the projected establishment of a constricted republic on the
                  ruins; that it had always been a thing of pity, for the English to behold the
                  lawless character of the American Government; that it was the most inexplicable of
                  all things, to think that in a country great as this, there were no men of energy
                  and talent to seize the helm of state and wrench it from the vulgar mob.</p>
               <p>Now, during all this time I had been frequently touching my nose with my
                  handkerchief, and what was my horror on seeing the red paint in spots all over it.
                  Could it be my nose was turning Yankee? Would these rascals discover me? I kept on
                  the shady side of the gas. Yancey was astonished how much I knew of the project of
                  secession. I told him there were any number of ways the British Government had of
                  finding out things abroad. First, it sends out spies; then, correspondents; then,
                  gas-blowers; then, bullets. "And I am on the second list," said I, "for this new
                  adventure." When I said this, Floyd swore. All my prognostications were true, he
                  said. "This country is about to change its form of government to a limited
                  republic; but here will be no pickings for the British Government. We are now the
                  sick old man; but let France and Britain join on us, and you shall see——" Then
                  came a furious oath. And even with more fierceness did Yancey speak out. They
                  apologized to me, but warned Britain. Though, when I disclaimed any desire of the
                  British Government to seize this country, or any part of it, and, with some
                  authority, added, "Great Britain only speaks in the cause of humanity." "That's a
                  hit at slavery," said Floyd. "All the Abolition emissaries of the North were
                  taught by Britons."</p>
               <p>I told him he was sadly mistaken; that the British Government recognized the
                  theory, that there must be in all countries hewers of wood and carriers of water;
                  and that we, the English people, would sooner to-day see this Government with
                  slavery for its corner-stone, than to see it emanate from a common mob. "This is,"
                  said I, "one of the chief things for which I am here to inform you, though
                  unofficially. And you may rest assured that it is the doctrine we will ever
                  maintain—first the Government, then the people."</p>
               <p>"And those are my sentiments too," said Yancey. "We have tried universal suffrage;
                  now we shall have it limited."</p>
               <p>I then asked him in what way this great desideratum was to be accomplished; and he
                  told me, if I would have the patience to wait a few minutes, he would take me to a
                  meeting of some of the prominent leaders, where I could hear and judge
                  accordingly. And that he would be pleased to have me state before the meeting the
                  probable position the British Government would assume during the troubles which
                  must necessarily result during the important change. Next he ordered some
                  sparkling Catawba, and we sat and drank to each other for a good while; and I,
                  meantime, wishing. I had Judge Francis here, to tell us a story of his youthful
                  days.</p>
               <p>At a quarter past ten we left, arm in arm, they having previously cautioned me to
                  be silent during our walk. Down the avenue; up L to Monroe Lane, and along the
                  lane—it should be called alley—till we came to No. 76, a dingy sort of high-stoop
                  frame house, where all was darkness. I was satisfied now, if I were detected, I
                  would be killed, and that no one would ever know it; and some fear began to creep
                  over me. Yancey touched the door, and some one inside opened it, when we walked
                  in. All was dark.</p>
               <p>"What are your names?" demanded the man in the dark. Yancey told him for us all.
                  The man dashed a lamp in full glare in our faces, saying, "Pass on." And we did
                  pass. The house was an unoccupied one, unfurnished, and everything we touched or
                  did seemed to make<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6417-00000032"/> a great noise. A dim
                  light came down from above after we got further in, and we found and went up a
                  long pair of stairs, at the head of which stood a sentinel and Orsini, both with
                  swords drawn. My friends vouched for me, and we entered, having left our hats and
                  walking-sticks with the sentinel. In another moment I remembered my name, Jenkins,
                  was engraved on the gold mounting, but I was already in the hall, and knew not
                  what to do. Half turning my head, I saw the rascal looking at my cane, and I
                  feared he would call me to account. But he was interrupted by some one else coming
                  in, though he kept the cane in his hand. At the other end of the room—if, indeed,
                  a whole floor can be called a room—were Toombs, Mason, Cobb, Rhett, and Davis. As
                  soon as we came up, I was introduced as Clarkson, of the London
                     <title>Times,</title> and greeted warmly and pleasantly. Rhett asked Floyd if
                  he had any good news to report to-night. "I have," said Floyd. "I have this day
                  sent fifty thousand muskets to the armory in Charleston; also sent a good
                  assortment of munitions of war. But that is not the best of it; I have appointed
                  the Governor of your State to look after it." This was followed by a laugh. In
                  another moment I saw the sentinel approaching, bearing my walking-stick with him.
                  "Are you certain you know this gentlemen?" said he, pointing to me. Yancey and
                  Floyd said they were positive. "Orsini says he is a painted man, and Orsini knows
                  paint. Here is Jenkins' cane!" "Ah!" shouted—or hissed rather—every one present.
                  "Gentlemen," said I, "I-a cannot receive-a this pleasantly. Is this the way-a
                  statesmen-a build up new States-a? If you ave-a any doubt, gentlemen-a, of my
                  respectability, I will-a assure you I will do anything 'onorable to convince you-a
                  your doubts-a can be removed-a." This, being a rather parliamentary-constructed
                  sentence, won over to me several voices from the members. But Floyd and Yancey
                  both spoke out, saying they themselves doubted me. Toombs said, "Demand any
                  letters he may have about him. See if they are to Clarkson, and if post-marked
                  England."</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said I, "I have no letters with me. I hope you will not make it
                  unpleasant for me to remain with you."</p>
               <p>"Do you know, sir," said Floyd, "I think you are a spy? Show us some proof!"</p>
               <p>"I have nothing with me."</p>
               <p>"Whence came this cane?"</p>
               <p>"I got it at the tavern; I don't know whose it is."</p>
               <p>"Then let us examine your face, to see if it is painted."</p>
               <p>"I cannot allow this, gentlemen. You brought me. If I am not welcome, take me home
                  again."</p>
               <p>"No, sir; not out of this house, till we know who you are," said Floyd.</p>
               <p>They then came upon me, and I treated them with backing toward the door,
                  continually complaining of this indignity to a British subject. In the meantime I
                  had taken my cane to look at it, but with the full determination to use it, and
                  also the revolver and knife, if attacked. The meeting was now nothing more than a
                  row, some for and some against me. Floyd had me by the sleeve; Orsini was at my
                  back with his uplifted sword. I wheeled round, and knocked the sword from his
                  hand. With one bound I went down the stairs, but lost my footing and fell. For a
                  moment all was darkness and despair, made terrible by a wild scream from a female
                  by my side. I was in the cellar; fell through a hatchway, bruised my hand, and was
                  almost unconscious of how badly I was injured. The female passed aside, and darted
                  out through a cellar door into the lane above. I followed, not knowing how soon my
                  pursuers would be upon me. But the sounds of the voices and the running party
                  convinced me they had mistaken my whereabouts, and were pursuing me down the
                  stairway. A few minutes sufficed, however, to show me I had made my escape
                  successful. The next great mystery was, who was this thief of a creature hid in
                  the cellar? Of course, her way of escape had been matured, and if I followed her I
                  too was safe. She ran faster than I had ever seen a woman run before, and I ran
                  nearly as fast as ever did man. Her course was down the lane, across the avenue,
                  and to the grounds of the Smith-sonian Institute. Curiosity led me to follow so
                  strange a woman, if for nothing more than to assure her I meant no harm. As soon
                  as she was about fifty rods ahead, she slackened her pace, ever and anon looking
                  back to see if I followed. On several occasions she dodged a corner to escape me,
                  but I always found her course, and pursued. When she entered the Smith-sonian
                  grounds, going even toward the Institute, I saw she slackened her pace still more,
                  as if waiting to be captured. I walked briskly till near her, and then slower. It
                  was nearly a full moon, and I saw, even before I approached her, she was at least
                  no beggar, or person of scanty cloth. Finally she halted and faced about, waiting
                  for me, and in another minute I was face to face with her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I beseech you," she said, "if you can imagine a woman's fears, you will
                  pity me, and treat me kindly." She burst out crying as if her heart was broken.
                  "Oh, in God's name, sir, let me go! If there is anything sacred in the name of
                  mother or sister, oh, I pray you, grant it unto me! I am yet a child, and my fears
                  will drive me to death."</p>
               <p>All this she said while she was sobbing, and before I was within a half a dozen
                  paces. So, when I halted, I assured her, over and over, that I was no enemy; that
                  I would, on the contrary, be her friend, if it were possible for me to do any good
                  act for her.</p>
               <p>"Then are you not an officer?" she said, endeavoring to quiet herself a little, at
                  the same time tossing back her velvet robe, and disclosing to my view her other
                  attire, which seemed of the richest quality. A hood she lifted back, and waving
                  ringlets of light auburn played on her snow-white neck. She was pretty; she was
                  bewitching, even while she stood weeping and nearly overcome with fear. I assured
                  her I was no officer; and then I told her about being at a meeting with some
                  friends in the old house, and about falling through the hatchway. And then I
                  assured her that mere curiosity had induced me to follow her, because it seemed so
                  strange for a lady to escape from such a miserable, deserted house. Now, when she
                  saw I was so frank, she replied, saying, "Your words, sir, have done much to
                  assuage my fears. I would that you knew me as I know myself, or as Heaven knows
                  me; you would lend some assurance to my heart-pangs, which it seems can never
                  heal. Oh, pity me! pity me!"</p>
               <p>Said I, "Sentiments like these, madam, cannot emanate but from one deserving
                  honorable pity. If you will be kind enough to relate to me what misfortunate
                  circumstance has crossed the path of one so little able to battle with stern
                  realities, and also to tell me what I can do to extricate you from your perils,
                  you will, I do assure you, find in me a reliable friend."</p>
               <p>"I am indeed much pleased with your proffered assistance," she said, becoming
                  calm, and deeply interested in eyeing me from head to foot. "But were I to tell
                  you of the misfortunate circumstances that have crossed my path, you would
                  yourself, man as you are, feel that fate had forever closed the portals of justice
                  to me. My life has not been a happy one; and, were it day, you could see in my
                  young face such furrows as would tell a sadder tale than words ever painted. Now,
                  sir, I pray you, if you will befriend a helpless, virtuous girl, please leave me.
                  I would retire to the place whence I came; and I must so proceed, that no one will
                  suspect or molest me."</p>
               <p>Said I, "My lady, you do impose a burden on me. How can I leave? This would be the
                  greatest burden of my life, to leave you thus sorrow-stricken, with the thought of
                  your probable woes ever haunting me. Can I nothing do that will give you a ray of
                  happiness? Must I myself forever remain ignorant of the mystery that surrounds
                  you?"</p>
               <p>She then folded her handkerchief, and sobbed for many minutes. I knew not what to
                  do or to say; but after I lingered awhile, I turned to go away, remarking that, if
                  my presence was not pleasant, I would most unhappily take my leave of one whose
                  strangeness would ever be constant in memory. But when I started, she said, "Stay
                  awhile; I will be calm in a moment." Then she snuffled a little, and cleared
                  herself, and put on some dignity. "'Tis well, sir," she said, "that a stranger
                  approaches me thus, and that I behave as if I were ignorant of myself. You mistake
                  me for some idle heroine, who has, for a love-sick fever, imposed some hazard on
                  her future prospects. Such is not my case, neither do I feel at liberty to tell my
                  grievance without first knowing to whom I speak. For the telling of my woful
                  prospects may bring greater ones on me. Yet I need a friend. Oh, sir, I do need a
                  friend! So long I have prayed God to send me a friend!"</p>
               <p>Her dignity again broke down, and she sobbed as before. As soon as she quieted a
                  little, I said, "Madam, I do assure you, if it be possible for me to prove myself
                  that prayed-for friend, you need but give your commands, and I will obey them.
                  Nay, so much I am convinced of your virtue and nobleness, you can impose whatever
                  you will, and I will obey you. Take courage, madam; for, as Heaven witnesses, I
                  will be true."</p>
               <p>"Take heed what you swear, man, for there are things you know not of. Would you,
                  sir, to a strange woman—if indeed I am at the age of womanhood—swear to forswear
                  your country's laws?"</p>
               <p>"Almost you put me to the test," said I. "Whatever law could interdict your
                  seeming nobleness, seems not law, but violence."</p>
               <p>"A friend stands above all things, save Him who formed us. If you cannot be so to
                  me, you are not the meet of my long,<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6417-00000033"/> long
                  prayers. Go, sir; I pray you, leave me!"</p>
               <p>"No, madam. Now I swear before God I will ever stand at your command."</p>
               <p>"Uplift your hand and speak to Him!" she said, as calmly as ever woman speak; and
                  I held up my hand, and said, "God witness!" And then she came to me, took my hand,
                  and, pointing upward, she said, "O Lord my God, receive my humble thanks, that
                  Thou hast sent to Thy heart-broken child a true friend. Aid me, O God, to maintain
                  my trials, and bless this great, good man!" She turned to me then, and added,
                  "Sir, however fair you behold me, and with what freedom of speech you may see I
                  address you, know that I am called a slave; called a negress; called a fugitive,
                  flying from my owner. Five hundred dollars are offered for my capture, and I am
                  sought for by many. Now, my friend, I have but to tell the horrors in store for
                  me, and you will carry me safe to Canada; for I know you would not see one so
                  young and helpless as I am doomed to the fate hovering over me."</p>
               <p>I was so astounded I scarcely knew if I were not in a dream; for I gazed full in
                  that snow-white face. Her eyes were large and blue; her lips thin, and a pretty
                  dimple rested in each cheek and on her chin. Her hair was pale auburn, and nearly
                  straight; her person full and round, but she was tall and of upright form. I never
                  heard a sweeter voice, and her hand was so small and soft to the touch——She could
                  not be a slave! To-morrow a constable may say to me, "Come, sir, help capture my
                  slave, and carry her back, or you, sir, shall to prison for refusing." This
                  noble-spoken girl, who hath all the centres fine of genial worth, and outer form
                  of all, that hath each her several parts compounded into that one excellent being,
                  woman—a slave! Why droops my soul, that but a moment since would have challenged
                  the world in her behalf? A pristine love a moment since, and, Heaven witness, so
                  soon shocked and dead! Even while the same eloquent beauty clings so prayerfully
                  by my side. Away, away, ye cavilling, doubting, carrolers of my peace! She is a
                  woman, fair and virtuous! I will, will be true!</p>
               <p>All this passed through my mind quicker than I can tell it; so that, when she
                  ceased speaking but for a moment, I told her she could rely upon me; that I would
                  provide her safety out of the country. Moreover, that I would make myself a
                  special guardian over her until she was comfortably situated. She pressed my hand
                  fervently, the tears fast rolling down her cheeks as she gazed piteously up into
                  my face. It could not be, I thought, from her resemblance to Ann Underhill, that I
                  loved her also; yet, if outward form and a gifted speech show off the heart and
                  mind, why not some noble worth in this poor slave?</p>
               <p>"Now tell me," said I, after she had again thanked me for my many promises, "tell
                  me of the misfortunes you have endured, and how you came to this unhappy
                  pass."</p>
               <p>"Not yet," said she, "for even now may I be pounced upon and captured. Let us away
                  to some secure place, and I will then tell you all about it, and who I am and
                  whence I came."</p>
               <p>"Then," said I, "'tis well we take the train for Canada even now."</p>
               <p>"No," she said; "I have a half-sister who will be here to-morrow night. She is out
                  of money. I must wait till she comes. Let me go now to my room in the deserted
                  house, and, if you like, you can call to-morrow, and I will tell you the story of
                  my life."</p>
               <p>But I urged her to go to a hotel. She said they had her carte-de-visite at all of
                  them; that she should surely be captured. I then asked her if she were not afraid
                  to go back to that house. "No," she said, "no; I trust in God! See how He has
                  blessed me!" Again she pressed my hand, adding, "Go, now, go, though it breaks my
                  heart; still I have more joy this night than ever before came to poor woman. Say
                  you call to-morrow?" I told her I would, and she said, "God bless you!" She took
                  my arm, and we walked together till we arrived at the intersection of the lane on
                  Pennsylvania Avenue. "To-morrow, at twelve," said I, as we were parting, and she
                  again wept, saying, "God bless you!" And in a moment more she disappeared up the
                  dark lane, and I went home.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>BEING PART OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HISTORY EVER PENNED; WHEREIN IS SHOWN THAT,
                     WHEN THE VOTES OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WERE COUNTED, THE AMERICAN COLORS, RED,
                     WHITE, AND BLUE, APPEARED ON THE NOONDAY SUN.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the election of Lincoln had been known for a good while, still the
                  counting of the votes of the electoral college had not taken place, and a vain
                  hope was still entertained by some Southerners that some Northern electors might
                  prove false, and yet elect some other President. This was the most doubtful period
                  of the nation's history. The rumor was spread, too, that Scott was wavering, and
                  might join the seceders; in fact, in all the length and breadth of the land there
                  was no public champion for the Union. The hearts of millions were praying that God
                  might give them a leader for the cause of national glory and justice, but all was
                  sullen silence, save the clamoring of the destroyers of liberty. They had it all
                  their own way. Now the electoral votes were to be counted, the die cast, the fall
                  begun. Accordingly, this day was a memorable one. All the leaders of disorder were
                  concentrated in the Capitol, and countless curious spectators filled its every
                  avenue. It was about eleven o'clock when we started. I had for my companion Miss
                  Underhill, while Judge Francis had Mr., Mrs., and Miss Edge. I knew we were all
                  well attired, but the scenes around made it seem as if it were all a dream. I had
                  never seen the streets so crowded. The air was fresh and pleasant, and the leafy
                  trees of the Capitol grounds never looked so splendid. The reveille sounded afar
                  off. They were Scott's troops. I saw a few galloping horsemen. I knew America had
                  few troops, and feared this was the beginning of a mighty revolution. Everybody
                  was full of emotion. Some men, old and feeble, I saw in tears. When we passed the
                  gates one man said, "I fear the great republic is no more." Another, drooping,
                  said, "Oh, that I had died ere this unhappy period!" The bells were ringing, or
                  rather tolling, in parts of the city, adding more gloom to the awful affairs of
                  state. Anon hurried past us the votaries of secession, with muffled-up cloaks a
                  few, and many in rich but scanty attire; and the heinous laugh and grin of demons
                  rested in complacent triumph in their beautiful faces; for, though devils all,
                  they were Americans. It was the saddest day I ever saw, and every one else, save
                  the secessionists, seemed as if throwing the awful burden of their souls at the
                  portals of Heaven. Not a breath of air stirred; no leaf had motion. When we
                  arrived at the steps of the Capitol, near the lower fount, we faced about to see
                  the vast assemblage. Ourselves saying little, for so solemn was the hour—as if a
                  nation was at prayer; as if Liberty was in the throes of death; as if the voice of
                  twenty millions were in communion at the throne of Almighty God! My companion
                  touched my arm, and we looked aside and beheld Breckinridge; he was with Rhett,
                  Floyd, and Davis. He was one of the candidates for President; he was going in to
                  count the votes himself. Soon we all followed, and in a minute more were standing
                  in full view of the expected scene. It was then twelve o'clock precisely.
                  Pennington called the House to order. Stockton then prayed, the substance of which
                  was, "God bless the out-going Administration. May it close its labors without
                  further violence or more stain of blood. We pray for the President elect. Thy
                  blessing rest upon him; protect him hitherward; guide him with Thy counsel, that
                  he may administer the affairs of state as a worthy example of civil and religious
                  liberty."</p>
               <p>The House then sent a message to the Senate, requesting them to enter, in order to
                  count the votes together. I never saw such excellent order. You could have heard a
                  pin fall. When the Senate entered, the House arose to do them honor, and provided
                  them a circular line near the Speaker's desk. Breckinridge, the slaveholders'
                  candidate, being Vice-President of the United States, and President of the Senate,
                  took his seat beside the Speaker. In a moment all was order again. Breckinridge
                  then rose up, saying, "We have assembled pursuant to the Constitution, in order
                  that the electoral<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6417-00000034"/> toral votes be
                  counted, and the result declared for President and Vice-President for the term
                  commencing March 4th, 1861. It is my duty to open the certificates of election, in
                  the presence of the two Houses, and I now proceed to the performance of that
                  duty."</p>
               <p>When he ceased, the House was even more quiet than before; and as he took each
                  sealed package from each State, and broke the seal, it seemed to send a death like
                  shudder over every person present. He handed the packages to the tellers to be
                  counted. Oh, what a terrible spell now came upon us! Six thousand of us were
                  present, and we all trembled for the result. The Southern States were under
                  threat, if Lincoln be elected, they would secede and destroy the nation. Even now
                  were they silently praying, nursing their vainglory and hellish glee, for a cause
                  to show their foolish madness. This cause would come of Lincoln's election. Oh,
                  that they could show how ugly they could be, for the seeming menace against their
                  glut in human bondage! Their prayers were full of curses. They mocked the God of
                  Justice. Might was their king. Like tigers they were, gazing at the tellers, to
                  tell them to say it if they dare. And yet they feared. They had boasted they
                  would; and conscience—for they were Americans—still swept o'er them. But the
                  blindness of uncertain failure had seized on them; the rays of national glory were
                  being sealed to them forever. Pitiful creatures! what a bleeding shame to the
                  great republic! For your madness to damn your country.</p>
               <p>Not less, though, were we prayerful the while. We viewed the tellers in their
                  routine, with our hearts divided. Lincoln was on the side of liberty, and most we
                  hoped he would be elected. But we loved the opposite party—not for its principles,
                  but they too were our countrymen. Almost we hoped against our wishes, and wished
                  against our hopes. We would not enrage our fellows. Yet, with silent pledge, we
                  said to Almighty God, Thy will be done. Give us this day the result of the voice
                  of the nation. Thou hast prospered us, and we know that Thy wisdom will ever guard
                  us. If it be that the voice of the great republic is for Lincoln, so shall we
                  stand trusting in Thy name.</p>
               <p>Now, while we thus in silence sat, and much feared, musing in awful mood, the
                  tellers fast told over all the States' decrees, as each State had by parts its
                  several parts proclaimed. Anon this silence ceased. Then Breckinridge, with
                  trembling hand, held up a slip of paper, reading, even while he grew deathly
                  pale:</p>
               <p>"Douglas, twelve; Bell, thirty-nine; Breckinridge, seventy-two; Lincoln, one
                  hundred and eighty."</p>
               <p>Every person present seemed as dead. Even our breath had nearly ceased. Anon a
                  tear from many an eye stole down. No one looked on another. Countrymen—all—the
                  banter forth and challenge taken. But fast the blood returned to Breckinridge's
                  face, and almost black he was with choking madness. "Lincoln has," he said, "the
                  majority of the whole vote. He is elected President. Hamlin is elected
                  Vice-President." He could say no more; the eyes of six thousand people were gazing
                  on him, and he was the vanquished candidate. We pitied him. He was the
                  slaveholders' choice, but not the nation's. The law is, that the majority shall
                  rule; but not so now, thought the vanquished and his adherents. They swore, though
                  not aloud, they would not submit; and this was the first treason formed in the
                  hearts of men on this continent.</p>
               <p>Soon the senators took their departure; the House meanwhile had risen to their
                  feet in due honor. Such was the terrible day—the hour of death. But darkness was
                  over us all; the country was without Heaven's sign; like a clash of arms in a
                  midnight battle, the wail and war-whoop was heard, but the end no man saw. "The
                  slave party is beaten; will it yield to the nation's ballot? Will it try by arms
                  what it failed by moral power? And will not the liberty party cringe to them, and
                  plunge the whole in chaos?" Thus we said, and thus mused, even from the moment the
                  Senate left. Then the busy voice of maddened whispers ran amongst the six thousand
                  people. Louder grew the hum, and order ceased. We turned, amidst the throng that
                  now became a moving mass, and slowly made way beneath the dome and thence toward
                  the upper porch that faces the grounds above the Capitol. Quick now past ourselves
                  we saw Floyd, Madame Ponchard on his arm, and Orsini near, all making way to the
                  open plot beyond, where grouped a thousand men and women, gazing upward. Before we
                  cleared the trees, we were near Washington's statue, and then, in view full of the
                  dim-like sun, we gazed and saw the colors in their brightest hue, the red, white,
                  and blue.<ref rend="super" target="#note_009" xml:id="return_009">*</ref>

               <p>"See! see!" said Floyd, for he and Yancey, and others, were just a pace ahead, and
                  as he pointed to the sun; "I care not, though Heaven curse, we can, we will
                  disprove such a foolish sign."</p>
               <p>And then Yancey said, smiling, "This is God's farewell to the Stars and Stripes.
                  He is with us."</p>
               <p>"No, I will tell you," said Madame Ponchard; "for you see there are no stars. This
                  is a new flag for us. The red is a challenge to our foes; the white is a white
                  man's government; and the blue is the menial North." And then they all laughed
                  heartily, turning around to see if others laughed at what they had said.</p>
               <p>Not two yards distant was I, my face shaved even as on the previous evening, when
                  I had imposed upon them in effecting an entrance at the secret meeting. They were
                  astounded, but refrained from violence, because I had a lady in my company; though
                  in low whispers they pointed me out to Madame Ponchard and Orsini. The crowd
                  meanwhile became so great that I soon lost sight of them, but again encountered
                  the Judge and Vickey. His old silver spectacles were thrown high upon his
                  forehead, and he was alternately looking at the sun and his fair one, to whom he
                  introduced nearly every one he met. He only introduced them, though, then kept on,
                  as it were, with an interrupted discourse on the planets and on the rays of light.
                  So he says to us, "Ha! ha! Jenkins and Ann—fine day!—Miss Victoria Edge!" and,
                  before we had time to say anything, he turns to Vickey: "As I was saying, the
                  parallax seems as it were to conjoin, and the effect is more or less transmitted
                  to the rays of light within the earth's atmosphere. Just as I told Agassiz in the
                  researches on spherical action—ah!" and he turns to Mr. Holt, "ah, Mr. Holt!
                  strange phenomenon! Shall I introduce you to Miss Edge, of Ohio?" and again, not
                  waiting for a reply, he goes on to Vickey: "If you comprehend me, I only allude to
                  its passage through our atmosphere. Humboldt, you know, seemed to doubt somewhat
                  on this point. Fine day, Mrs. Barrow! Shall I make you acquainted with Miss
                  Victoria Edge, daughter of the great railroad contractor of that name?" and he
                  bows, and good-naturedly turns away, saying to Vickey, "It is indeed, as you may
                  imagine, a pity that our great authors dwelt so little on this subject."</p>
               <p>His style attracted attention. Those who knew him not, wanted to; and those who
                  knew him wished to hear him further, and these desires pleased Vickey; for what
                  girl would not love to walk with a man that could so easily attract attention?</p>
               <p>"See my uncle," said Ann, "sailing away with that young girl. Don't an old
                  bachelor always act silly? Indeed, I believe a wife is a looking-glass through
                  which a man can learn to see himself."</p>
               <p>"Then 'tis better," said I, "some men never get wives, for some are blest in their
                  ignorance of not seeing themselves. Yet I would that I could so see myself——"</p>
               <p>"Come," said she, pulling at my arm, "come; I fear this sun will give me
                  headache."</p>
               <p>And thus she ever broke off the dialogue that I had so often ventured on. She
                  could playfully speak of marriage, but the instant I took it up she found
                  something more important to talk of. In this instance I was about to bring her to
                  account for her style, when we reentered the Capitol, and passed under the dome,
                  where were congregated about a hundred people. At the head, and spokesman for the
                  whole, was Rhett. Near him stood Davis; but Mason was skulked aside in listening
                  attitude. "Never! never!" I heard Rhett say. "They may battle us, they may beat
                  us, but never, never can they subdue us. <q>

               <p>He then turned to leave, and many men present shouted huzzah at the top of their
                  voices. Mason, who was downcast, his hands deep-crammed in his pockets, now came
                  to Rhett, and said he would like to talk to him about these affairs, stating also
                  that, as the Government had really ceased to live, it was necessary something
                  should be done to save the country from coming to civil war, and perhaps entire
                     destruction<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6417-00000035"/> tion. Rhett burst into
                  tears, saying, "My dear sir, I cannot. I cavil no more. This day I leave
                  Washington, never to return. An ungrateful country has turned the South out of
                  doors. I go now to draw my sword against ingratitude. I shall only hereafter pull
                  down the tottering edifice, to make way for something sound and noble. Go, tell
                  Buchanan this—to-morrow one star shall be ripped from the American flag."</p>
               <p>"God bless you! My heart is with you," said Mason, and he shook hands with him.
                  "Tell Thompson and Stephens their doctrine's frail; that, in trying to take the
                  whole country, they will not take even their own States. South Carolina will go
                  alone."</p>
               <p>Again they shook hands, each prophesying that war would in all probability prevent
                  them from ever meeting again. Hardly had they separated, both nearly overcome with
                  the affairs of state, when a loud, uncouth laugh directed our attention toward the
                  lower steps. "I tell you they are vanquished. I tell you, Professor, they are
                  vanquished!" and again the laugh rang out, and we distinguished Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha
                  Stimpkins and Professor Jackson. "You see," she continued, "Lincoln's election has
                  knocked these fellows. Thanks to the Harmonial philosophy, this is a triumph of
                  Liberty—a triumph for human freedom—a triumph of the genial power of woman. I well
                  remember when these fellows, not long since, run me out of the telegraph office by
                  their unseemly laughter. Now I can laugh—ha! ha! Professor Jackson?"</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jackson.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Indeed, it is the first triumph I have enjoyed."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Lucy.</speaker>
                  <p>—Oh, no, Professor! the honor is not mine, but my principles. A New York paper
                     has for years claimed that it always elected the Presidents. But now let that
                     editor look, and see what woman has done. To see those fellows, those dealers
                     in human flesh, with tears in their eyes, and whining at the giant power of
                     woman!" In another moment she darted through the crowd, Professor Jackson
                     trying to follow, even while roars of laughter sprang from the throats of
                     thousands.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>For my part, I rather enjoyed it, but gentle Ann turned away her face, saying,
                  "Oh, for shame! Take me home, I pray you."</p>
               <p>"Why, no," I said; "let us follow a little, and see what more she says!" But my
                  companion hid her face with her fan, and pulled at me to go the other way, and I
                  went. I saw other ladies do so too, and I wondered at it, for the men all longed
                  to follow Mrs. Lucy, to hear the style of her enjoyment.</p>
               <p>After we came below the Capitol, we looked at the sun again, and the colors were
                  still there—a fact which I remarked to my companion; whereupon she suggested that
                  we should seat ourselves beneath the trees, and await the issue. But I told her I
                  was under the necessity of hastening home, because I was to carry the result of
                  the vote to the President.</p>
               <p>"You have never a moment to spare when we walk out," said she. I told her then we
                  would linger awhile if she liked, though she said, "No; when I bethink me, now, I
                  have no time either." And so we started homeward. I often wondered why it was that
                  I did not seize upon the opportunity she offered. When we reached the gate we were
                  met by the clerk, who had anticipated our weariness, and brought the Judge's
                  carriage to take us home. He had the best joke of the season, he said, and he
                  longed to tell it to me in full, although he further said that the joke was not
                  yet fully completed. At that instant Wadsworth came up, and got into the carriage;
                  whereupon the clerk winked to me, as much as to say I should come near him, and
                  leave Miss Underhill to the care of Wadsworth. Before I reflected, I agreed to it;
                  but, I have ever since considered it a very weak thing on my part.</p>
               <p>In a little while we were all safely ensconced in the Jackson House. The clerk
                  asked me to wait in the office a little while, and he would tell me the joke he
                  had on foot. Just then the Judge, with the Edge family, came up, and the clerk,
                  seeing them, shouted, "Oh, indeed! now is to be enacted the other part of the
                  joke;" and at that he broke away, and thereupon took the Judge and the Edge family
                  in by an other way. I waited a while, to hear what it was that he should be so
                  excited about, and presently I saw him through the scuttle window, looking in
                  toward the parlor. He was laughing to himself fit to kill. This made me uneasy,
                  for I wished also to enjoy what he was laughing at, but still I remained a long
                  while a spectator. Finally he broke away, and ran to where I was, exclaiming,
                  "It's took! egad, it's took! Oh, the best joke!" and he slapped his thighs and
                  laughed heartily. As soon as he quieted a little I told him to tell me the
                  joke.</p>
               <p>"I have just completed the greatest feat," said he, and he took me aside; "the
                  very greatest feat you ever heard of. You know," said he, "the Judge is dead in
                  love with Vickey, and believes she is going to marry him. And, would you think it?
                  I've got an old maid dead in love with the Judge. You know Mrs. Edge—kind-hearted
                  old woman! She wonders why the Judge is always round them. So, a week ago, I sat
                  down and talked the matter over with her. I told her the Judge admired her more
                  than he did any woman he ever saw. She believed it—felt wonderfully flattered;
                  whereupon I told her that any of the Edge family was an angel to the Judge.</p>
               <p>"'Indeed, do you think so?' said she.</p>
               <p>"Said I, 'I know so. He told me he never saw so fair and noble a woman as you. He
                  is tired of fashionable follies. He says that you are not ashamed to own that you
                  once made candles and soap for a living, and he loves you for it.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, really,' said she, 'I kind of thought so. I admire him for it, too. But,
                  you know such things must not be talked of. I will tell you,' she added, in a
                  whisper, 'I have a maiden sister, the very picture of me (only, some folks say I
                  was a little—just a little—handsomer than she is), and she has three thousand
                  dollars. Now, what is your opinion? If I send for her, do you think he would take
                  her?'</p>
               <p>"'Of course he would,' said I. 'He would marry any one related to you; I know he
                  would.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, now, really!' said she, smiling. 'They are just about the same age, only I
                  must say she may look a little older of the two; but then, you know women always
                  get to looking old sooner than men.'</p>
               <p>"I told her to lose no time, but send for her sister at once. When this
                  conversation was ended the old woman became so anxious about it, that she
                  immediately wrote and posted a letter to her sister. So now, to-day, while all of
                  you were off to the Capitol—in fact, all the Edges, too, being absent—the old
                  maiden sister came, all breathless and dirt, fearing some of the Edge family were
                  dying, because they had sent for her to come. She is the strangest old creature I
                  ever saw—so tall and thin, and leaned away over, and as harmless seeming as an
                  angel. I don't think she is exactly in her right wits, but it may come from her
                  old age. Well, as I was going to say, you were all absent when she came. I met her
                  at the door, and she asked me for the landlord. I told her I was the man; and she
                  smiled enough to show me she had not a tooth in her head, as she said,</p>
               <p>"'Indeed, sir, you are a young-looking man to have a tavern like this. Can you
                  tell me, sir, what is the matter? My name is Peggy Van Dorn.'</p>
               <p>"I knew, then, who she was, and I put my hand on my breast, sighing,</p>
               <p>"'Ah, indeed, my lady, there's matter enough!'</p>
               <p>"'What! are they dying?' said she, and she pulled out her awful long handkerchief,
                  and eyed me with great solemnity.</p>
               <p>"'Worse than death, I fear,' said I. 'Did they send for you?'</p>
               <p>"'They did, and I hurried with all my might; the trains are so slow I thought I'd
                  never get here.'</p>
               <p>"'Well indeed,' said I, 'you might hurry. You are the only hope; it rests with
                  you.'</p>
               <p>"She then got her long handkerchief to her eyes, and began to snuffle a little. I
                  told her that none of them were sick, but if she would step into the parlor I
                  would tell her all about it. She at once went in, I having told her you were all
                  off to the Capitol. When she got in she took off her bonnet and laid it down on
                  the floor beside her with much care, frequently stopping to wring her nose and
                  wipe away the tears.</p>
               <p>"'You must know, then,' I began, 'here in Washington is one Judge Francis
                  Underhill, of Loudon Heights, the wisest man that ever lived, and the handsomest.
                  He is worth two millions of dollars. Well, now, mind you, you must not blame a man
                  for what he cannot help, nor must you think hard of Washington society for what
                  you yourself might do. You are aware, also, of the beauty and nobleness of your
                  sister, Mrs. Edge, and of her ten thousand pleasing charms. This Judge, this
                  millionnaire, has formed a powerful attachment to her, and he is well-nigh
                  distracted to learn that she is already married. The wisest counsel of this city
                  has been in session, to determine what to do about it, not wishing to see so great
                  a man throw himself away in such a manner. Many of them having been acquainted
                  with you, and knowing the striking resemblance between you and your sister, it has
                  been decided that in this emergency you should consult with the Judge, in hopes
                  that your excellent judgment may devise a means to win his affections away from
                  her.'</p>
               <p>"She looked steadily at me a moment, and then said, 'How old is he?'</p>
               <p>"I told her he was about sixty.</p>
               <p>"'I'm afraid he's too old for me,' said she, and again she wiped her eyes, seeming
                  lost in reflection. 'I am but fifty-one, past since last 4th of July.'</p>
               <p>"'That's nothing,' said I; 'you cannot be insensible to the fact you are both
                     at<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6417-00000036"/> least old enough to marry. You do
                  not wish to live to be an old maid?'</p>
               <p>"She shook her head in the negative, and then changed her bonnet over to the other
                  side. 'How much did you say he's worth?' said she.</p>
               <p>"'He's worth a million of dollars,' said I.</p>
               <p>"'I thought you said two millions,' said she.</p>
               <p>"'Well, I dare say,' said I, 'he is worth two millions. It is almost impossible to
                  estimate his wealth.'</p>
               <p>"Again she shook her head in the negative, and looked straight out another
                  way.</p>
               <p>"'You are aware, also,' said I, 'that there are plenty of instances where men have
                  fallen in love with other men's wives, resulting in the most fearful consequences.
                  I must not name them, but the history of this city is not clear of such stains;
                  and if we go to England, France, and Italy, we find high life full of it. In all
                  countries, in the highest walks of life, the marriages are always planned out by
                  proxy, the persons themselves being merely children to the wise counsels of their
                  best friends. In many countries it has been found necessary to make a law
                  governing the marriages of the heirs of royal and imperial families. In this
                  country, of course, we have no such law; but then, you know, the same thing is
                  done in other ways. We find we must protect the truly noble. You and the Edge
                  family have risen from candle-makers and soap-boilers to be persons of the highest
                  quality. Nobleness is yours by nature.'</p>
               <p>"'I have always felt that,' she said, and she seemed to see a ray of happiness
                  beaming on her withered future.</p>
               <p>"'It is, therefore, thought meet and proper that we bring you and the Judge face
                  to face, to see if indeed such a marriage might not be not only a thing of
                  necessity, but a pleasurable consummation. He has already given his consent, and
                  longs to be presented to you.'</p>
               <p>"I feared I was getting it on too thick, and so I waited a moment to see what
                  reply she would make. Having taken her bonnet up and set it down on the other
                  side, and flourished her handkerchief a little, and brushed away some imaginary
                  specks from her dress, she finally ventured to ask, 'What kind of looking man is
                  he?' and I answered and said, 'One of the most noble you ever laid eyes on. He is,
                  to be sure, rather stout and fleshy, but he is so fair and so fresh, like a ripe
                  apple. He is not tall, nor is he short; and he carries his head considerably in
                  the rear of his abdominal viscera, in real royal fashion. His forehead is so
                  large, and extends so far over the top of his head, you would almost think him
                  bald; but this comes of his princely blood. Such feet and hands! they are like a
                  lady's, so soft and delicate.'</p>
               <p>"Again I waited a moment to see the impression I made on her, and she replied that
                  she had read somewhere that opposite figures made even numbers; that, as she was
                  tall, she needed a stout man; that her hands and feet were large, and so she had
                  always admired small ones most.</p>
               <p>"Now, while we talked thus, I was apprised the Judge might return any moment, and
                  I might be caught in a rather meddlesome business. Accordingly I assured her that
                  the Judge's mind was made up; that she must take it for granted that every one was
                  expecting her to reciprocate his affection, and never to cast a doubt in the way.
                  'You have, therefore,' I concluded, 'nothing more to say, when you meet him, than
                  that the proposed marriage is your extreme pleasure. But if you, when you see him,
                  do not like him, you can tell him that you oppose the marriage, and it will end
                  there.' I rose up then to go, and she rose up too, dangling her bonnet by the
                  strings, and with some hesitancy she asked, 'You think he's got the money?' I
                  assured her there was no doubt about that at all, and then told her to keep her
                  seat till I brought in the Judge. She looked both pleased and scared, and complied
                  with my request. Then I sallied out to meet the Judge, and to post him on the part
                  he was to play. Fortunately, I met him near the gate, and called him aside,
                  leaving Mrs. Edge, Mr. Edge, and Vickey viewing the rainbow round the sun.</p>
               <p>"'Now, Judge,' said I, as soon as I got him alone, 'I have more to tell you about
                  your expected marriage than you ever dreamed of.'</p>
               <p>"'Pooh!' said he; 'about my marriage?'</p>
               <p>"'There is no use making long words about it, Judge,' said I; 'I know you and
                  Vickey are dead in love with each other, and I know, too, that a great obstacle is
                  in the way, which will probably prevent you from ever marrying. No joking, Judge;
                  I want a fashionable wedding at our hotel, and I want everything to go off
                  smoothly; but I tell you there is a cat in the bag, and it will scratch like fury
                  if you don't look out.' The Judge thought there might be some truth in it, and he
                  merely told me to go on, to say what I had to say. 'Now,' said I, 'Judge, you know
                  Mrs. Edge has never given her consent, and she is really the master over Vickey's
                  affections. She can, by the mere crook of her finger, turn her daughter's love all
                  over to Prescott, for whom the girl has a great admiration. Now, there is one way
                  in which the old woman can be won over, and that is through her old maiden sister.
                  This is a poor, old, dwindled creature, not worth a pinch of snuff. And yet Mrs.
                  Edge does whatever this old half-witted maid bids her; she looks to her, in fact,
                  as a master, ruling spirit. Now I come to the joke: I put up Mrs. Edge to send for
                  this old maid (so we could have the thing in our own hands), in order to let her
                  see high life in Washington. The maid has come, and is now at the Jackson House. I
                  want you to soft-soap her up—in fact, to court her a little, no matter how
                  distasteful it may be, in order that she may buy over Mrs. Edge's goodwill to us.
                  I have had a long talk with her. Her name is Peggy Van Dorn; and I told her that
                  you and Vickey were in such great hopes that her influence would overcome Mrs.
                  Edge, that she had been sent for for that very purpose. And I promised her that,
                  for her good influence in this, we would all put our heads together and secure a
                  husband for herself in the bargain. She is in great glee, and I do hope we can
                  keep it up; perhaps some fun will come of it.'</p>
               <p>"'Now, as I am a Judge,' said he, 'you are the cunningest rascal I ever heard of!
                  But say, you, can we not get up some old fool to marry her? I would enjoy it so
                  much! Why, I can make an old woman like that believe she is a perfect angel. But
                  how could you invent such a thing for such an old person? Oh, you rascal!'</p>
               <p>"'Oh, we'll marry her off to somebody,' said I; 'we'll pay her off some way; only
                  you play well your part.'</p>
               <p>"'Trust me to that,' said he. 'I'll do such wonders on her affections as makes
                  Cupid tremble for his profession. You leave that to me.'</p>
               <p>"We then returned to the carriage, and, with our company, proceeded to the Jackson
                  House. On the way up I told them all of the arrival of Miss Peggy Van Dorn, and of
                  her desire to see them all.</p>
               <p>"As soon as we alighted, Mrs. Edge and Vickey hastened in to see her; Mr. Edge
                  went into the office to examine his papers in reference to some new railroad
                  project. With the Judge I lingered outside till the common greetings between the
                  ladies should be over, and then we entered the parlor. Of course, the Judge was
                  introduced, and a general free conversation ensued about the result of the doings
                  at the Capitol. In a little while, however, Mrs. Edge called Vickey, being anxious
                  to leave the Judge with her sister for a moment, promising that she would return
                  to the parlor in one minute. The Judge then told her of his extreme happiness in
                  getting acquainted with the Edge family, and added that there was only one link to
                  fasten, before the chainwork would be completed, which would be the happiest event
                  of his life. 'It seems as though I still have another consent to win, and that is
                  yours.' She was silent, and pulling furiously at the bonnet strings. 'You know, at
                  your time of life, which, like my own, is well-nigh spent, a little encouragement
                  is a thing of great joy. You are yet capable of feeling those warm emotions, and
                  you know, too, that a brighter day awaits your happy decision.'</p>
               <p>"I don't believe she knew a word he said, and I thought she had forgotten what I
                  said; so I kept near her back, digging her old ribs, telling her to say, 'I admire
                  you, sir; I consent to the marriage, sir;' but she was so frightened, and withal
                  had so much fuss with her bonnet strings, and I feared every moment some one else
                  would come in, that I was nearly frantic with anxiety.</p>
               <p>"'You have been apprized of Mrs. Edge's decision?' asked the Judge.</p>
               <p>"'Oh, yes, sir; I—I—' she replied.</p>
               <p>"'Well,' said he, 'I trust we understand each other?'</p>
               <p>"'Tell him you consent,' said I; and, before she thought, she said,</p>
               <p>"'Oh, yes; I—I consent to the marriage.'</p>
               <p>"The Judge then took her withered hand in his, saying, 'I say, now, you are a very
                  queen, an angel. I never saw such majesty. You have performed your part like a
                  princess of the royal family of Britain;' and he danced about, dragging her after
                  him in greater glee than I had seen him in a dozen years; and she herself danced a
                  little. Just then Vickey and her mother came in, exclaiming, 'Well, did I ever!' I
                  turned, and told them the Judge was so anxious to meet one that rejoiced in
                  Lincoln's election, that he danced like a child. They then took her out, and I
                  returned to the office."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>SHORT sentences, I said to Jenkins, are easily understood. We can always discover
                  in them the author's meaning. Referred him to many authors, naming even some of
                  our greatest modern citizen writers. But, he said, for his part he liked long
                  sentences the best, and maintained that they left the sweetest and most impressive
                  influence, referring me to one of our great American poets, quoting this beautiful
                  verse: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I laid on my back and viewed the setting sun,</l>
                        <l>And, as the radiance faded out,</l>
                        <l>I sucked the sky to keep it there."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> And, as a proof of its elegance, he told me that that poet had been named
                  after the famous cotton mills of Massachusetts simply for having sucked the sky.
                  He smiled in triumph, and, taking up his notes, proceeded as follows:</p>
               <p>I had no more time to spare than to hear the clerk's story, but hastily took leave
                  of gentle Ann and Wadsworth, whom I most reluctantly had to leave together while I
                  departed to acquaint the President with the result of the election. This was only
                  a few minutes—at most not an hour—after we were at the Capitol. But what was my
                  surprise, on going to the door of the Jackson House, to behold Floyd, Davis,
                  Mason, Madame Ponchard, and Orsini flying past in a carriage drawn by two spirited
                  horses in the direction of the White House. I determined to be there before them,
                  and ordered my driver accordingly; being well armed, and fully determined that, if
                  Floyd gave me any justifiable ground at all, I would be a full match for him. In
                  fact, I even hoped that he would shoot at me, or stab me, or in some way give me
                  an excuse for ending his career. It could not be gainsaid that he had bartered
                  himself, and his oath, and his office. He had forfeited still more sacred trusts,
                  and even publicly challenged God to grind his body into dust if he ever again
                  yielded to his former obligations; that not a vestige of this country should ever
                  be governed by States prohibiting slavery. He revoked all his former life, and now
                  stood sworn the opposite way, even while he was Secretary of War. Davis was more
                  silent and cunning, using him as a cat's-paw to his deeper-laid schemes. Rhett,
                  Davis, and Toombs were, in fact, the master spirits; while the more profane and
                  weaker instruments, Cobb, Yancey, Floyd, Mason, Slidell, Hunter, Thompson,
                  Iverson, Breckenridge, Wigfall, Miles, and others, were barking bloodhounds sent
                  out to start the game.</p>
               <p>Buchanan was waiting in the hall to receive me; for, though he had heard from the
                  general election that Lincoln was elected, he still clung to the hope that in the
                  electoral college some of the minority candidates might come over, and, through
                  their united votes, beat Lincoln. There was scarcely a shadow of difference
                  between Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge. They had all run on the slaveholders'
                  platform, only the former ran it blind in deceiving the people. They had merely
                  lent themselves to a pretended difference, but all for a Southern, sectional,
                  slave purpose. Lincoln ran against all these men, and on a platform to settle all
                  the national troubles by a constitutional, amendment. He beat them all. The nation
                  decided to amend the Constitution, so as to prohibit slavery where the other party
                  wanted to introduce it. The question was settled. The election made it law in the
                  hearts of the American people. All it needed was execution. Now, this being so,
                  the beaten party would never have hereafter a clue for arguments, whereby they
                  could obtain office. This election made their political death.</p>
               <p>As I stated before, the President was waiting for me, apparently very much
                  downcast, and he hardly saw me ere he feebly said,</p>
               <p>"Tell me, sir, oh, I pray you, is it true? Has he indeed the majority of all the
                  votes?"</p>
               <p>"He has," said I; "it is certainly true; Lincoln is elected to be the next
                  President."</p>
               <p>"That can never be!" he said; "no man shall ever be President of these United
                  States after me. What say Davis, Toombs, and Rhett?"</p>
               <p>"Rhett has gone home," said I, "and he gave strict orders that you be informed
                  that, ere to-morrow's setting sun, one star shall be ripped from the American
                  flag."</p>
               <p>"I told the people this," replied Buchanan. "They would not go according to the
                  Constitution. They have voted to rob the South of the vast West, and the South
                  will never stand it. That great unsettled territory was as much intended by the
                  Constitution to be for the South as for the North. But this vote has used the
                  liberty of voting the national domain over to the free States. If there be war,
                  the North have themselves to blame. I'll never raise a hand in their behalf. If
                  there is any justice at all, it is all on the other side. Come in; I shall write
                  such a message, and you shall pen it for me, that the very reading of it shall
                  overturn this whole affair. Take my word for it, if there be ever another
                  President for the whole of the States, it will be either Davis or Toombs,
                  Lincoln's election to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>
               <p>Hardly had we turned to enter the Mansion, when Prescott came up on a full run,
                  shouting,</p>
               <p>"South Carolina has already passed the ordinance of secession. It was passed
                  unanimously, immediately on receipt of the news, by telegraph, from Rhett, of the
                  result of the electoral vote."</p>
               <p>We were astounded. It had been suspected, but not to take place so suddenly.
                  Buchanan nodded his head a little aside, saying,</p>
               <p>"I told them so; I told them so." He then took us both in, and we all seated
                  ourselves to weigh the matter at our ease. Just then Davis and Floyd came in, even
                  without any ceremony, the doors being open, and affording a free passage.</p>
               <p>"I know the meaning of this," said Floyd, as soon as we were all squarely face to
                  face. He eyed me. "It is the furtherance of that dastardly election; it is a
                  hurried dodge to sway a Christian President from his constitutional
                  obligations."</p>
               <p>I told him I was ordered by the President to be here at this time for his special
                  purposes, and that I could hear no personal insinuations. "I know, too," said I,
                  "all the plans and purposes of the secessionists; it is my duty, as a citizen, to
                  inform the President of what I know."</p>
               <p>"And how did you gain your information?" said he. "As a spy? Ay, worse! as a
                  British subject—the most abject of all falsity. You have more shamed the name of
                  American than could any living man. Any falsity but this, this base assumption.
                  Tell all you know of us, and, when it is known that you put on the garb of an
                  Englishman, no American will believe a word you say. A man so mean cannot speak
                  the truth."</p>
               <p>Now, I must confess I felt a little shame, and was at some loss for a reply, so
                  suddenly had he blown upon me. Yet I comanded myself a moment, and said that I
                  considered any deception whatever would be justifiable, if it should succeed in
                  exposing such a villainous scheme for extending the power of human bondage by
                  usurping a government founded on civil and religious liberty. "You must be aware
                  now," I said, "that my determinations are not to be baffled by bluster. The whole
                  country knows you robbed the national Treasury. Your name will ever be branded as
                  thief."</p>
               <p>Buchanan had stepped aside, scared for his life, and Prescott and myself were in
                  full attitude for an attack. Davis, too, seemed to shrink back, cowardly; but
                  Floyd, thief as he was, showed no signs of fear. He was armed with a bowie knife
                  and revolver; so was I, and so was Prescott.</p>
               <p>"Were it not for the place, I would cut you in two," said Floyd; and I retorted
                  that he could take any other place he chose, either by notice or without warning.
                  "Only too glad will I be," said I, "that you may fall upon me in ambush or in
                  public or by appointment. If you have no conscience other than to perjure
                  yourself, I will teach you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, gentlemen, for God's sake!" said Buchanan, his knees shaking so he could
                  hardly stand, "will you leave me? will you retire?"</p>
               <p>"Only this message have we," said Floyd, "to tell your Excellency, that
                  commissioners are to be appointed to call on you to negotiate for the sale of the
                  forts, arsenals, and Government property in South Carolina, and that they must be
                  received and treated as emissaries of a foreign country."</p>
               <p>Buchanan was so frightened he knew not what to say, and stood there trembling,
                  till Floyd and Davis bowed themselves out. "Oh, sir," he then said to me, "if
                  there should be blood shed in this house! If I should be killed! What have I done?
                  God knows I have stood by the Constitution!"</p>
               <p>"I think you have not," said Prescott. "You have stood by the South. You now stand
                  by the South. You see them rob the nation; see them plotting treason; see them
                  doing in South Carolina what Jackson stopped them from doing; see the election of
                  Lincoln in a constitutional<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6417-00000038"/> tional
                  manner, and you declare it is unconstitutional. You crouch and tremble here, while
                  these common traitors dictate to you the terms you shall yourself subscribe to. In
                  cases of emergency you can call out the national forces, but you creep into
                  technicalities to avoid enforcing the constitutional laws you have sworn to
                  protect."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I am in no humor for this. I know I seem so to everybody, but it is not
                  so—I am no child; I can speak; I will show these fellows what I can do. I will
                  never, so help me Heaven! never sell these forts and arsenals. But I pray you
                  both, leave me awhile. I am a little excited—I fear I am."</p>
               <p>Before we had time to leave, he had himself withdrawn. In a minute more we wended
                  our way out. When in the hallway I touched Prescott's arm, and with one hand drew
                  forth my bowie knife, remarking, "This had most assuredly been Floyd's death, had
                  he raised a hand on me."</p>
               <p>Right before us, outside the Mansion, and near the upper step, was Madame
                  Ponchard. She saw the knife, which I instantly sheathed, and I heard her pat
                  distinctly with her foot on the stone—a signal, I thought, to some one—and I left
                  my hand still resting on the handle of my knife. A few paces brought us to the
                  outside door. To the left, and below, there stood Orsini, both hands in his
                  pockets, and he was apparently in a sleepy attitude. He had been stationed there,
                  no doubt, to stab me; but her signal was to warn him that a witness was by, and
                  one that would perhaps fall on him. Perhaps the showing of my knife saved us, yet
                  this was merely conjecture. We passed out unharmed, and were soon in our carriage
                  on the way back.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" says Prescott, as soon as we were seated, "oh, do you know I believe I have
                  found your fugitive? I am almost certain I have."</p>
               <p>Now I had previously told Prescott about the slave girl; that I had lost trace of
                  her, although I had searched the city over and over. He then told me that, if I
                  had no objection, we would drive that way, and he would show me the place where he
                  was confident he had seen her on a previous occasion.</p>
               <p>Accordingly we proceeded over to the east side of town, down Clay to Montgomery
                  street, and then down Park Avenue. Here we encountered a dusky-looking washing and
                  ironing establishment, where a pug-nosed old woman kept herself half hidden behind
                  poles, tubs, and clothes. "This is the spot," said Prescott, as he was about
                  halting. "Let us call and ascertain. I am sure I saw just such a person here at
                  the break of day this morning." I told him, however, to drive on, for we would
                  probably only frighten her, and not succeed in getting an interview. He acceded to
                  this, and, after we had passed a square further on, I bid him excuse me; that I
                  would return, while he proceeded homeward; cautioning him, too, that, as it was
                  getting late, he should make good speed, keeping an eye out for assassins.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes afterwards I was before the washerwoman, endeavoring to gain the
                  required information. She was Irish, and spoke in exceedingly broad accents, and
                  was stubborn to all my queries, seeming to know nothing about what I meant. She
                  was, she said, an honest, hard-working woman, and hoped that other folks would do
                  the same as she did. She was sure, she said, that I was not such a fool as to
                  think that two persons could live in a shanty as small as hers. I told her I was a
                  friend of the missing girl. What had she to do with that? she said. Surely, if she
                  washed and ironed her clothes like an honest woman, I should not come there and
                  bother her with my tomfoolery.</p>
               <p>For a long time I talked with this old woman, who persisted to the last that she
                  never saw nor heard of the slave girl I was seeking. Yet, she betrayed such signs
                  as made me sure she was playing false. I could do no better, however, than
                  reluctantly to turn away, saying, "In half an hour I will pass here again. If the
                  said girl is here, bid her secrete herself where she can see me as I pass. If she
                  knows me to be her friend, bid her speak. If she does not, let her keep secreted.
                  I will never trouble you more." Again she persisted it was nonsense to talk such
                  stuff to her; that I might pass the shanty a hundred or a thousand times if I
                  liked, provided I did not trouble her with my nonsense. I left, and strolled round
                  awhile, and then, in about half an hour, started back. Ere I reached the place,
                  however, and in passing some plaster and boards where the builders had been at
                  work, some one called my name. I turned, and faced the sound.</p>
               <p>"It is, then—it is indeed my friend!"</p>
               <p>I heard the voice behind the boards, while plainly before me rose up the fair one,
                  bursting into tears. I knew her at once, and expressed my happiness in finding
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, pardon me that I act so unbecomingly becomingly! I hardly know if this
                  be life, or if it be death; exposure, fear, and hoped-for joys nearly distract me.
                  Scarce I know where I am, and yet too clearly do the vivid scenes appear."</p>
               <p>I had gone near her, seeing that she was in fact a little bewildered. "Be calm,"
                  said I; "you have nothing here to fear. Let trust in me give you time to collect
                  your presence. Your speech betrays a soul strained to the utmost. If this do
                  continue, your blood will take improper roads, and so derange you fully."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I will be calm; but first let me weep. Oh, blessed vent to woman's
                  bursting heart! Oh, sir, that I could waste myself away in tears! I know that God
                  has sent me a friend."</p>
               <p>She then caught my hand in both hers—two small and delicate hands, the sight of
                  which, so fair, like swords fell on the boasted name of American, to hew from us
                  at a dash the stain on liberty.</p>
               <p>"With me, sir, it is life, or it is death," she continued. "The sea of agony is
                  over-flooded; desperate is my hunger for kind words, and in the surge betwixt two
                  contrary tides I seem the fool. Please, sir, I will not weep long. Oh! oh!" She
                  started, looked up the avenue, and again composed herself. "A sound of common
                  things. You see that carriage? I am half unhinged. Why! did you go to the old
                  place to find me?"</p>
               <p>I told her I did.</p>
               <p>"No wonder," said she. "I was barred out. I ran away that very night, God knows
                  where—I don't; but I walked nearly all night, and then I came to yonder new
                  buildings, and laid me down on the shavings to sleep. Praise Heaven, I slept so
                  sweetly! I dreamed I flew, with a friend, from my native country—that I was free.
                  How did you find me, sir?"</p>
               <p>I then told her it was through Prescott; that I had, however, previously searched
                  all over the city in vain.</p>
               <p>"I throw myself all on you," she interrupted. "I know you will take me safe to
                  Canada; that you will shield me from every danger. Oh, sir, if you knew my
                  suffering, you would ever regard my fervency and freedom with due allowance. But
                  come, I will take you to the old washerwoman's shanty, and there relate my ills
                  and threatened barbarous treatment. 'Tis not well we talk long in this place. Have
                  you ever been in Georgia? Oh, we have pretty places there! But cold, cold be the
                  hearts, where summer's radiance ever is; to balance fair majestic Nature's parts,
                  the winter is all in human bosoms. The lily springs where burning suns pour down;
                  and shadows, too, appear cooler and darker there, but not in wild nature. Oh, no;
                  only in man is death! I could tell you such tales of Georgia and Virginia, you
                  would call me mad. Who was this Prescott with you? Do you know he is your friend?
                  Many men, for the reward of five hundred dollars, would betray me."</p>
               <p>As she ran on in this way we were slowly wending our way back to the shanty, and I
                  observed that nearly every moment she started and looked about, as if suffering
                  with great fear and anxiety.</p>
               <p>"And why should I not be?" she said. "Six times have I run off, and six times
                  captured been, bound, and carried back. On the seventh Bruce succeeded, and so
                  will my pursuers. My vigilance is but the desperation of all my powers. Every
                  nerve hath an eye, an ear, an action. Oh, that I could quiet them—that I could
                  still myself to rest! My aching head, my bursting heart, my soul that pleads for
                  power from above!—all in struggle, all grappling for the feeble force I have, each
                  to wield in front extreme its own importance first. 'Tis the grasp of a drowning
                  soul on the sea of life; breakers and foul winds blind me, even while on the
                  furious surge I catch the glimpse of a far-off shore. But no; I gasp, I rouse to
                  see, to feel, to prove each separate sense by another, that I am past all danger,
                  landed clear from the billows, and in my hand the rod of liberty. Then why, whence
                  this shaking form, to gain the world, and quiver still? But dark forebodings come,
                  and imps of treachery steal from every corner; the clank of chains hath its echo
                  in every spear of grass. Oh, my native country! what a chattel am I! A fool that I
                  love thee still!"</p>
               <p>Thus she continued, till we had seated ourselves in the shanty, where she was
                  interrupted by the old washerwoman, who accused her that she had said she had no
                  friend—that every one was an enemy—that on no account was her concealment to be
                  divulged. To all of this, however, the young girl gave a satisfactory answer.</p>
               <p>It was now quite night, and we had no fear whatever of being discovered. I asked
                  her what her name was, and she said Lizzie; she knew no other. I asked her if the
                  washerwoman knew of the reward offered for her capture. She answered, No. "I took
                  care to conceal that," said Lizzie. "I told the old woman that all the trouble was
                  about a forced marriage. She does not mistrust I am a slave. She says she knows I
                  am some great lady."</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6417-00000039"/>
               <p>Now it happened that, while we conversed thus, the old woman packed up some
                  clothes and got ready to carry them home. I feared Lizzie would dislike to have me
                  stay with her alone, and I signified the same to her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, you much mistake me," she said. "Had I no more confidence, you had never
                  found me here. I feel that a Higher Power guards over me. This is my last attempt
                  to fly from slavery—to fly from a new-found master, whose designs I can never
                  forget, for the deep horror of his boasted might. Welcome all hazard! I am
                  resolved. These poor, frail parts, these hands and limbs, given me as instruments
                  of adornment and protection to the spirit within, shall first exhaust themselves
                  to carry me safe to a foreign shore; but when they fail, and all the avenues on
                  earth are closed to me, I will, to keep the soul unspotted, open a vent and wing
                  myself to the imperial throne above!"</p>
               <p>She half choked at her own words, drawing a bowie knife, and then smiling in
                  anticipated triumph.</p>
               <p>"And this is my vow, when man no more protects me; Lucretia will end herself
                  before Sextus comes. Think not, sir, I speak of you, but of the home I dread."</p>
               <p>Now, while she showed this desperate resolution, I involuntarily recollected that
                  her nature was at variance with a large portion of the American women, who, when
                  failing to win their point with man, kill him, and that's the end—so unlike
                  Lucretia's death, that aroused the city of Rome and overswept the kings. And so,
                  too, this poor fugitive had hit the vein that most moves man in her behalf.</p>
               <p>As soon as the washerwoman left, I bade her relate to me all her trials and
                  hardships, and to depict more plainly the dangers that awaited her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how can I tell you—how collect myself when thus excited? And you know, too, I
                  have a half-sister, who has not yet arrived. I fear she has been captured, and
                  carried back to slavery. Ever comes before me the vision of her gentle wrists and
                  ankles encased in iron; and I fancy I hear her suppressed sobs pleading in my
                  ear—to help her. She is so fair, so gentle—only fifteen. Such a form as storms the
                  noblest heart, as tempts the ruffian. And she unprotected! Oh, how can I tell you
                  my long misfortunes, while my sister is away? Sit near me, sir, for now it is
                  growing dark, and I need something tangible to remind me I am safe the while." She
                  smiled a little, and looked up with much modesty, adding, "You know you are in
                  Heaven's sight my protector, while I, like a drowning child, catch at the shore in
                  the name of all that's holy."</p>
               <p>Now, when she had laid her hand over into mine, she entered upon her history,
                  which I have here in brief set down, to wit:</p>
               <p>"When I was about four or five years old, I lived with a planter by the name of
                  Palmer, in the State of Georgia. Of the still earlier part of my life I knew
                  nothing, nor do I know now. I do not know who was my father, nor who was my
                  mother. When I was very young, an old colored woman took care of my sister and me.
                  We called her Mammy, but I never thought her my mother. Until I was nine or ten, I
                  never thought about who I was or where I came from. I was brought up under the
                  belief that I was a negress. I and my sister had more privileges than any other of
                  his slaves. We slept in our master's house, and always ate at the second table.
                  But, as I hinted before, at about nine years of age I began to surmise some on my
                  unknown ancestry. I could not account for my lack of color, though I was despised
                  by the genuine blacks, partly for my whiteness, and partly for the privileges I
                  had. I mean also my sister; for we were treated the same. These surmises about my
                  origin led me to watch the conversation of older folks, from whom I learned that I
                  was a favored slave because I had a nose and hair the very style of Palmer's. My
                  curiosity became greater. For weeks, for months, ay, for years I stationed myself
                  in byways, in chimney-corners, garrets—anywhere, everywhere—to see, to hear, and,
                  in the language of my master, to know whence I came and whither I was travelling.
                  But I gained no information. Only once I heard him tell our mistress he had
                  ordered a teacher for Lizzie and Kate, and that he intended they should be well
                  brought up, and finally sent to France. Of course, I kept this a secret, only I
                  told my sister Kate. The nature of our lives gave us no familiars. We occupied a
                  position between the blacks and our master. My sister and I often prayed, when we
                  laid down to sleep, that God might change us into genuine blacks by morning. We
                  wanted some one to love, to be familiar with.</p>
               <p>"When I was eleven, we were put to our lessons under the promised teacher. But
                  this was kept a secret, on account of the law of the State forbidding slaves being
                  educated. Soon, then, our intercourse with other slaves was nearly extinguished.
                  Our teacher was a gentleman man, a small, lean man, very pious and good. He it was
                  who taught me first the road to happiness; taught me to subdue my passions, and to
                  trust in a Higher Power. Blessings rest upon that man! He showed me the finger of
                  God, which has ever pointed me to the narrow path.</p>
               <p>"At about twelve I was instructed by an excellent artist from Savannah, in cutting
                  and making ladies' wearing apparel; and, according to my instructor's report,
                  learned quickly all the intricacies of changing models.</p>
               <p>"At about that time my master was elected to the United States Senate. He had
                  previously held several high positions under Government, but never so high as
                  senator. One term he served, bringing Kate and me with him, as servants to our
                  mistress' toilet; and he then resigned on account of ill health. At his home in
                  Georgia he had much company, and I am forced to believe that his company ruined
                  him. He gambled. Our mistress died. She was the purest and best woman I ever knew.
                  She was a defenceless little creature, and whenever she addressed us, 'twas with
                  such a voice and gentle sentence as only Heaven inspires. This was the beginning
                  of our darkness. Our master mortgaged his plantation, and went to Savannah. Here
                  he lost all his money, and was reduced so low that he moved to a cheap cottage in
                  the suburbs. He had no servants but Kate and me, and the old negro woman who took
                  care of us when we were children. One faithful negro man he brought with him, who
                  now agreed to hire out for the support of our master. But the latter got
                  intoxicated one day, and sold him. That money was soon gone. We had nothing more.
                  One day he came to me, in the cottage, and, taking my hand, said, 'Lizzie, what
                  shall I do—shall I sell Mammy?' I answered him, saying, 'No, master, no; for then
                  would soon come the end. 'Tis better that we work for you. I think I can turn the
                  talents and the culture you have bestowed on me to a good advantage. There are
                  many rich ladies here, who, when they know my capacity to cut their dresses and to
                  adorn their persons, will soon reward me handsomely on your account. Besides, I
                  think Mammy, and Kate and I, and perhaps yourself, would die if we were separated.
                  You cannot be ignorant of the fact, that you are in very feeble health; that you
                  are, in fact, likely to be called at any moment.'</p>
               <p>"He burst into tears, and told me to leave him a moment. I did so. In half an hour
                  I returned. He was kneeling down by the sofa, praying and weeping. In one hand was
                  a miniature of his loved wife; in the other was this trifling jewel—see, sir!—a
                  thing, I had heard him say, that had been presented to him many years ago in some
                  foreign country. He ceased grieving only by falling on the floor exhausted. I ran
                  to him, but he was insensible. I took the jewel and miniature, lest some accident
                  befall them, and then hastily summoned Mammy and Kate to help him. After some
                  difficulty we got him aroused and assisted to a bed, when we summoned a doctor.
                  For many days now we were in great trouble. We had not money to buy medicine with.
                  Mammy ironed to earn a little. Our master was very low, speechless. I then went
                  out to get work. Fortune smiled on me. I knew not what to charge for my work, and
                  the ladies I worked for were so ignorant, and, being rich, valued me according to
                  my prices. Consequently I deemed it just—for I was vain of my capacity—to charge
                  at least ten times as much as would any other person. This soon became notorious,
                  which helped me still more. I ceased doing anything myself, only visiting wealthy
                  and fashionable belles. On my arrival they would send for their regular
                  dressmaker, who had to cut and trim according to my direction. Often I got fifty
                  dollars for a single visit. My accomplishments and ease of speech elicited much
                  curiosity, for I always represented myself as a slave, stating who my master was,
                  and what misfortune had befallen him. Sometimes the money was given to me,
                  sometimes sent to my master. One day I was sent for to visit a fashionable
                  actress; but as I knew nothing about that style of costume, I declined going. The
                  next day she called on me. I declined again. I did not like her. She was called
                  beautiful. She repeated her call, but I still declined, hoping within my heart I
                  should never see her more. She had not harmed or in any way treated me rudely, but
                  I felt that she carried an awful fate before her. Oh, that I had never tried to
                  banish these intuitive impressions! Forgive me, sir, I weep when I remember. Well,
                  our little caste in life rapidly improved, but my master long lay in feeble
                  health. One whole year he lay there, my little sister Kate ever by his side, Mammy
                  ever preparing him some of her thousand fancy feats for his nearly-exhausted
                  palate, and I, I am happy to say, toiling to the full support of all. Nay, more,
                  in one year I saved six hundred dollars. My master<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000040"/> would not touch this money. Though, when it had
                  been sent to him for my services, he would hold it in his hand till I came to his
                  bedside, and then give it me, ever saying, 'God bless you; save this, Lizzie; I
                  will some day make you happy!'</p>
               <p>"How long this course of things would have run I know not, only that Fate changed
                  the scene. In my visits one day to the house of a wealthy and honorable citizen,
                  when I withdrew something from my pocket, this jewel fell on the floor. The
                  gentleman of the house picked it up, saying, 'What's this, young woman?' I told
                  him it was my master's; that it was something he valued very highly, and that
                  always, on leaving home, I carried it in order that it might not be stolen or
                  lost. He eyed me with some suspicion, and then asked where my master lived. I told
                  him. He then put it in his pocket, and went off to see my master. I was nearly
                  frantic, for I feared I would be accused of theft, when Heaven knew with what a
                  loved and honorable purpose I had done it. When I came home my master called me to
                  his side, having ordered all others out. He was then propped up in bed. After
                  asking how I came by it, and why I carried it, and, having heard me all through,
                  he said I had done well. 'Some day that jewel shall be yours,' he said, with some
                  emotion. 'You shall discover something which shall make you and your half-sister
                  happy through life. Should ever any misfortune overtake me, keep you this jewel.
                  How I came by it I cannot tell you at present. But it was first presented to your
                  father. Whenever harm comes near you, tell men that such was your father's jewel,
                  and no man will harm you.'</p>
               <p>"I was certainly pleased at this, but feared that, if indeed my master believed in
                  such a charm, he had lost some of his reason. Though I was more anxious to learn
                  something about my own father, and yet I dared not be so impertinent as to ask him
                  more. He bid me take the jewel and keep it till he called for it, and then told me
                  that I should order a feast of simple things that night; that his friends had
                  discovered his whereabouts, and would visit him at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>"True enough, many men called on him, but they were strangers to me. From that
                  time on my master regained rapidly in health. Society cheered him up, but he was a
                  changed man. He drank no more, nor did he ever gamble after that.</p>
               <p>"One bright spring morning he called me to him, for he had entirely recovered now,
                  and frequently took a walk or a drive, saying, 'Lizzie, you must go out no more to
                  work. You have been a good girl, now rest yourself by preparing for a journey to
                  the interior.' He told me nothing of his plans, nor of his business. I had seven
                  hundred dollars in gold, which I often offered him, but he invariably answered,
                  'God bless you, Lizzie, I have plenty of money; keep your own.' I knew then that
                  the gentleman who discovered his whereabouts by having seen this jewel, must have
                  provided him with money. One day, when I was absent, getting things for our
                  journey, the actress called again for my services. My master bid her wait till I
                  returned. Oh, woful day! Dread Fate, why did I stay so long? He, whom I should
                  have guarded, was in the snares of the evil one. Yet I tarried, so heedless of the
                  woful future. Excuse me, sir, my tears are the fruit of untimely joys. But I must
                  tell all. My master smiled on this woman. All men have a failing part, but some
                  are never touched upon it, and so, pass applauded for their virtue. The pure never
                  throw a stone, and the untried are great boasters and full of vain glory. My
                  master was good and great, but even these can be overcome. We excuse those that
                  steal to appease a starving stomach. But who, with a heart of love and tenderness,
                  can feel the desolation of a noble man whose house is stripped of conjugal joys,
                  and not pity him for catching at something whereon to cling in good companionship?
                  I adjusted the style the actress desired, and she paid me handsomely.</p>
               <p>"Soon after this my master informed me that he had redeemed the mortgages on his
                  plantation, and that we must return. Oh, how happy I was to get away from
                  Savannah!—To get away from that actress! But I was happy in ignorance. The
                  anticipated horrors came. We had hardly got settled on the old plantation, when my
                  master returned to Savannah, married the actress, and brought her out to the
                  plantation. This was the renewing of winter to my own life. Though I was but a
                  slave, the new wife was jealous of me. But she concealed it well, for she was a
                  woman of great comprehension. I never asked what countrywoman she was, but thought
                  she was Spanish. She was very dark, with dark eyes, and she spoke with so much
                  deliberation on all occasions, though ever saying little, I was positive from the
                  first that she would in some way prove treacherous. But it came sooner than I
                  expected. She ordered a magnificent ball. All the choicest liquors were provided.
                  Guests, the first in the State, were present. That night my master drank. Next day
                  he took sick and died."</p>
               <p>For a moment my fair companion could say no more. I read at once her surmise, that
                  her master had been murdered. But she soon went on.</p>
               <p>"The widow became the owner of us all. We were all advertised for sale. My beauty
                  and accomplishments were asserted in the advertisements in all the Savannah,
                  Atlanta, and Charleston papers. Can any one conceive the meaning? Can any one know
                  the horrors within my soul? 'Tis now nearly three years since, and yet no minute
                  has passed to give me joy. I was sold, with my sister, to a neighboring planter,
                  where I was kept as lady's servant. My sister had nothing to do. But he announced
                  that he would sell all his slaves at the end of the following year, and this kept
                  me in continual dread. Many men called to see me, and often tried various means to
                  purchase me. I became frightened, and ere the year rolled round I ran away. When
                  seventy miles from home I was seen by an acquaintance, and arrested and carried
                  back. I had four hundred dollars then, having given my sister the balance, with
                  instructions to follow me soon after. They took my money, and never returned it.
                  On the next day I was home again, where I received a severe reprimand, with the
                  threat that I should now be sold without consulting my wishes in regard to a
                  buyer. Again I repeated the attempt, and was again excused with a reprimand. He
                  then changed his purpose, to not sell for still another year. Before this
                  appointed time arrived I had been selected and bargained for by a gentleman from
                  Charleston. The sight of him was almost death to me. His eye had not the mark of
                  avarice, and yet it made me pray for death. It had more terror to me. Under the
                  guise of something else. I was bound by a chain to my sister, and taken into
                  Virginia. We loved to go North; slaves always fear going further South. We were
                  then put into the fields to hoe tobacco. In a few days after, when we were at
                  work, my Charleston purchaser came up to us. He was on horseback. I shuddered at
                  his approach, and at the words he uttered.</p>
               <p>"'Which do you choose?' said he, after he had smiled and bid us cease our work,
                  'you are no longer ignorant of my will nor my power. Obedience will give you ease
                  and enjoyment; its opposite will entail upon you toil and sorrow.'</p>
               <p>"'By sending me here,' I said, 'you have given me my choice. I pray you, sir,
                  leave me to toil here all the days of my life, and I am content.'</p>
               <p>"He then made an oath that he would tame me or be my death; and, bidding my sister
                  and the other slaves to leave, he then attempted to dismount from his horse, but
                  his foot tangled in the stirrup, and the horse ran off, dragging him some
                  distance, and leaving him helpless on the ground. We took advantage, and Kate and
                  I ran away. Several times I have been captured and carried back; but, ere he
                  recovered from his bruises, we ever escaped. For the last year we have been
                  running and hiding. A few months ago we were, near Columbus, Ohio, captured and
                  carried back. My master had entirely recovered, and then paid the captors three
                  hundred dollars. We were so overcome that we were both taken ill. We pretended to
                  be worse than we were, in order to prevent violence. A few weeks since we fled
                  again. At night we were pursued; but we had matured our course, and the place of
                  our meeting in this city. All the advertisements in the papers stated that Kate
                  and I were so attached to each other we would most likely be found together. For
                  that we separated. And now, alas, I fear we meet on earth no more! She has no
                  money, and I know not how she can live. Oh, that she were here! Send her to me, O
                  Heaven, or I must die!" She burst into a new flood of tears, ending thus her story
                  of life in a land of liberty.</p>
               <p>In two hours after I had her in boys' clothes, with a short black head of hair,
                  registered at the Jackson House as Joe Travers, of New York.</p>

               <p>THE night passed most unpleasantly to me, for the talc that Lizzie told brought
                  vivid pictures of horrors to my vision. The threat of war, too, brought clouds and
                  darkness and blood and death. The threats of Floyd and Davis sent the frenzied
                  blood to my every nerve: the imbecility of Buchanan enraged me. But these fevers

               <p>Thus I moralized till the bright morning came, and then sallied forth. No more the
                  thought of war; no more concerning secession. Hardly had I come down to the office
                  of the Jackson House, when a rough, burly-looking customer met me, with a paper in
                  his hand. Pointing to it, he said,</p>
               <p>"I say, sir, do you live here?"</p>
               <p>I told him I did.</p>
               <p>"Then," said he, "read this. I've lost some niggers."</p>
               <p>I took the paper which read as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>A runaway slave known as Lizzie, formerly owned by the late Hon. John Pahner of
                     Georgia. Five hundred dollars reward offered for her. Also three hundred
                     dollars offered for the girl Kate, a young sister of Lizzie. They are both
                     nearly white, with light hair, blue eyes, well dressed. Kato is fifteen, and
                     Lizzie eighteen or nineteen. Both are good-looking girls, and might readily
                     pass for white. They have been traced to this city, and are supposed to be here
                     at present. Apply to Wm. H. Russel, office, Jay Street, Washington.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Scarcely had I scanned the advertisement, when, tripping down the stairs came the
                  identical Lizzie, now and hereafter known as Joe Travers—a modest, beardless boy.
                  The fevered excitement was at its flood on my nerves. What could be done? In she
                  came square before us ere she saw the hated face of him whom, more than all things
                  on earth, she dreaded.</p>
               <p>She the slave to such a man!</p>
               <p>She started, almost frozen at the glance, and then walked away. He, ashamed of his
                  profession, seeing the boy, as he supposed, approach me, took the paper from my
                  hand, and it fell on the floor. So, when the slave started, he was the while
                  scrambling after the fallen paper, and thus most providentially failed to fully
                  see her. Yet so much had he seen, that, when we were again alone, he said, "Had my
                  niggers brothers, I'd swear that boy was one—the very dimples in his cheeks and
                  chin, and the sprightly step—I swear, I would that he too were my slave."</p>
               <p>"That boy!" said I. "His father had better hear you talk that way."</p>
               <p>"Oh, not for the world!" said he. "I was only joking! And then he asked me to go
                  and drink with him, promising me that he would give me such a description of his
                  fugitives as would enable me to capture them, and obtain the reward; stating also
                  that he had been told that I knew more about the city of Washington than did any
                  other man, and would be likely, in consequence, to aid him in an effectual manner.
                  "I will tell you, stranger,' said I, and I wondered the while to see so coarse a
                  man all hung with jewelry. An immense gold chain of choice workmanship dangled
                  weightily on a rich silk vest, the breast of which, being open, showed a splendid
                  cluster of large and small diamonds, so set as to resemble the ice-tipped branches
                  of the wild orange tree. Golden leaves tried to hide the brilliancy, but anon, as
                  the wearer moved, waved aside to show some secret gem. On his fingers were rings.
                  One was of native gold, and rudely made; others, set with choice stones, seemed so
                  rarely carved and chased as it had been a jeweller's lifetime to contrive them.
                  Strangely, too, this man's boots, unpolished, outside the trousers, were poor and
                  common. On his head was a soft wool hat, large in the brim, and seeming to rest on
                  his heavy, dark side whiskers, while the points of a coarsely twisted moustache,
                  like horns, stood far out, displaying a lofty Roman nose piled high up between two
                  as sensual eyes as ever were in the face of man. A little walking-stick with a
                  gold handle he twirled in one hand, between the fingers of which was a half-smoked
                  and badly chewed cigar, and the advertisement I mentioned was in the other. "I
                  will tell you, stranger," said I, "if you will excuse me for calling you
                  such,——"</p>
               <p>"My name is John Russel, sir, descended from the ancient family of that name in
                  England."</p>
               <p>"Ah! then, Mr. Russel. In these days it is useless to seek for a run-away slave.
                  They get to Canada by steam, and I hope yours may soon be there too."</p>
               <p>"What," said he, "you too talk so?" I made no answer and we parted, he to seek his
                  slaves, and I toward the girls in the parlor. I saw him go to the door. He seemed
                  still to look after Joe Travers. I feared he did. I looked for Joe. Not to be
                  seen. I then went into the parlor. Vickey came to me and asked me for a good
                  dentist. I told her where to go. Asked her if she had tooth-ache? "Oh, no," she
                  said, laughing. She then excused herself, and went out. I was about to leave, when
                  in came Mrs. Edge and the clerk, who seemed very polite to her. He winked at me to
                  keep still; so I sat down, unobserved, by Mrs. Edge. "I know it will make a great
                  difference with her," said Mrs. Edge to the clerk; "her face is so sunken in, and
                  then she can't half eat. I've been telling her so for a long time, but she's so
                  close with her money. Now, she's not like me in that at all; I go in for any
                  expense according to one's station, you know, and I tell her she's getting so old
                  it need not make much difference now no more with her as long as she's got to
                  live."</p>
               <p>"Why, certainly," said the clerk; "you have just my views exactly, and so has
                  Vickey."</p>
               <p>"And I wish Mr. Edge was the same," said she; "he's gone after railroad contracts
                  ever since we came. His soul is all in a railroad—poor, dear man!—Always into his
                  papers; he hears nothing you say to him no more, unless it is about railroads.
                  Only the other day I called his attention to our accomplished daughter as she
                  passed so lovingly before us. 'See,' said I, 'what a beautiful train she has;' and
                  he started, and said, 'What road's that on?' for he thought I was talking about a
                  train of cars. Poor, dear soul, he started up, and says he, 'What road's that on?'
                  and I thought I'd a-died a-laughing; and then he got up and went out, for he said
                  it was nonsense to call Vickey's coat tails a train. 'What road's that on?' he
                  said so funny."</p>
               <p>The clerk laughed a little then, and he turned to her, saying, "Excuse me, Mrs.
                  Edge, but I am in a hurry, and I will be pleased to hear what you have called me
                  here for?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," said she, "yes, yes. Well, what I was going to say is this, for you see I am
                  a plain-spoken, honest woman, and I always speak my mind, and I always think it is
                  best for folks to understand each other as they go along, and then they will
                  always remain good friends. I'm laughing at what Mr. Edge said; says he, 'What
                  road's that on?' But, as I was about to say, you know we don't make much
                  pretensions ourselves—that's Mr. Edge and me—but we have spared no expense on our
                  daugther. She has a finished education. She went to Philadelphia. Every one who
                  sees her knows she's prepared for the best of society and people of the highest
                  rank. Only the other evening I noticed, when a promiscuous crowd was in the
                  parlor, and one of the ladies there said something or other not just according to
                  genteel society, and Vickey spoke right out and said, 'We are taught differently
                  in the high society in Philadelphia,' and that made them all stare pretty
                  straight, I tell you. Indeed she's smart, if she is my own daughter, and I say it
                  myself, and she knows what's proper for a real lady."</p>
               <p>"No question of that," said the clerk; 'she is the belle at this house at least.
                  Every one speaks of her in the highest praise."</p>
               <p>"Just so I say, if I am her mother; and what I was coming at is this—that is to
                  say, I have not decided yet who Vickey shall marry. But I understand that you have
                  been instrumental in encouraging an attachment between her and Prescott, and
                  that's what I was going to speak of, for I could not entertain such a marriage at
                  all. Who is this Prescott? He's nobody—a penny-a-liner! How could he provide for
                  such a lady?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed, Mrs. Edge, you much mistake me, I have not been instrumental, only so
                  far as to speak of the virtues of<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6417-00000042"/> each.
                  Prescott is an excellent man. He is not rich to be sure, but you have yourself
                  told me that you and Vickey did, in former years, work not only at soap-boiling,
                  and candle-making, but in the fields hoeing corn."</p>
               <p>"But we have proved ourselves; we are now universally acknowledged to be the very
                  head of society. Judge Francis Underhill, of Loudon Heights, told me with his own
                  mouth he considered Vickey the most perfect lady he ever saw. He is too old to
                  flatter; he speaks wisely. Now, then, shall we turn backward from our attainments
                  to help up this fellow by the way? No, no; far from it. Excelsior, as Vickey says,
                  is our motto. Then, too, you must know that Vickey has many suitors. There is
                  Wadsworth, so rich and handsome. To be sure, he is an owner of slaves, but my mind
                  has changed on that score since we came to Washington. There's nothing like the
                  lowly being contented with their lot. There must be distinctions in society;
                  persons of rank always will hold this, and I don't know as we could make a better
                  choice than in this young man. But there are others. Only this day a
                  finely-dressed man lingering at the street corner, seeing her rare, ladylike
                  appearance, slipped a card into her hand, and desired to walk with her. I tell
                  you, and I make due allowance for my vanity for my own child, but she can say with
                  pride who she will or will not choose. Now, all I have to say is, that I do hope
                  you will discourage this young Prescott off. Indeed, I know you will, for you know
                  he's no match for our Vickey."</p>
               <p>"Certainly so, Mrs. Edge. Why, of course I will, rest assured—indeed—Oh, yes!"</p>
               <p>"You know," she interrupted, "I'm a little afraid she takes to him a little, only
                  don't say nothing, you know; you understand?"</p>
               <p>Again and again the clerk gave assurance that her wishes should be carried out,
                  and then they went out of the parlor, for some one had been calling the clerk. I
                  was about to follow, but the clerk returned alone.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have such a joke!" said he, and he laughed heartily. "Oh, such a joke! Do
                  you know, these fool Edges believe everybody is in love with them. Sure as fate,
                  they believe the Judge is going to marry the old maid, and she is gone off with
                  Vickey to get a new set of false and big plumpers." Again he laughed. "You see,
                  they observed that the Judge was not very attentive to the old maid, and suggested
                  that they ought to fix her up a little. Mrs. Edge got some patent breasts for her
                  last night, and now Vickey is off to the dentist to get her mouth filled up with
                  teeth and plumpers, and the poor old thing is half raced to death with battling
                  the huge pads and hoops and whalebones. Oh, I declare, 'tis an excellent
                  joke!"</p>
               <p>I told him I was real sorry for the old maid, and also for Vickey, who were both
                  so innocent and well meaning.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" said he, "I'll get Vickey to marry the Judge, you shall see. I vow I
                  shall have a wedding at his hotel, somehow or other."</p>
               <p>At this instant came a violent scream from the stairs above. We ran; I thought of
                  Joe, the fugitive, and feared she had been detected and captured. I felt under
                  obligation not to suffer her to be wronged to the value of anything by another if
                  in my power to prevent; and with these vivid fancies flying through my mind, I
                  rushed to the spot. Here I was startled afresh, to see, not the fugitive, but my
                  own gentle Ann, reclining on the stairway, pale and helpless. Below her, on the
                  stairway of the lower floor, and leading into the street, was a rude crowd,
                  pushing and jamming furiously to make an exit. From the noise I could tell
                  nothing, nor no word distinguish. Only gentle Ann, almost frenzied, cried out,
                  "Stop them! Oh, for God's sake, save her! O Heavens, is all my labor lost!" In a
                  moment the crowd was gone, save the lingering servants, who, half-affrighted,
                  peered from every corner. "Dear, gentle Ann, what is the matter?" said I, and I
                  raised her up, and she leaned her head over on my breast and sobbed aloud. Again
                  and again I urged her to tell the cause of all this; but she clung fast to me, and
                  seemed as if her heart would break. "Oh, urge me no more!" at last she stammered.
                  "The things whereof I weep I cannot, must not mention. Take me, oh, I beg of you,
                  take me to my room, and leave me! Oh, how can I—how can I?" and I never saw so
                  near a death with weeping. I then took her to her room, even to the doorway, where
                  she turned and warmly pressed my hand, saying, "How lonely, lonely now! I scarce
                  can enter. Leave me, my heart is broken." She then went in, and I came away, not
                  being able to guess the cause of such great sorrow. When I encountered the
                  servants, I inquired the cause of the confusion on the stairs, and they told me
                  somebody was taken prisoner—a woman, a young woman, a girl of about fifteen! "Can
                  it be," I thought to myself, "that such was the fate of Joe's sister, Kate?
                  Captured here?" I then remembered that for a week past my gentle Ann had seemed so
                  cast down and sad, and I thought perhaps she had been secreting this fugitive. I
                  made some cautious inquiries accordingly, but gained no evidence to substantiate
                  my theory; but I resolved to linger about the hotel till I could get an interview
                  with Ann, and then ascertain, if possible, the whole mystery. I then repaired to
                  the office to await and to reflect awhile, but was instantly hailed by a newsboy
                  shouting into my face, "Buy a paper, sir? buy a paper, sir? Beauregard in
                  Charleston building batteries. General Scott burnt in effigy all over the South.
                  Davis or Toombs to be made President and installed in Washington before Lincoln
                  gets here." Of course I bought a paper, and I read it, too. The boy's statements
                  were true. Active treason against the established government was on foot. The
                  party beaten at polls had resolved to carry their point by the sword, to place
                  themselves in office. Yet I called it vanity; called it boasting; for I, nor any
                  other man, could be convinced that so great a folly could be attempted by an
                  intelligent people. Some one touched my arm, after I had read and reread the paper
                  for a good while, and, looking round, I beheld Professor Jackson. "Lend me the
                  paper?" said he; and I answered, "Certainly, sir, I am done with it." He looked
                  rather cast down, and his clothes were certainly the worse of the wear. When he
                  had taken the paper, he pulled out one from the ragged pocket of his coat, and
                  said, "I can exchange with you. I am one of the editors and publishers of the
                  Journal of Progress, devoted chiefly to literature." I thought, when he said
                  devoted to literature, he meant it as a pun on the thousands of illiterate
                  pamphlets and magazines that claim the same heading at the top of their title
                  page, and are published in all the cities and towns all over the country, and so I
                  said, "Indeed! Literature is cheap now-a-days, especially in the name. Had
                  Humboldt lived here, he need have taken less trouble. After he had spent thirty
                  years in study, he was urged to prepare some literary work, but he replied, that,
                  as nearly as he could compute the time, he had forty years more to study before he
                  could prepare himself to write on a literary subject, but if the society would
                  wait until that time, he would be happy to make an effort to please them. I wish
                  he had lived in this country."</p>
               <p>"Ah, sir," said the Professor, "it was well indeed when man depended on mundane
                  evidence, to ask for time to prepare a literary work; but now, you will, I am
                  sure, admit that knowledge is beginning to be intuitive. Appreciation and
                  confidence is all that is needed. But, sir, a journal like this of ours is in
                  advance of the times. People go in for trash,—novels, picture papers, caricatures.
                  That's the trouble!" and he looked over the paper I gave him, while I glanced at
                  the one he gave me, but I read it not. My mind had other matter; I cared not for
                  literature. Several times I observed the Professor casting glances toward me, and
                  at last he ventured to ask me if I was not a contributor myself to some paper. I
                  told him, not at present. He then asked me if I would not like to take a share in
                  the Journal of Progress? I said, no. He next asked if I would not like to buy him
                  out? Again I said, no. But he persisted, asking if I would not lend money on the
                  establishment, taking charge of the income till I got my money back, with a
                  hundred per cent. profit? "No," said I, "I cannot engage in business. I have
                  retired from all business, save what pleases my fancy. If you want to borrow
                  money, go to your banker." "We have none," said he. "Then go to a broker," said I.
                  "We have been," said he, "but they said they would not lend money on literary
                  establishments. They don't go in for literature. You might as well ask a monkey to
                  appreciate our Journal, as to ask a broker." "Have you not funds enough to carry
                  it on?" I asked: and he answered, "No; we're out entirely. If we could only get
                  started rightly, I am sure it would be a success. I have put all I had in it. I
                  put in a hundred and sixteen dollars. And my wife has put in rather more than
                  that. I am now delivering lectures every night, and so is my wife, for the benefit
                  of the Journal." "Well," said I, "can't you raise funds sufficient?" "No, sir,
                  there is hardly anybody goes to literary lectures. The first night I took in
                  eleven dollars above expenses; but the last two evenings I hardly came out even,
                  and we are getting in considerable of a strait. For economy sake we took a room in
                  a shanty and went to housekeeping, and, if you will believe me, sir, we live on
                  bran bread and water, eating only one meal a day." "You are certainly very
                  persevering," said I, "but if you have not money enough to carry it on, I think
                  the better way is to sell out the whole concern." "We have tried that, too," said
                  he, "but every one says just as you did; they don't want to buy. They think there
                  is going to be war in the country,<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6417-00000043"/> and
                  they won't invest; whereas, in my opinion, this very Journal, rightly managed,
                  could avert the whole danger of the country. If I only had my own money back, I
                  would not care."</p>
               <p>Just then Joe Travers came in, and I excused myself to the Professor, and followed
                  Joe into the hall beyond, and there told her how best she could avoid her pursuer,
                  John Russel; that I had not the slightest doubt but he would know her if he came
                  near her, and fairly looked on her. She promised in every particular to follow my
                  advice, but cautiously urged me to go with her to the Quarters, which is the place
                  where slaves are kept preparatory to buying or hiring or sending off when changing
                  owners. That she feared indeed her sister Kate had been captured, for she heard of
                  something to that effect just a few minutes since. I agreed to go with her. I am
                  confident no one heard us talking. We went out the back way. In the garden was the
                  Judge, lounging on a bench beneath the trees. He was sound asleep. Beside him lay
                  a piece of fool's-cap on which was written the following lines. I took the paper;
                  did not consider it stealing; he had often taken my manuscript notes himself, and
                  then returned them. I intended to return these. The words he had written were as
                  follows, to wit: <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When we got outside the gate, we halted till I read it over, and thereupon Joe
                  remarked, "I rather like that old man, sad as I am, for it is so humorous in him
                  to love so young a girl." I then told her about the Judge, and about his
                  eccentricities; his egotism; his good nature, and his present love adventure. We
                  were then going toward the Quarters, and I took a good while in telling the
                  Judge's life to her, but when I finished she heaved a sigh, saying, "Oh, sir, tell
                  me more! My every breath of life holds upon a thread when you speak of the ties of
                  the human heart. To be so free, to love and never fear the bond by mortals torn
                  asunder. Oh, please, sir, tell me more! Tell me of this Vickey. Oh, what joy is
                  hers—to feel that even one so old has proffered to the craving of her warm
                  devotion!" I told her I thought it was rather ridiculous for so old a man to
                  suffer himself to fall in love with one so young. "Oh, indeed, sir, it is not.
                  Whoever is not thirsty can wait for a gourd, but the others can dip with a leaf
                  and drink to Heaven's praise. Oh, sir, what pain is it to famish, to be alone in
                  the world! I do hope she may love him in return."</p>
               <p>As we walked along, she frequently asked me if I thought any one could detect her?
                  and I assured her that with due caution and presence of mind, she might forever
                  pass unknown. She heeded my advice and manifested considerable resolution, saying
                  that she believed she could go even to the Quarters, and if her sister was there,
                  still maintain her composure unobserved. But when we neared the place, at that low
                  spot of ground just in front where the Irish exile sighed to have a house, so the
                  clank of niggers' chains might lull him to sleep, so forgetful that for liberty he
                  had himself rebelled—when we neared this memorable spot, and beheld there
                  assembled some fifty or a hundred people, and in the crowd what seemed to be the
                  fugitive, Kate, marching amidst a throng of police and the curious populace, Joe
                  siezed my arm, exclaiming, "What is yonder? See! a charge in double breast of full
                  a score against that poor, helpless girl. Oh, I cannot, cannot further go! 'Tis my
                  sister—no, it cannot be! Oh, what shall I do!" and she burst into tears, holding
                  me that I might proceed no further. Said I, "Be resolute, dear girl, imagine
                  nothing. Look with indifference; 'tis not your sister, I am sure. At all events
                  study more what you can do, and waste your power less on idle sympathy."</p>
               <p>Very soon I saw that she could go no further without herself becoming a mark of
                  observation, and persuaded her to halt by the way until I inspected the tumult.
                  This was the occasion on which I gave her a cigar. She did not smoke, and it was
                  not lighted, but simply held it in her mouth to assist in disguising her as a boy.
                  I then proceeded alone, leaving her standing on the sidewalk. Many persons passed,
                  but no one seemed to notice us. The attention was all on the tumult. I could not
                  tell at first what it was about, but the crowd was very dense, and I saw coming on
                  a full run Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins, and Professor Jackson. I knew then that
                  it was the party with the fugitive, and that a rich scene was about to be enacted.
                  I ran as fast as I could, and when I reached the place, Mrs. Lucy rushed in before
                  the officers, looking, indeed, almost a maniac.</p>
               <p>"I protest!" she said. "In the name of Heaven I protest! You shall not reinslave
                  that child!" and she seized hold and forced a halt. But the officers pushed her
                  aside, saying, "Now we want none of that sort of stuff. Let go. Let go, I say."
                  But the woman said, "Never but by violence. I will hold on as long as my feeble
                  grasp has power, and when that fails I will cast myself upon the points of your
                  daggers. Hew me in pieces who dares! Here! I will bare my breast! Dogs! Beasts!
                  She shall be free!"</p>
               <p>"Away, away, foolish woman!" said the officers, and then the owner came forward,
                  saying that whoever claimed his slave was a thief and an Abolitionist. "I want
                  nothing of you, you are opposing the law. Away, away!" And then the crowd surged
                  forward, and the mutterings of many voices made confusion. But soon the woman's
                  shrill voice broke forth again. "Halt! Halt, I say! This thing shall never be! She
                  is no slave: she's white! Carry me, drag me, tear me hence who can!" And I now
                  looked far into the crowd, and beheld Mrs. Lucy clinging fast upon the poor slave,
                  who, though frightened, told me in her fairy-like face she was the identical
                  sister, Kate. The men were endeavoring to pull Mrs. Lucy away, but as often as
                  they tore her hands off she again laid hold. The sympathy of the crowd was with
                  the poor slave, who, all dust, with clothes rent by violence, and her pale auburn
                  hair dishevelled and dangling on her pallid features, wet with tears, and eyes
                  dilated with fears terrible, but now an instrument of contention, pulled both ways
                  as a child between two furious bears. All the while nearer to the Quarters they
                  surged. But yet awhile, and the dire confusion broke; some blows, a squall, a
                  scream. I saw it not, but heard, and then beheld a part and parcel of the crowd
                  tear loose and run. And then an opening. There stood Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins,
                  some scratched and bruised, but worse her clothes the contest held. Kate was
                  dragged off with the flying crowd. Alone stood Mrs. Lucy, and thus after her
                  vanquishers held forth: <q>

               </p>
               <p>She said more, but it was all after that style, and then she turned abruptly away
                  and was soon lost to view. I followed the crowd up to the Quarters. It was a brick
                  house, rather old and shabby. On the front was the following sign:</p>
               <p>"Slaves bought and sold here. Highest price paid for fugitives. Guard room; keep a
                  night-watch. Slaves boarded for their owners. Money advanced on slaves. Slaves
                  procured on short notice, and warranted. William Filmore, Esq., proprietor.</p>
               <p>Besides this were many posters for "Runaway slaves." "Rewards." "Overseers to go
                  South, wanted." "This house has connection with all first-class slave-traders in
                  the South." "Established eighteen years." "References of the highest
                  respectability." "Fugitives captured." "We keep several first class detectives to
                  ferret out runaways."</p>
               <p>I read all these notices before I could make way through the crowd to the house.
                  Heard much laughing. Many of the men joked about the fugitive. The words they said
                  cannot be written. Hard words were also used about Mrs. Lucy. No man cried
                  "shame." I know that if any man had showed disapproval to the dragging of the
                  slave to the Quarters, he would have been shot or stabbed on the spot. One of the
                  officers, the one who most pulled at the fugitive's arm, was a United States
                  Marshal. I did not see him kick her. He gripped her arm so tightly she cried. It
                  was not the Marshal that seized her by the hair. It was an assistant. Heard him
                  say it was fine wool, and he added an oath to his words. She offered no resistance
                  during the foregoing melee; she was pale with fright. She did not moan. Large
                  tear-drops flowed down her cheeks. I could not see her fairly in the crowd. She
                  had chains on both wrists; also on her ankles. She could not go as fast as the
                  Marshal, and that was why he gripped and jerked her arm so cruelly.</p>
               <p>In the Quarters she was placed in the front room; could be seen from the street.
                  The window was open; the day was warm. I saw her sitting on a bench. Two<pb
                     n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6417-00000044"/> others were sitting at her left hand
                  side. They quite dark; I think they were mulatoes, or half breeds, as they are
                  commonly called. One of them seemed contented; that one was a man. The other was a
                  woman, about fifty years of age. When Kate was pushed into the room, the old woman
                  rose, saying, "O Lord, my God!" and she burst into tears. The keeper hit her
                  lightly with his cane. The slaves then sat down and the keeper went out. Many
                  others beside myself lingered in front of the house to look upon Kate. She saw us
                  not. She looked downward; never raised her eyes toward Heaven. Once or twice she
                  gazed at her arm, now black and blue from the Marshal's grip, but instantly her
                  eyes again fell to the floor. She moved not; sat upright, pale as death, a
                  beautiful American slave!</p>
               <p>While we looked on, Russel came up. He clapped a man on the shoulder, saying,
                  "That's the chalk! Your money's ready." Some of the crowd set up a cheer for the
                  secession of South Carolina. They said Cotton was king. Many of them boasted that
                  the Government of England would be on the side of slavery; that if the Southern
                  States would found a government, based on slavery, that the British Government had
                  assured them they should meet every encouragement it was possible to give. Many of
                  the crowd gave groans for Lincoln, and for Abolitionists, and then they gradually
                  dispersed. I returned to my companion, Joe. She was still at the lamp-post with
                  her cigar. I feared to tell her her sister was indeed the person, for I thought
                  she would betray herself by crying or fainting. She asked me, "Is it really my
                  sister? Tell me, for I am dying with suspense."</p>
               <p>"No," said I, "it was only a common culprit. A little thief girl."</p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed! really?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, really!"</p>
               <p>"Then I am so happy. Oh, what a burden it has been to me! and now I am so
                  relieved. Indeed I would like now to see the girl, thief as she is, that has given
                  me so much concern. Come, take me to the prison, I will see the thief, or drunken
                  woman, that I may laugh at my foolish fears."</p>
               <p>"No," said I, "a prison is no place for a youth like you, let us return to the
                  Capital."</p>
               <p>"Why, now, indeed, you frighten me. It was my sister, and you fear to tell
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"On my word, dear girl, can you think I would wrong one I have sworn to be
                  friend?"</p>
               <p>"Now, I objure you, if you are my friend indeed, tell me if it were my
                  sister?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I am your friend, and wishing to save you, for you might be overcome; I told
                  you wrongly."</p>
               <p>"Alas, my sister! Poor Kate! Take me, sir, I honor you, oh noble citizen!"</p>
               <p>I then told her to take my arm, and we walked awhile, she drooping and weeping the
                  while. I knew not how to comfort her; I had no plan to rescue her sister. After we
                  had gone two or three squares, she stopped short, saying, "No, no, what am I
                  about? Why do I not go to my sister? Come, I will share with her; take me!" and
                  she looked up into my face, her tears were gone and she seemed resolute. "You see,
                  I am older and grown in more independence, but my sister looks for some one to
                  look out for her. If I go back with her, Providence may show us yet some way of
                  escape, but if I stay here, I know my sister will pine and die. Therefore I must
                  go. Come, take me!"</p>
               <p>"Rather say you will help provide your sister's rescue, and I am not long in
                  yielding. After we have failed in all things, your proposition is still good.
                  Russel will Undoubtedly keep Kate here for several days, while he searches for
                  you. During this interval we can counsel on all the plans we may invent. Let us
                  hence now, using our judgment more, and our sympathy less." To this she assented,
                  and we started back. In front of the flower gardens we encountered that ever crazy
                  pair, Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins and Professor Jackson.</p>
               <p>"I never heard of a husband," said she to him, "if indeed husband means a woman's
                  partner—that loitered by the way nursing ever the woes of a lost purse. Why have
                  you not followed me? Were you true to our glorious cause, we would now have been
                  champions in one of the greatest affairs of the age. With my single hand I
                  encountered a hundred men, who were mad with the capture of a fugitive little
                  slave, and full exultant, flying with their game, and boasting of their clutch on
                  the frail creature. But I was overcome. Brute force overrun woman's moral power.
                  And I have to thank you. You were not on hand."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, my dear, you much mistake these matters. We are in advance of the age.
                  The tide is against us. In all our adventures we fail. Had I been there, they had
                  murdered us. You, being a woman, was spared;"</p>
               <p>"Is that indeed your courage in the cause of human rights? Have you been really
                  lecturing for years on the cause of Woman's Rights, and now, when we put our
                  doctrine into practice, and have almost accomplished the glorious result, do you
                  eternally wail over that hundred and sixteen dollars? Did we not carry the late
                  election? Did we not exult over the Senate, and the members dared not lay hands on
                  us? You say you cannot live on one meal a day; you do not like water and bread.
                  Are you a glutton? Do the temporal things of life most concern you? Now I tell
                  you, I am seriously considering about reducing our food to one meal a week. I have
                  carefully estimated the wear and tear of the human body, and I find it cannot
                  exceed a pound a week. Whoever eats more than that, is not conversant with or
                  obedient to the laws of Nature. If we raise money enough to publish another
                  edition of our Journal of Progress, I intend to have in it an editorial on eating.
                  You shall see then where you stand. Have you been here all day?"</p>
               <p>"No; I have been very busy."</p>
               <p>"Well, what have you done?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, nothing."</p>
               <p>"Professor Jackson! There are four million slaves in this country; do you know
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do."</p>
               <p>"Well, do you know that the Southern States wish to extend their slave
                  institution, and that to accomplish their purpose they are about to separate from
                  the Free States?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do."</p>
               <p>"Do you know the British Government encourages them in it, in hopes to destroy
                  this nation?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do."</p>
               <p>"And will you sit and remain silent while these evils are being carried out?"</p>
               <p>"I don't want to, but how can a man work without tools?"</p>
               <p>"Tools! Professor? Had you seen the helpless girl—the poor child I just saw—you
                  would not talk of tools. When I have nails on my fingers' ends, I have tools for
                  such work. When I have a tongue, I am provided. Ay, any power left, I can use it,
                  and will. Come on, let us march hand in hand. I have work aboard. The law, feeble
                  as it is, and in as vile hands as it is, may be used."</p>
               <p>"Well, as for this business, I know nothing. But I am sure of failure. It will be
                  a loss of time and loss of money. I think I can do more good going round the
                  country lecturing, than I can in this business. If you will pay me back my hundred
                  and sixteen dollars, I shall like it better."</p>
               <p>"Now, I tell you, unless you arouse yourself up to more action, you shall never
                  have a cent. I shall turn you adrift altogether. You shall learn to treat me as a
                  lady, or I will have done with you. So, there now."</p>
               <p>"Oh, indeed, I meant nothing! I am willing to do anything reasonable. Only lead
                  the way, and I will follow."</p>
               <p>"Come on then, we'll have no more of this."</p>
               <p>He signified his entire consent, and they got up and walked off together, her
                  tongue on the continual clatter, but we heard no more.</p>
               <p>"Oh, that she is not ashamed!" said my companion as soon as we started on, "to let
                  herself become so foreign to the retiring sweetness of woman, which so charms and
                  pleases all men. And that he is shameless in the presence of such a creature, who
                  has so seemingly entailed grief on him till he has no power to shake her off. Why,
                  now, I thought indeed, where laws protected marriage, marriage was the heaven of a
                  lifetime. Truly, it seems where trouble is not forced on us, we ourselves seek it
                  out and adopt it as a desirable thing to live with. But we, that are bound by
                  others, to others whom we abhor, we have real woe. My poor sister Kate, in all
                  this dread while must loiter there, alone in spirit, thought, feelings. Pondering
                  ever on her horrid prospects. Nothing, save the soul within her, feeds her
                  pleading, bleeding power. Even time must linger to wear her patience out. Oh, my
                  poor sister! my poor sister!"</p>
               <p>Again and again she asked herself what she could do for Kate. "Oh, is there
                  nothing I can do? Can I not break open the door and provide her exit? Can I not
                  even speak to her? Shall I desert her now she is in prison? O God, show me what I
                  shall do? Is there no penance worthy of this? Teach me, O my Father in Heaven.
                  Impose upon me that the tearing of the flesh from my arms will free my sister.
                  Take hence an arm, a foot, or, shut up my cars, but O, burst the fetters of that
                  helpless child? Give her freedom! O give her freedom!"</p>
               <p>I told her she should desist in this idle talk, for it amounted to nothing; urging
                  her to use her judgment only. I knew, too, it would not answer for her to see
                  Kate, for she would be sure to betray herself. "Have you no way," said I, "you can
                  send word to Kate?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Why, certainly! Have I forgotten myself? We had it planned. I am to write on
                  a thin paper, send it her in a piece of tobacco. A glorious thought! See; but no!
                  Well. I can at least comfort<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6417-00000045"/> fort her." I
                  was much teased by her excitability, for many people passed us, and some of them
                  frequently turned to look at us. If it should be proved that I was accessory to
                  her disguise, I was safely in for a year's imprisonment myself. Knowing this I
                  cautioned her every few paces, and hurried as fast as I could to the Jackson
                  House. I was anxious to see Ann Underhill, to learn all about her concealing Kate,
                  and to learn too if she had a plan matured for Kate's rescue. In turn I had
                  resolved to tell her all about Lizzie, or, as now called, Joe Travers. I will not
                  deny that I hoped the similarity of our actions would enlist her more in my
                  favor.</p>
               <p>Washington was becoming dangerous for me; men were murdered every day for their
                  political sentiments, if opposed to the slave sentiment of the South. Boasts were
                  common and bets frequent, that Lincoln would never reach Washington alive. At the
                  Planter's Restaurant was an open book on the counter, where men subscribed their
                  names, and the amount they would give to any body who would kill Lincoln. Books of
                  the same kind were opened in nearly all the hotels in Charleston, South Carolina.
                  But this was all called mockery; nonsense; political scare-crow. The threatened
                  aspect called together a body of politicians, nearly all of whom were proslavery
                  men, under the name of a Peace Congress. I was selected as a member of that body,
                  and was now pressed for time in which to accomplish my purposes. The secessionists
                  still held their meetings in the deserted house where Joe was first found by me,
                  and I determined too that Joe, knowing all about the house, should secrete herself
                  on the premises and learn all about their proceedings. Of course, I could not
                  spend much time in trying to free Kate from the Quarters. The affairs of the
                  nation were becoming too serious.</p>
               <p>The writer of this most remarkable history is here ordered to say, that the next
                  chapter is already written, and that whoever looks a little further ahead will
                  discover that fact.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>BEING A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF EVIDENCE ENTIRE; THE RELATIONSHIP OF WHICH CAN
                     ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED BY THOSE MYSTERIES OF WHICH THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL
                     FOREVER REMAIN IGNORANT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER viewing the heading to this chapter, the writer asked Jenkins if it was
                  selected from Everett, and he replied by way of explanation, saying, "While I was
                  travelling in a country where were wealthy pears of State, a nobleman remarked of
                  a steamer, 'Its confluence is the traverse of two bivalves set in motion, like the
                  mist in the Valley of the Nile, where inundations so frequently interrupt the
                  pleasure of travellers, with which I presume everybody in this age is perfectly
                  familiar;' and this was called an eloquent sentence. It was indeed with some pride
                  that I remembered the literature of my own country. But I want the men and women
                  to read, and regardless of an author's name, give him his due; and I wish to wake
                  up my countrymen not to boast of the things here written, or my blunders, but to
                  show them that wit and humor lives in every head, only it is sometimes lost in the
                  stately style of tasteless authors."</p>
               <p>I told Jenkins that he spoke well, but he had not yet told me of the most
                  important part of this history, and that was whether he married Ann Underhill;
                  neither had he told me how it came out with the Judge and Vickey. I never saw
                  Jenkins look so sad; for the manner in which I spoke, made it seem as if I was
                  joking.</p>
               <p>"Wait," said he; "I am only telling what was at that time a too oft repeated tale,
                  and which must now and forever be preserved as one of the most prominent
                  incidents, connected with the early history of the great rebellion—I mean the
                  mysterious disappearance of Miss Underhill, one of the leading belles of the
                  Capital. At any other time in our country's history, such an occurrence would have
                  created the most intense excitement; but the threatened aspect of political
                  affairs had cast its deep shadow over all other things, and made them
                  comparatively trivial. Still, the sudden departure, the mysteriously secret nature
                  of this lady's whereabouts was only second in importance to all else in the
                  Capital."</p>
               <p>First there were whispers about the hotel; then from house to house, until in all
                  the avenues of the city her name became a theme of every tongue. The causes were
                  discussed, and the probable results questioned. Was she dead? Had she eloped? Had
                  she anything to do with the fugitive that was captured at the hotel? Every person
                  acquainted with her told of her beauty, her fame, her fortune. Those unacquainted
                  with her grieved that they had not seen her and known her. Her uncle, Judge
                  Francis, always so cheerful and gay, was now downcast and depressed beyond
                  measure. The joy of many years was now clouded and full of woful suspense. The
                  flower of his life, the theme of his soul's devotion for so many long years, was,
                  without a moment's warning, now gone, no one knew where, and the pangs of a broken
                  heart were his. By day and by night he sat there weeping and saying little, and
                  those who joked him so often before, now respected his tears; for this is one of
                  the most excellent traits of our countrymen.</p>
               <p>On the day following her disappearance, the newspapers were full of notices of
                  her. In New York, Philadelphia, and other cities, the papers called for
                  information of her whereabouts, or anything that would lead to information of her.
                  Large sums of money were offered, but nothing came of that. Days passed by, but
                  still nothing was heard. This was the time that the South Carolina Commissioners
                  came to treat with James Buchanan for the separation of that State from the Union,
                  and the whole country was wrapped up in the interest of the approaching ultimatum.
                  We were all of us at fever heat, for the signs of the times predicted the probable
                  fall of a great and good government.</p>
               <p>The Commissioners, too, longed for the Presidential reception for the crowning of
                  their pet scheme; the consummation of which would have backset the rights of man
                  for many ages. But even while these were their woful prayers, the President in
                  turn was weeping for the inevitable fall of his party, and this it was that bore
                  so heavily on his soul.</p>
               <p>The whole country was in commotion. The storm was seen approaching and near at
                  hand, but, where first it would burst, was the study and whisper of many millions.
                  Omens, signs, and rumors. The South did most their glory boast, and would they
                  fall to with bloody hands? But should they by Lincoln be outdone? Dread deeds, and
                  terrible to the peaceful, great republic. A nation's life or death within the
                  grasp of politicians; for ere our country's fate was settled, thousands and
                  hundreds of thousands must take a soldier's diadem. In the midst of these
                  approaching terrors, how can I give importance to the theme of a single broken
                  heart? How can I show you the eccentric but venerable Judge in tears, forgetful of
                  all around him? And the belle of the Capital, who shall search for our sorrows in
                  the awful mystery of the disappearance?</p>
               <p>Now be it known that, owing to my anonymous character, I am now about to reveal
                  one of the most remarkable attempts at human destruction ever planned on this
                  continent.</p>
               <p>The attempts to head off the threatened was were so feeble by all our Government
                  officers, that some of us felt justified in anything that would avert the coming
                  storm. To this end it was proposed by Prescott that we blow up the secessionists
                  during their secret meeting. Accordingly, we procured a keg of powder, and put it
                  under the deserted house, but owing to a former faithful promise, I will not
                  divulge who all were accessory to the dread deed. My fugitive Joe was employed,
                  and had a hazardous part to play, of which you shall hear by and by. The fuse was
                  attached to the keg and extended into the backyard, and was calculated for six
                  minutes from the time of ignition until the keg of powder would blow up. The time
                  for ignition was set down at about fifteen minutes before eleven. This was on
                  purpose to meet the railroad train going North at eleven. We had also bribed the
                  door-keeper to let the slave-girl, Kate, out at fifteen minutes before eleven.
                  Prescott and I were to remain in Washington, but the two fugitives, owing to the
                  expected excitement, were to start for Canada. So much for the design, now for the
                  execution. Joe, my fugitive, was horrified when I proposed it to her, but finally
                  did, to all appearance, give consent and even praised the invention. We trusted
                  her implicitly. And she also agreed to remain in an obscure place within the house
                  until just before the explosion, in order to tell us who all were sure to die.</p>
               <p>Now, when the night had come, Prescott, and I retired near the place to await the
                  awful moment; our fugitive having effected an entrance and secreted herself within
                  the house. She also awaited the result. In a short time strangers to her came in,
                  amongst whom, as I since learned, were Cobb, Floyd, Thompson, and others.<pb
                     n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6417-00000046"/> She, however, goes on to state that she
                  afterwards distinguished Cobb, having seen him in the South on a previous
                  occasion. Fearing that she might be defected in her hiding place, and that she
                  might be suddenly despatched as a spy, she had provided herself with a pistol to
                  be used as a signal to Prescott and myself.</p>
               <p>In due time the meeting was called to order. Toombs first addressed the members,
                  and, on this occasion, he said he was reluctantly compelled to admit that the
                  firmness of Scott for the Union made it too dangerous an affair to try to change
                  the government of the whole country; but that the South might safely set up for
                  itself, and that, for his part, he was now in favor of hazarding nothing greater
                  than such a design. He then apologized for having, on a previous occasion,
                  prevented other members from advocating the scheme which he now espoused himself.
                  It was on this occasion that a letter was produced informing the members of the
                  meeting that Mr. Russel of the London <title>Times</title> would soon visit the
                  Southern States. Davis and Toombs then advised the selection of Squire Larramie of
                  Virginia, and also one Dr. Thornton of the same place to be sent to England to
                  open a direct communication through the London <title>Times</title> and
                     <title>Post</title> with the people of England, in regard to the rights and
                  demands of the people of the South.<ref rend="super" target="#note_010"

               </note>
               <p>While these harangues were going on, Joe, the spy-fugitive, was watching them,
                  and, in order that she might hear better, she leaned forward a little; for the
                  wind blew through the cracks of the boards where she was holding her ear, and she
                  had not heard all that had been said. Though there were about forty members
                  present, yet Toombs and Davis did nearly all the talking. In thus leaning forward,
                  however, she was enabled to perceive to her chagrin, that the door was guarded by
                  a man with a drawn sword. This person she recognized on the instant. It was
                  Orsini. He was the companion, about a year previous, of an actress in Savannah.
                  That actress was the woman to whom her own master was married. She looked upon him
                  as the murderer of her master, and she involuntarily screamed outright. But having
                  sufficient presence of mind to compose herself, she sat perfectly still. The
                  members of the meeting, however, all started to their feet, immediately
                  mistrusting that a spy was present. They took candles and went about to examine
                  the apartments. As before stated, she sat behind some loose boards, where the wind
                  was blowing, and she feared that the tumult in the house would cause the persons
                  in the yard to anticipate her escape, and so blow them all up together. Still she
                  was compelled to sit quietly as the candles were passed from place to place,
                  toward every corner, until they approached even to the very boards where she was
                  sitting. But with perfect coolness she blew out the candles as fast as they were
                  thrust behind the boards, even on several occasions, and the person having the
                  light in charge simply said "Confound the wind!" Suffice it to say, however, they
                  all came to the conclusion that they had heard no scream at all, but that it had
                  been the wind whistling, and so they resumed business.</p>
               <p>On this occasion Davis stated that it was the determined policy of every one of
                  the members present, that Buchanan should not receive the South Carolina
                  Commissioners. He hoped that not a week would elapse before the batteries of
                  Charleston would open fire on the forts and garrison of Anderson's soldiers. He
                  had heard with joy that Anderson had removed to Fort Sumter, and he considered
                  this of itself an overt act against the South. It was, he said, a menace to the
                  city of Charleston.</p>
               <p>Cobb then wished to know what action, if any, had been taken, in regard to the
                  merchant ship sent out by the Government carrying food to Anderson's garrison.
                  Thompson answered, saying, "The Star of the West—our friends are apprized of her
                  coming to Charleston; our guns will be ready for her reception."<ref rend="super"

                     Secretaryship.</p>
                  <p>Toombs in turn said that twenty-five thousand minute men were already armed
                     and equipped in Virginia ready to march at a given signal into Washington.
                     Many newspapers of the country detailed all the above and the facts were
                     believed to be true, even by the President himself, and yet no action was
                     taken by the Government to prevent the coming destruction.</p>
               </note>
               <p>About this period of time, also, Toombs, Davis, and others publicly expressed the
                  wish that Southern members of Congress should not all leave Washington. They
                  feared that the opposition might pass laws to interfere with their designs; and
                  urged the Southern members to keep their seats as long as possible. These are the
                  facts in detail, perhaps somewhat tediously told, of the plot in the origin and
                  carrying out of the great rebellion. The opposition to the instigators, and the
                  evidence against them was, at the period referred to, of so small moment that to
                  speak of it in any manner was only to elicit ridicule.</p>
               <p>But there were also at this period patriots triots—men firm and determined to use
                  every means, no matter how dreadful, to thwart these apparently wicked designs,
                  and amongst these means was the affair referred to of blowing up the house that
                  contained the leaders. And to do this effectually, we had used every precaution;
                  we had waited till such an hour as would surely catch all the chief leaders; and
                  we could even now, while stationed at the fuse with well-tried matches, hear the
                  fierce murmuring of their villainous tongues. Here for two long hours we sat
                  waiting, watching, wearing, trembling, praying, and justifying the deed before
                  God. All the chances did we weigh, whether we should escape, or whether be caught
                  and hanged, and our heartfelt answer was, God's will be done! Yet withal, most
                  terrible were our convulsions of thoughts, counting the minutes of life and death
                  for our well-caged felons. But then came a new mystery; instead of our fugitive
                  returning to us as we expected, she lingered, she tarried so long. We heard the
                  scream referred to; we heard a rustling in the building; could she have been
                  killed? This troubled us; it set us all on fire. An hour passed; Joe came not. Yet
                  another long hour and she had not come. The time was almost up to light the fuse.
                  What should we do? Who can imagine what an awful suspense was ours? We whispered
                  together, still as the midnight air, and we advised, but heeded not. Yet patience
                  gave us victory. Our fugitive approached us, even a few minutes before the fatal
                  moment. Now was our time. By sign and motion all was made ready. The fatal match
                  was lighted; we saw it burn, and then we leisurely walked away. Our escape was
                  good, orderly, effectual. But how long we waited for the explosion! Six minutes!
                  We waited twenty. Ay, an hour! And no explosion. What could it mean? We dared not
                  return. We had no chance. We needs must go home disappointed. Perhaps might be
                  detected and made to suffer, not for what we did, but for what we attempted.
                  Prescott was downright mad. Joe was mysterious, and seemed discomfited. Neither
                  Prescott nor myself mistrusted but she was heart and soul with us. Though now that
                  the failure was manifest, we needs must look about for our other fugitive, Kate;
                  she had not approached the place designated, and here too were we disappointed.
                  For we traced every street, alley, and lane near the Quarters; but could not find
                  her. Thus, with disappointment on all sides, and the fear of detection too, we
                  wended our way back to lodgings, but not to rest, for the play was scarce
                  begun.</p>
               <p>I cannot now, when reviewing these long past scenes, describe with what
                  astonishment and discomfiture I learned on the following morning of the house
                  having been blown up, and of the escape of the fugitive. My plans and schemes and
                  plots were all frustrated. I set about discovering the cause of what was passed,
                  and to devise something for the future. Bearing strictly in mind, too, that I was
                  the chief suspected person and that a price was set on my head. Added to my
                  distress was also the mysterious disappearance of Miss Underhill. My first desire
                  was to seek such information of her as I could best obtain.</p>
               <p>To do this, I encountered Joe, who was apparently as much discomfited as myself,
                  and at about as much loss how to account for the past occurrences. She then went
                  on to give me a description of such things as might lead me to discover something
                  in relation to Miss Underhill's whereabouts; and related things to me which made
                  it apparent that she might have possibly, in some unguarded moment, consented to
                  an elopement.</p>
               <p>"Only on the evening previous," said Joe, and she came close to me and told me
                  quietly of the apparent attachment between the two. "Only on the evening previous
                  to this," said she, "Wadsworth spoke to her of the beauties of his Southern home,
                  and of his own loneliness. She was attending to all he said. As if to urge him to
                  cure his maladies with some congenial fair one, she assured him any one might be
                  happy with such a home, and almost hinted that the dreams of such a spot had
                  consoled her own lone heart. Yet not quite did either one speak that which I most
                  wished to hear, and which, too, I thought each of them wished to say but dared
                  not. And thus it ran from day to day. At times he spoke of his intended departure,
                  but still he lingered. At times he spoke of the dreadful aspect of the country. He
                  told her that his fortunes were in the South, and if war came he feared his ruin.
                  And then he thought if ruin came, he could not think of entailing that ruin on
                  another. Thus by indirect hints, and by apparent backwardness between the two, I
                  could only discover that their attachment was guarded by serious affairs." Joe was
                  quick at thought, and turning to me, she added: "But see, Wadsworth, you know, is
                  not gone. Now, were he gone, we could be content; for then we could say They are
                  truly eloped. This pair has flown together: but while he<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000047"/> is here, and himself overcome by the course of
                  things, all my conjectures are eclipsed; they are not gone together." And so, in
                  fact, it was with us all. No one to whom this fair lady was attached had
                  disappeared with her. Her dearest and best friends, and her most ardent admirers
                  were still in Washington.</p>
               <p>Now, it so happened a few days after her disappearance, and when Joe and Judge
                  Francis Underhill and myself were returning from a place where we had been making
                  inquiries regarding recent incidents of Miss Underhill, we came to a corner of
                  Pennsylvania Avenue, where we met, at diverse angles, Victoria Edge and her aunt.
                  There could not have been a better or more opportune occurrence to divert the
                  melancholy of us all. Vickey was gay and joyful, to all appearances; but the aunt
                  was so strange and so seemingly out of place, that we were completely astounded
                  and not displeased with the difference in style.</p>
               <p>The Judge braced himself backward a moment on his walking-stick, ejaculating, "Ah,
                  indeed, these happy moments! Never winter came, but smiling summer followed; never
                  sorrow lingered, but bountiful nature sent a joy to outmatch it. Welcome, you who,
                  more than all the world beside, can fill the place of gentle Ann. You, the pride
                  and joy of a broken-hearted old man—the pride, the joy, the reciprocal tie to a
                  heart-broken old man!" And then with a handkerchief all doubled up, he cleared his
                  face. Vickey, not thinking but his address was delivered to her aunt, wist not
                  what to say, but smiling, turned toward the ancient maid, who was indeed the
                  strangest figure. Alack, I must tell you, she had been to the dentist, and her
                  mouth was stuffed with a double set of teeth, and plumpers stretching her withered
                  cheeks to the utmost. Tightly she clenched her jaws to hold the awful contents,
                  and not a word could speak.</p>
               <p>"You must excuse her," said Vickey, "she's just got a new set of teeth, and she
                  cannot talk. Meantime I am happy to reply in her behalf and for myself also, that
                  your bereavement has also well nigh distracted me. Since your niece disappeared, I
                  have not had a moment's happiness. I am indeed so miserable I can only add to your
                  own affliction." She then turned to Joe and me and very cordially greeted us. In a
                  minute more we were walking all on together. But as five cannot walk abreast, so
                  the Judge and Vickey got ahead, and in spite of myself I was obliged to be the
                  arms-bearer to the old maid. Joe, in spite of all the horrors and woful scenes she
                  had passed, now hung her head and screened off the oft recurring laugh. Again and
                  again the old maid attempted to speak, but her teeth and plumpers so stretched her
                  mouth she always failed. Two or three times they got loose and well nigh made
                  their escape from her mouth, but she caught them and crammed them back. People
                  were passing us and continually turning to look at her; and she walked so limpy
                  and slow, so proud of her patent bosom and high-topped bonnet, the latter all
                  tipped and tinselled with gold, and such hoops; my legs tilted them a yard high on
                  the other side. It was the fashionable hour on Pennsylvania Avenue, and even the
                  leisurely promenading ladies and gentlemen of fashion walked faster than we. Those
                  who came along on the other side, from behind, and passed us, having seen the old
                  maid's fine bonnet and fine dress, beneath whose up-tilted skirt hung common
                  flannel half down her wrinkled stockings, turned, when just ahead, to see the face
                  of so strange a woman. Here, behold—they did behold a face like a famished
                  squirrel's full of nuts. Next they looked at me and then at Joe. They were
                  astonished; nudging and grinning all the way. I wished seriously I was at home. It
                  seemed to me that always when I went anywhere, I got the oldest and ugliest girls.
                  The hotel was yet so far off. And then, too, if that mischievous clerk should be
                  watching for us; and he should see me with the old maid? I sighed for an
                  interruption. If only Floyd would come, or Orsini, and challenge me, or if some
                  special messenger should call me. Doomed to walk with the most foolishly dressed
                  old maid; with a face for the grave, and a frock for a flirting girl of fifteen.
                  Fortunately, however, a change occurred, and I was relieved. A man came galloping
                  down the avenue, and seeing me, halted just opposite where we were. He beckoned
                  for me to approach him, and I did so. I had never seen him before, and though
                  under other circumstances I might have hesitated, yet now, being so anxious to get
                  rid of the old maid, I gladly accepted his invitation to proceed in another
                  direction, leaving Joe without any instructions as to what she should do; only
                  saying that I should be at the Jackson House ere long.</p>
               <p>At this important part of the history, the writer is obliged to strike off from
                  the main column, to deal with one of the wings thereof. It must be remembered that
                  heretofore this history has been written in subsequent time; the reader has been
                  following lowing the story; but from this point onward, the prospective will bear
                  a very important part. What is to be said now is selected from Jenkins' notes in
                  advance of the place here stopped at, and it begins in this fashion, to wit:</p>
               <p>Not long after Ann Underhill became acquainted with Wadsworth, she took to the
                  habit of promenading on the outer porch of the hotel, and frequently alone. Those
                  who are acquainted with this house know that the porch alluded to is very pleasant
                  in the afternoon, and is often the resort of persons of fashion. To see a lady
                  walking there is nothing strange; one would hardly question whether she be in love
                  or in quest of a lover; he would hardly straighten himself up and walk with a
                  brisker step at the sight of her; hardly put the squint-glasses on his nose;
                  hardly pull out his chronometer, or even twaddle his walking-stick against his
                  leg. Thus could she loiter there, as others often did, and scarce a person noticed
                  it. The excitement in Washington at this time was very great; the rebels had made
                  constant threats to take the city, and many of the residents of the place
                  apprehended serious trouble. Many foreigners were in the city, and inasmuch as
                  they were never accustomed to see young ladies unattended in the streets, they
                  could not now, and believe them to be as chaste and holy as angels. American young
                  ladies do not like to have fops turn their squint-glasses full in their faces at
                  every corner. They are little rebels against such impertinence. They are not
                  ignorant of the motives of such men, and know how to judge them. And this is the
                  chief reason that ladies ceased to promenade alone. The prospect of war had
                  brought "men on leave" from foreign navies and armies, and their conceptions of
                  America, formed on the basis of their own countries, had polluted the social air.
                  Many young ladies would not call on their friends, unless attended by one or two
                  companions. So, when cut short the old way, they must seek exercise by some other.
                  Thus it was our gentle Ann took relief on many an afternoon on the outer porch.
                  Vickey had been for a good while engaged in fitting up her aunt for fashionable
                  life, and was necessarily absent much of the time. According to the clerk's story,
                  Vickey fully believed the Judge would marry the old maid; but the clerk had
                  cautioned the Edge family to keep it an entire secret from Ann, lest the latter
                  should break off the match; for the clerk knew that, however eccentric the Judge
                  was, yet his niece would not tolerate any advantage to be taken of him. She loved
                  him dearly. She was without any other near relative; and he had ever been with her
                  and watched over her. She was his only sister's child, bequeathed to him as the
                  last of the Underhill children. The Judge claimed to be descended from persons of
                  the highest quality, and he ever esteemed his neice as of a superior race. He had
                  provided her the best teachers; he had taken her constantly into the very best
                  society. Of course, he petted her; he had made her his ruler; she was his guiding
                  angel. She was mistress of Loudon Heights. Whatever was required by her, was
                  furnished at once. Yet she was not spoiled. She had good, sound sense. She knew
                  her uncle's eccentricities, his egotism, and his boasting, but she never mentioned
                  them, or, if so, only to please him. She never found fault, never complained; but
                  she pleased him till he made himself as her child, yet she commanded not—for such
                  is woman's chiefest power. Nor had she stateliness nor much to awe with at first
                  beholding; but more by mirth and backwardness calling out all that is noble in man
                  in her behalf; for what man, though he crush the blooming thistle, would not
                  fondly hold the violet and therewith join his heavenly converse? Nor was she
                  silent, nor pleading with pretended faintness of voice; but frolicsome with due
                  demeanor, and ever at a game of harmless mischief, as makes man ever remember and
                  treasure each passing moment. Nor ventured she her wit on persons, nor passed a
                  pun that ever pained another; only on things did her wit and humor tell. And such
                  decorum had she when you spake your sorrows, she seemed to pray to Heaven in your
                  behalf; though mostly is she described as a merry, good-hearted girl and
                  everybody's favorite. Every one who knew her was kind to the Judge, for none would
                  do aught to grieve her. She was likely to become heir to her uncle's estate, and
                  of course had many inquiring friends. Lovers had been after her since she was a
                  child, and, as in her childhood she had valued them, so now the serious part
                  thereof seemed not to disturb her. There had been acquaintances with whom she
                  played in infancy; with whom she danced and walked now in her youth. One of those
                  was a young man by the name of Perkins. The Judge had cautioned her three years
                  before that Perkins was a fast young man, and so she knew it and was cautious.
                  They had been much together when little children, and she knew that he was a
                  brave, adventurous<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6417-00000048"/> ous person. Now it so
                  turned out that, when this boy grew up to the size of a man, he became a gambler
                  and a politician, being a wealthy man's son, and not provided with any trade or
                  profession. It was said he came to Washington as a lobby-man—that is, to help at
                  outside pressure to get bills through Congress; that he was paid for such services
                  by large contractors and by railroad companies. Be that as it may, he was often
                  without money, though his father always provided him well. Now it is a principle
                  in society, long established, that, such men are always ready to marry any sort of
                  woman for money, and especially if she be young and handsome. This man—if a person
                  of twenty one years be a man—had proposed marriage to Ann Underhill a year since,
                  and had been rejected. Yet, according to his personal appearance, he was an
                  excellent match; and he would also some day inherit a fortune by his own father.
                  He had not openly proposed marriage, nor had she positively denied him. He had
                  merely ventured in the neighborhood, and she had tossed up her hand. He despaired,
                  because he feared her uncle knew too much about him, and he ventured only so far
                  as to satisfy himself that it would be hopeless; though he hoped still, and often
                  came near about, her, but not to give offence, for he was an accomplished
                  gentleman. He had noticed her apparent attention to Wadsworth, and he inwardly
                  resolved—at least it afterward seemed so—that by some means or other he would
                  carry off the prize.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, he watched her, and often he saw her promenading on the porch as
                  before mentioned, and then he would accidentally, so seeming, endeavor to come
                  there himself. Sometimes he would wait to see if her promenading there had
                  anything to do with Wadsworth. Once he ventured to ask her why she walked there.
                  She told him there was so much excitement in the streets, and so many of those
                  foreign squint-glasses, she could not go out so well as before, and that she
                  loitered here in consequence. But he believed her not. An evil mind doubteth
                  everybody. So he watched her more. One evening he observed her looking over the
                  banister at a lady passing on the sidewalk. He saw the latter toss a paper on the
                  porch, and Ann picked it up. 'Twas nearly night. The lady, or girl rather, who
                  threw up the paper was veiled, and quickly disappeared. Ann turned the paper
                  toward the light, and read it. Her hands fell; she was astonished. She looked over
                  the side; the person was gone. Again she read the paper, and now pressed her hand
                  on her forehead. Perkins was puzzled, and determined to await the result. In a
                  moment, however, she was gone. He sought her, but was told she had gone to her
                  room. Still he doubted, and lingered near. And, fortunately for him, Mr. Edge came
                  in. He had had much to do for Edge; Edge used him as a pump-handle, in Congress.
                  Judge Francis Underhill was a fine gentleman—man very fine for women; but, in
                  Edge's eyes, he was nothing for business. Edge was smart. He could soon find out
                  his man, and he liked those best who would buy and sell. Perkins suited him
                  exactly, because Perkins would sell his word, his honor, his friend, or anything
                  else, to the highest bidder. So these two cronies sat to talk, but sat where
                  Perkins could observe. Long they waited there; talked over all the stocks; all the
                  railroads, the canals, steamships, steamboats, etc., etc., peculiar to politicians
                  and stock brokers. At once, however, Perkins starts, excuses himself, and so Edge
                  goes away. This was Perkins' time. Ann came down; looked at her watch; hesitated a
                  moment, and then went out on the porch. It was quite dark. No one else was there,
                  Perkins mistrusted. Soon, from the lower steps, a lady came up, and, at near
                  approach to Ann, halted, and entered into conversation. No one else heard them,
                  only Perkins—suspicious man!—who had slipped beneath the curtains, and was
                  listening to catch the words. Oh, villainous man, caves-dropper to such tender
                  ones! Suspicious mortal! A hush, a caution! He heard the words,
                  Starved—lost—sister—must die! "But he heard no more. This was enough. Sharp man,
                  he knew she must be one of the runaway slaves.</p>
               <p>Now stealthily Ann and the fugitive entered the hotel and passed from view. A
                  paper fell as they passed the door, and Perkins eagerly sought and seized it. Now
                  to the light, and thus he read:</p>

               <p>Perkins knew it all. Three hundred dollars; were ready to be picked up, and he
                  resolved to do it. On went his hat, and off he started; but ere he reached
                  Russel's house he thought of the other fugitive, the sister for five hundred
                  dollars. To make the greater sum certain, he resolved to wait a few days,
                  believing that the other fugitive would come to this one. Here now became his
                  special watch, and he was often seen loitering round the hotel for hours, ay, and
                  for days.</p>
               <p>Ann was much affected by the tale that Kate told her, and became more secluded and
                  less mirthful. The fugitive she kept in a secret room nearly all the time, only at
                  early morn or in the evening late did she permit her to go out. She had resolved
                  that, as soon as Kate found her sister, she would herself, conduct them safely off
                  to Canada. After a few days had passed, however, they both began to believe that
                  the fugitive Lizzie had gone ahead. Ann applied to the Judge for money, and of
                  course he gave it her. She had only to mature some plan of action, and to set it
                  on foot. The two girls often weighed the matter together, and as often formed some
                  new plan of reaching Canada. Finally, though, they fixed upon a time—the evening
                  train of a certain day. But how to travel to excite no suspicion, that was the
                  matter, and thus was their woman's invention planned. They were to travel as
                  mothers. But, not having babies, they resolved to get two monstrous dolls, and
                  have them dressed in the finest embroidery, with long trails; to keep them muffled
                  up, as if very solicitous of the little dears' welfare. Of course, conductors and
                  private detectives would treat them kindly. Accordingly, the dolls were purchased,
                  and Kate entered upon the work of adorning them. Two whole days and nights they
                  provided the things; sometimes so merrily congratulating themselves on the surety
                  of their enterprise. At last the affairs were all completed; they had only to wait
                  for the night to come. But lo! foolish girls, vain hopes! The Old Boy had his
                  snares around you! He had a shrewd instrument watching over you, and that was
                  Perkins. He despaired of the other fugitive coming, and he resolved to make good
                  the first. On a fair morning he sent the marshal, and Kate was taken to the
                  Quarters. Ann was nearly distracted. The toilet was there, and so were the dolls;
                  but gone was the gentle youth with whom she had longed to fly. This was her day of
                  weeping, but not of despair. She saw Perkins when the capture was made, but
                  supposed him innocent. On the afternoon of the same day she saw him again at the
                  hotel, and she resolved to bride him to get the fugitive's escape. Accordingly,
                  she placed herself on the outer porch, and waited till he came up. He was every
                  inch a gentleman in appearance and style, and, after saluting her, he hoped she
                  had recovered from the fright in the morning.</p>
               <p>"Indeed I have not," said she, "and I fear I never shall. The awe of that moment,
                  and the contemplated horrors awaiting that poor girl, have sent a chill to me that
                  will never, never cease."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I do think it was dreadful," said he.</p>
               <p>"And yet you opposed it not?" said she.</p>
               <p>"I dared not; 'twould have sent me up for three years. Indeed, I abhor such
                  things; but I must preserve my own liberty first, and then to others give it."</p>
               <p>"Had you known that girl, and the life that awaits her, you would have saved
                  her."</p>
               <p>"I would without knowing her, if I could. But the law must be carried out, and, of
                  course, there are such as would always, for the reward of three hundred dollars,
                  betray a fugitive. But as you have spoken of her and of the life that awaits her,
                  I should be pleased to learn it myself from one who would be pleased to tell it.
                  Perhaps I might yet meliorate her condition."</p>
               <p>"No one would be pleased to tell it. No one can meliorate her condition. Money is
                  of little value, and brave hearts are scarce. Her owner will not sell her, or I
                  could save her. She is in chains, and you can do her no good."</p>
               <p>"Now, that is strange, you tell me this. Do you remember ever a thing I tried, and
                  failed in? Do you know a thing that money cannot get? Now, I will wager you to the
                  value of a fine bonnet that I can get that girl's chains off before tomorrow
                  morning's sun for one hundred dollars."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"Will you wager?"</p>
               <p>"I will; and I will furnish the money."</p>
               <p>"Done!" said he; and "Done!" said she.</p>
               <p>Now, it followed that she told him all she knew about the fugitive, and of their
                  plan to escape to Canada, and he seemed much affected by it, often exclaiming,
                  "Oh, had I known this! Oh, what monsters some men are! Poor, poor girl! But now,
                  hark you! you shall yet carry out your purpose. To-morrow morning shall you start
                  for Canada. I ask no favors; I want no money. It is a most holy cause, and highly
                  honorable."</p>
               <p>She believed him; thought he had still a noble nature, and she would fain clap her
                  hands with joy at the coming prospect. He told her to hold herself in readiness on
                  the following morning, before<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6417-00000049"/> fore the
                  break of day, and then he left her. She was much pleased; was never so happy
                  before. Thus did she while away the time; having worked herself up to such a
                  nervous pitch about it she had no rest. Poor girl, how simple and childlike in
                  human discernment! Thou hast been talking with a devil. The old maid with the
                  plumpers, whom thou wouldst laugh at, were it not for thy better manners, is an
                  angel. She rises at the early cock-crowing of the morning, because, forsooth, she
                  never learned the fashions. She walks before the break of day to taste the morning
                  air. But hold ye yet! the future is known to no mortal. There is a purpose in all
                  the habits of man that safely leads conception on to their holy origin.</p>
               <p>Perkins resolved to use the other hundred dollars as a bribe, and then to make a
                  stronger and more lasting hold upon gentle Ann. To get her captured with the
                  fugitive, as herself a fugitive, and then to have——</p>
               <p>The writer of this great history is obliged to apologize for this abrupt
                  termination to Jenkins' notes on this subject. And he will also apologize for what
                  is coming immediately after, to wit:</p>
               <p>Ere the morning came, gentle Ann arose and left the Jackson House. In her arms
                  were the dolls, and she had thick shawls over them. She was too impatient to wait
                  for Perkins, and so repaired to the Quarters, or near there, and watched and
                  waited. Two men, disguised opened the door, and out came the fugitive. Ann
                  followed, fearing at first, and ever keeping in the rear. When they had walked so
                  she could see them fairly, so she could make sure they were the right persons,
                  they halted, having met a third man wrapped in a cloak. To him the slave was
                  confided, and the other two started, of course for the Jackson House. Ann would
                  have called them, but she was too much frightened, and so stood there. In a little
                  while there was a loud report. The guard ran away, but the slave stood firm. Then
                  Ann came up and greeted her, each wellnigh overcome at so unexpected a meeting.
                  Thence they flew for the railway station fast as possible, or at least fast as two
                  young women with very young babies could. What was their surprise, however, ere
                  they had gone far, to be accosted by a man in deep disguise, and demanded to halt.
                  "I know you!" he said; "you are the fugitives, Lizzie and Kate. Here, you
                  wretches, I will cowhide you?" and he seized them, and was beginning to handle
                  them roughly, when lo! the simple old maid came near, being even before daylight
                  out to take her morning walk. "What on earth's the matter?" said she. "Here,
                  police! soldiers! watchmen!" and she screamed as if her throat were of brass. The
                  villain ran off. But he had so frightened the poor girls, and had withal thrown
                  away their dolls, that they feared to go to the railway station. Not knowing what
                  to do, however, they ran, and the old maid then got frightened, and she ran too.
                  But she was so slow she soon lost sight of the others. Two men then came, and,
                  overtaking her, asked for the two girls, assuring her that they were friends. She
                  told them the direction, and they pursued. The old maid then went home, and told
                  what she had seen, assuring everybody that she would never take another walk at so
                  early an hour in the morning. The girls ran toward the Potomac, anon beholding
                  their pursuers and again avoiding them. In a short time they neared the river
                  bank, and coming to a rickety old boat, they just succeeded in getting into it and
                  shoving off from shore, when the men, to them unknown, came up. Ann at once
                  resolved to cross the river, she herself pulling on the oars, with a full
                  determination to get on the first train for some indirect route to Canada. She
                  never knew before how strong she was, or what resolution a little fear could give
                  her. But this was in fact a feat of much magnitude, and must result in nothing
                  short of failure.</p>
               <p>With what triumphant feelings they shot out upon the river. The discomfited
                  pursuers were amazed. No other boat was there, and the girls felt so completely
                  master of the attempt that they would have shouted to them in derision had not
                  their lives been in peril by the unsafe vessel they were in. But their joy was
                  soon brought to a close. Some idle sailors were passing, and they saw and heard
                  their pursuers beckon to them. The girls put forth all their power, for they next
                  beheld approaching from the shore the sailors' boat, with the two men in it. The
                  sight appalled them. The distance to be rowed was yet very great, and all odds
                  were against them. Not strength, but weakness, came over them, though they pulled
                  with all their might. It was now sunrise, and they were exactly between their
                  pursuers and the sun. Again they heard another explosion, or a not far-off cannon.
                  Kate felt the awful danger to her, and she now seized the oars and took them from
                  Ann, who was astonished how strong the slave was. Their frail boat took a new
                  start. Hope again lived, and for half an hour they sped forward without doubt. But
                  then uncertainty revived. The boat of the stalwart men came after them like a
                  steamer, casting the shining water in flaming wings on either side. The tears
                  involuntarily flooded the eyes of the poor girls as the dread fate began to
                  appear. Nearer came the long-desired shore, but still nearer the never-faltering
                  boat behind. Soon they hailed the girls, who made no answer. They were then near
                  the shore, but the impossible could not be. Kate saw it, and she dropped oars.
                  "Oh, my God! my God!" said she; "I am forever doomed! You see—you see, they are
                  here! Now I will drown myself. I will never be taken alive, so help me Heaven!"
                  "Hold! hold!" said Ann; "Heaven save her!" and she caught hold of her, but she
                  jerked loose, exclaiming, "No, never! Let go; I'll die! Here! If ever you find my
                  lone sister, give her this pin; say it was from Kate, even while the perils of
                  slavery were stripped of every hope, and the darkest crimes of licentious man
                  found refuge in American law. Tell her that my constant prayers to heaven are but
                  the folly of vain hopes; but yet within my breast is a natural flame that burns
                  forever chaste and pure, and so I die!" Ann was then holding her, but the other
                  broke loose, being almost frantic and wild. Then, standing up, she leaped
                  overboard, but did not sink at once. With her mouth full of water, she shouted,
                  "God bless you!" and then she went down. But she could not sink well. Ann was
                  frightened. Both men saw her; they were at once alongside. One of them, the
                  smaller of the two, caught her dress, and they pulled her into their boat. This
                  was the first time Ann looked at their faces; both were strangers. One of them
                  said, "Now for the other!" and he seized Ann's boat. The girls were then only the
                  breadth of a street from the other shore. Ann did not know if Kate was alive or
                  dead, but asked, and one of the men said, "Stop your mouth, girl, or I'll cowhide
                  you! "She was frightened. He did not say she was a fugitive till they got ashore
                  on the other side, and they would not let her speak. The men took a tie rope off
                  the boat, and tied them together. After about ten minutes Kate was able to walk,
                  but she looked more like one dead than alive. The men then ordered the girls to
                  march. Their hands were fastened behind their backs. The men swore fearfully, and,
                  if Ann attempted to speak, they beat her. She knew they mistook her for a slave,
                  but she had no way to prove herself, and was crying; but Kate did not cry. One of
                  the men said that, before six months, they would wallop such wenches in the
                  streets of New York and Boston. The other said, "It takes us to do it! When we
                  strike out, the world will go with us. The London <title>Times</title> and
                     <title>Post,</title> and all the nobility, will be with us. "And then they
                  would say, "Trot along there, runaway! You'll get it good when you get home!" but
                  they used words that cannot be mentioned, though they were very merry. Ann would
                  say, "I am no slave; I am Miss Underhill, of Loudon Heights;" but they said, "Hush
                  up, wench! we've heard that sort of stuff before;" and then they kicked her. She
                  soon became quite faint, but expected every moment something would turn up to
                  release her. After a while they came to a road, and some people passed them. Ann
                  screamed out to them, and told them who she was, but got severely bruised for it.
                  One of the men said, if she opened her mouth again, he would put the gags on her.
                  This was before they came to the cabin. The cabin is about half a mile, perhaps
                  more. The cabin is a railway station, and is small, with only one door and one
                  window, and a bench in front. They were compelled to sit here, but hardly had
                  taken seat, when they heard a yell near by, and, on looking over the way, saw a
                  crowd of a dozen men hanging a man to a tree. One of the captors said, "There goes
                  another Abolitionist!" and he ended with an oath. A train of cars then came
                  alongside, and halted. The girls were ordered aboard. Again Ann protested against
                  her capture, and assured them of her name; but they would not hear her. "I can
                  prove myself," said she; "I have money. In my pocket is a purse of six hundred
                  dollars. "The men all laughed, and one of them put his hand in her pocket and took
                  the money, saying, "I know, now, we're right. The elder of the fugitives had
                  money. This is the person. Not another word now, you ——!" and he thrust them into
                  the cars, swearing at them all the time. He got into the cars also, but his
                  companion did not go with the train. Kate was very ill, even as if she might die.
                  Dark purple sat in round her eyes, and she had lost her senses, for she spoke not,
                  and hardly ever looked at any one. The train then started, but the girls knew not
                  where they were going. They were taken, however, to Montgomery, South Carolina,
                  and put in the Quarters there. Word was then sent to Russel to come on and pay
                  charges and take his slaves; but he<pb n="98-99 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000050"/> was two days coming. In the meantime the girls were
                  kept locked up, and no one whatever, save a simple old negress, ever saw them.
                  There was great excitement in Montgomery at this time. Secession delegates had
                  arrived from all parts of the South, for the purpose of electing a President. Some
                  of them were continually making stump speeches; some declaring that their
                  President would be for the Southern States alone, but others said they were
                  determined to rule over the whole country. They said they would give the New
                  England States to England, Mexico to France, and Central America to Spain. They
                  openly avowed that Squire Larimie was already off to Europe to carry out these
                  plans; that they had money enough to buy up all the foreign newspapers, and that
                  in that way they would rule Europe itself. The people were all enthusiastic.
                  Business of all kinds was suspended; no courts or tribunals were at post. Nearly
                  every day some one was murdered for Abolitionism. Parties of ten, twenty, or fifty
                  men roved about in quest of victims; any one suspected of opposition to slavery or
                  secession was seized, and marched with a tether rope around his neck to the
                  nearest tree, and there hanged. Women became infatuated with the excitement.
                  Seventy first-class ladies formed themselves into a vigilance committee, and often
                  paraded the streets of Montgomery in a body. On one occasion they were jeered at
                  by a carman, because they interfered with his horse and wagon by their unseemly
                  marching. They at once accused him of being an Abolitionist, and surrounded him.
                  With the lines of the harness they entangled him, and would have slain him on the
                  spot but for his agility. But, when he broke loose and ran, a gentleman shot him.
                  The ball took effect in his neck, and he fell, and expired in a few minutes. The
                  ladies all dipped their hands in his blood, and swore they would not wash it away
                  till every Abolitionist in the country was annihilated. This occurred on the very
                  day that Russel came for his slaves. Many people in the city knew Russel. He was a
                  large dealer in slaves, having a plantation in Virginia for growing them, and
                  often visiting all parts of the South to sell them. He repaired immediately to the
                  Quarters, but no sooner beheld gentle Ann, than he denied that she was his slave.
                  He did not believe she was a negro, but he verily believed she looked like the
                  Abolition wretch that tried to steal his slave Kate. He could not let her out of
                  the Quarters without an order from the constable, and the constable could not do
                  it without a voucher as to who she was. They therefore took a leisurely stroll to
                  consider the matter, and finally resolved to telegraph to Perkins, at Washington,
                  to learn the truth of the girl's story. In a few minutes they got a reply, stating
                  that they were to keep her confined till he came down; that dreadful suspicions
                  were afloat about her. Already was there such vigilance on the cars, and so much
                  watching for Abolitionists, that the cars ran at only half their usual speed. The
                  consequence was, that the poor girls had remained in all seven days in the
                  Quarters when Perkins arrived. The Quarters here were in the suburbs of the city;
                  it was merely a large log cabin, without a window, and having only one door. At
                  one extreme end were the necessary closets, with water, etc.; but the slaves were
                  all unchained, being seven in number. There were five different open spaces
                  between the logs, about the size of a man's arm, which answered for windows. At
                  one side was a plentiful pile of hay to sleep on, but there was no other bedding.
                  The negress kept to feed them passed the food through the open spaces mentioned.
                  Most of the time the slaves sat or lay on the hay, indifferent to any casual
                  observer who might chance, to be curious enough to look through the cracks to see
                  them. When Perkins came to look in, gentle Ann was seated on the hay, beside the
                  others. She was pale and silent, her head resting against the rude logs, and her
                  feet drawn up underneath her. She had been stripped of her hoops, and her clothes
                  were in evil trim; her golden ringlets were fizzled and faded, and frowning
                  wrinkles had already seared her fair forehead. She was not asleep, but fixedly
                  gazing aside, and seeing nothing, nor heedful of the noise near the door; but much
                  swollen were her eyes, and her fair bosom still heaved with the latent fire of
                  noble blood. Beside her lay the fugitive, Kate, sound asleep. She had not changed
                  since first her capture, save that she had nearly recovered her health. Long abuse
                  had hardened her. Now, when Perkins came up and looked in the Quarters, and beheld
                  the ruin he had purposely made, he fancied the girl before him would never detect
                  the manner of his mischief, and that, by pretending to be her rescuer, he would be
                  sure to get her acknowledgment in marriage. So, after he had looked in a moment,
                  he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miss Underhill! what sad misfortune is this?" She started, and turned<figure/>
                  <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6417-00000051"/> toward him. "Is it possible," he
                  continued, "that this sad late has come upon you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Perkins, I thank God that you are here," said she, springing up, and
                  running to him. "It seemed no one would ever come, and I am almost dead. Get me
                  out of this! Oh, I cannot live! What horrors I have undergone!" and she made such
                  eccentric ejaculations, that he almost feared she was losing her wits, wringing
                  her hands all the while, and crying at a furious rate. As soon as she gave him an
                  opportunity, he replied very kindly to her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, that I could have had your pains and bruises, myself!" said he. "Ever since
                  last I saw you, I have been well-nigh distracted about you. Not a day, not an
                  hour, not a minute have I ceased to seek for you. Why did you not await at the
                  Jackson House till I called for you? And yet I have heaped constant abuse on
                  myself for letting you think of such an undertaking in the first place. Oh, that I
                  had told you to stay at home, and I had taken the fugitive to Canada myself! Can
                  you ever forgive such great neglect? Oh, I have died a thousand deaths!" and he,
                  too, rubbed hard upon his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir grieve not!" said she; "I know it was all my fault. You are a most kind
                  and noble man. I can never repay you for coming so far to rescue me from this
                  cruel fate. Oh, I am so thankful that you have come! Go, please, at once, to the
                  constable, and get me out. May Heaven aid me to repay you!"</p>
               <p>Again he made protestations of his own suffering in her behalf; and then, duly
                  assuring her that he would soon get her out, he took his leave. All this while
                  Kate lay asleep, and Ann knew not whether to awaken her or not, thinking it would
                  perhaps be better to go away silently, than to take a farewell of one who was
                  doomed to slavery forever—of one whom she would never see more, and whom she could
                  never benefit. Kate was yet ill from the effects of attempted drowning, and now
                  seemed more of a resigned, heart-broken Christian, fit to be taken to a bed of
                  death, than a slave to work in the cotton fields. But such could not be; for, even
                  while gentle Ann gazed on the pallid, sleeping slave, the voice of the Christian
                  white man was heard in the street, exultant singing, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Away down South in the land of cotton,</l>
                        <l>Cinnamon seeds and sandy bottom, etc., etc."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Perkins soon returned, and in much haste informed her that the story was spread
                  abroad that she was an Abolitionist, and that the constable had kept her there for
                  safety, to herself; that everybody concerned believed she would lose her life if
                  taken out publicly; that she should have some one to vouch for her and take care
                  of her; that as for himself, he was engaged in affairs of state, and did not wish
                  to compromise himself; but that, if she had reliable friends in Washington, he
                  would send word for them to come after her. While he spake thus she was almost
                  frozen with his words, for he kept continually affecting to weep.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, it seems to me," she at last ventured in a pleading manner, "that you can
                  get me out, if you will try as hard for me as I would for another situated as I
                  am."</p>
               <p>"You tried to save Kate," said he, "but what have you gained by it? Shall I
                  entangle myself to save you, and be thereby brought, with yourself, to an untimely
                  end? Nay, say that you demand this risk of me, and I will venture on it. Yet, in
                  all candor, I ask, why I shall be put upon such an ordeal, when there are others
                  with whom you would so much prefer to hazard the fate? Could I take your place,
                  and send you safely to Washington, I would most gladly do it. But we must not put
                  aside our judgment; we know the streets are all in riot; what shall we do?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I know not. I do not wish to endanger you. But cannot you buy me out? Offer
                  the city here a mountain of money—anything—if the authorities will only give me
                  safe conveyance back to Washington. Ask anything, and I will give it."</p>
               <p>"I want no money, nor does any one I know of. Nor can I hazard now what I could
                  have before."</p>
               <p>"I do not understand!"</p>
               <p>"You grieve me. You blame me because I do not throw my life away for you, and, in
                  turn for the risk I run, you offer me money."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how much you mistake me! Had I a friend, nay, even an enemy in prison thus,
                  so wrongly, I would wade through fire to open the doors. I would make even my
                  enemy love me for the deep interest I took in it."</p>
               <p>"If I could do that too, why, I would."</p>
               <p>"You are so strange!"</p>
               <p>"Must I then explain? Yes, though my heart break, I will speak. When I was in some
                  show of adversity, and the evil tongue of others injured me, while you were
                  surrounded by vain flatterers, I was cancelled from my childhood dreams. Now, when
                  the tide of my fortune is at its flood, when I stand at the proper age of virtuous
                  discretion, and penitent for the idles of other days, you, and yourself with a
                  city against you, must knock at the door of my generosity Alas, I cannot, cannot
                  say more!" and then he wept, while she, in much amazement and sorrow, looked on,
                  trying to think what to reply.</p>
               <p>"I believe you are truly noble," at last she timidly spake, "and that I have been
                  too neglectful. But oh, you cannot, must not compromise me in this evil plight!
                  How can I live till another come for me?—and if the communication should be
                  closed? You know I am but a child yet before the law. I have a guardian who is
                  master of me. If I disobey him, I will be turned out on the world—with nothing;
                  and, with nothing, I ask you in all candor, what would be my attractions to any
                  man? Now I pray you, that, as I regard you nobly for having come so far for me,
                  that in my heart I feel that I can never repay your kindness, ask no more of me
                  now, but give me my liberty."</p>
               <p>"If your liberty were in my hand, I would give it you. But, as to your
                  attractions, with nothing else to aid you, they are more to me than all the world
                  beside; they have usurped my every other joy, and hold me desolate from all
                  things. I know your uncle, and all else you allude to, and I acknowledge your
                  wisdom in the mention of it. But you forget one great affair; which is, that the
                  Government of the country is in a transitory state, and that now is the founding
                  of something new, the very tone of which forbids that ever be the name of
                  Abolition attached to my name. If I go out with you, I am ruined in the affairs of
                  state; if I go not, my fortune and name are built up. One way I will win for
                  certain; the other way I may lose both."</p>
               <p>"Why, then, have you come so far to see me?"</p>
               <p>"Because I loved you—because I wished to state my position—because I would
                  willingly be branded an Abolitionist, or anything else, and forfeit all my
                  prospects in the new government, for you."</p>
               <p>Gentle Ann held down her head, the large teardrops rolling down her cheeks. Yet in
                  all her sadness and fear a ray of eternal light began to appear to her; for the
                  thought of being forced into a promise of marriage made her doubt his sincerity.
                  Summoning all her courage, she at last spake out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I beseech you that you remember my situation! I have told you I could
                  not be neglectful of your generosity if you set me free. If I should be, why, then
                  I am, in cold ingratitude, unfit so good a man."</p>
               <p>"Yet you make no promise?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, how can I? I am free to tell you, any man of noble actions might win my
                  admiration. I pray you that you urge me no more."</p>
               <p>"What! and leave you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, say not so! Shall I, must I stay here, while you rove so free?"</p>
               <p>"Too lightly you weigh your chance of escape. It is at the peril of your life; and
                  if I go with you, it is at the peril of mine also. The roads are lined with
                  vigilance committees; none can pass or repass without military permission. I can
                  send for your uncle, but he may never reach this place alive. I may conduct you
                  safely to Washington; but shall not rather he who is to be your husband run the
                  risk?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I can bear no more!" said gentle Ann, and she sobbed bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Think not, dearest," he then began, "that I would compromise you, or bar your
                  liberty to choose. If all my acts are not most noble, I would hold no bond over
                  you. But I ask you in all seriousness, if I am not right in pursuing the object of
                  my love even in desperation? Can so urgent a lover ever do a thing to give you one
                  unhappy thought? I have already a good commission in the new government, and, if
                  you will be my wife, I am at the portals of fame and fortune. I tell you frankly,
                  too, that I cannot act on uncertainties. You are at liberty to choose; your uncle
                  or some of your friends can come for you—that is, if they are not murdered on the
                  way." Coldly now he surveyed the object of his passion; a girl untutored to the
                  craft of gay men.</p>
               <p>"You have taught me to fear you," she faintly said in broken sobs; "for, had you
                  sought only my liberty, it would have been a weighty argument in your behalf."</p>
               <p>Here she halted, for she cried so she could not speak. He answered her in
                  irony:</p>
               <p>"Then I am feared, and my arguments betray an evil design! I hope you will not rue
                  this; and I hope, too, you may be happy."</p>
               <p>He then started to walk away, and she began to despair of her situation, and so
                  she called to him, saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not leave me! Tell me, will you not indeed do anything to get me liberated
                  without I promise to marry you? You know I must have my uncle's consent."</p>
               <p>"I must have your positive answer," said he, halting, and looking back at her.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6417-00000052"/>
               <p>"But I have not myself to give away."</p>
               <p>"Why not? You are now mine; I can take you to church at once; or I can—turn yonder
                  pack against you."</p>
               <p>Now, while he spoke, there appeared in the distance the female vigilance
                  committee, together with about one hundred little boys, with drums and fifes
                  playing, Ann knew who they were, for the old negress had before told her about
                  them.</p>
               <p>"One promise <emph>will</emph> I make," she replied, "that, if my uncle give his
                  consent, you have mine."</p>
               <p>"That is no promise at all. Nor will I urge you more. I would not marry one who is
                  not willing to it, and so I take my final leave."</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not go, and leave me here! Say, what would you? What shall I do?"</p>
               <p>"Now, indeed, I pity you, and I love you for your consistency. No, I will not bind
                  you thus. I will set you at liberty, and carry you safely back to Washington, and
                  you shall there state my conduct to your uncle; and if he decide against me, I
                  will not murmur, choose whom you may."</p>
               <p>"Why, now, that is nobly spoken! Oh, how thankful I am! God bless you!"</p>
               <p>"But hark you," he replied, drawing again near the doorway, "it is not as easy as
                  walking in a street. We must have strategy. You are known here as an Abolitionist.
                  Russel has told the people you stole his slave. Now, if you are set out here
                  alone, you will be either murdered, or caught and locked up in some prison till
                  the country is made again quiet, or you may be incarcerated all your life. There
                  is only one mode of escape; I have studied every plan whereby I can get you back
                  to Washington. I will apprise the constable, and you shall be set at liberty just
                  at dusk. I will have cars provided, and then conduct you safely in some byways and
                  unsuspected places to avoid the mob."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is excellent! Now speed the time; make sure every course. Oh, that night
                  were come! How can I ever repay you? Excuse my crying; you know not what I have
                  suffered. But I will tell you all—oh, such horrors as I have passed! could you
                  believe the half? Oh, that I had ever kept under the eye of my uncle! My foolish,
                  foolish undertaking! He will never forgive me—O Heavens!"</p>
               <p>Her feelings well-nigh overcame her, for the confidence she felt in Perkins
                  removed her restraint, and her long-pent-up anguish and overstrung nerves now gave
                  way, and, quite exhausted, she sank down on the hay and hid her face.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been in Montgomery on a winter's eve, and felt the genial air? Could
                  you an Italian sky surpass, and free from banditti roam in the light of an early
                  evening moon, and treasure evil in one single thought? Have you seen a country
                  maid from home on a lone road, miles away with one man, and never thanked your God
                  you were an American? Or was it possible that virtue and honor were so common here
                  you knew not of them? Possibly you have never been in other countries. Possibly
                  you do not know that the avenues to employment in a republic are a greater
                  incentive to virtue and honor than all the edicts and soldiers of any of the kings
                  or potentates on earth. A republic is a book on the rights of man, and the
                  citizens are taught to read it; but a monarchy is a game of grab-all with a whip
                  in the hand of the mighty. A man that opposes or rebels against the former, rebels
                  against himself, and must be mad. Only destruction could come on such. But the
                  philosophy of all things is fixed, and no man may change them. The vigorous body
                  is neglectful, and foul disorders prey upon its vitals; then stern nature sickens
                  and purges the whole. The surfeit in spots appears, and the wise man trembles; for
                  these are the signals, and the Almighty points at the nation's fall. Treasure it,
                  O ye mighty men of earth, for the law of equal rights amongst men is in the care
                  of Him who rules the heavens! Justice is in the firmament with an uplifted sword;
                  who would not fall, let him behold. It is the guiding star to the mind, and the
                  footstool to the climbing genius. Vain politicians heed it not, but cavil on the
                  meaning of words, and their own ingenuity blinds them. Heaven shall strike them
                  down, and their party with them. They will not heed equal rights before the law,
                  and they shall be ruined. They have long been told of this, and the wisdom of the
                  prophecy makes them fear its truth, and they are enraged thereat. They are mad.
                  They are given up to all manner of profanity and wickedness. They make oaths to
                  Heaven, then violate them, and even Heaven itself do they defy.</p>
               <p>Of this party was Perkins. Once planning rebellion against liberty, had fitted his
                  soul for all wickedness. He knew his own impurity, and that no good act of his
                  could ever win her guardian uncle's will. Some things we can forgive in a man, and
                  welcome to his arms our fair ones; but there are others that seal a separation
                  forever—things that make a grave more welcome than a husband. Perkins was
                  intelligent and sensitive, nor could he brook to be denied. His victim was a
                  heart-broken girl, far from home, in prison, and he led her out at night. She was
                  all joy for herself, but nearly overcome with grief for the poor slave Kate, left
                  bawling in the Quarters, whence the pleadings and prayers were screamed till
                  gentle Ann was lost in the distance. Closely now on his arm she hung, all
                  confident, and nearly crazy with her hurried thoughts, nor noticing where she
                  travelled, till full out in the open country road, by the light of the evening
                  moon, he bade her halt.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, now," he spake, in slow and solemn voice and determinedly,</p>
               <lg type="stanza">

                     bore you safely, he would point his finger, and say, Unclean! Had I, with the
                     promises of my fortune, lived in Britain or Europe, and been the father of a
                     dozen children and still unmarried, the bond of equal rank would not have been
                     yet broken. Here has a sentimental philosophy sprung up, and I would join hell
                     itself for its overthrow. You know what I mean. There is a time when all
                     ceremonies cease, and love can wait for no more speeches. You shall be

               <p>"Oh, say not so! for my own unhappiness might ruin yours. Please take me to the
                  station, or back to the Quarters, or where you will, but do not more for which you
                  impugn yourself; for yet you are possessed of a noble soul that may long live in
                  happiness. Too gloomily you view the things whereof you complain, and in too much
                  haste you urge the final course. If not I may be yours, there may be one never
                  knowing to the things you accuse yourself better suited to bless you."</p>

                     before the law, I will not be bound by the law, and yet you shall rue that you
                     fill the place never sanctioned by ceremony."</p>

                     motionless, and then teardrops rolled down his cheeks. Down he hung his head,

                     God.</p>

                     half praying and pleading, she sank down even at his feet. In a moment now the
                     scene changed. A vigilance committee of a dozen men were returning from the
                     hanging of a neighboring farmer, and, turning the bend in the road, came full
                     upon Perkins even as gentle Ann lay at his feet. The persons all gathered
                     around, and in much earnestness looked to Perkins for an explanation. "She is
                     sick and weary," said Perkins; "will you help me take her to the city?" and
                     then the weeping, fainting girl was raised up. One of the vigilance committee
                     exclaimed at once, with an awful oath, "Why, this is that Abolition wretch
                     Russel spoke of! Hang him and her!" and then he called her by an evil name. The
                     crowd was inclined to make quick work of it, nearly every one shouting out, "Up
                     with her!" "Hang her!" and such like words; but Perkins stoutly denied she was
                     an Abolitionist, and kept the crowd at bay for some time. One of the men then
                     said, "He is an accomplice of hers. I do suspect both are Abolitionists. I
                     would rather hang a dozen innocent ones, than let one Abolitionist escape. Let
                     us hang both, and that is the end of it." After some parley, however, it was
                     concluded to postpone the hanging till next day. Gentle Ann was so weak and so
                     frightened she realized little of what was going on. The mob then tied her and
                     Perkins together, and marched them back to Montgomery, one of the pleasantest
                     cities in the South.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHEN I read the heading over, I told Jenkins an excellent scholar could perceive
                  that a few words inserted in it at various places would make it quite plain.
                  "Well," said he, "let him perceive it. We must be diplomatic, no matter what comes
                  of it." I made no more argument, but signified my readiness to proceed. He then
                  handed me a bundle of papers, saying, "These are Prescott's; take them, and write
                  them out." I then asked by what right Prescott claimed notes before our exalted
                  courts. "He has no right," said he; "we granted it him. He had long knocked at the
                  Temple and cast in morsels of learning. We let him in, in order to show him by our
                  wisdom how much he lacked. We put him in the box, and he gave in the following
                  testimony, which, by our court, was pronounced upon. The approaching war had
                  reduced the number of members of our court to a fraction. Prescott had never been
                  in the box before; the Judge scarcely had his old spectacles adjusted, when the
                  former began, and these were his words before the court, to wit:</p>
               <p>"It is hardly possible for the people of any period to place a correct value on
                  their own transpiring events, or to conceive the verge whereby they walk so near
                  to life or death. On the morning before Cæsar's death the great Roman empire was
                  all joy and gratitude for the seeming changeless glory and peace that awaited
                  their mighty nation; but yet they were on the verge of a fall that will be awful
                  to contemplate for thousands of years to come. The Trojans hoped and believed in
                  their power and glory, even till they were destroyed. The Lacedæmons, the
                  Carthaginians, and the people of all countries and kingdoms under the sun have
                  boasted of their power and safety even to the day of their fall. For
                  five-and-thirty times has France set up the boast, and every several time come to
                  ruin. Great Britain thought she had hit on the noblest and most enduring form; but
                  her distant colonies have gradually alienated and stripped the parent stem, till,
                  standing there, she is only a helpless show, commanding by the shadow of what was
                  once a great power. In olden times she could raise four hundred thousand men; but
                  in the late war with Russia she could raise but six-and-twenty thousand. Like an
                  old man, she acknowledges not her weakness, nor will she while a crown can hold
                  the helm. She has passed the verge, like an old farmer whose sons have gone away
                  from the old homestead, leaving only a few old maids, as harmless as doves, to
                  mark the fall that has been so gradual as not to be felt by the people. All other
                  nations have fallen by war or by internal dissension and general disintegration;
                  and, strange to say, every nation's fall has been previously predicted by its
                  wisest men, and scoffed at by the general citizens even till the day of trial
                  came; for, what men do wish to believe, though the verge ripens to their every
                  sense.</p>
               <p>"But what of ourselves? Is our nation at the verge where all men pass? First the
                  childhood, with only wild nature pleased, and all-absorbent with rural joys. Then
                  the age of admiration and self-love, where the mirror and the boast hold command
                  over all else. Next, followed by the goal of disappointment, and turned to battle
                  with the unruly members within itself, and in despondency commit suicide, or in
                  triumph conquer matchless glory. Who that thinks of these things is not solicitous
                  for the welfare of his country? And who can, in an approaching crisis like the
                  present, stand idly<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6417-00000054"/> while the poniard
                  is raised to his Cæsar's breast? It is not deserving of praise to fight for one's
                  country, for it is natural; though, when an officer is given a sword; and himself
                  swears to keep the peace by it, and then himself will stand and do nothing, he is
                  indeed a criminal fit for the trap and craft of any design against his life. A
                  very dog in the manger, holding back the guard while murderers plunge their swords
                  and bayonets in the hearts of innocent millions. An officer loving more his party
                  than his country; a man to for-swear his oath before God; to set bloody war afoot,
                  and gloat on poor widows and orphans, rather than see his own party turned out of
                  power. What man, knowing such a man to hold the chief office of a nation, would
                  not feel that his country was at the verge of its own greatness? Nor could any one
                  blame a citizen for trying to counteract the evils of so vile and perjured a
                  wretch. Was ever so poor a person put in office? Was ever a Constitution so
                  distorted? Was ever a man of so low a mind raised to so high a station?"</p>

                  <speaker>Judge.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Prescott, you are off your subject. You remind me of my ancient
                     French friend, Victor Hugo, and, if you were not handsome, I should banish you
                     also to some lone island. Always, when he begins to tell a story, he tells a
                     good many others first. We want nothing with ancient Rome or Greece, but
                     Washington. If you cannot give in your testimony without running abroad for
                     illustrations, or without ambiguous reference to men in office, you are not
                     suited to this court. If you allude to James Buchanan, say so. If you have any
                     affair between him, Madam Ponchard, and Jeff. Davis, why, say so. We want no
                     Romes here."</p>
                  <p>Prescott felt the rebuke, and would have gladly shut out the comparison to the
                     French author had it been possible; but remembering that in earlier days,
                     before he had arisen to fame, he had played in the minstrels, and learned to
                     say plain things under color which he never could have without paint, he rubbed
                     his face now to make believe the blush was hidden, and then struck out in the
                     following most remarkable words, to wit:</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prescott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Then, now, of a solemn voice I speak, and I speak as my heart moves me. I
                     stand not, sir, on legal forms or etiquette, but use such plain, blunt words as
                     best apply to this eventful period. For, even while gloomy winter overhangs
                     this city, while rains and storms, thaws and freezings alternate changes play,
                     and suns and clouded heavens vie for the mastery; while covered lies the
                     withered leaf of autumn, and budding green in embryo yet is sleeping, wrapped
                     in the folds of fruitful and never-denying earth, and the birds to their holes
                     or to their southern homes, albeit devotional all for the glorious bounties in
                     an early spring, changes far on in the world's history and magnitude of human
                     events are about to be borne into the presence of an unguarded people. The toil
                     of labor for the scene and coming convulse stirreth now in the heart of
                     millions, and the mutterings of its thunders hide all that is on the face of
                     the earth. Like a newly-kindled fire, over which lies endless food for the
                     devouring flames, its yet almost unnoticeable sparks and smoke have more terror
                     to more people than did ever before the threatened war in any age. Millions of
                     people, honest and virtuous, unarmed and unprotected by soldiery, now behold
                     the bloody Mars galloping forth with sword uplift, while bayonets in the hands
                     of millions are pointing to the breasts of countless women and children."</p>

                  <p>"This court cannot receive such testimony, Mr. Prescott. It is neither history
                     nor philosophy;" and the Judge winked at various members.</p>
                  <p>Prescott was excited, but firm, and thus went on, to wit:</p>
                  <p>"While many men and women, here in Washington, are engaged in trying to plunge
                     the whole country into war, or, by their threats, to maintain in power the
                     party that has just been defeated by vote, it will be, no doubt, to future
                     generations a great mystery why somebody does not nip the thing in the bud. And
                     it will be, too, no doubt, said, owing to the imbecility of Buchanan, that
                     nothing was done to avert so great a calamity. But such is not the case. There
                     are many men, unofficials, who are knocking at every door, communicating and
                     urging everything possible to arouse a patriotic action, but who as signally
                     fail in every attempt."</p>

                  <speaker>Judge.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Come to the point, Mr. Prescott; this court is waiting for the testimony."</p>

                  <speaker>Prescott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"On a fair winter's day, amid the mixed multitude thronging the streets of
                     Washington, was to be seen one of the busiest men you ever heard of, hurrying
                     hither and thither in the show and fashion, his hands clenching a bundle of
                     papers, his brow all sweat, and snarled with alternate hope and anguish in
                     every feature ture. He seemed but a boy in step and action, but his fixed
                     features, long experience, and some adversity, marked him full thirty or forty;
                     and his hesitance was like a woman's. He seemed to notice none, and few,
                     indeed, noticed him; but yet he had ventured upon a part in the great national
                     drama that will ever signalize him as the first active patriot of the present
                     period."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>At this point the Judge interrupted Prescott, by declaring his style too much like
                  a parson's novel, or the romance of a schoolgirl.</p>
               <p>Jenkins then took up the subject, and thus related it himself, to wit:</p>
               <p>For a long time there had been threats made by many secessionists that Lincoln
                  would never reach Washington alive; and even Buchanan had said that Lincoln should
                  never be President. Offers for Lincoln's destruction, for his head, for his body
                  and for his skin, were now made in nearly all the hotels of Washington, and in
                  many cities throughout the South. Most of the American people could not—would
                  not—believe the country was at the verge of its own fall. These offers and bribes
                  for Lincoln's death were laughed at—considered merely a political boast, that
                  would vanish by the coming March. Yet the evidence to the contrary was true beyond
                  all question, to persons acquainted with the whisperings and low cunning manifest
                  in all Washington society. Two persons, Madame Ponchard and Orsini, mysterious in
                  all their doings and actions, had weighed the offers for Lincoln's death, and
                  found a profitable balance on murder's side. These, in a remote corner, secluded
                  by some leafless winter trees, in an unguarded moment let fall some strong words,
                  the which reached Prescott's attentive ear. It was late in the evening when he
                  observed them to halt and to prepare to hide something. "See! harken, now,
                  Orsini!" she said in rather audible whispers, "lest some woful fortune turn on us
                  and us betray, beneath these stones we'll hide these scraps, and so hide the
                  evidence to convict us, if caught." "Agreed!" said he, and then, in some
                  indistinct mutterings, agreed they both to keep this spot as the hallowed
                  receptacle of their designs. Prescott watched with eager eye these would-be hired
                  murderers, in hopes, in part for fame and notoriety, but more to thwart so foul a
                  purpose, till they were gone; and then, repairing to the spot, upturned the
                  stones, and, in the broken column of a fallen lamp-post, found crammed certain
                  papers. It was too dark—being at night—to read or guess with certainty what was
                  there-on, and so, to make all safe, thinking they would return to deposit more or
                  call for these, he returned them, resolved that, with the first gleam of the
                  morning light, he would return and read them. He did so, even while he thought all
                  the city asleep, supposing no one was fool enough to rise so early; but of that
                  anon. The papers were a collection of subscriptions for Lincoln's death, and were
                  so plainly written as to be unmistakable. Hastily he ran over the amount, and
                  found that it footed the enormous sum of two millions. Aside from this, there were
                  others, offers for the heads of many other men. When he had satisfied his
                  curiosity, and safely replaced the papers, he left. Orsini left Washington the
                  next day, and travelled South. For six days and nights Prescott watched the hidden
                  papers, but no one seemed to come near the spot; yet, ere he had gone far from it,
                  one morning at the break of day, he met Mrs. Stimpkins, the famous lecturer and
                  editress. "Ha!" she said, "I'll know now, Mr. Prescott, why it is you frequent
                  this spot so regularly. Are you, indeed, too, conspiring against the life of the
                  in-coming Administration? Are you, indeed, to receive two millions of dollars for
                  simply killing one man? Has man wronged you also? Is, also, man's fickleness your
                  ruin? Know you that you have laid a trap for your neck? Know you that for six days
                  and nights I have seen you come here to count over your expected gains?"</p>
               <p>Thus saying, she tightly clenched her long thin lips, and hand over hand rubbed
                  her large knuckles, eyeing him with the fierceness of a very tiger.</p>
               <p>"Madam," he said, "you much mistake me. I have been also watching this spot, in
                  hopes to acquire evidence and power to convict the would-be criminals doing
                  this."</p>
               <p>For a moment an incredulous smile overspread her half-starved face, the while her
                  eyes piercing still, and she slowly, firmly said,</p>
               <p>"So, indeed! Am I to be forever unarmed by plausible stories? Am I to be again
                  balked by the cunning of man? to disbelieve my own senses, and all faith bestow on
                  a race whose every word and action have ever galled me with disappointment?"</p>
               <p>He told her he knew not what she meant.</p>
               <p>"You don't?" said she, satirically. "Then hark you—I will tell you; and, little
                  can I ask you to believe, if indeed<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6417-00000055"/> you
                  have found, as I have, all men and women to be false; but I speak in justice to
                  myself. First, then, I don't believe you; you are a dough-face, a man to betray
                  the liberties of your fellow-creatures for money. Such is man's nature, and you,
                  bearing the semblance of a man, must be false to human rights. You smile! Sir, I
                  have been many times married—have dived into the deepest recesses of man's heart,
                  and I speak only the things I do know. For gold, for gain, for self in any sense,
                  man, this would-be lord of creation, will sell virtue, honor, love, and kindred.
                  Benevolence, morality, and religion will he use as masks for his selfish purposes.
                  Give him an opportunity to better his fortune, and he will fall in love with a
                  bundle of bones or a bag of meat; add another opportunity to his view, and he will
                  cast the same bones or meat into a gutter. Give him adversity, and his love is
                  like a snow in harvest, a fancy to melt away ere 'tis seen. Such has been my
                  experience, such my evidence. The joining together of a few hundred dollars has
                  ever been the cause of my marriages; and my every husband has painted out sure
                  prosperity in the prospect; but when failure came, a want of congeniality was
                  discovered, and I was cast aside, or perhaps opportunely I cast them aside. Thus
                  have many husbands failed me; but my last one, the celebrated Professor Jackson,
                  for the most trivial cause, because I limited him to one meal a day, has left me
                  the worst of all, or rather I did not cast him off soon enough. Again I take the
                  field alone, a champion once more for woman's rights. But, sir, Professor Jackson
                  wrongs me still. He lectures on the same subjects I do, thereby even robbing me of
                  my own profession. But I am resolute; I have learned man's selfishness, though it
                  cost me dear, and I am sworn to make my mark on every man I meet. I don't believe
                  your story!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, madam, you much mistake me," said he, "and much abuse us all. There are
                  strange coincidences in nature. You may have five or seven husbands, and all of
                  them selfish and bad, and yet, were you to take another, he might prove a very
                  angel."</p>
               <p>"Sir! sir!" she almost screamed, "would you offer yourself to me? Must here begin
                  another course, to end in failure—to tear hence still another vital part? Oh,
                  curses, curses on thy sex! Even while you lay hands on a murderer's bribe, you
                  talk of marriage!"</p>
               <p>He then assured her that these papers were not his, but Madam Ponchard's.</p>
               <p>"Then do I know," she said, "you are false. If 'tis but to curse a woman you lay
                  this trap, if but to send some woman to prison, then you act verily a man's good
                  part. Yes, I believe you; you are not the villain to murder Lincoln, but still you
                  are a man, and, as such, woman's enemy. Were these would-be murderers of Lincoln
                  men, you would not stir a hand; but, since 'tis woman, verily how noble you are!
                  Now, I shall see to it, and, if it be indeed a woman, I swear I will thwart you,
                  though the heavens fall!"</p>
               <p>He called her, for, when she closed her speech, she started onward, and he
                  endeavored to tell her the importance of keeping the matter a secret. She would
                  not heed him, and strove to appear as if she had vanquished an enemy.</p>
               <p>Prescott knew not what to do, but immediately left the place, and sought me, and
                  disclosed all his discovery, with particulars about a Mr. Russel, of Baltimore,
                  being engaged in the plot.</p>
               <p>Our plans were at once submitted to Judge Francis, and we were directed to assume
                  the responsibility of procuring the aid of two trusty officers to make, at the
                  proper time, the arrest of Madame Ponchard and Orsini. Prescott was despatched to
                  Baltimore, to appear before Russel as a man from Alabama or Mississippi, and to
                  convince, if possible, the would-be murderers of Lincoln that he was also in the
                  ring with them, and by this means obtain all the information possible of the
                  numbers and designs of the gang. This affair was managed well by Prescott. On
                  arriving at a tavern in Baltimore, he came across the said Russel, to whom he
                  represented himself as the leader of a similar plot from Louisiana. The bait took
                  exceedingly, and several Baltimore gentlemen were introduced to help mature the
                  plans. Prescott informed them that he was not only acquainted with, but a partner
                  in carrying out the plot. Russel was a crafty man, and had a straight and
                  honest-looking eye, even when telling downright falsehoods, and could so laugh,
                  talk, and fill up the time, that no other could edge in a word. Yet, in apparent
                  candor, like a child fond to learn, Prescott led him on, and some suggestions made
                  that won him to value highly his every plan. In course of time, Prescott asked,
                  then urged, then commanded him to come to Washington, to help consummate the plans
                  for Lincoln's death. To this he acceded, and the trap for his capture and
                  conviction seemed sure. On the following day he and Prescott reached Washington.
                  This was the day on which Lincoln left his home in the far West for the Capital.
                  Already had Scott the whole city guarded, but the assassins had resolved to commit
                  the murder in Baltimore.</p>
               <p>What was our surprise to learn that this same Russel was a member for the Peace
                  Congress, and that he professed such a warm attachment for ex-Presidents Fillmore
                  and Tyler, and that he so honestly believed Lincoln's death would settle all the
                  trouble between the North and South, by giving the South supreme power ever
                  after.</p>
               <p>Immediately after Prescott and Russel arrived in Washington, and when they had
                  proceeded a short distance together and then halted to part, they were met by the
                  little thin-faced man Stephens, and Jeff. Davis. The former walked on slowly, but
                  Davis spoke with Russel, and suggested to him, within the hearing of Prescott,
                  that the proposed assassination of Lincoln would not amount to much unless a
                  hundred others were killed the same day; and this, he said, would be the most
                  humane way of settling the matter, Russel replied that the whole of the leaders of
                  the Black Republican party could be disposed of within a week. Shortly after this
                  Prescott left, and so also did the others, each one going his own way.</p>
               <p>All the above information was now communicated to the selected officers, and all
                  of us were assigned a part to perform, either for evidence or the arrest. Scott
                  ordered two agents off to meet Lincoln and inform him of the dangers awaiting him,
                  and to plan out some mode of reaching the Capital without passing through
                  Baltimore. On the same day of the departure of these two agents, we had another
                  interview with Buchanan. He was pale and distressed, and, when we told him about
                  the two agents sent to meet Lincoln, he really trembled with rage. "Shall Scott
                  transcend his powers?" he said. "The whole thing is bosh; it is unconstitutional.
                  I know Madame Ponchard and Orsini, and I do suspect this whole thing to be a
                  conspiracy against them in hopes to aggravate the South."</p>
               <p>He was inconsolable. We left him fevered with rage, fearing that he might, in
                  fact, betray us, and so frustrate all our intentions.</p>
               <p>Now it became necessary to guard the place where the prize papers were concealed,
                  but we needs must guard them in such a way that we could get witnesses and that we
                  remain unsuspected ourselves. To do this, we resolved to open a news-stand near
                  by, and to put the fugitive Joe there as salesman. To this she readily assented,
                  not knowing, however, our object. But I myself had some unpleasant conjectures
                  about her. For several days past she had failed in appearance, looking really
                  depressed and broken down. And whenever I inquired after her anxieties, she seemed
                  to avoid me; seemed as if the spell of her former open-heartedness was at an end.
                  At present, however, I accounted for it by the disappearance of her sister Kate.
                  As it was only for a few days we desired her services, I urged her to brave the
                  task, and in hopes the better to catch the eye of her sister, should she pass that
                  great thoroughfare, she herself seemed at first enraptured.</p>
               <p>On the evening of the third day, when I called at the news-stand, she was in
                  tears. It was then about seven in the evening, and she was greatly agitated. No
                  one else was near, and I insisted on knowing all her trouble. She leaned on my arm
                  a moment, and sobbed bitterly. "Oh, say not all," she replied, "say not all my
                  trouble, for it would break the stoutest heart. But come; I am a child—provide me
                  safety at once. I do forget, but I must fly. I am detected. That murderer, Orsini,
                  passed here, and he pointed to a friend even as he passed. He was in company with
                  the actress who married my master."</p>
               <p>"What! Madame Ponchard?" said I.</p>
               <p>"The lady," said she, "so richly attired, in black, jewelled. Oh, I know she and
                  he murdered my good master. They are now after me. I must leave in an instant.
                  Tell me where to go—what to do!"</p>
               <p>For a moment I was shocked and confused, but, on regaining my presence of mind, I
                  told her to wait but a moment and I would call Prescott. She clung hard upon my
                  arm and looked most piteously into my face. In a moment more I released her hold,
                  and she sat down, while I hastened fast as I could walk to the Jackson House. In a
                  little while I found Prescott, and solicited him to come and help provide safety
                  for the news-stand till we could quietly and surely wait on the fugitive's
                  requirements.</p>
               <p>What was our astonishment and mortification, though, to find, on our return, that
                  the poor girl was gone! Not a vestige of her could we find. No note—nothing.
                  Thinking that perhaps Orsini and Madame Ponchard had returned and had frightened
                  the fugitive off, we now sought for the hidden papers; but here too were we
                  confounded. They were<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6417-00000056"/> gone! Our object
                  was, as has often been told in the newspapers, to get the would be assassins
                  arrested, and to keep them so until Lincoln should reach the Capital. But this
                  little slip was likely to frustrate all our designs. Of course we informed the
                  detectives of what had happened, and this in a measure made them distrust us. The
                  consequence was, on the following day a sort of wholesale arrest was advised, and
                  to have Russel taken up at once. Now it so happened that, when the detectives
                  passed near the place where the papers had been hid, our veritable Mrs. Lucy
                  Tabiatha Stimpkins was looking for the valuables, and in a quandary about their
                  disappearance. They approached her, mistaking her, in fact, for Madame Ponchard,
                  though really they looked as much unlike as any two ladies, could.</p>
               <p>"Madam," said they, "we are sorry, but our duty compels us to demand your presence
                  at headquarters this morning;" and they smiled, and signified for her to come
                  along.</p>
               <p>"What fool effrontery is this?" she said, scowling with her deep, sunken eyes, and
                  bracing herself in the most upright position. "Know you that I am woman?
                  Independent woman! Independent! I have, sirs, a duty to perform, and I will
                  perform it though a world opposes me!"</p>
               <p>The officers smiled a little, and told her she was all right—it was all very well,
                  but there was a little affair which made it necessary for her to appear at the
                  police court, hoping she would pass along so quietly as not to attract
                  attention.</p>
               <p>"Do you know," she said, looking terribly fierce, "do you know to whom you speak?
                  Have the inalienable rights of woman sunken to this low ebb? Is this the sphere of
                  intellectual woman?—to knuckle to man; to go to police headquarters; to go
                  quietly! Quietly! I would, sirs, make my voice ring louder than the thunders. I
                  have felt the tyranny of man, and, sirs, my heart bleeds for the manner in which
                  woman is crushed; but this low degradation shall never come on me—never! never!
                  You may defraud us of the right to vote; you may tax us without letting us hold
                  office, but you shall never tie woman's tongue. Never!"</p>
               <p>This did attract attention, and already were a few beginning to collect around.
                  One of the officers stepped up to her and took her arm, smiling, and saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, you are all right; but come on!"</p>
               <p>"Hence!" she said, snatching loose. "Begone, inferior mortal! From all that was
                  perfect, was most perfect woman made: But, sirs, you have robbed us of our
                  affections—of our souls; you have turned us into barren skeletons and
                  weazen-voiced orators, and you mock at us for the wreck you have made. But when
                  you say, 'March off quietly,' there's the mark, <emph>quietly;</emph> you have
                  then come to the place where you can go no further. March off quietly! I'll make
                  my voice rattle more than all the devils in pandemonium!"</p>
               <p>The crowd began to assemble rapidly, and many of them began to laugh, and this,
                  too, still attracted more attention—the officers following her up gently, and she
                  as violently stepping back and lecturing them, to the amusement of the bystanders.
                  Fortunately, however, in a little while Prescott came up, and, seeing the mistake
                  that had been made, succeeded in setting all right, so that the officers retired,
                  leaving her master of the field. Here she held forth in a speech on woman's rights
                  in earnest; but we cannot relate her speech, owing to more important matter.</p>
               <p>It was on the day after the fugitive's disappearance, and immediately after a
                  court sitting before Judge Francis, when I had come down from the Temple, and
                  meeting Wadsworth even at the columns thereof, and seeing him in apparent
                  distress, I halted, and engaged him in the source of his reveries. He had never
                  before, to me, looked so ill—never before so melancholy and downcast. At first
                  thought I inwardly rebuked myself for not having heretofore tried more to minister
                  to his apparent sorrows. Another thing that flashed over me for the moment was, he
                  had talked for a long time past of going home to his plantation; and now, why did
                  he linger still in, Washington? With tearful eyes he gazed into mine, taking my
                  hand, in such assurance as sacred made the word of each to the other, saying, "I
                  have waited for you," and he seemed at loss whether to say more. But I assured
                  him, in my gentlest manner, that I was anxious to do him service, and that I could
                  perceive that something more than common was preying on his mind. "You are right,"
                  said he; "I am almost distracted. I hardly know whether I am living or dead." With
                  this expression he half turned his face away, so fair and noble, and the tears
                  flooded his checks. Drawing a card from his pocket, and cautiously turning it
                  over, he passed it to me, remarking, "You know not how desolate is all the world,
                  with no one to love!" I looked on the card, and, while I read the words on it, I
                  was nearly palsied.</p>
               <p>"God bless thee! With no mishap, thy dear one will soon return."</p>
               <p>I knew who it was, and, although I stood as motionless as a statue, a torrent of
                  emotion well-nigh caused me to sink to the ground. Oh, that I had never lived to
                  see this—to feel that the dearest one I ever knew had so kindly written to my most
                  excellent friend! Oh, the racking in my brain, the flood of gushing thoughts and
                  strange imaginings! The dread of long mistrust, but long concealed and curbed by
                  my best judgement, had now, in an unexpected moment, had the veil lifted, and
                  doubt settled forever. Visions sad and lonely then spread out before me, and my
                  course through, the long future loomed up as mountains of darkness perpetual in
                  the clouds, while my own isolated self appeared in the distant future vainly
                  trying to achieve that happiness which all men covet on earth, but no one has ever
                  attained. "Vain, vain man," I mused to myself, "see you not the higher law, and
                  acknowledge it, that the aspirations and fond desires of the full-grown man are
                  dependent too on the independent will of others, and that yourself in obedience
                  here must find exaltment in the things that goad and murder you!" Bitter, bitter
                  bane this, to an unprovoking man! But why of myself? Thus, in a second of time, I
                  measured a world in thought, and confounded stood, with the little card half
                  hidden by the clouds of mist gathering in my eyes, till Wadsworth, more collected
                  but weeping more, urged me to tell him if I knew some misfortune to her.</p>
               <p>"I see it in your eye, your face, and whole expression," he said; "you have ill
                  news for me. Oh, tell me, I pray, what evil tidings make you fear to break it to
                  my sensitive ear? I know your kindness to me, and your gentleness to her. You fear
                  we are separated forever? Oh, speak! why are you silent?"</p>
               <p>He seized me by the hand, and earnestly peered into my face; but I was so
                  confused, for his innocent construction of my sorrow overpowered me, that I found
                  no utterance at first, and then he added, quickly:</p>
               <p>"You know not what I have been doing? I have searched all the North, and even
                  Canada, but I tell you the newspaper stories of her flight are all false. She has
                  not absconded, but some great misfortune has befallen her. Now I charge you, and
                  you know by what injunction I crave aid in my distress, if you know aught of her
                  that will give me either peace or sorrow, speak it—in Heaven's name speak!"</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of her," said I, "and you astound me beyond measure. So much
                  credit has been put in the stories about her having been seen travelling North,
                  that no one doubted. Besides, also, has not the Judge received letters from her in
                  Canada?"</p>
               <p>"Those letters are forged!"</p>
               <p>I was thunderstruck, and still silently waited while he resumed:</p>
               <p>"I traced those letters out. The Judge gave me the said-to-be address, and urged
                  me to go to Canada and see her, keeping it quiet, until such time as we should be
                  married and she could return in safety."</p>
               <p>Here was another shock; the Judge had given his consent, and I had never known
                  it.</p>
               <p>"The Judge knows not, but believes the letters are genuine. He will die if I
                  unfold the truth to him; but oh, sir, what fate must hers be! Some deep and cursed
                  villainy is afoot. That lady never left Washington, at least on a Northern railway
                  or steamer." He then minutely described all the manner of inquiry he had
                  instituted, and related the sad result. I listened to his adventures, myself much
                  moved by the tenderness of his style, and when he had finished, he gave a
                  lengthened sigh, and pressed my hand warmly, saying, "I know of no one to whom I
                  can so well unfold my sorrows, or who would so much excuse my weakness as you, and
                  for that reason have I cast my history before you. Pray, sir, do not let your
                  sympathies too much my troubles bear, but rather counsel and advise me with what I
                  shall do to regain my life treasure in that gentlest one of all I ever knew. My
                  day-dreams, my night-dreams, my hours of ceaseless thought have only life in her,
                  and her absence is my living death. Oh, sir, in Heaven's name, tell me, what shall
                  I do? Give me a thought, or a dreamed of prospect, and I will follow it to the end
                  of the world. For I have fashioned out all conjectures and hopes, and pursued them
                  to the very uttermost end, and failed. Give me some clue, some possible hope,
                  whither she is gone, and I will fly. My admiration for you, and my love for your
                  intelligence and nobleness, have sent me here to meet you. Thus have I loitered
                  near the Temple, that I might eagerly devour your first conjecture."</p>
               <p>He then waited for me to reply, and I summoned all my powers to act the noble
                  part; although, had a dozen swords'<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6417-00000057"/>
                  points pierced me through, I had suffered less than what was now galling me to the
                  very soul. And he so innocent of what was moving me!</p>
               <p>"My friend," I said, with some caution, "too much we value things so mortal, and
                  too hastily surmise the coming end. Take less to heart, and more control on the
                  feelings keep, while sterner judgment and time and sure events work out these
                  mysteries. Think you no one else has ever borne such woful loss, and yet
                  controlled and hidden it from even a friend's suspicion?"</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wadsworth.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Oh, that could not be! When two souls so tenderly love, they will speak though
                     Heaven frowns. Oh, say not that mortal ever so loved fair woman, and concealed
                     it, for it is in the nature of things impossible—impossible!"</p>
                  <p>"I think 'tis possible—quite possible! Indeed, I have heard it so said, the
                     deepest love in silence lives, and bides the powers above. Know you all the
                     history of this gentle lady?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wadsworth.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Oh! indeed, I know it well. But no, perhaps not all; for so gentle and kind a
                     one has a history in every hour's thought, and since she has passed some twenty
                     years, of course I cannot know it all, though much I trace it back, of what she
                     was by what she is, and so do full acquit myself I know the whole. What of her?
                     For if in anything past you can unravel something leading on to the time
                     present, it may much mystery explain."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"Well, then—for my attachment to you is quite equal to your admiration of him whom
                  you have sought to comfort you—let me tell you of this fair one, who has no
                  superior in this world. She was once a child, and, as such, played as children do,
                  wore short dresses, and at times went out in the sun without her bonnet.
                  Frivolous, this, to tell; but no, you shall hear. Along with her, and with other
                  children, too, was a little boy, called by the others Freckle-face, always in
                  mischief, always teasing all the other children. Only gentle Ann he never crossed,
                  but kindly treated. When she lost her bonnet, he brought it her, and playfully
                  tied it on, and she regarded him well. Anon the other children teased them both,
                  because of their affections, and this nearer brought the primitive loves to each
                  other, till, though in almost infant years, they betrothed themselves. Long they
                  lived so—one, two, three, four long years—and their affection became a type of
                  purity and nobleness to all the neighbors. The parents of each were about equal in
                  rank, wealth, and culture, and much approved the intended marriage. But, as all
                  people are subject to die, so the boy's parents both died, leaving him heir to a
                  great fortune. The boy was taken by an uncle, to be educated and cared for till he
                  came to maturity. This uncle had a daughter, cousin to the boy, who was now set
                  upon by several indirect methods, of which he knew nothing, to be won over to
                  marry the cousin, and so forsake gentle Ann. He was then in his seventeenth year,
                  and needs must remain with his uncle four years, according to the will and
                  testament of his own father. He was forced into the society of his cousin, but no
                  mutual love ever sprang up between them; and, on the other hand, he was told
                  falsely about his dear, gentle Ann; that, as she was only a child of thirteen, she
                  had since discarded him, and taken up with other lovers. He did not believe it,
                  however, but rested his faith in the All-ruling Power above to restore him, some
                  day, to the dear one of his choice. After he had been absent two years, he fled
                  from his uncle's house, and over the mountains of Virginia travelled on foot two
                  hundred miles to see his long-absent love. And he saw her, and they renewed their
                  pledges with more warmth than ever; but were scarcely done greeting each other,
                  when the rude uncle came upon them, and, bidding him remember the will and
                  testament of his father, succeeded in carrying the boy back again to his place of
                  abode. Not long after this the young man—for he was no longer a child—heard that
                  Judge Francis Underhill had gone to Europe, and that the dear one had totally
                  abandoned him. He became depressed and isolated, but at maturity, coming into
                  possession of a great estate, he came to this city, where he again met his
                  long-lost one, but they met coldly. The stories told to each of the other had
                  chilled the love between them, and neither one would venture again in the sacred
                  channel. At times they would walk together, or playfully allude to the days of
                  childhood, but a power more than mortal ever seemed to stand between them. A
                  thousand times did he try to overcome the awful barrier, and a thousand
                  opportunities did she offer, but whether the recollection of the malicious stories
                  told, or whether Heaven itself intervened, I know not; but their broken hearts
                  both felt the loss of a world, and were silent in it. But hers was not a heart of
                  love to love in vain; her charms fell upon one of the noblest men I ever saw—one
                  of the most innocent, and virtuous; and he gave her a warmer and dearer love than
                  the other over could—and you are that man!"</p>
               <p>"In mercy's name, you have torn my heart asunder; you have laid bare every portal
                  where on lived my happiness! But tell me—tell me of the young man!"</p>
               <p>"I am he!"</p>

                  author is weighed by critics, and judged accordingly. We, you know, must have our
                  style. Every one his own way. One man sets out to tell you a story with a
                  beginning as follows, to wit: 'Two mysterious beings were seen at early morning in
                  a boat in the river Thames, in coarse habiliments, in close proximity and earnest
                  attitude, in silence rowing. One was a female figure in the bloom of youth, in the
                  stern of the boat, in a loose old gown in reduced circumstances. The other was
                  that of a male companion, in a drowsy slouch hat, in bending form, with silvery,
                  uncombed locks, in the middle of the boat, rowing, and pulling something that
                  looked like it might be something'—and so on. Now, you know our style would be:
                  'An old man and his daughter by the name of Smith searched for dead bodies in the
                  Thames. One morning, having found the corpse of some unfortunate, they took it in
                  the boat and rowed down the river'—and so on. The style is everything. The weary
                  man, the business man, the active mind of this age can fill in; give them the
                  points, and tease not with such worthless stuff."</p>
               <p>I told Jenkins that the reader of this history would be too much interested in the
                  fate of some, and not enough in the fate of others connected with it.</p>
               <p>"I want no Lucy Dashwoods," said he, "for my model. The interest was there kept
                  back, and it made an accidental glory; it was, in fact, an Eva's death to the
                  book, and made it live."</p>
               <p>Said I, "Do you suppose you can make a sweet young girl halt here and read
                  Buchanan's politics, or about a peace convention? Would she not be skipping over
                  to see how it came out with the Judge and Vickey, and Prescott, and gentle Ann and
                  Wadsworth and the old maid and yourself? Then there are Madame Ponchard and
                  Orsini; will not the writers of history skip over your love affairs, to ascertain
                  the part they played in the beginning of the great rebellion?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed!" said he. "If you will be patient, I shall here read you such a
                  chapter as you never dreamed of." He then took up his glass, and smiled. I asked
                  him what he smiled at.</p>
               <p>"At wit," said he. "I smile at wit. Only a short time since a man wrote a poem,
                  stating in the preface that he wrote so funnily, that, when he took it to the
                  publisher, the latter laughed from ear to ear, and that all the buttons flew off
                  the poor fellow's coat with laughter. The author then goes on to state, that after
                  that he never dared to write so funny as he could. Very witty, was it not?"</p>
               <p>Being anxious to get on with the history. I urged him to proceed with the
                  translation; and he immediately took up his notes, and began with these very
                  words, to wit:</p>
               <p>My position as reporter had made me quite an important person in the estimation of
                  many people. Slave-hunters always came to me, and also to Prescott, to learn all
                  the hiding-places of Washington, and, in fact, of many other cities. Now it so
                  happened, that the man who came down the avenue when I had been gallanting the old
                  maid with her new plumpers, was Russel, the slave-catcher. As soon as we were
                  alone, he began. Said he, "I am a Baltimorean, and live in Jefferson street, that
                  city. Two ladies have taken a house next door to me, and have acted so
                  mysteriously about it, that I do suppose them to be Abolitionists, and that they
                  keep, in fact, a depot for the underground railroad<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000058"/> road. My business has been for many years to assist
                  in capturing runaways, and I scarcely ever err in my judgment of people. The
                  stories circulated about, that the fugitives Kate and Lizzie are off to Canada, or
                  are captured and sent home, are all false. I am too cunning for that. I have long
                  heard of you, Mr. Jenkins. You have figured a good many years as a writer; our
                  occupations are nearly the same."</p>
               <p>I did not feel flattered by so rough a comparison, but made no answer; for, in
                  fact, he talked so fast I could not. He called a man to take his horse to the
                  Jackson House, and then he urged me to accompany him, having in a single sentence
                  informed me he was a member of the Peace Congress, the originator of the Bureau of
                  Detection and Capture Bill, and that neither ex-Presidents Pierce, nor Tyler, nor
                  Fillmore could claim it. What he was aiming at I could not foresee, nor could I
                  imagine the cause of so great familiarity of words at first meeting. But I soon
                  beheld his mistake; for he, in the midst of his ceaseless talking, informed me
                  that the clerk of the Jackson House had told him I could be relied upon as all
                  right on the secession and slavery questions, because I was an Englishman. He did
                  not even let me have time to deny it, but talked, talked all the time himself,
                  till we neared the turn leading up toward the Patent Office. "Well, I do say,"
                  said he, stopping short and looking at a lady who had just passed, and whom I knew
                  to be Madame Ponchard, "if there is not one of my dearest friends! I'll stick by
                  her till doomsday, and I'll learn all the particulars." And then he turned
                  abruptly away, looking back, and saying, "Meet me at the Peace Congress in half an
                  hour, and such things as I shall there tell you, you shall see; for I do suspect
                  we shall have an uphill time of it. You Englishmen are better skilled in the
                  accomplishment of destroying nations, and you shall have plenty of work, my word,
                  as you say in England."</p>
               <p>There I stood, looking after him, and he going away and talking every moment as
                  fast as he could. In fact, I pitied him, for his ideas seemed to come much faster
                  than he could talk. But such strange conduct in a stranger to me left me
                  bewildered as to who he was and what he wanted with me. He followed after the
                  Madame, anon looking back to me and shaking his finger and smiling like a
                  horse-jockey. He was a stout, good-looking, middle-aged man, and seemed a man of
                  business and many jokes, and inclined to say everything himself. Of course I was
                  left alone, and a little embarrassed about receiving such treatment from a
                  stranger; but he seemed so good-humored, that I entertained only the best of
                  feeling toward him. Not daring to go back to the Jackson House lest that
                  mischievous clerk should bore me about the old maid, I loitered slowly along till
                  I came to the halls of the Peace Congress, whereat it has been prophesied there
                  shall never, to the end of all time, stand a monument. Near the doorway, outside,
                  stood Floyd and young Wise. They were looking at a photograph; it was of the usual
                  size called <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte-de-visite.</foreign> I did not look at
                  it, but saw enough to recognize it as Madame Ponchard. Floyd wished to avoid me,
                  and he went in the house. Wise seemed suspicious of me, but he remained in the
                  same place. Ex-President Tyler then came up and spoke to Wise, and they both went
                  in together.</p>
               <p>The hall was very large, and ingress only permitted to the officials. You cannot
                  imagine my surprise at seeing my stranger friend already in the hall. I had left
                  him following Madame Ponchard, going in an entirely different direction, and now
                  found him as a member of the Peace Congress, safely and quietly smiling at
                  everybody, and propped up near the doorway, ears and eyes for everything present.
                  I doubted, at first, if he were the same man; but he saw me looking at him, and he
                  tossed up his finger, and nodded and smiled as if he had known me for years.
                  Thinks I to myself, this Peace Congress is a curious conglomeration; for I beheld
                  the venerable Crittenden, and others equally honest in their endeavors to
                  compromise the trouble between the North and South, here sitting beside the most
                  rampant fire-eaters of the South. A man near me then touched my shoulder, saying,
                  "Why, have they got Buchanan's statue here?" and he pointed toward the left-hand
                  chair, whither I cast my eye, and there saw, to all appearance, a marble figure
                  like our present President. But while we looked at it, it raised its hand, and my
                  friend said, "What! is it he?" For it was, and he beckoned for me to come over to
                  him. He was as pale and death-like as a corpse. All eyes were now turned on me,
                  and I felt somewhat embarrassed as I went forward. He raised up to receive me,
                  and, bursting into tears, exclaimed,</p>

                  <l>"Oh, Jenkins! Jenkins! come to my relief!</l>

               <p>I was at loss to reply, for the house was not organized, and I knew every one was

               <p>And he smiled in triumph, while many of the ultra pro-slavery men winked and
                  smiled to each other, and whispered aside, "That's it!" "Keep him on that track!"
                  I pretended not to notice what was passing, and was relieved from further replying
                  by the sound of the gavel.</p>
               <p>Ex-President Tyler was made Chairman of the Peace Congress, and, as soon as order
                  was restored, he handed the secretary a recommendation, signed by nearly all the
                  Democratic party of the State of Massachusetts. This was read at length; and the
                  document reflects severer on the American character than anything of the kind ever
                  signed by a civilized people. It was while this document was being read, that the
                  police appeared at the door with Madame Ponchard. I knew, but I now think no one
                  present knew, what the outside row was about. The commotion in the Peace Congress
                  was greater than I ever before beheld. We would fain rush to the door, for Madame
                  Ponchard's arrest was deemed almost equivalent to a declaration of war; yet we
                  were so intent on knowing what the document held forth, we dared not move. Six or
                  seven members left, the balance of us remained.</p>
               <p>The document was said to be signed by half a million people of Massachusetts. But
                  was it genuine?—that was the question; or was it gotten up by Fillmore, and Davis,
                  and Toombs, as a make-believe for peace? It proposed to please the South by
                  disenfranchising a large portion of the people of Massachusetts on account of the
                  color of their skin; it proposed to let slave-owners bring their slaves into
                  Massachusetts, and to protect them while there; it proposed to establish in every
                  township a whipping-post for runaway slaves; it proposed to pay the slave-owner
                  for every slave coming into Massachusetts, if not captured; it proposed to make it
                  lawful to buy and sell slaves in Massachusetts, if not to remain there; it
                  proposed to divide all the Western territory, half and half, for slavery and
                  freedom; it proposed to keep up the balance of power for the slave States, by
                  purchasing or taking by force Central America and the West India islands; and all
                  that this great State of Massachusetts asked in return, was summed up in four
                  words—Pray don't fight us!</p>
               <p>Hardly had this, the most remarkable document ever signed by a Christian people,
                  been read, when up jumps a little fellow with a whining voice, holding up a paper
                  not two yards in front of me, shouting out, "Mr. President! Mr. President! if it
                  be in order——" and he stretched himself up and smacked his lips, smiling, and he
                  slapped on the paper with his hand, "I will read you a brief answer to that."
                  Again he smiled, and twisted his lips like a member of Parliament. I saw the
                  writing, and knew it to be in Toombs' hand; it was written on foolscap. It was
                  twenty pages; the substance of it was: "We, Southern members of the Peace
                  Congress, have heard the propositions of Massachusetts, and we reject them,
                  because she does not give as much as we want, and because we do want what we are
                  determined to have."</p>
               <p>"Like a love-sick belle, never satisfied!" said a voice in a far-off corner,
                  whither I looked, and now beheld Judge Francis Underhill, of Loudon Heights,
                     spreading<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6417-00000059"/> himself, and adjusting his
                  old silver spectacles. "'Tis ever the plight of a girl of seventeen. Her ardent
                  lover tells her he gives his whole heart, his wealth, his muscle, his name, his
                  very soul, if she will but let him love her. Then she proudly asks, 'Will you not
                  give more?' Here is a leading State offering you everything—even promising to rob
                  her own citizens to please you. Hardly are her proposals read, when your
                  heir-expectant jumps up, and reads a previously written speech, saying, 'Give us
                  more! Give us a good deal more!' Massachusetts offers to make a heathen of herself
                  rather than have any trouble with you. She is a cowardly cur, and the South is a
                  greedy hog."</p>
               <p>Before he said more, the Chairman called him to order, but all the while were
                  others rising, shouting out, "Mr. President!" "Mr. President!" and trying to get
                  the floor. Finally the small man with the whining voice got ahead, and sharply
                  demanded who the Judge was? "An Abolitionist!" "an Abolitionist!" shouted out
                  several others, some of whom roared out, "His niece and he run the underground
                  railroad!" Buchanan then pulled my arm, and bade me sit beside him, saying to me,
                  "Do you think there'll be a row? Oh, for God's sake, I wish I were home!" and he
                  was even paler than before; but I cheered him up, and urged him to remember that,
                  as long as he stood by the Constitution, he was safe.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have had such a time!" said he, in a whisper, and he pulled my head over to
                  him, shaking badly all the while. "Those Commissioners have been to see me! Oh,
                  what shall I do? They might come in here! When I told them I could find no law in
                  the Constitution empowering me to sell all the Southern forts and arsenals, they
                  said I must read it again, and find it, or they would wring my neck. For two days
                  and nights I have read it, and I can't find the place. Oh, what shall I do if this
                  Peace Congress miscarry? Where shall rest the head of the last of the American
                  Presidents?"</p>
               <p>I thought indeed the old man's fears had deranged his judgment, and I longed for
                  some interruption, to put a stop to his earnest whisperings. But while he was thus
                  pleading to me, the little whining man was talking about the North agitating the
                  slave question, and hoping they would continue at it till they fired every
                  Southern heart. He was happy to hear they were stretching cables across the
                  Mississippi, and that suspended Abolitionists were ornamenting every Southern
                  forest. He went in for the Union as much as did any other man; the Constitution
                  was framed by the wisest men in the world, and he revered it. He deprecated
                  secession; it would bring sure ruin on the South. But he was sworn to fight to the
                  last for Southern rights—and for State rights, too; and when he could find no one
                  South ready to fight with him against these Abolition usurpers, he would go
                  single-handed. He would take the torch in one hand and a bowie knife in the other,
                  and wade through blood and fire till he had vanquished the whole mudsill race of
                  the North.</p>
               <p>This was Stephens. His braggadocio made the house quiet, for we longed to hear
                  what all he could say; though Buchanan kept continually whispering in my ear, and
                  I heeded little more than the tenor of the speaker's speech. When he ceased,
                  Crittenden presented his resolutions, the substance of which was—all the new
                  States hereafter added on the Western frontier should be slave States, if south of
                  a certain line; or free, if north of the line; that there should be incorporated
                  in the Constitution a fixed law to prevent future generations, as well as the
                  present, from ever interfering with the growth and moral influence of slavery.
                  After his resolutions he made a speech, and we all saw in him the heart of an
                  honest man. He wept while he spake, and Fillmore and others also shed tears. But
                  his resolutions were too much against the North, and not enough in favor of the
                  South. He, too, beheld the inadequacy, and then his good, honest heart gave way.
                  Exhausted, and beholding the insurmountable end, he finished his speech by
                  imploring aid from on High, even while covering his face with both hands, and
                  falling into his seat. And when he sat down, it was like the going out of a lone
                  star in the dark night; he had failed to carry his measures, and now were
                  five-and-thirty millions of people without a ray of hope. Compromise was buried;
                  Mars, muffled yet, but clad in armor, strode o'er all America, and with the craft
                  of long experience; for this was not the end of the Peace Congress, but it
                  lingered many weeks, though as a tool in aid of the fire-eaters. Though we saw the
                  end in the outset, we had not measured strategy with Davis, Toombs, and Stephens.
                  Their craft must hold out a hope, by pretended love for the Union, while their
                  armament was being put in trim to destroy it. Even Crittenden was blinded by them,
                  and made to hope against hope. And far down South did all the newspapers and hired
                  speakers berate the non-conceding terms of the North. Miles was hired for five
                  thousand dollars, and all expenses paid, to lecture South, and to tell the people
                  that the Northerners would concede nothing; and that Massachusetts demanded the
                  unconditional abolition of slavery; and the people South believed him. Cobb was
                  hired for two thousand dollars, for the same purpose, and the people of Georgia
                  believed him. Iverson was hired for six thousand to employ General Twiggs to
                  betray his part of the national army over to the Southern cause, and Twiggs did
                  it; but his soldiers, good, brave hearts, deserted their traitorous leader.</p>
               <p>These subjects were discussed in the Peace Congress, and immediately after
                  Crittenden's speech. And these things caused him to fear for the result; and, thus
                  despairing of the nation's cause, he had put forth his eloquence but to bleed his
                  own heart. Not so with Fillmore and Davis. They wept because they beheld the
                  prospective downfall of an old party. So, when the floor was clear, they were
                  ready with threats of vengeance, some of them declaring that a raid of a thousand
                  men could decapitate the President and Cabinet in two hours' time. I saw that
                  Buchanan was excited, and he pulled me over to him again, asking if they meant
                  him, or Lincoln. I told him Lincoln. "O God, I hope so!" said he; "no—I mean, I
                  hope they may not decapitate me, nor Lincoln neither. Is not this
                  terrible—terrible!" and he cried like a child.</p>
               <p>"It appears to me," said a voice, "there is unnecessary quibbling here. These are
                  demonstrations denoting anything but a Peace Congress. Do you not behold what
                  unnecessary pain you give his Excellency, the President? These vituperations are,
                  in my humble opinion, at variance with the designs of this Congress, and wholly
                  unnecessary and uncalled-for."</p>
               <p>I turned to look at the speaker, for the word <hi rend="i"/>unnecessary, coming in
                  so often, made me fear I had really gotten into the British Parliament. I did not
                  know the man; he was past the middle age, a little bald, with a flushed face.</p>
               <p>"It appears to me, if I may add," he continued, "that an assemblage of this sort
                  is unnecessarily resorting to the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad captandum</foreign>
                  on one side, and quite as unnecessarily resorting to the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >nil ad captandum</foreign> on the other, and that no end will come of it,
                  unless it is in strict adherence, which it ought necessarily to be in order to
                  achieve the called-for objects."</p>
               <p>As he was going on in this style, I heard some one whisper that he was one of the
                  Russels, a correspondent of a paper published in England called the London
                     <title>Times.</title> The other Russel was there, but I could see no family
                  resemblance, nor could I imagine what business such a man had in our Peace
                  Congress. He spoke for half an hour, and the substance of his remarks, translated
                  in English, was:</p>
               <p>"You are very foolish. We great statesmen on the other side the water have long
                  told you you would come to pieces, and now you see it. We pity you, and are ready
                  and willing to advise you in your distress; and we trust, too, you are such a
                  young people, while we are so old and full of experience, you will heed what we
                  say to you. You may be, to be sure, sixty or seventy years, but still you are very
                  young. We may be only sixty or seventy, but then we are a very old people. You
                  must remember that we once attempted to coerce your colonies, and that we failed.
                  All the colonies, at that time, were not half as powerful as are your present
                  dissatisfied States, and the result is manifest to the weakest mind. Still, I can
                  assure you we are on friendly terms with you both, and should remain, in the
                  contest, your neutral well-wisher."</p>
               <p>I then asked several gentlemen if the man was William H. Russel of the London
                     <title>Times;</title> but I failed to learn for certain, neither had I any
                  evidence that said Russel had been imported for the secession cause. Stephens told
                  me that South Carolina had already sent over emissaries to England and France, but
                  he said he knew not who they were. When the speaker resumed his seat, my stranger
                  friend then came forward and greeted him very cordially, many of the people
                  expressing their surprise at such a proceeding in a Peace Congress. Tyler did not
                  call order then, but leaned over, talking to Stephens. Many of the people were
                  whispering, or rather muttering with one another. My stranger friend and the last
                  speaker then started for the door. Toombs was about to speak, but at that instant
                  we heard a voice at the door say, "That is the man—arrest him!" I looked out, and
                  beheld Prescott. Two police were with him, and they advanced to my stranger
                  friend, whom they took prisoner. He swore violently, and demanded the reason.
                  Floyd and others then sprang up and rushed for the door. When I started, Buchanan
                  pulled at my coat, and I dragged him a little. "Oh, Jenkins! Jenkins! don't leave
                  me! don't leave me!" he said, and he stared wildly out of the door. "The South
                  Carolina Commissioners<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6417-00000060"/> ers are coming!
                  They'll wring my neck! They said they would! It is not in the Constitution. Oh,
                  don't leave me, for Heaven's sake! they will wring my neck!" Had he not been so
                  pale and frightened, I should have laughed; but he clung to me as close as Sancho
                  Panza did to Don Quixote when they heard the fulling mills, and I did not know but
                  the like consequences would result from the fright. At that moment, however, Tyler
                  declared the Congress adjourned till next day at twelve o'clock, and he and Toombs
                  and Davis joined arms and walked off together. Buchanan would not go himself, nor
                  let me. I urged him to believe there was no danger; I told him it was another
                  affair altogether, outside the house; but he stared with great consternation
                  toward the door, frequently saying, "It is not in the Constitution. Oh, those
                  Commissioners! What shall I do?" I then started with renewed force, most of the
                  crowd having gone out, the President still clinging to me with one hand, and with
                  the other pointing toward the door in the most abject fear, and I really dragged
                  him out with me. However honored I was to support the American President to his
                  carriage, I felt full as much shame with the burden as did Dr. Johnson with his
                  drunken woman.</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Jenkins," said he, as we stood waiting for the carriage, "you cannot
                  imagine the terrors around me. Only a few days ago, that imperturbable Prescott
                  crammed such arguments down my throat, and, sir, sir, he said, if I sold the
                  forts, I would commit perjury before God. Yes, sir; and he did so enforce his
                  views on me, that a deliriousness of mind has made me more the tool of other folks
                  than I was before. Oh, sir, such a fire as he placed me in—God and heaven on one
                  side, and my party on the other; and they threaten me so terribly, that I can
                  neither walk ahead nor stand still for the danger of them." The tears rolled down
                  his cheeks as he spoke, and he had no more color than the driven snow. I then
                  helped him into the carriage, and he pulled me after him, saying, "For God's sake,
                  come in—see me safe home!" and I did so accordingly.</p>
               <p>Here the writer of this remarkable history waited for Jenkins to proceed, but, on
                  looking up, beheld him penning this line, "End of this Chapter." "Now," said I,
                  "Jenkins, whether are you to be the author of this book, or am I to be?" And he
                  said, "You." "Well, then," said I, "what literal truth is there in this chapter?"
                  "Things cannot always be in literal sense," said he. "Things plain and simple may
                  be, but things and times of great importance never can be. You will remember
                  Richard the Third said, 'I want a horse—quick!' but the historian wrote it, 'A
                  kingdom for a horse!'"</p>

                  <p>FIFTEENTH SITTING OF THE COURTS OF JUDGE FRANCIS UNDERHILL, OF LOUDON HEIGHTS,

                     TOPIC OF WAR AND THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF DIAMOND WEDDINGS WITH A RAINBOW IN THE

               </argument>
               <p>"NOW," said I, after I had read the above heading, "now, Mr. Jenkins, that is
                  carrying things too far! One would think you were making a speech at the
                  Tuileries, or fitting up yourself for a foreign minister."</p>
               <p>"What one?" he asked; and I told him I knew not who, for I saw that even in my
                  criticism I had blundered. Now it so happened that I had been, years ago, the
                  principal witness at the courts of Judge Francis, and that Jenkins was only
                  admitted to the box at the time of building the new Temple; consequently my words
                  were now constructed into sentences under his approval, which accounted for his
                  greater vigilance.</p>
               <p>"All right; go ahead!" said I, and he uplifted his huge manuscript and read off
                  the following, to wit:</p>
               <p>The second thing in importance, now, to the contemplated war between the North and
                  South, was the prospect of a diamond wedding. It was in all the newspapers; it was
                  issued from everybody's tongue; but, true to propriety, the names of the parties
                  were withheld. One was mentioned as the wealthiest and noblest citizen of
                  Washington—a man somewhat advanced, to be sure, but still as vivacious and hopeful
                  as a boy of twenty. He was no less a person than the Judge of that mysterious
                  court of etiquette and learning which has so long been the nucleus of men of great
                  wealth and literary attainments; he was one of the oldest inhabitants; he had
                  travelled farther and learned more than any other man. He had been so long and
                  ardently watching over the affairs of the nation, that he had neglected himself;
                  but, just in the nick of time, he had cast his glories before one of the most
                  enchanting, amiable beauties that ever appeared in the Capital. She was also a
                  millionnaire, and of course the envy of her sex; she ruled the fashions; she was
                  the belle, the queen of the city of queens, and her beauty as rich and rare as
                  ever the sun shone on. Thus read all the papers; thus said all the ladies; thus
                  talked all the gentlemen, and rumor and curiosity exaggerated the stories till the
                  like was never seen before in any age. But, strange to say, no one knew who the
                  lady was; no one, save one, knew who wrote the articles for the newspapers, and
                  every one guessed hard and guessed often to ascertain who the noble parties were.
                  A few knew who the gentleman was; but gentlemen were too much engaged about war to
                  attend to such idle matters; and ladies were the more put to their wits' ends
                  because the gentlemen wouldn't. Now, the truth of it was, that ever mischievous
                  clerk was at the bottom of it all; writing all those stories for the papers,
                  concealing just so much as should deceive both the old maid and Vickey as to which
                  was the intended bride, for he would have them both believe they were both alluded
                  to, but both to be the recipient of a different kind of husband. This he did by
                  stating at the end of the newspaper articles, "also two of the relatives of the
                  same parties, and also wealthy, will be married the same day." So craftily had he
                  managed the matter, that Vickey now placed herself on the list of the betrothed,
                  believing, through the clerk's stories, that Prescott was the millionnaire alluded
                  to, and that the other match was between her aunt and the Judge. One thing
                  troubled Vickey, and that was the style of courtship. She had had her love
                  adventures in a small town in Ohio, and out there the lovers courted in closer
                  proximity. For a long time this had preyed on her mind, and she feared that she
                  might, indeed, be the victim of some mistake or ill-fortune; but she dared not
                  counsel with her money-making papa, and she had learned so much of fashionable
                  life while in a Philadelphia boarding school, that it were useless to apply to her
                  less-informed mother. One day she resolved to have the matter cleared up, and
                  accordingly set herself about it. Prescott had also taken rooms at the Jackson
                  House—a fact that should not be omitted in a work like this—but he seldom lingered
                  about the place, his arduous duties as reporter calling him hence most of the
                  time. Occasionally, however, he would pass through some of the elegant parlors or
                  drawing-rooms, nodding to one and another, bidding the time of day, passing only a
                  few words, and then passing himself out. Thus he had often met Vickey, often said
                  something pleasing, and often most abruptly left; for, though he was the son of a
                  washerwoman, his contact with his fellows had polished him a little, and his
                  duties had made him abrupt to business. He was sharp to view his friends, and read
                  their character and standing at a glance. In Vickey he saw the heart of a good and
                  virtuous girl; but he saw the vanity and folly of a boarding-school education. Her
                  diction was trained, her affectation assumed, and her position in fashionable life
                  painful to herself. And she, too, felt it all; and felt, too, that a man of so
                  sharp a vision as Prescott could see and know her prison bounds. Of her aunt and
                  her mother she was ashamed, not for any fault of theirs, but because she had
                  drunken at the Pierian spring just enough to unfit her for spheres of high or low,
                  and because she loved them too dearly to break from their ungainly ways. Gradually
                  did this light dawn upon her, and gradually, too, did she become unhappy, and
                  suspicious that every body noticed hers and her family's greenness. And then she
                  grieved; she grieved that she had ever improved in intelligence, for it was
                  robbing her noble woman's soul of the objects to love. She could speak fluently,
                  for the boarding-school taught ladies to read and speak in public; taught ladies
                  that a bold utterance was learning; taught that the modulations of voice made
                  woman great, commanding, queenly; taught that a smattering of many books could
                  gild the mind, so that it would pass, on the unthinking mortal who should marry
                  her, as the store-house of an angel's literature. But now, alas, she found that
                  the short period of polishing off at boarding-school was but an external polish;
                  and, too, she found that, to be in the society she had entered, she had needed to
                  have been in it all her life, and to have been ever studying with diligence, to<pb
                     n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6417-00000061"/> make it now a place of enjoyment. Her
                  attractions were not lasting; she could play you on the piano; but could not
                  inform you on the difference between Beethoven and Mozart; she could talk you on
                  the Constitution and our great, free country, but she had never heard of ancient
                  republics—nor did she know Cato from Plato; she could talk you on Byron and
                  Milton, but she could not tell you the difference between <foreign xml:lang="GRC"
                     >acatalectic</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="GRC">catalectic.</foreign> She
                  had heard of <foreign xml:lang="GRC">iambic, trochaic, anapestic,</foreign> and
                     <foreign xml:lang="GRC">dactylic,</foreign> but she knew so little about them,
                  that, when you talked to her of them, she sat in painful silence, or cunningly
                  talked of something else. And thus it was on all subjects and things whereof
                  fashionable life amongst a literary people abounds. The consequence was, young
                  gentlemen, and even ladies, of genuine worth and information, who were at first
                  attracted by Vickey's pretty face, prettily-set speeches, pretty playing, queenly
                  grace, soon discovered she was only plated ware, plated by a boarding-school; and
                  so, for lack of learning she was cast aside. That is to say, every new arrival at
                  the hotel was captured by Vickey first, but first, too, would she get the cold
                  shoulder, and then, plainer ones, perhaps, became the greater lights and glory.
                  But this young lady had a heart, a good, honest heart, and she had been told that
                  she was accomplished, and "fit for the best of society." People had told her that
                  her voice was a second Jenny Lind's, and she knew no better; to encourage her in
                  learning, her boarding-school teachers had told her that she was excellent, and
                  that all she needed was a little more brass; and so she got brass. But now, alas!
                  she had learned that there were to be found giants in learning and
                  accomplishments, and that she herself, the pampered and flattered, was but the
                  victim of a boarding-school polish. And she grieved; she grieved bitterly. She
                  grieved in particular for herself; she grieved in the burden she had with her aunt
                  and mother. Then she became unhappy; and then she became distant and watchful,
                  nay, suspicious. She weighed too heavily all things, and cast them all against
                  herself. This made her weep; ay, at times she wept bitterly. She thought no one
                  loved her; she thought some of them loved her very ardently. The Judge told her
                  every day she was the fairest queen he ever saw; he was ever telling her what
                  glorious times they would have after their marriage, and she thought he meant her
                  aunt and she and Prescott; but she was too much afraid to try to find out, and she
                  would only answer; "Oh, I shall be so happy! all of you are so attentive!" but it
                  was all so muddled and confused she knew not what to make of anything. Though, as
                  before stated, she finally resolved to have things cleared up; and she resolved,
                  too, that she would inquire from some other than that ever-mischievous clerk. So,
                  who should she apply to but her own intended? But how could she do it? Ask him if
                  he really meant to marry her? ask him if he was a millionnaire? ask him where he
                  intended to take her on their wedding trip? Oh, how could she ask such questions?
                  But then she remembered that her boarding-school teachers had ever told her she
                  needed brass; that brass and a fluent tongue would make all things pass. So,
                  accordingly, she set to work to invent some plan to meet Prescott alone—to break
                  through all barriers, and to throw herself into his arms, with a full protest
                  against fashionable courtships, and to entreat him to court her hereafter in close
                  proximity, in country fashion; that they-might look each other in the eyes, and be
                  as tender as they pleased. Now, she knew of no way to meet him thus alone, unless
                  by rising early in the morning, and catching him in the drawing-room before he had
                  finished his morning papers. This, too, she resolved on doing; and after having
                  been for weeks maturing her plans and her set speeches, the morning came on which
                  she was to make the attack. Now it happened, also, that that morning Prescott was
                  late, and that she was herself the first in the drawing-room, and was first
                  apparently engaged with the morning papers. Not long had she been there, when in
                  came Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins, between whom there was no further acquaintance
                  than that each knew who the other was. This occurred at sunrise, and Vickey was
                  not a little astonished to see Mrs. Lucy out so early, for she knew the latter
                  lived at least a mile off; so she bade her good morning, adding, "I thought I was
                  the first lady up this morning!"</p>
               <p>"Why, indeed," said Mrs. Stimpkins, "I have been up nearly four hours! I have
                  written out an hour's lecture, and walked a mile. But that is nothing for me;
                  though I am astonished to see you up so early. Most people lose the best part of
                  the day in bed. Though I see by your looks that something is the matter; have the
                  doctors ordered you to rise early? You look horrid!"</p>
               <p>Vickey shook; Prescott might come in.</p>
               <p>"As I remarked in my lecture last night," Mrs. Stimpkins continued, "these
                  hot-beds of fashion destroy more constitutions, and more effeminate woman's
                  nature, than do everything else under heaven. It makes my heart bleed. Pampered
                  pride and foolish courtships, on which, through the fickleness of man, are wrecked
                  more hearts than were ever joined by all the foolish cupids this side of eternity.
                  I'm done with such stuff, and I wish every woman in the land was awake to that
                  higher progression of human independence. How long have you been sick, Miss
                  Edge?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am not sick; I am quite well, thank you."</p>
               <p>"Then you must be in love, for, God knows, you look a perfect fright—I don't mean
                  your clothes, but your haggard face. Don't mind what I say; I am a plain, blunt
                  woman, and have discarded all deception; I speak the truth, and I tell you
                  plainly, by the look of your face you have either had the ague a month, or have
                  been a month crying your eyes out over some foolish man's pretended love. Is it
                  not so?"</p>
               <p>Vickey's eyes began to cloud; her head hung down, and her hands picked about
                  excitedly, but she also smiled the while.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, you may smile; but, as for me, I am not the smiling kind, nor will you
                  be, when you shall have passed through what I have. I tell you, this world is all
                  wrong; society is turned upside down; progression is hooted at; the same old
                  theories of a hundred years ago are more prized now by the great multitude than
                  are the truths of our newly-discovered harmonial philosophy. It is the
                  disobedience to Nature's laws makes you sick; it is an infringement upon the
                  mental and physical constitution makes you scowl and yawn at the approach of day.
                  It is ignorance that makes all the mischief. The fool puts his finger in the fire,
                  and burns it; the fool sits in the draft, and gets a sore throat; the fool wears
                  tight boots, and gets corns. Look at my shoes, Miss ——." Here she displayed her
                  large feet. "Those are sensible. Ah, again you smile. Well, let us go on a bit.
                  The foolish girl sits wearily at night to pen a love-letter; she dotes on the
                  expected joys; she teases herself with foolish jealousy; she makes herself sick
                  from the tediousness of marriage; but some day she wakes from her folly, to find
                  that she has been a fool. The joys she expected never come; her jealousy is folly,
                  too; for, when she has tried marriage, she is willing her husband may go to the
                  dogs; but she is too foolish to get rid of him, and so she lives and dies a fool;
                  and her folly has burdened her with a world of mental and physical pain. So, you
                  see, when I see a face scarce above twenty, and see its pain deep and deadening, I
                  can surmise the rest. I wish to see a Mr. Prescott; have you seen him this
                  morning?"</p>
               <p>"I have not; perhaps he is not forth."</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Lucy.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Oh, yes, he is; he is always early. But no matter; I have a good deal to do
                     to-day, and so I must be jogging on. Now, mark you, if ever you take a moment's
                     trouble over man, you will find that you are making a fool of yourself. The
                     dreams of congeniality are all folly. When you marry—but God forbid you ever
                     do!—you will find that your husband is a stick, only a stick, and not worth a
                     moment's consideration. And so I charge you, if any such foolish matter ails
                     you, banish it at once and forever. I was once as handsome as you are, but the
                     husbands I have had have given me much grief and anxiety, and now, behold my
                     wrinkles and haggard looks! Think you I am fair? Could man have ever bowed and
                     sued to win such a face? Could such a face have ever had its surface moistened
                     with tears of tenderness for a man? And is this the wreck they have given me?
                     You think, because I am a lecturer on woman's rights, I am a heathen; but I
                     tell you it is not I that speaks; it is the injury and misery burning in my
                     soul, and my mouth is their vent-hole. You'll come to it; every woman,
                     sensitive and refined, comes to it. Only the dull sluggards of slaves of soggy
                     fat women escape, and they only because they are too stupid to see their own
                     misery. If you have a lover—or rather I should say a hyena—I tell you to drop
                     him; he's false, all false. I know what I say—he's false. Only a few months
                     since, I married a man, a real handsome man, with a beardy face, and all that—I
                     mean no less a person than Professor Jackson, the celebrated lecturer on
                     psychometry and woman's rights, and he, too, proved to be but a stick. He says
                     he lost a hundred and sixteen dollars by it, and now he wants me to return the
                     money. It makes my blood boil! He harped on that hundred and sixteen dollars
                     till I was worn out, and so I turned him adrift. But mind you, we had no
                     ridiculous divorce suit. We married ourselves, and, when we found we were
                     uncongenial, we separated ourselves, and that's the nearest heaven I ever got.
                     But the joke of the matter was, I was no sooner out of the scrape, than up
                     jumps another suitor, this young Prescott, and spreads himself to win my heart.
                     Fudge! He has no<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6417-00000062"/> money, and wants to
                     ride into fame on my talents. But I am too old for such stuff——" At this
                     juncture Prescott came in. "Ah, Mr. Prescott, I was waiting for you." Prescott
                     bowed, and bid them good morning; but Mrs. Lucy kept on talking. "The
                     messengers sent on to warn Lincoln of his danger have met him in Philadelphia,
                     and been told by his important Excellency that he don't consider himself in any
                     danger at all, and that he intends to come through on his own account. Now,
                     what I have to say to you is, that last night, after I had delivered my lecture
                     on the Germ of Psychometry, on my way home, it being late, I ran afoul of that
                     mysterious couple for whom we are both under bonds, and this much I abstracted
                     from them by playing eaves-dropper: That sixty men, known as Roughs, from
                     Richmond, Virginia, have gone up to Baltimore with Russel, and that in that
                     city they are to join with the so-called Dead Rabbits and Plug Uglies, and that
                     they are to institute a formal riot, when Lincoln passes through that city, and
                     during the riot Orsini is to stab Lincoln and be borne off by the crowd. The
                     other part of the drama—the seizing of this city and the killing of the
                     Cabinet—you know as well as I do. This information I wish to communicate to
                     General Scott; but, knowing the barriers against my sex, I would not wish to
                     presume so much as to go in person to him."</p>

                  <speaker>Prescott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"This is most important, indeed. Not a moment must be lost; but, to make the
                     matter impressive, I wish you to accompany me to Scott, and in your own manner
                     tell it him."</p>

                  <p>"That, too, is my desire; and knowing your intimacy with him, and your energy
                     against secession, I applied to you at this early hour."</p>

                     for the joys in store. Oh, those mischievous newspapers!" Thereupon Prescott
                     smiled knowingly, and he and Mrs. Lucy went out arm in arm. Poor Vickey would
                     have been willing to sink into non-existence, but motionless a while she sat
                     there, big tear-drops rolling untouched down as pure and innocent a face as
                     ever the sun shone on.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>When Jenkins got thus far, he halted, and I looked up. Said he,</p>
               <p>"You will need to make a break here."</p>
               <p>"How so?" said I.</p>
               <p>"The annals must be uniform," said he; "keep the horse before the cart."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Wait," said he, "and you shall see."</p>
               <p>"See what?" said I.</p>
               <p>Now, when Jenkins saw that he had used the word "see" when he should have said
                  "learn," he bit his lips a little, and then, without making any further answer,
                  commenced again with his monstrous manuscript, and these words he uttered unto me,
                  to wit:</p>
               <p>A galloping horseman in military dress was a strange sight in Washington; but an
                  officer in full uniform, with a sword dangling by his side, made us all look, and
                  watch with anxiety. Americans, whose avocations had ever been in peace, could
                  hardly believe the evidences of their own senses. Yet these things were beginning
                  to appear. Throughout all the South the secessionists had seized the national
                  forts, arsenals, and post-offices. National officers everywhere were committing
                  open perjury, and turning from their sworn allegiance to the nation, and even
                  robbing it, for the benefit of their particular part, a State. They repudiated the
                  doctrine of republics, that the minority shall yield to the will of the majority,
                  and were by their own example instituting a principle of disintegration inimical
                  even to themselves; it was the principle that, whoever likes not a law, need not
                  obey it; but still they called it liberty; like the Indian denuding himself in the
                  city, because he wanted liberty. And so general had this fault become, the
                  treasonable doings down South, that nearly half the nation lost sight of the fact
                  that we had a Government, a Constitution and laws, and the actions of the
                  conspirators were so common, and even so criminal, that the attention could only
                  be aroused by some deed of more than an ordinary character. And one of these
                  occasions is that of which we speak, when who should gallop through the streets of
                  Washington but Iverson, proclaiming claiming the fact that General Twiggs had
                  betrayed the national army over to the cause of the South. This was like the shock
                  of an earthquake in this country. Not that Twiggs, nor his army, was of much
                  value, but the thought of what countryman he was. To him it was not much; for,
                  when he is dead, his infamy is at an end; but the stain on the American name will
                  never die. Our countryman, of high trust in office, had perjured himself—had been
                  bought for five thousand dollars! This was the blow, and it shook the confidence
                  of us all. Now, while this man galloped the streets, himself exulting at the
                  infamy of Twiggs, how could we restrain our indignation, or even sit in calmness,
                  knowing that Buchanan sat cowering, and praying to his party for their
                  forgiveness, inasmuch as he could not, owing to his position, go to the full
                  extremity.</p>
               <p>Here Jenkins became so moved that he could not read for a few moments, and the
                  writer of this remarkable history had to wait a little. Jenkins then took another
                  glass of wine; the glass was not more than two-thirds full, and, when he had put
                  it safely down his neck, he ejaculated the following: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Buchanan! Infamy be thy name,</l>
                        <l>And hatred everlasting to thy kindred;</l>
                        <l>Followers, thine applauders, and all men</l>
                        <l>Whoever speak thee well, take them this curse,</l>

                        <l>Most justly do full merit to the brave,</l>
                        <l>That thou, the opposite, for cowardice</l>
                        <l>And love of party passively played death</l>
                        <l>On millions, take the millions' death, and die</l>
                        <l>In torture of their many million pains,</l>
                        <l>And ceaseless death of mental agony;</l>
                        <l>And when thou'rt dead and gone, and yet remembered,</l>
                        <l>Be't only to receive another curse.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Why," said I, "Jenkins, you were his friend; why curse you thus?"</p>
               <p>He put up his finger, and then went on:</p>
               <p>Aroused one morning by the clash of horses' feet, I beheld Iverson, and heard the
                  story of his joys no sooner, than off I put for Buchanan to acquaint him
                  therewith. I found him in bed, but with some persistence forced my way in, just as
                  he had arisen. He was pale and excited, but I waited not, and so told my story. At
                  first he ejaculated, "Is it possible! Twiggs!" Again I assured him, and again he
                  replied, "Is it possible? Is Twiggs a Democrat?" I told him I knew not, and that I
                  could see not why that should make any difference.</p>
               <p>"All the difference in the world," said he; "all the difference in the world!
                  Don't you know, if I do a thing against him I will only exasperate the South?
                  Rather would I flay the other party alive, for then I would pacify these
                  fire-eaters. Toombs told me this. Besides, is not Twiggs a free man? If the
                  Republican party chooses to draw their throats across Twiggs' sword, is that my
                  fault?"</p>
               <p>Said I, and I looked him fair in the eye, "Buchanan, you are aware that the
                  national soldiers in Fort Sumter are about to starve for lack of food, and that
                  Scott endeavored to provision them on the sly, but that, through your connivance,
                  the secessionists were informed of that fact; and so, to-day, the soldiers are out
                  of food."</p>
               <p>"Don't call it connivance," said he; "it was my extreme friendliness to both
                  parties; besides, it was not me, but Thompson, that telegraphed them."</p>
               <p>"Zounds!" said I, "who is Thompson, but your right-hand man? Why do you keep him
                  in the Cabinet?"</p>
               <p>I had scarcely uttered the words, when a messenger arrived and communicated the
                  important intelligence that the secessionists had opened fire on the Star of the
                  West, the steamer referred to. Said he, "Mr. President, it is true what I tell
                  you; the South Carolinians have fired on an unarmed steamer that was carrying food
                  to the national soldiers, and the vessel was obliged to put back." Buchanan then
                  sat down and cried like a child; and when I asked him the cause thereof, he said,
                  "Because such conduct will ruin the Democratic party. Had they waited till the
                  fourth of March, they had had cause enough; but now, alas! alas! Why have they
                  heaped this thing on my head? 'Tis thus those Commissioners wring my neck. O my
                  God, my God! what shall I do?" and again he cried as if his heart would break. The
                  messenger and I then turned to leave him, but he called me, saying, "Wait here,
                  Jenkins; I want you to take my message to the House to-day." I told him I would,
                  and I returned and sat down, but the messenger left. Seeing that Buchanan was so
                  agitated, I took up the unfinished message, and began to read it, but was
                  interrupted by the unceremonious entrance of Jeff. Davis, who, laughing,
                  rein-formed us of the firing on the Star of the West. Said he, "I laugh, because
                  no longer ago than yesterday I made a speech<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000063"/> to prove that there would not be a gun fired on
                  either side. But I see I made a mistake, and I think 'tis laughable."</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Buchanan.</speaker>
                  <p>—"I think it is no laughing matter."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Why, no, not the firing, but the speech I made. It will go in history, that
                     the head and front of secession made a speech in Congress to prove all would be
                     done in peace, while even on the day, and in the same hour thereof, the guns of
                     the chivalrous South began the woful thunder."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Buchanan asked him if he had heard of Twiggs' conduct.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," said Davis; "but that was looked for. It had been boasted at the Peace
                  Congress that it would take place."</p>
               <p>Buchanan then asked me to read the message to Davis, and I complied therewith, and
                  thus it ran:</p>

                           <head>"To the Senate and House of Representatives assembled:</head>
                           <p>"Americans and citizens of this free land, behold! The hour of trouble
                              and the fall of an empire is at your doors. Arouse ye, and heed the
                              moral precepts of your fathers, or perish all. Arouse to the danger
                              hanging over your heads, and your best reason manifest; for the peril
                              of civil war hath sent forth his lightning tongue, and his thunder
                              resounds on the wild ocean. Behold the tenets of the Constitution and
                              the doctrine of State rights, for they are threatened from the great
                              North, and about to be renovated by the imperial South. Hear me, hear
                              me, in Taney's name hear me, for I am the last of the American
                              Presidents. Hear me, O my countrymen, and then judge ye. Certain
                              Commissioners appeared before me, and threatened the nation—nay, the
                              head of the nation. Am I to have my neck wrung for fault of the
                              Constitution? How could I sell the forts, when there is no law for it?
                              How could I protect the forts, when there is no law for that neither?
                              Are not forts built and manned for the purpose of protecting the
                              nation? Was our nation built merely to protect the forts? Nay, verily.
                              It is not in the Constitution, and is that my fault? I have cried out,
                              Peace! and I have showed them my example; but my countrymen are
                              becoming refractory, and are stirring each other up to deeds of blood.
                              But they are freemen, and, although the ascendency of Lincoln is
                              repulsive to many, it is not unconstitutional; neither do I value it a
                              sufficient cause for a general civil war; and these my sentiments I
                              now reiterate for the twentieth time.</p>
                           <p>"Therefore, hear ye, O my countrymen, and fight who may. To you of the
                              South, whom more I love than I do my Bible, I proclaim peace; and I do
                              full assurance give, as I am a Democrat, I will not reinforce any of
                              the Southern forts without your consent; neither will I give the
                              soldiers, who are now in the forts, any morsel of food during my term
                              of office, for it is not so ordained in the Constitution. And if said
                              soldiers starve, it is their own fault, for they need not remain so
                              long.</p>
                           <p>"To you, citizens of Charleston, I warn you not to fire on the
                              national forts in your harbor during my term of office; but if you see
                              proper to build batteries, and to get all things in readiness for that
                              purpose—and though the building of said batteries is not within itself
                              treason, yet the whole thing must be carried on at your own
                              expense.</p>
                           <p>"To you, my countrymen of the North, who have too much agitated this
                              question, peace be unto you; and I ordain, by this my special message,
                              that you must not hurt the South during my term of office.</p>
                           <p>"Lastly, my countrymen, pray for me, for the ills I have to bear.</p>
                           <p>"Given under my hand and seal," etc.</p>

               <p>When I had finished reading it—though the above is but a brief of it—Davis jumped
                  up, and, cramming both hands down his pockets, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Mr. President, that is neither fish nor flesh.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_012" xml:id="return_012">*</ref>
                   It is the message of a child spoken to babies. Ere another morning sun I
                  shall be President of this country. You may wriggle and squirm for yet a short
                  while, but the inevitable truth, that the Southern people shall rule this nation,
                  will force itself upon the public mind before another month. If there be war, you
                  will be, through all time, cursed by both North and South. Had you been firm to
                  either, you might have saved the shedding of blood; but you have done the worst
                  you possibly could."</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_012">*</ref>The remarks here made by Davis are almost identical with his speech in the
                     Senate, neither are they any plainer or more abusive.</p>

                  <speaker>Buchanan.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Why, Davis, why is this? Have I not ever hearkened to your counsel?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Davis.</speaker>
                  <p>—"And therefore I curse you, because you have been my tool to carry out my
                     purposes; but now, as I need you no more, you are in the way, and so my enemy.
                     You have been false to your oath of office to protect the national property,
                     and so you are false to the whole country. And now all men shall oppose you and
                     curse you. The sooner you get out of this place, the better it is for you."</p>
                  <p>Buchanan looked pitifully at him, pale as death, with big tear-drops rolling
                     down his face, but Davis continued:</p>
                  <p>"Your every action calls forth hate; your every message is so much disgust;
                     your whole life, your person, nay, the clothes on your back, can only be
                     remembered for all time with curses for your last four years of infamy. You are
                     unworthy the name of man, if, indeed, you have the outward semblance; and you
                     are too destitute of sense and cunning to be by will a devil, and yet your
                     imbecility has made you more the tool of the infernal regions than has been any
                     other living thing since the foundation of the world. For God's sake, leave
                     Washington at once; go hide yourself in the mountains, and live the life of a
                     toad; or, better still, tie a stone to your neck and swim the Potomac, that
                     your hideous person may be lost to the sight of man forever. Lincoln will never
                     reach Washington; a grand <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup d'état</foreign> is on
                     the tapis, and no man knows what an infuriated mob may do. Take my advice now;
                     go away—go anywhere; but leave at once, or the threat of the Commissioners will
                     fall on you ere you suspect."</p>
                  <p>Buchanan grew even paler still, and his knees knocked like one about to die of
                     fear. "Oh, Davis! Davis!" he cried, "why this unsuspected blow! Give me a
                     moment's leave. Merciful Heaven! what have I done to merit this? Oh, pity me,
                     sir; you know not what I have passed through," and he sobbed so much he could
                     say no more.</p>
                  <p>Davis retorted, "I have no pity. I'm not the pitying kind, and, in the language
                     of the ancient chivalry, I love blood more. A man's life is but so much dirt,
                     and, when it is in the way, it must be brushed off. We are done with you, and
                     you are in the way. Some humanity has prompted me to warn you to leave
                     Washington, but the choice is yours. If you quit at once, surrender all the
                     affairs of Government, you may pacify the demands of the injured South; but no
                     less an act of yours will ever subvert the coming civil war."</p>

                     gasped, and then Davis sneered, and curled his lip in fiendish anger. "All
                     right," said he; "you are a Democrat, and free to choose what you will; and you
                     have death—for we are sworn that every Northern occupant of this mansion shall
                     die, though it be for years to come. Should war miscarry, or any deed the time
                     defer, still this thing shall be, though we hire a thousand men to ply the
                     assassin's knife." He turned away and strode out without saying another
                     word.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Buchanan was speechless, and I knew not what to say, lest I might give him more
                  pain; but I suggested that that was merely one of the sparks out of a fire-eater's
                  mouth.</p>
               <p>"Had you not better go and ascertain the truth of these things?" said he.</p>
               <p>Said I, "I will." I then rose up to leave him, but he rose up too.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jenkins! Jenkins!" said he, and he put his arms around me, and really bawled
                  aloud. I kind of laughed a little, and pulled him loose, saying, "Oh, don't; come,
                  now, it will be all right, I hope," and so I released myself and left, just as I
                  saw him fall back into his large armchair.</p>
               <p>Here the writer of this invaluable history is obliged to forerun the statements,
                  not in imitation of Shakespeare, but because a combination of annals is history.
                  That is to say, that immediately after the above remarkable interview, Jeff. Davis
                  was elected President of the Southern confederacy. A few men had assembled at
                  Montgomery, and formed a plan of combination for the Southern States, and thus put
                  a man at the head of their government; the full plan was, however, to assume the
                  Government of the whole United States. Lincoln was to be killed in Baltimore, and
                  the Virginia roughs were to kill Buchanan, all the Cabinet, and such men as were
                  deemed dangerous to the South. The next day after the murders, Jeff. Davis and his
                  cabinet were to enter Washington, and so assume the whole national affairs.</p>
               <p>Now, with this explanation, we again refer to Jenkins' notes, beginning with these
                  words:</p>
               <p>But before I tell you more of what I did, let me now turn back to the young girl
                  we left at the Jackson House, so full of tears and disappointment—I mean Vickey.
                  Turning her face toward the front window, to hear what Iverson said,<pb
                     n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6417-00000064"/> she attracted his attention. He reined
                  in his horse and rode near, while she threw open the window. Searching then in his
                  pockets, he inquired if she were not the same lady who formerly promenaded so much
                  with Miss Ann Underhill, and also asking if she knew one Wadsworth. Vickey replied
                  in the affirmative, and at once brightened up, thinking she should hear good news
                  from poor gentle Ann.</p>
               <p>"Tell me," said Iverson, "if you please, where is Wadsworth? I have private word
                  for him, which I am sorry I cannot communicate to you."</p>
               <p>Vickey told him she could not tell, and that she knew not how he could be found,
                  unless by applying to one Mr. Jenkins, who was his sincere friend.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, tell me where I can find Jenkins," said he.</p>
               <p>"Most likely at the President's Mansion," said she. "But pray, sir, have you any
                  news of Miss Underhill? Can you tell me where she is?"</p>
               <p>"I would that I could tell you," said he.</p>
               <p>"Oh, so much I would love to hear from her—where she is, and how she fares!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you may, some time," said he.</p>
               <p>"Then it must be soon; for if Lincoln and Buchanan, and all the officers of the
                  Government, are to be killed to-morrow, we must pack up at once and leave
                  Washington."</p>
               <p>He laughed, and then inquired, "Is there anything new afoot?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, indeed there is; but the whole thing has leaked out, and two of my
                  friends have gone down to acquaint Scott with the designs of the
                  conspirators."</p>
               <p>Iverson wanted to hear no more. The conspiracy was discovered; something must be
                  done to outwit Scott, if, indeed, that were possible. Iverson laughed again to
                  Vickey, and told her to believe the whole thing was as groundless as a woman's
                  fear, and that not a drop of blood would be shed. "But I forget, I must go find
                  Jenkins," he added, and then galloped off.</p>
               <p>Poor Vickey had a world of trouble before, but now she had curiosity to battle
                  with—a thing at all times burdensome to woman; and in her fevered excitement she
                  got up and walked toward the veranda, where she beheld that mischievous clerk
                  calmly smoking his cigar. He was so near by that he had evidently seen all and
                  heard all that had been said, and had no doubt seen her intended husband walk off
                  with that strong-minded woman. He rose up to meet her, and came forth smiling,
                  bidding her good morning, and calling it a very fine day.</p>
               <p>"Too well, indeed, Miss Edge, do I divine the cause of your discomfort. But bear a
                  while; heed nothing you see. It is the course of fashionable society. Young men
                  try their intended wives by every possible manœuvre, to see if they are
                  unsuspecting and constant. Prescott is desperately in love with you, but he needs
                  must put you to this severe test. It was for that purpose I was stationed here,
                  and you may rest assured I will tell him you were as joyful and unconcerned as if
                  you cared not whether he returned or not. You see, he fears you are after his vast
                  fortune."</p>
               <p>"Really!" said she.</p>
               <p>"Of course," said he.</p>
               <p>"Well, now," said she, "Mrs. Stimpkins says he is not worth a farthing in the
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Certainly. And did she not say Prescott was after her?"</p>
               <p>"She did; and she signified she would not under any circumstances accept him."</p>
               <p>"Just so; that was their programme. It is done in order to see if you really love
                  the man and honor him, or if you are after money. You notice that ever since his
                  proposal he has kept aloof?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, to my sorrow I have."</p>
               <p>"Keep you aloof also. Leave it all to me."</p>
               <p>"But how am I to know he intends marrying me? He is so distant, and I tell you,
                  for you and the Judge are the only real friends I have here; but I am at a loss
                  what to do. My mother urges me to fix the marriage day at once, for she is afraid
                  it is not all right. And Mr. Prescott treats me as indifferently as he does the
                  other ladies. Already it is in the newspapers, and every one looks at me so, my
                  heart almost breaks!" She sobbed right heartily, and the clerk bade her compose
                  herself. "You know," she continued, "father says we must leave Washington in a few
                  days, because there will be war, and I don't know what all, on the day of
                  Lincoln's arrival. Oh, dear! oh, dear!" and she renewed her sobbing.</p>
               <p>"Miss Edge," said the clerk, "now, if you please, leave the matter in my hands. I
                  am used to this sort of thing, and I am stern in my course. You are excited, and
                  may make a blunder of it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I thank you. You are so kind!" she said, and the clerk replied,</p>
               <p>"Oh, I will write him such a letter—no, that will not do; love affairs should
                  never be written down. I'll go talk to him. You should have been married a month
                  ago, and I'll tell him so. Indeed, I shall tell him he will lose you altogether if
                  he don't look out."</p>
               <p>"And that is true, too. But see, my aunt comes!"</p>
               <p>In another moment the old maid came in, but Vickey dodged her, and so went out.
                  The old maid held her teeth and plumpers in one hand, and her bonnet in the
                  other."</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mr. Jackson," said she—she always called the clerk Mr. Jackson;
                  "it's a nice morning this morning. Wasn't that my niece, Vickey?" He also said
                  good morning, but told her he did not know who the lady was that just went out. "I
                  wanted her to help me fix up a little, and I thought that was her. These patent
                  teeth and plumpers, I don't know yet how to put 'em in, and I've been to Vickey's
                  room, and she isn't in. She's a darling, good girl;" and away the old maid mosied
                  out.</p>
               <p>"Now, let me see," said the clerk, in soliloquy; "I am afraid the Judge will never
                  take that old creature; and I am afraid Prescott will never marry the gay Vickey
                  with all her diamonds. Vickey would not marry the old Judge, that's certain. Now,
                  what's to be done? If I could put myself in Prescott's place, why I'd marry
                  Vickey, that's more certain than anything I know of. But I would not marry her
                  while she is so fond of Prescott. Here's work. I swear I'll marry her. I'll go
                  tell her with all the cunning I can invent, that Prescott wouldn't give a pinch of
                  snuff for her; that he values one of Mrs. Stimpkin's big shoes more than he does
                  the whole Edge family. Then I shall weep for Vickey; if possible kiss away her
                  tears. Tell her how I too once lost an intended, which will be all false, and then
                  I will offer her my mighty heart, which in my own estimation is not bigger than a
                  pin's head. Perchance I'll get her father's fortune. I must first publish myself
                  as heir to some great estate, and now and henceforth wear fine new cloth."</p>
               <p>The clerk then went out elated beyond measure, confident that no one knew his
                  intentions. Though his soliloquy was not that of a novelist, but a real one, he
                  had spoken, and he was heard. An ear unused to stratagem, an ear not stationed to
                  hear, but as pure and noble as ever passively received an unholy thought, now
                  caught the tenor of a designed love. The owner was chilled and frozen by the
                  thought that a man for a fortune would prey on so fair and thoughtless a girl, and
                  all horrors traced in tales of fiction came up to shock and terrify. Who was
                  there, at so early an hour? Where was a hiding-place? There were no closets.
                  Parlors on one side; a hall on another; veranda on another; and an office on the
                  fourth. And yet there was a person concealed—a person nearly starved. For several
                  days a noise had been occasionally heard, but the plainness of the walls dispelled
                  all conception. In earlier days, when room was less a consideration than now, the
                  Jackson House office extended across the hall; but some ingenious landlord saw
                  that, by extending the hall at the other end, and moving the folding doors about
                  six feet nearer the middle side of the large parlors, an additional room could be
                  constructed nearer the yard, which room is now called the bridal room. When the
                  folding doors doors were moved, the opening behind had to be either boxed up and
                  papered or built up with brick and mortar. As it was done by contract the opening
                  was never filled in; so that, by coming from the cellar upward, a small, thin
                  person could stand within the wall, resting the feet on the short ends of boards
                  that extended into the hollow. But a person could not get up into the hollow space
                  without springing the boards upward, and, when once inside, the boards would
                  spring downwards, rendering it altogether impossible for the person to ever get
                  out alone. But as a full description of this accidental trap was published at the
                  time referred to, no further reference need be made to it here. Suffice it to say,
                  in this death-like closet was the fugitive Lizzie, alias Joe Tavers! And now let
                  us see how this thing came about. You will remember that she kept the newspaper
                  stand for a while, and that she very unceremoniously disappeared. The cause of it
                  was, she feared she was discovered. Persons had been to buy papers and had eyed
                  her so carefully that she became frightened; and well for her that she did. She
                  had become identified. She ran to the Jackson House, to hide herself. Here she
                  lingered for some time, in order to see me especially, but, while watching on the
                  veranda, she beheld the murderer Orsini, who ran for her, and she ran down into
                  the back cellar. He saw her go down the cellar stairs, and quickly followed. She
                  ran then into the front cellar for a moment, seeking a hiding-place behind the
                  Judge's wine-barrels, but her pursuer came too quickly on, and she fled up in the
                  corner by the kindling-wood, just as the light from the now groping detective's
                  lamp cast a ray on the space in the wall. It was full twelve feet up, and a huge
                  plank rested on the edge. Up the plank she scrambled with all her<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000065"/> power, with the agility of a squirrel, to find
                  alas! that the hole was too small. But no; she felt the boards spring upward.
                  Quick—'twas freedom, or endless slavery! Her head and tapered shoulders passed
                  through—the plank fell—and out went the light in the detective's hand. In a few
                  moments more she drew herself up, through, and stood within the hollow wall. The
                  detective got another light; carefully searched every crook and corner, and
                  finally concluded she had escaped some other way. The servants were all on hand,
                  and were given a full description of the fugitive, and promised, within her
                  hearing, that whoever found her, and caught her, should have a hundred dollars.
                  Then they left—left the cellar, left Lizzie in the darkness; left her in the
                  hollow wall, a beautiful American slave, who now vowed to heaven she would remain,
                  and starve, ere she would more hazard her liberty. But resolutions, like all other
                  things, can be overcome, and so were hers. Three days and nights in total
                  darkness, in an immoveable position, with nothing to eat, with an active mind, a
                  mind awake to all the glories of liberty, had by slow degrees gradually overcome
                  her determination to die, had little by little invented yet other means of gaining
                  a life of freedom. The sounds of voices in the parlors during the day had aroused
                  her feelings, filled her with envy, with remorse, hatred, love, and with a slow,
                  burning fire. Little by little her tiny fingers had picked at plaster, till a hole
                  was through the wall, whither came a ray of light. Then the curious eye sought the
                  outward group—fashion, glory! Lace and diamonds, gold and the genial smiles of a
                  free people in the parlors she then beheld. They, too, were Americans. Only one, a
                  red-faced man, with bald head, who nibbled the head of a gold cane; he had a
                  foreign twang, and he boasted that, in the coming war, his country would at least
                  sympathize with the South. Then she picked the hole larger, but yet no more than
                  the size of a pea, to see if any face she knew. But no; all were strangers. Oh,
                  that she could see a friend, to look once more on one she knew was true, and then
                  with the happy view, to die! Only one person had ever cared much to save her; that
                  was Jenkins, and Jenkins she would see. But would he ever come? Had he ever stayed
                  so long from those parlors before? Might he not devise some way to get her away—to
                  get her something to eat? But day after day she lingered, waiting, watching for
                  Jenkins or for death. So weak, so frail, so persecuted, almost a maniac. Poor
                  girl! And yet to make and to keep slaves like thee, my own countrymen are
                  rebelling against the great republic!</p>
               <p>But here I must refrain; history should not have the style of romance or fiction.
                  It will be borne in mind that after I left Buchanan, I sought for Prescott and
                  such others as would be able to give me definite information regarding the
                  expected attack on the city of Washington. Well, as I came down the avenue, and
                  meeting a friend, I halted for a moment's word, when who should gallop up but
                  Iverson, shouting, "Ha! Is your name Jenkins?" I looked round, and when he saw me
                  he knew me, and for reasons which I care not to mention, he dreaded me. He had
                  supposed that Jenkins was some person he did not know, but now he saw me, he was
                  taken aback, he would not tell me or ask of me what he wanted. I saw his
                  embarrassment as soon as I turned round, but he quickly retorted by saying, "I
                  merely halted to say, go, you, and boast of Twiggs!" and then he wheeled his
                  horse, and galloped off. Without boasting of myself, I must say I knew too much of
                  human ingenuity to be deceived by such a turn; and I must also acknowledge I was
                  not a little interested to know what the mistake was. But this I would not perhaps
                  have ever found out, had it not been for the remarkable events that immediately
                  followed at the Jackson House, which, though talked of so much at that time, have
                  never been published till now. The particulars of the whole affair were as
                  follows:</p>
               <p>As I was passing through the parlors I heard a voice say "Stay, Jenkins!" At that
                  instant the Judge met me and I said, "Certainly Judge, what is it?" He looked at
                  me from head to foot, retorting, "What is what?"</p>
               <p>Said I, "you said, 'Stay, Jenkins!'"</p>
               <p>"Then I'm not sober."</p>
               <p>"You certainly did!"</p>
               <p>"I certainly am a fool."</p>
               <p>"Then there is a ventriloquist in this house. I heard those two words once before
                  and not an hour since."</p>
               <p>"Tut," said the Judge, "'tis that Mrs. Stimpkins' spirit. The yowl of her voice
                  infects the house, the furniture, the very air. Whoever sees her once, or hears
                  her nasal twang, will ever after hear and see her when he chances to pass the same
                  spot where she has been. These strong-minded women remind me of horrors; as, for
                  example, a person is murdered in a forest, the strongest man will dread to visit
                  the dire spot—on a dark night. Thought, that divine principle in man, beholds the
                  thing in a thousand times more revolting form. So, likewise, is ever the memory
                  troubled by the thought of these misfortunately organized creatures. Once having
                  seen them, we see them ever after; when we are asleep, when awake; in company and
                  in solitude. We first see her in argument; then in the lecture-room; then with a
                  cowhide or a pistol; then married, then single; then deserted; then haggard; a
                  living skeleton or a thing of lust; shunned by true women, hated by true men;
                  sinking into her tomb the most wretched of anything on earth. Nay, verily, God
                  save me from an intellectual woman!"</p>
               <p>"No, I understand; you go for the girls of seventeen?"</p>
               <p>"Did you see that?" the Judge asked.</p>
               <p>"I did; who was it to?" said I.</p>
               <p>"Why, how do I know? Am I accountable for every love-sick swain's poetry?"</p>
               <p>Now, while we thus pleasantly talked a few minutes, pacing back and forth through
                  the parlor, the clerk came and told the Judge that Mr. Edge wanted to speak a word
                  with him in the office, and so the Judge went out. I followed, passing near the
                  folding doors, intending to ring for my man-servant. Again I heard that voice,
                  "Stay, Jenkins!" The hair of my head stood on end. I was not superstitious, but
                  the voice was that of Lizzie, only it was so hollow and death-like. Almost palsied
                  in my tracks, I halted. "Fear not!" I sat down. "In God's name speak not!" My eyes
                  were flooded with tears, and the blood coursed in torrents to my fevered brain. In
                  a moment more the clerk came in, and began to tell me a new-laid scheme for
                  another wedding; but I heard not. I was more like one dead than alive, and yet I
                  had confidence enough to dissemble before the clerk. Merely saying, "yes" or "no"
                  to him, I withdrew my note-book and pretended to be writing, hereupon he cleverly
                  withdrew. For one or two minutes I waited, but never before did my mind travel so
                  fast.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jenkins!" Again I felt the immortal stroke. "Your poor fugitive, Lizzie, is
                  hid in these walls! Keep still, or all is lost! I am not a ghost, but am hidden
                  here, and am almost dead." Her voice was indeed weak, and I waited in great pain,
                  the blood now almost freezing in my person. "I can't get down. Come into the
                  cellar, and help me. I think, if you help me down, I will die in your arms, for it
                  seems heaven has so ordained it!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am glad to find you! I will be with you in one moment," said I.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do come!" said she; "but come with caution."</p>
               <p>I then went down into the cellar, telling the steward the Judge wanted me to
                  examine his wine-barrels. After groping about for some time, I found the
                  neighborhood, and, then, by drawing matches, succeeded in getting a view of the
                  place, or at least of the hole through which she had crept, and the crevice was no
                  larger than my two fists. Fortunately, indeed, for her, or she could never have
                  entered the place but for wearing boy's clothes. I called to her, but got no
                  answer. My matches went out, and I had to go get a candle. Thus provided I again
                  sought and found the place, but my calling brought forth no answer. I became a
                  little nervous, for the thought moved me that her relaxation from secrecy might
                  have caused her death. After some considerable difficulty I erected the plank
                  before mentioned, and then ascended and examined the crevice. Far along, at one
                  end, I touched her foot; it was warm. Again I called "Lizzie! Lizzie! Joe
                  Travers!" but no answer came, and my own blood turned cold as I pressed her little
                  warm foot. What to do I knew not. I pressed against the two spring-boards, but
                  could not raise them up, for she herself was in the way. I renewed the calls, but
                  all was silent. Almost chilled to death myself with the thought that one of my
                  poor fellow-creatures had died so suddenly in so miserable a place, I then came
                  and reflected a moment on what to do. Perhaps she had only fainted away, and, if I
                  betrayed her, on her coming to, she would be again sent into endless slavery.
                  Perhaps she was dead, and I might get myself in trouble by not giving the coroner
                  due notice. Who should I apply to? Not a servant could I trust. Not that blabbing,
                  mischievous clerk. Prescott or Wadsworth? But where find them?</p>
               <p>Once more I ascended the plank, and pressed her foot, calling, Lizzie! Lizzie! Joe
                  Travers!" but all was silent. I could not get my finger up to feel her pulse. Down
                  I came, almost dead with perplexity. But what was my horror, the Judge and the
                  clerk were coming for wine! They exclaimed simultaneously, "What, Jenkins!" "Oh,
                  in heaven's name," said I, for I instantly resolved to tell it all; "see you here,
                  what horrors. That fugitive Lizzie is hid in the wall, and nearly, if not quite
                  dead!"</p>
               <p>"Lizzie? Why, she's been gone a week," said the Judge.</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6417-00000066"/>
               <p>"No matter," said I, "she is here; come, and I will show you."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible!" said the clerk; and I now saw in that mischievous face the
                  glimpse of a pure and noble heart. In a moment more the clerk ran up the plank,
                  and called her, but he, too, got no answer. Down he came, saying, "Stay you here;
                  I will go for the old Dutch doctor in Mark's drug-store. He can raise the dead.
                  Fear not, fear not; if she come to life, she shall never be a slave!"</p>
               <p>Out he went, and we remained there to ponder on the sad scene. But we were
                  startled by a death-like moan. Up I went again, calling her by name. "Water!
                  water!" she whispered, and then moaned a little. The Judge then went into the
                  ante-cellar, and called aloud for a saw and an axe. Soon now the cellar was full
                  of folks. Then came the old doctor. Then we sawed off the boards; bent them, pried
                  them, pulled them, and finally extricated the pale, and almost lifeless slave
                  girl. We laid her on a straw mattress; the old doctor examined her, but spoke not.
                  Once he held up his hand to us all, saying, "Sh! sh!" Then he ordered us to carry
                  her upstairs and into a quiet room. The curious crowd then dispersed, but we bore
                  her to a dear, sweet room and moistened her lips with water. Serene and calm she
                  lay there, the orphan child, alike our sister in the sight of the Almighty! She
                  was insensible! I fanned her with a newspaper, and on its page I saw, great God! a
                  Southern Confederacy, based on the cornerstone of slavery. In another column was a
                  letter from Wm. H. Russel, eulogizing the Southern cause. And he was an
                  Englishman. But Lizzie saw them not; only the eye of Him who governs all she
                  sought in her death-bed visions! Long we waited with her; long we watched her
                  every symptom. Some little drugs the doctor gave her, and then he ordered not a
                  word to be spoken. How long we sat in silence I know not; but we saw her face take
                  more a living form and her breathing was like one asleep. Then we left; only the
                  old doctor and a negro girl remained with her. On the day following, all the city
                  papers had it published; told the whole story.</p>
               <p>Here Jenkins bade the writer to end this chapter, for he assures me that that
                  which follows is so deeply absorbing to the mind that historians will refer to it
                  for a thousand years to come.</p>

               <p>"Why?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Why," said I, "if parliamentary is derived from the French, signifying talking
                  testament, the above is wilful and plain to be seen. Had you used the word <hi
                     rend="i"/>of, instead of <hi rend="i"/>in, in the last line, you had made sense
                  out of "all-absorbing," and rendered it——" But he interrupted, "All right! all
                  right! Begin—begin!" And thereupon he turned to the notes and read the following,

                                 square on the head. We want none of this how-come-you-so kind of

               <p>We'll follow her. We care little for Mr. Edge; he goes to his railroad contracts;
                  he studies all the rules of economy and intrigue. Mrs. Edge, too, she is burdened
                  about Prescott's intentions; and also about her old maiden sister. She fears her
                  sister will make blunders in fashionable life; she sees not herself, neither does
                  anybody else. And so we leave Mr. and Mrs. Edge a while, turning to the good girl
                  Vickey, whose smattering inception of culture was her misfortune.</p>
               <p>The clerk feared the Judge would come in the general parlor, and so he stationed
                  himself near Vickey's private parlor, in order to have his love adventure unknown
                  to the Judge. He had, therefore, no sooner been apprized of Vickey leaving her
                  mother and father's presence, than he fell back a pace, and waited to assail her
                  affections.</p>
               <p>"O joy! joy!" said he, as soon as she approached him. "Never fair lady looked on
                  so happy a man! Behold me—look what a wondrous change! Am I noble? Am I vain?
                  fortunate? wealthy? zealous? ambitious? proud? commanding? here mark you my lordly
                  bearing! And so many fools bow down to me. My dear sir! My very considerate sir!
                  Shall I speak to your honor? Oh, isn't it glorious!—to be drunk with joy! to have
                  a fortune thrust upon one; to be one day a clerk, with every guest calling and
                  growling in one's ears, and the bitter-smiling snarl to bear in the name of hired
                  man; and then in a day to be transformed into a very prince of fortune, and feel
                  the soft caress and deep solicitude that the natural nobleness<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000067"/> ness has so long sought for! Oh, Miss Edge, Miss
                  Edge, be joyful! Sing me your sweetest songs; play me your tenderest music! For
                  really I am intoxicated with the happiness of the present hour."</p>
               <p>Vickey was a good, unsuspicious girl, and knew not what to make of so sudden a
                  burst of joy; but she urged him to tell her, for she said, there was nothing in
                  man's nature so winning to woman's heart as this capacity to be happy. But he
                  feigned not to hear her for a while, rubbing his hands together, and ejaculating
                  with great warmth:</p>
               <p>"Oh, I shall go to Europe—to the royal courts of Britain, France, Germany, Italy!
                  Oh, land so classic to classic ears, I come! The dreams of my earlier days have
                  come upon me like a thunder-cloud in summer, to electrify and set on fire my ever
                  out-bursting soul of royal emotion, and I know no quiet, no rest. Come, sing!
                  Come, play! Romp with me, play me your choicest jokes! Say, you, I have just come
                  in possession of my grandfather's fortune. He was Earl of Standburgh, England. I
                  have the title—the money—Four millions sterling! And I shall have a seat in the
                  British Parliament! Say nothing, keep it quiet. But come, I have a word for you,
                  and you know you have received many introductions through me; there are many
                  ladies here, who have become very desirous for my company for the past few days;
                  the very ones, too, who would not deign to treat me civilly as clerk, and
                  now——"</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vickey.</speaker>
                  <p>—"I thought of that, and noticed something of it."</p>
                  <p>"And now," he continued, "only to those who treated me well, will I even speak.
                     I will be the lord I am. To those who spoke me kindly, I will be a lord."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vickey.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Did I not ever treat you well?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, most kindly, Miss Edge—most kindly, indeed. And I admire you for it. I
                     esteem you above all others for your many pleasantries. And for that reason am
                     I come to you, for I have now to speak to you in your adversity." He stopped
                     short and looked down a moment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vickey.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Of my adversity? What do you mean? You frighten me!"</p>
                  <p>"Of your adversity, indeed. But believe me, Miss Edge, of all I have ever done,
                     to try make you happy here or promote your best interest in good society, I
                     have done it with as noble a heart as ever rested in the bosom of man. When you
                     came here first, I beheld in your matchless beauty—nay, wince not, for as I
                     shall soon be in foreign lands never to return here, and never to see you more,
                     it behooves me to speak you honestly—I beheld in your beauty, your grace, and
                     naturally royal accomplishments, the charms to win from any source, no matter
                     how exalted, the hearts of many men. In some measure I guarded you, bringing
                     into your presence only those whom I knew to be truly worthy. One by one I have
                     seen them take up with you, and if I found them unworthy, I drove them off.
                     You, poor, bashful creature, fancied they deserted you."</p>
                  <p>Again he stopped a moment as if weighing the delicacy of his subject.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vickey.</speaker>
                  <p>—"You give me great joy. I fancied I lacked in accomplishments, for I was not
                     blind to those apparent slights."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"Not at all; I was at the bottom of it all. And yet not all. And it is that of
                  which I would speak; for as I am a nobleman by title, I will play the part by
                  action. Oh, villainous, villainous man, what vain conceits and crafty measures
                  thou would'st palm off on unthinking woman! Oh, what corruptions and base desires
                  this world's made of! But say, you know how light and trifling I have been; well,
                  I saw your worth and loveliness. I introduced to you some good men that they might
                  win the prize I was unable to support in the glory she was wont. Amongst those men
                  was Prescott. The rest you know,—only this, that he is false! He says he would not
                  marry you if you were owner of a mountain of diamonds. He says, moreover, he was
                  only taking his wag off you. I declare it makes my blood boil. For a mere song,
                  ay, for a song, I would go shoot this fellow. By heavens! that he should so badly
                  treat so fair and innocent a woman! Excuse, I weep with madness. But these things
                  shall not be known in Washington. It is published here you are soon to marry, but
                  fortunately this villain's name is not in the papers. But now come you a little
                  aside; it shall not be said you were jilted. You shall marry another, and that
                  other shall pass as having been the one."</p>
               <p>He rested here a moment to give her time to speak, but she merely replied,</p>
               <p>"So vast and varied have been your points of converse, I am bewildered; I know not
                  what to reply to so fair and good a man."</p>
               <p>"Then let me suggest, for you must ascertain that of which I speak. Go you to
                  Prescott, and ask him if he intends to marry you. If he say no, then remember,
                  that in that same hour of your adversity, there is in waiting for you the hand,
                  heart, fortune, title of one who will ever love and protect you with a most sacred
                  and holy care."</p>
               <p>She leaned her head on his breast, and cried bitterly, saying,</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, I have no one to love me. For weeks and months I have suffered a world
                  of pain, of anguish."</p>
               <p>He patted her a little on the back, stroked her black curls, kissed her on the
                  forehead, and pretended also to weep, and to comfort her.</p>
               <p>But just at that moment the old doctor came along, having returned from the sick
                  fugitive, whom he declared to be very much better, and desirous, he said, of
                  communicating something of importance to Miss Edge, Mr. and Mrs. Edge then came
                  in, and the clerk put off in short order, leaving Vickey to dry up her tears as
                  best she could. In a few minutes she was off to see the fugitive, and to hear her
                  story of so much importance. The clerk, was, however, much elated with the
                  prospect of marrying the heiress, believing that with one more interview he could
                  have it all fixed up. Though, in passing along the hall, whom should he meet but
                  Judge Francis, who had another bouquet of flowers stuffed under his vest, and
                  ready with a well-timed speech to meet the same fair one.</p>
               <p>"Oh, clerk," said he, "is it you that capers ever at the door of Miss Edge's
                  parlor? As I am proprietor of Loudon Heights, I do say you have the fairest girl I
                  ever saw."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I'm in no favor there; but I'll venture, with a fortune in my hand, I
                  would make you tremble in your boots for her."</p>
               <p>"Tut!" said the Judge; "I'm old enough to be her father; but do you know, I think
                  you have some knowledge of the affair between us?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all," said the clerk; "what is it?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Entres nous</foreign>," said the Judge, "I'm engaged to
                  marry her, and the happy hour is appointed here. Do you see—and I trust you will
                  mention it to no one—the last time I saw her, which was last night, I urged her to
                  appoint the time; but she said she was resolved to leave it all to her intended
                  husband. I named to her Sunday next; but she said she would decide nothing
                  herself; that she had given away her heart, and she felt as if, in so doing, she
                  had given away the world. Thereupon she took a fit of crying, and seemed to feel
                  so badly about it that I urged her no more. Now you see I have it all my own way,
                  and so I appointed Thursday night. It is here written down, and you shall carry it
                  to her, for she is tenderly affected by it."</p>
               <p>Having said this much, the Judge withdrew a paper, and handed it to the clerk, and
                  these words were upon it, to wit:</p>

                              evening. I have waited about the office and general parlors all day,
                              to meet you, and to make the appointment to you in person. But your
                              gracious majesty has not been seen, and I am obliged accordingly to
                              send it by my excellent friend, the clerk. I would add also, that I
                              took my usual pretended nap in the garden to-day, watching your window
                              to get a glimpse, but I watched in vain. Some important affairs of
                              state call me hence this night and to-morrow, and perhaps longer; but
                              as soon as I do return, I will call. Till then I remain as usual, your

               <p>"Oh, how fortunate!" exclaimed the clerk, "she will be so delighted! And to think
                  I, the clerk—why, it is excellent! I tell you, Judge, I never heard of anything
                  that pleased me so well."</p>
               <p>"Come, now," said the Judge, "let us into the bell-wing, and crack a bottle of
                  Catawba;" and so, laughing, they walked off together.</p>
               <p>Here the writer of this invaluable history was interrupted by the entrance of our
                  friend, a translator, who very cordially greeted Jenkins, whereupon the latter
                  held up his finger, and motioned silence. I saw in his face that some serious
                  matter was brewing in his soul. "Speak!" said I, "speak, Jenkins! Go on with the
                  story."</p>
               <p>But he smiled not, only looked at me as if words were too small for his vast
                  emotion. At last he spoke out:</p>
               <p>To me he had no kindness done, but yet he had me won. I mean Wadsworth. We were as
                  like as very brothers. Both young, both tall, both brave; but he the more
                  melancholy. For, indeed, he had more cause; his heart was bigger. Of all that
                  between us passed, no matter. But we kindly changed canes. Mine was very crooked
                  and large, his was like a whip-stock. But now he had the larger, and I the other
                  one. Had you, in a lone night, seen him, you had sworn by that ungainly
                  gold-headed stick he was me. Now it had been resolved by divers persons that many
                  men should die on the self-same day that the fatal knife of Orsini should
                     pierce<pb n="134-135 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6417-00000068"/> Lincoln's
                  heart in Baltimore. Amongst the doomed I was myself marked out. Behold you now,
                  that near the river's edge my priceless friend had, by long research, traced the
                  course of gentle Ann. Here, at times, in melancholy humor he came to muse and
                  dream of her, who, he had heard had been drowned in crossing the river. Unguarded,
                  alone, he seats himself on the bare ground, and so, amidst tears and the dim light
                  of the waning day, traces first the ripples where all is gloom and death, then
                  visions noble grasp from the heaven above, whither time our sorrows soon must
                  heal. What all he feels, what little speaks, it matters not. A stealthy tread from
                  behind approaches more silent than the whispering leaves, and deadly. Crouched,
                  hatless, and with a devil's grin, a very bludgeon uplift, Orsini springs, and
                  falls the blow on poor Wadsworth's head. Falling then, and his innocent blood for
                  me flowing—he was cast into the river! Orsini ran, nor man nor woman knew yet who
                  he was. But all things conspire against sin, and Heaven has so ordered it that
                  even walls, trees, and dumb earth bear evidence. Though suffice it here, on the
                  day following all the newspapers announced that a supposed murder had been
                  committed; that the body had been dragged into the river, and had been most
                  probably carried away by the tide. The knowledge came to me, and I knew by the
                  cane and hat who the victim was. So I mourned. I mourned as I had never before
                  mourned. But more of this anon. For the present we must turn to that mortal
                  saviour of the republic—Scott!</p>
               <p>Swiftly now did he despatch Colonel Lamon and Fred. Seward to meet Lincoln, and
                  bring him through to Washington in disguise. They met Lincoln in Harrisburg. They
                  cut the telegraph, and started, passing through Philadelphia at night, and, taking
                  a sleeping-car, rode through to Washington unknown and unsuspected. A carriage was
                  in readiness, and conveyed Lincoln to Willard's Hotel. Here it was I first saw
                  him; and I own that, when I looked at him, I feared for the great republic.
                  However honest he appeared, he was, evidently, very short of being the owner of a
                  giant intellect; though his qualities were more the type of an American, more the
                  manner of man that Americans love, than any other that was ever made President. He
                  was not a Kentuckian, nor an Illinoisian, nor Southern nor Northern, nor Eastern
                  nor Western, but an American. His aspiration and love were not for a county, nor
                  for a State but for a country. So unlike Toombs, Yancey, and Davis, who loved more
                  a clan than the great republic; who reversed the order of national progression, by
                  setting States and factions against each other. The one was unity, power, and
                  glory. The other was division, weakness—death!</p>
               <p>One was a terror to foreign powers; the other was inviting them to feast on our
                  funeral. For herein is the philosophy—if a State can secede, so can a party; and
                  if a party, so can an individual; and there is the end; for no law could be
                  binding. The national Government must command, and each State be dependent; for,
                  even as three men do build three houses conjointly, the one in the middle shall
                  not pull his part down without the consent of all. Such a man would be a criminal,
                  and the other two should punish him. 'Twas thus that honest Lincoln spoke, but in
                  homelier phrase. His style was weak; character he had none. He was a blank sheet
                  of paper whereon the nation should write its will, and he was an honest judge, to
                  sift and do their full desires as fairly as if he were God's decree. He was an
                  American. Pomp he had not, nor command, nor explanation. Reserved, wise with his
                  little wisdom, and so inviting strength from all his countrymen that loved their
                  country, and not dividing them by his self-esteem or arrogance. God never made a
                  better man for such a season. Was he weak—'twas just enough to make the nation
                  feel its own need of doing; was he slow—'twas just enough to fire the nation with
                  speed; was he conscientious—'twas that silenced his enemies; 'twas that that made
                  the nation exacting. Thus he seemed when first I saw him, and he seemed always so
                  afterward, nor did he ever prove otherwise. To forerun this history I must add, he
                  was a stick of circumstance; the happiest choice, the wisest placed, and as noble
                  a type of an American as ever God made. Now he had come to Washington—come to be
                  inaugurated President of one of the wealthiest of nations—President of five and
                  thirty millions of people.</p>
               <p>He had come unknown, unexpectedly to the secessionists. Scott did it. This little
                  thread, this little nucleus was preserved by Scott. Oh, Scott, immortal Scott!
                  While all the nation slept, thy vigilant heel stunned the viper's head. This
                  little act all hell o'erawed, and the devils South, dismayed, in silence stood.
                  This was the first balk the great rebellion had; but even as villains more by
                  craft than bravery win, so now the secessionists yet another fatal plan marked
                  out, which was, that inasmuch as Lincoln had foiled<figure>

                  </figure>
                  <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6417-00000069"/> them in Baltimore, it was threatened
                  that he should die at his inauguration. But more of this anon; suffice it here,
                  Lincoln's arrival spread like wild-fire. People meeting at the corners stopped to
                  tell it, and neighbors went to tell one another. Never was such another time in
                  Washington. Private citizens, ay, the commonest man and child was drunken with
                  excitement, was conscious of the near advent of the awful day. Not a moment's
                  peace or rest had any man, and the highest in office were taxed with terror, were
                  prostrate, were weeping in despair. But most who suffered was Buchanan. He had not
                  only a dread for a great war, and fear for his own life, but his conscience, even
                  his small conscience, had at last turned against him, and was now battering his
                  thin soul to atoms. Like a timorous woman when the ship's on fire, he could only
                  wail, and ask every passer-by what the prospect was. And if passers-by came not
                  frequently, he would sally forth and halt by the way to ask any one he chanced to
                  meet, "Are you sure where the commissioners are? Do you think they will carry out
                  their threats? Oh, that Lincoln's, time would come! Welcome 4th of March! Oh, sir,
                  I never thought it would come to this, or I had left my party! I cannot pray. My
                  God, who will pray for me? Is there a man in America can pray for one so
                  neglectful as I have been? Through me, hundreds of thousands of men shall die.
                  Countless widows and orphans—O heavens! how can I ask forgiveness! The
                  Constitution was made to hold the nations, but I let it bend, and now, alas, it is
                  broken! Pity me, pity me, ye gods! I am mad! Say, you sir, if Lincoln comes, will
                  I not be in less danger? I think so. Oh, indeed I think so! They would not wring
                  my neck."</p>
               <p>Thus would he go on whenever he found a person to listen to him, hoping thereby to
                  gain a little sympathy.</p>
               <p>Now, if you please, we shall refer back to the Jackson House, and you shall hear
                  of such a strange adventure as no man could invent were he not to follow true
                  history.</p>
               <p>As the Judge and the clerk returned, I met them in the hall. "Ha, Jenkins!" said
                  the Judge, seizing me by the arm, "I'm so glad to see you! Come up—come up!" He
                  always said so when he took any one to his private drawing-room. It was not up,
                  but on the same floor. His whole suite of rooms were on that floor. He had
                  occupied the same rooms for upward of twenty years, save the time in each year he
                  spent at his plantation, Loudon Heights. The furniture of said rooms was twenty
                  years old, much mended, and out of fashion. He never took common folks to his
                  drawing-room—only, dignitaries, save on special occasions. When he told me to
                  "come up," I knew it was for some important purpose, though he showed little, if
                  any, excitement. He did not pull me, but rather walked with me, one hand resting
                  on my arm and the other on the clerk's shoulder. He is very fat and short; I am
                  tall, and so is the clerk. We could look each other in the face over the Judge's
                  head. The clerk winked at me to keep mum, and at the same time motioned the paper
                  to me. As we thus marched toward the drawing-room, and while the Judge was
                  assuring us of the quality of his newly-opened wine-barrel, we met that almost
                  ever-present Prescott, who had told us on many occasions that he was preparing
                  himself to write history, so that the name of Prescott might go down to future
                  generations.</p>
               <p>"Ha, Prescott!" said the Judge, "come up; I will unfold to you such matters as
                  will make a greater history than you ever dreamed of."</p>
               <p>"Things are getting warm," said Prescott.</p>
               <p>"But I say they are getting hot," said the Judge; "and yet you don't know the
                  hottest part of it. Come up."</p>
               <p>We went up. This drawing-room was furnished just as it had been twenty years ago,
                  save the wear and tear. To me the Judge shoved up an old arm-chair, saying,
                  "Jenkins, to you the chair of honor. Sir, the greatest men of America have sat in
                  that chair. The last who occupied it was my bosom friend and companion, Henry
                  Clay. I shall never forget that occasion. It was soon after his defeat for
                  President. Webster sat yonder, on that slap-jack stool. Some less important
                  friends had seats here also. After we drank awhile, Clay leaned over the
                  table—so—taking my hand and Webster's in his, and he said: 'My esteemed friends,
                  this is the finale to my ambition. Long have I labored to attain the Presidency,
                  to carry out these great principles; for I see far in the future, after I am dead
                  and forgotten, that the clash of factions will ultimately come upon our fair land.
                  There are, afar off, now kindling two small fires, which will some day envelop
                  this nation in flames. I have labored a long while to pave a new road whereby we
                  could all walk over the devouring element. But even my own State would not hear,
                  nor can the populace of many States believe in it. Though they will some day
                  learn, and my only prayer is, that future generations may learn by these things
                  that reason and justice should guide them in voting for any party. Now I leave for
                  Ashland, and to Washington return no more." These words," continued the Judge,
                  "were the last words he ever spake in that chair; and he spake with that tone of
                  voice, that, hearing once, is ne'er forgotten. People ask me to repair my
                  furniture, to trade it off and get new stuff. Ha, the gods! I'm made of better
                  mettle. Sit you here, Mr. Prescott," and, suiting the words, he then placed us all
                  comfortably, and we, almost jointly, thanked him for such exalted kindness.</p>
               <p>Now, as you are aware, the left-hand side of his drawing-room is next the
                  lattice-falls of the outer porch, where a large window opens out into the
                  vine-covered corner. Hardly had we got stationed in the room, having only taken
                  one turn at the wine, when we heard a sepulchral voice from some person out on the
                  porch, and, ere we got an insight to the Judge's story, we found ourselves in a
                  listening posture to catch the words of the outsider, whom we mistrusted as
                  Buchanan.</p>
               <p>His speech ran as follows: <q>

                        <l>Or gnaw on my too sensitive nerves.</l>

                        <l>At first I did indulge those common men,</l>
                        <l>To hear their speech to please them; they were sugared</l>

               <p>We thought we knew the voice, and Prescott whispered, "Buchanan!" Though, when the
                  speaker mentioned Prescott, we all turned to look on him, and he listened with
                  renewed vigilance, almost breathless. After a little while the voice on the porch
                  became inaudible, and Prescott spoke out, saying, "I never knew where the money
                  came from, nor why it came; but I will know now," and with a rush he threw open
                  the window. There sat, as we thought, Buchanan, pale and weeping.</p>
               <p>"We have heard your soliloquy," said Prescott, "and I now demand an
                  explanation."</p>
               <p>Buchanan sprang up, shouting out,</p>
               <p>"Nor—no, sir. Dare you insult me! I made no soliloquy. What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Sir," said Prescott, "we have heard such words here as move me with no common
                  feeling."</p>

                     gone by, I did so often sit with our friend here, the Judge. Here I come to
                     forget the cares of office—to find a moment's rest; nor can I imagine why my
                     solitude is disturbed."</p>

                        slandered,<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6417-00000070"/> merely because they
                     have some fault? Pray, sir, cast nothing more than my sins upon me, for I have
                     that which you never felt—a conscience."</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"Well spoken," said the Judge; but what more he said none of us knew, for at that
                  instant were heard out of doors countless voices shouting out,</p>
               <p>"Lincoln has come! Lincoln's in Washington! He ran through in disguise!"</p>
               <p>Buchanan said, "Thank God, I'm safe at last! I have preserved the great republic,
                  and can now hand it down to my successor in all its integrity and glory. Heaven
                  save me till I get out of Washington, and the devil take the country then."</p>
               <p>When he spoke so irreverently, I remarked ironically, that all the country would
                  thank him for his well wishes.</p>
               <p>"What! you, too?" said he, and he glared at me as if he were indeed none too sound
                  in mind, and in fact I almost doubted if I had not mistaken the person. "I had
                  thought," he continued, "that at least one man would continue true to so devoted
                  an adherent of the Constitution."</p>
               <p>Said I, "I buy no friendship, and, if I must speak plainly, I know why you absent
                  yourself from your Mansion. You have no longer a face for your faults, and
                  timorously hide from those you suffered to betray you. I am as grieved to turn
                  against you as you can be by it; but I am aware you had solemn warning from Scott,
                  Seward, and Cass. Had you sided with them, your any blunder had been excused in
                  consequence of their eminence and patriotism; but you chose to aid and abet those
                  who repudiated patriotism, those who violated their oaths of office, and you knew
                  it at the time. Ay, you not only knew it, but you made me write messages to excuse
                  it."</p>
               <p>He made no reply, but curled his lip, trembling from head to foot. This was the
                  occasion on which Prescott spoke, and the following is an abstract of his famous
                  irony, which soon became the household words for millions:</p>
               <p>"You have preserved the Union in all its integrity and glory. You have preserved
                  freedom, for you have given men freedom to build batteries for the destruction of
                  Sumter and Pickens. You have given Anderson freedom to surrender or starve. You
                  have left Lieutenant Slemmer free to behold his enemies erecting abattis and
                  breastworks, and mounting cannon for his destruction. You have preserved the
                  custom-houses and post-offices, by giving them over into the hands of
                  secessionists: You have given Floyd, Thompson, Cobb, Toombs, Davis, Iverson, and
                  even criminal Yancey, freedom to abuse the sense of the Southern people by their
                  falsehoods, that the North was about to make a raid on slavery, and you never gave
                  them an official contradiction. Hand it over in all its integrity and glory! Your
                  official inaction and reticence has left the people free indeed—but free with
                  blindness, with madness. Politicians have run away with the Government, and the
                  people are free to cut each other's throats. Why, indeed, should you sigh for the
                  4th of March—why long for a full retirement? Behold you not how many millions will
                  weep? See you not those rivers of tears from a grateful people, whose liberties
                  you have preserved? Oh, I wonder not that half insane you wander here, to ruminate
                  on your coming praise and glory! 'Tis too much for a common mortal."</p>
               <p>"Sir, had you not a heart in it, you could never speak so cruelly. Your part you
                  paint so well, I remember now no excuse. But oh, sir, such threats and abuse as I
                  have had from the other side! God knows how earnestly I have tried to go by the
                  Constitution!"</p>
               <p>He sobbed violently even while he spoke, and then, with some apparent madness,
                  started for the door, and escaped outward.</p>
               <p>"Zounds," said the Judge, "I almost question whether that be Buchanan or
                  Buchanan's ghost. Or are we drunk on my new wine?" Thereupon we shook ourselves to
                  see, but we decided that we were sober. Just then a delegation arrived from Scott,
                  demanding my immediate presence.</p>
               <p>Thus was our, affair with the Judge broken up, and we tasted but a glass of wine,
                  nor heard his great secret. For my own part, I hurried off to Scott, who greeted
                  me cordially, and briefly informed me that I was to go to Montgomery forthwith, as
                  it was necessary to have some definite knowledge of the expected attack on
                  Washington.</p>
               <p>Here Jenkins closed this chapter, intimating that, as everybody knows about gentle
                  Ann being in Montgomery, it is not necessary to mention anything new before it
                  occurs.</p>

                     ON THE CORNERSTONE OF SLAVERY, CHARACTERIZED BY EARL RUSSELL AS A NATION
                     STRUGGLING FOR LIBERTY, AND BY THE BRITISH AND MOST OF THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS
                     ACKNOWLEDGED AS A BELLIGERENT POWER, WHILE ONLY FORTY MEN COMPRISED ITS

               <p>"THAT'S a long sentence," said I.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Jenkins; "that's just the mystery of this great book. You can find a
                  Cicero and a Bacon on its every page, with now and then a little sea-room for
                  Quackenbos."</p>
               <p>"All right," said I; "let it pass." He then turned to the translator, and asked
                  him to read to me from the notes, stating that he wanted a day off, and he then
                  added, "We must finish the book to-mor-row. Five days are enough in which to write
                  a book. Otherwise it will be a long time ere we are done writing the Courts of
                  Judge Francis Underhill." At that he left. The translator then took up the notes,
                  and read as follows, to wit:</p>
               <p>The excitement in Washington knew no bounds——</p>
               <p>"Stop!" I said; "substitute for 'knew' the word 'had,' and let it pass."</p>
               <p>He smiled, and read on:</p>
               <p>Life and property were no longer safe. Every man was suspected to be a spy, either
                  for the national Government or for the rebels. Scott had found a man to join him
                  in the preservation of the country—Joseph Holt, now Secretary. By their management
                  a slight hope had begun to be entertained throughout the country that the national
                  Government would be maintained till Lincoln's inauguration. The rebels, on the
                  other hand, were beginning to fear that their golden opportunity would pass
                  unimproved. At first they designed usurping the whole national Government; next
                  they resolved upon establishing a Southern government, and of reducing the
                  Northern States to provinces. Now, however, they had evidence that to secede and
                  establish a Southern confederacy would be all they were able to accomplish. To do
                  this effectually, it was necessary that Washington should be captured and
                  destroyed. It was described by the Southern newspapers as a "nest for the Northern
                  scum to congregate in."</p>
               <p>Scott and Holt, on the part of the nation, had but a small army, and were obliged
                  to do what they could unknown to Buchanan. For this purpose a vast number of
                  private detectives were despatched to gather in all evidence of the conspirators'
                  designs. Thus it was I was despatched to Montgomery, again in disguise, again to
                  outwit the men who had heretofore outwitted me.</p>
               <p>I shall never forget the look Scott gave me ere I took my departure. I told him I
                  knew not what disguise to assume, nor how I could possibly escape with my life,
                  were I to undertake this adventure.</p>
               <p>"Life has nothing to do with these things," said he. "It must be done, and I know
                  no fitter man."</p>
               <p>The next day I arrived in Montgomery. But as the following is taken from my report
                  before the courts of Judge Francis Underhill, they are substituted here, as being
                  entirely satisfactory to everybody.</p>

                  <p>"An order had been issued by the rebel government offering a full pardon to all
                     the convicts who would enlist as soldiers. It seemed remarkable that a
                     government just established by such boasting men should, in the onset, fill the
                     rank and file in this manner. I went, with others, to see if the convicts would
                     volunteer. The prison had three apartments; only one was opened. Thirty-one
                     male prisoners were let out, and they all volunteered. I was curious to know
                     who the convicts were in the other parts of the prison. Some one said there
                     were some women and some political prisoners still left in. The crowd all left
                     then, and I also left, for I wanted to see what disposal would be made of the
                     newly-made volunteers. This was on the 24th day of February. Two days previous
                     to this Davis had issued an edict declaring all vessels in Southern harbors
                     foreign vessels. Duties, embargoes, and press money were demanded, and Southern
                     custom houses were demanded, and Southern customhouses were established in a
                     day. A chain-cable was stretched across the Mississippi, so that not a vessel
                     from the North could pass down without first halting to pay duty. Volunteers
                     were therefore in great demand, for there were already upward of a thousand
                     prominent points in the South needing a military force. But the place most
                     likely to engage in battle was Charleston, and to this place a vast army was
                     being concentrated. The convict volunteers I speak of were started off for
                     Charleston in less than two hours after they were liberated. They were mustered
                     into a regiment called 'Bloody Dogs.' The regiment left Montgomery at fifteen
                     minutes past six in the evening. Nearly all the town had come to see them off.
                     It was here I heard Russel compare the army South with what the North would be
                     likely to raise."</p>

                  <p>—"Yes, sir. He pointed to the convict volunteers, saying to Davis and Stephens,
                     'Those are the lads for soldiers! Always give me your devil-may-care man for a
                     good soldier, and for a great army give me men that have known and acknowledged
                     their superiors. It is this, gentlemen, that puts you ahead of the North. Up
                     North there is no authority. Even little boys are taught liberty in the North,
                     and many of them think nothing of arguing and disputing with even their own
                     fathers and mothers; so that, when they have become men, it is impossible for
                     them to ever be soldiers. They would not obey their officers. On the other
                     hand, the nature of your Southern institutions has built up a class of superior
                     men, who will be most cheerfully obeyed."</p>

                     he went shooting birds in Illinois, and was fined for it; on which occasion he
                     spouted rather violently about his august position, when before that Court in
                     Illinois he delivered to the magistrate these very words, to wit:</p>
                  <p>'You Western suckers, you, how dare you presume to assume to make and establish
                     and lay down laws on morals, and religion, and virtue, and observing Sunday, as
                     no proper and good day on which to shoot birds? The meaning of the word England
                     is law and gospel, and whenever we go outside of England, we mean to take a
                     little recreation in worldly sports, and pastimes, and amusements, and hunting
                     birds, and shooting; and, sir, it is the height of presumption for any country
                     in the world to presume to assume to make and establish and lay down laws for
                     government of the Sunday conduct and pleasurable amusements of one of her
                     Britannic Majesty's most honored subjects. Morals out here in Illinois!' These,
                     his words before the court, which were considered by the London
                        <title>Post</title> to be excellent arguments, and such as would be likely
                     to arouse the American people to higher notions of liberty, were here laughed
                     at. This enraged him, and hence the sentiment before mentioned, regarding
                     Northern degradation."</p>

                  <p>"They said nothing, but smiled, and winked to each other on the sly. They then
                     walked off together, but had not gone far when the despatch came announcing
                     Lincoln's arrival in Washington. Davis threw up both hands, saying, 'My God!
                     can this be true?' Stephens merely said 'Damnation!' I apprehended no more
                     demonstration that day, and did not, therefore, follow after them. They went
                     toward the Exchange Hotel, where they sojourned. I conversed with many people,
                     and became almost convinced myself that the destruction of the American
                     Government and the substitution of the slave confederacy would be accomplished
                     in a grand, jolly spree. It did not look, from that standpoint, as if any
                     formidable opposition could be raised against the new government. It was no
                     wonder at all that everybody became an enthusiastic Confederate. The leaders
                     kept the people blind on that subject—kept them intoxicated with
                     excitements."</p>

                  <p>"I was coming to that. When the crowd dispersed, I walked leisurely along,
                     without any design. It was then nearly dark; you could not distinguish your
                     friend more than twenty paces. When near the prison, I sat down to rest, and to
                     reflect on the awful affairs approaching the country. Not long had I been
                     there, when I saw skulking along, behind the old rubbish of brick and stones, a
                     form that seemed not much larger than a fox, and yet I was sure it was some
                     person. It looked like a little girl with her clothes closely tucked in about
                     her. Up, down, round, off, it was gone. What could it be? Had I rushed up at
                     once, I had discovered all about it; but I lingered long in astonishment, and
                     then got up and followed slowly after. Nothing of it could I discover, nor
                     could I see a place of exit, unless the thin little creature had passed into
                     the walls of the prison. On coming over, however, near the wall, I observed a
                     small opening that led into a vacant and half-finished cellar, where some
                     builder had no doubt not long since designed erecting a habitation, but had
                     abandoned it on account of the coming war. I sat down to muse again on the
                     varied woes of our fair land; and while I sat there, seeing, passing and
                     repassing, the fine, noble young men who were hurrying forth with swords and
                     muskets, preparing to battle alike noble young men of the North who esteemed
                     them as brothers, I could not but weep for the abuse of their minds. They had
                     been told that the North were bound to destroy slavery, and hence their fury.
                     Even intelligent America must fall by politicians' lies. Then I remembered my
                     friend Wadsworth; and the fair, gentle Ann. I almost wept, for I thought them
                     both dead. And, in musing, I thought Heaven sent me sweet sounds to still my
                     deep emotions. For, like the gurgling water in a cavern, hollow, sweet music
                     lived as in depth beyond, and nestled in echo most sublime 'neath the prison or
                     in the ragged walls around. I thought my melancholy had some respite found, but
                     then again I thought I heard a voice—the voice of gentle Ann! And lo! I never
                     wept so much, or more suspense suffered. Breathless sat I there, and gushing
                     tears rolling down my cheeks—the voices were so low and sweet. Must I burst
                     this silence, and madly rush to the awakening scenes of my vivid fancy? Reason
                     most commanded, and I burned even while the tempest held. Again the sound of
                     that voice, and then a long silence—like the fevered suns, when seldom comes
                     the life-like air, and I perishing there, but could not move. First in minutes
                     treasured, then an hour, then two, three. But no, not more than three; for then
                     I heard a stone, as if falling and steps secretly passing, gliding like a
                     zephyr. Quick I start and downward look, in the low, rude aisle, amongst
                     rubbish; climbing, mounts the little thin form—and out on the plain speeds from
                     my sight. Again I was alone, but, after some hesitation, went down into the
                     excavation, and found my way to the prison wall—a thing of brick and logs, and
                     rudely shaped. Here I found a crack, and hesitating some, seeing nothing in the
                     darkness round me, I knocked against the opening. What followed, hark, and you
                     shall learn.</p>
                  <p>"As in the dark night the timid sparrow lone sits trembling for the danger
                     near, herself her frailness knowing, and her little spirit enduring the awful
                     suspense of uncertainty—so, in the confederate cell, sat our sweet, our gentle
                     Ann. Watchful, weary, with imagination wild, to start at even a cricket's
                     sound, and the long-haired, snarling faces of confederate soldiers seeing in
                     the shadows, hearing their hiss and scowl as they roared out to her sensitive
                     ear, 'Abolitionist!' And thus she thought, but spoke not: 'Give me a trial!
                     Give me into the hands of any justice! Go to Washington—nay, at my expense hire
                     you a hundred witnesses, to prove me good or bad; pick you of those who most do
                     hate an Abolitionist, only let them ascertain who I am, and I am content with
                     your disposal.' Thus, at times, she had spoken to the curious crowd gazing at
                     her, but the only reply she ever received was, 'Abolitionist!' Then came the
                     'Ladies' Regiment;' and, when they looked in, they said, 'Ha, jailer, let her
                     out!" and they whetted their butcherknives on the ground. Some of them mimicked
                     her weeping, and others said, 'We know Perkins. He gives you a good character.'
                     But this was irony; for Perkins, having professed to join the confederate<pb
                        n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6417-00000072"/> erate army, was above suspicion. He
                     had accused her, on the evening when they were both taken prisoners. He told
                     her, on that occasion, that if she would marry him, he would not only liberate
                     her, but return with her to Washington; but that, if she denied him, she should
                     stand accused. This was before they were put into prison, he having obtained
                     the privilege to speak to her privately. But she answered him, saying, 'Accuse
                     me!' 'Then will you suffer, and perhaps die!' said he; 'but I shall volunteer,
                     and so be liberated. You will be hanged for an Abolitionist, if no one protects
                     you.' 'I know that One will save me!' she said, and she pointed upward.
                     'Indeed!' he said; 'now for your purity and faith I curse you!' and he turned
                     to the crowd, saying, 'Seize her; she is an Abolitionist! She was caught in the
                     act of running away with a slave. I was with her because I loved her fair face,
                     but the foulness of her heart has turned me against her. Take her, and cast her
                     in prison.' The crowd then bore her to prison, but Perkins started for
                     Washington as fast as he could, to get a written consent from the Judge to
                     marry her. The crowd of people then brought the slave-girl Kate before her, and
                     they asked her if this young lady was an Abolitionist, and if she had tried to
                     run away in her company. The slave girl answered, 'Yes; she tried to run away
                     with me, but we were caught.' They took them then to prison, and gentle Ann was
                     put in a lone cell. But Perkins was no more around. Though, as in all human
                     affairs, God hath so much His Spirit implanted, the trumpet of Divine power had
                     sounded to the bottom of that slave-girl's soul. In a short time she, herself a
                     prisoner and a slave, was taken to the cotton-fields, but only to fly again for
                     freedom, and to repay the godlike attempt for her own liberty by gentle Ann.
                     For such is nature. Coming now by stealthy means to the prison where gentle Ann
                     was bound, she espied through the crevices in the cell—and so, at night,
                     unobserved, the nearest part approached. Tapping lightly, lest at the hour of
                     night the sparrow die for terrible fear, she announced her name and mission. 'I
                     am Kate, the slave girl. I have again run off, but I have come for you. Tell
                     me—for you are wise—what I shall do to liberate you?'</p>
                  <p>Almost like death the words had fallen, and the fair lady most her very life
                     suspected for its transit into heaven. For this was the first kind voice for
                     many, many long weeks. Leaning then close against the wall where was found the
                     crevice, she timorously asked if it were indeed her own dear Kate. Of this she
                     was assured, and then an interchange of thought went on, till Kate proposed to
                     go to Washington for assistance. For this journey she had no money, and many
                     difficulties were before her. She would be obliged to walk all the way, and to
                     live by begging her bread from the slaves by the route of her passage. She
                     might be captured as a runaway slave, or even as a spy. But she resolved upon
                     the task, even though gentle Ann reluctantly gave consent that she should risk
                     so much. The two girls then kneeled down, the one in prison and the other out,
                     and they prayed for that guidance and protection which Divine Wisdom alone can
                     give.</p>
                  <p>Thus left our Kate for Washington—to see and to tell the Judge all about his
                     niece; but ere she left, she provided a little slave-girl to visit the prison
                     nightly, to see if anything could be done for the comfort of gentle Ann. This
                     little creature, ere the hour of locking up slaves, would steal across the
                     vacant lots, down by the way mentioned before, and, with three gentle knocks on
                     the door, call to the crevice the fair prisoner, and at times putting through
                     the crack in the wall some choice food which had no doubt been stolen on her
                     account. Thus from day to day watched and waited the acused Abolitionist,
                     without proof or trial—for how could it be otherwise? Military always
                     supersedes civil courts on political prisoners. But one course was left whereby
                     she could hope for succor—could Kate reach Washington, find the Judge, and he
                     get here before war actually commenced.</p>
                  <p>Many days the slave had been gone, and the prisoner was almost despairing, her
                     only comfort being in speaking to the child that brought her something at
                     night. As for the day, it brought only the hiss and scowl of 'Abolitionist!' or
                     the wretched yearning of the 'Ladies' Regiment' to butcher her. She knew her
                     weakness, and hence her fear. Those ladies had threatened over and over again
                     to come on the sly and kill every Abolitionist in the prison. Ann watched for
                     them at every moment, day and night. Her visitor gave three knocks—loud, soft,
                     loud. Who gave not these knocks, must be an enemy, a would-be murderer."</p>

                  <speaker>Jenkins.</speaker>
                  <p>—"There was no result. I then knocked louder than before, and a good deal more.
                     Some one seemed to sigh within. 'Will you tell me who is in this cell?' I
                     asked. All was silent again. In another moment I knocked louder and harder.
                     Again I heard the sigh—a deep, heavy sigh—and again I spoke, saying, 'Tell me,
                     poor prisoner, who you are, and what fate awaits you. I am no enemy, but a
                     friend. While sitting just above here, on the embankment, I thought I heard the
                     voice of a long-lost and dear one, and I now knock on the prison-wall to
                     satisfy this burning thought, to learn at least who it is that has another such
                     sweet voice.' Long I waited for an answer—so long, indeed, I almost feared I
                     had been speaking to the barren walls. Just then I heard a slight knock from
                     within, with the question, 'Who is here?' I was certain I knew the voice, but I
                     still used discretion, saying, 'One from Washington, a friend to Judge Francis
                     Underhill, of Loudon Heights. I was a schoolmate of his niece. She is lost, or
                     perhaps dead; but I thought I heard her voice in this prison.' 'Oh, is it
                     possible!' said she. 'To know of this! To know of this. What could have severed
                     that divine chain whereby I was bound, and now reverts me back to it? Verily a
                     pledge to Heaven, though by children, is watched over and cared for by God
                     Himself!' Said I, 'It seems, indeed, as if I had been sent by Providence; for,
                     must I tell you, though my heart breaks, our friend Wadsworth is no more!' 'Oh,
                     say not so!' 'I would it were possible to say otherwise.' This was all that was
                     said for some time; I heard her crying, and I was myself much moved, for I felt
                     I was venturing on the most hallowed scene ever known to mortal. After a while
                     we so far conversed as to make some amends for the long-lost love between us;
                     and I assured her I would rescue her at once from prison, and conduct her
                     safely back to Washington. With these assurances from me, and with a thousand
                     tender thanks from her, we parted, I to the jailer, she to solitary—</p>
                  <p>"To be brief, I found the jailer, and opened my business with him at once. His
                     name was Randolf, and he looked so carelessly gotten up, I involuntarily
                     compared him, in my mind's eye, to a towstring half twisted. He was a little
                     intoxicated, and his conversation was a volume of oaths, with a few chance
                     words in it. The word 'Abolitionist' was, from his mouth, an island in an ocean
                     of oaths, whereon he strove to manifest the bitterest hate that could be
                     invented. To this man—if, indeed, such profanity could emanate from a man—I
                     spoke in this wise: 'The prisoner is not an Abolitionist. I have known her from
                     infancy up; she is mistress of Loudon Heights. There are belonging to her
                     uncle's estate two hundred slaves. She has been falsely accused for some other
                     purpose; she is indeed an estimable Southern lady.' Over and over did I repeat
                     this to him, and he ever answered me with the word 'Abolitionist!' ever joining
                     thereto the usual oaths. But I continued, denying with all my ability that she
                     was now, or ever had been in any way, an Abolitionist. At last he ventured to
                     suppose my statement true, wanted to know what I would do with the prisoner,
                     and how, above all things, she could be gotten out of confinement. Said I, 'If
                     I were jailer, and your daughter confined under a false accusation in my jail,
                     I would liberate her, trial or no trial.' 'I have no daughter,' said he,
                     swearing worse than before. And then he twitted me on the fact that I had not
                     treated to the whiskey. Hereupon I took the thought that my liberality might
                     turn to advantage, and accordingly I took him into an inn near by, and gave him
                     a good many drinks. Now, after we had taken much whiskey, and discussed the
                     troubles North and South pretty freely, and had each of us told many humorous
                     stories, he told me that we had better return to the prison; 'for,' he added,
                     'if I get much drunker, a fellow might, on the way to the prison, drop fifty
                     dollars into this pocket, and take this key out of that pocket, and so liberate
                     a prisoner, and I would never know how it was done.' We got up, then, and
                     walked toward the prison, and fifty dollars went into his pocket, and
                     immediately thereafter the key came into my hand. By some means we got
                     separated then, and I reached the prison a little before him. Strange to say,
                     the mistress of Loudon Heights was there waiting for me, and she came and
                     leaned on my shoulder, and cried piteously. I said many kind things to her, and
                     she repaid me only with weeping. Soon after this we lifted up our feet, and
                     stood on something, and it carried us very fast. It was something that was
                     leaving Montgomery, and might have been a freight car. But the funniest of it
                     was, the next morning the Montgomery papers noticed the fact that a prisoner
                     endeavored to escape last night, but was captured by the citizens, and hung. I
                     wrote those notices, to put people off the track; I had done such things
                     before."</p>

               <p>The Judge then adjusted his old silver spectacles, and told us this story, to
                  wit:</p>
               <p>"Scott kept me on the run. It was Judge this and Judge that on everything. My
                  opinion, my knowledge, my advice must forerun everything that was to be done for
                  the preservation of the great republic. In fact, it reminds me of Mrs. Howard at
                  the ball, being teased to dance. 'Here, Sal,' says she, 'hold my baby, till I trot
                  that fellow through with the yellow breeches.' I had to save the nation, and needs
                  must trot these fellows through with yellow breeches, only I had no baby, but
                  something else, as you all know, of much more value. Now, as I am a Judge, and as
                  I hope to live to see established a high protective tariff, to make every village
                  in America into a Sheffield and a Birmingham, but the weight of these great
                  affairs had somewhat told on my too sensitive nerves; and it seems to me now, when
                  I remember it, with the rebels in arms five thousand strong organized to come from
                  Harper's Ferry on the day of Lincoln's expected inauguration, while on that same
                  expected eve I should venture that great change in life which I can never mention
                  but in awe; for, though I am not old, I am not young, and it seems that the
                  approaching affairs were more terrible than ever before one man withstood. For you
                  see, one might upset the other. If Washington be taken, and sacked and burned, as
                  they do things in war, what kind of jubilee can we have that night? I tell you—for
                  you are not unacquainted with my expected adventures—with these weighty affairs to
                  bear, what more could harrow the soul, to hide them in oblivion? Now drooping, but
                  still in haste, the man absorbed in 'proaching war, and betimes forgetful only for
                  the fairest of the fair. I had a niece, and, though she was the purest and
                  sweetest that e'er the sun shone on, I was forgetful of her. Alack, my frenzied
                  brain! Torment me not, O ye harrowing swords of justice, till this I do confess!
                  Forged missives, not like her hand at all, were given me, to teach me she was in
                  Canada; and I believed them—for I was mad. I read them not. Oh, fool, fool—cruel
                  fool! My niece? Had I, in mine own expected joys, forgotten the mistress of Loudon
                  Heights—scarcely took a thought where she was? But blind deviltry will out. 'Say!
                  say!' some one spoke to me as I hurried up the Avenue, and, turning, there I
                  beheld that villain Perkins. 'Say,' said he, your niece is in prison down south
                  for Abolitionism. I was thunderstruck, but silent; but he went on—oh, the cold
                  villain! 'The letters you have received are all forged. She is locked up. I can
                  free her, but I will not, unless you give your consent for me to marry her.
                  Neither will I tell where she is. She sent me to you for your consent, and told me
                  to say that she prayed in God's name she might lie in prison as long as she lives,
                  if you refuse us.' This was the sort of stuff he put on me; and he spoke so
                  fairly, looking me so tenderly in the eye—for a snake may own a passive eye—and I
                  was confounded with the burden of my own thoughts. Reluctantly to this villain's
                  plea I did consent, and we drew writings on it, whereby I portioned out for them
                  quite a fortune. Soon then he left, and I mused with much unhappiness on what I
                  had done. I was almost distracted; for, though one be slow to passion, it is more
                  terrible. Days passed, but time was out of joint. I hoped Heaven might avert the
                  dread fate to my dear niece. One day a young lady, with a negro servant in
                  attendance, accosted me on the street, saying, 'Excuse my forwardness, sir, but is
                  not your name Judge Francis Underhill?' I told her 'yes,' and she immediately
                  replied, 'Then, sir, I am sorry to say your niece is in Montgomery jail for
                  Abolitionism. She sent me to see you, and to tell you to come to her assistance,
                  as she is in great distress.' I was more astounded than ever, and much pained with
                  the uncertainty of what I heard. To know if these things be true, for a moment I
                  prayed to Heaven—and you know it comes tough for me to pray; but the lady, seeing
                  my embarrassment, continued: 'Make no doubt of my words, but haste you in silence
                  to her assistance, or she must die. I am the slave girl Kate, with whom she ran
                  off. She told me to come right to you, and make a clean breast of it, and you
                  would not only understand, but protect me. I have no servant; this one I brought
                  as a disguise; she is also a runaway.' I feared some trick was being played on me;
                  I am naturally suspicious about some things, and I replied, 'My niece is too fair
                  and too gentle to be spoken of in this manner. Whoever plays a joke on her, knows
                  not the sacredness of a pure heart; and as for myself, in God's name, trifle not
                  with me about such a woman!' 'Sir,' said she, 'as I am living, I tell the truth.
                  Behold you this fine apparel; think you it is becoming the slave girl Kate? Now
                  see, what a stock is here!' Saying this, she so spread her dress that I saw she
                  had on rags underneath. 'Fine ladies, who sport a servant, generally wear better
                  underclothes. As for me, this servant stole a dress, and so made me a lady.' She
                  was so pert, and did so prettily turn her head, I could not but remember the wife
                  of my late lamented friend, General Andrew Jackson. His wife, when a girl, was a
                  little spoiled pet, and her father opposed her marriage with Jackson. One day,
                  after he had admonished her for some time, she said, 'Now, father, do you know I
                  think you are a mighty smart man, and a good man, but you are nothing 'longside of
                  Andy Jackson. Bet you anything he'll be great, some day.' I always, as the old
                  General used to tell me of her, tried to picture out what kind of a girl she was;
                  and as I am Judge of Loudon Heights, I had made her in my mind's eye just like
                  this snub-nosed beauty. I could hardly believe she was an American slave, nor
                  could I doubt, in case of war here, but the British Government would take positive
                  side with freedom. I had seen the slave-girl Kate, but in common duds she was
                  common; now she was in a nice frock, and looked a chirp little queen.</p>
               <p>"Having satisfied myself with her story, I ordered her and the servant to the
                  Jackson House, and immediately started for Montgomery. How I met you on the way,
                  you know quite well. My poor niece, weary, sick, and disconsolate—she that was so
                  mirthful and sweetly wild, to come and fall in my arms like one at the brink of
                  death! Do you know what she said? 'Oh, uncle, forgive me! I was so little
                  acquainted with the world!' And then, after a while, you know, she said, 'Girls of
                  romance are girls of inexperience.' Everything she said made me think she was
                  dying. But most I was moved when she said, 'Take me back to Loudon Heights.' This
                  had been her home, where I had watched over her as if she were a tender flower.
                  Poor, poor, dependent girl! Who would not love dependent woman? But her grief was
                  too quiet Something within was sapping her lifechords. Perhaps she loved
                  Wadsworth; for I know, when I told her he was dead, she turned pale, and her eyes,
                  though filled with tears, had no motion. 'How far is it to Washington?' she said,
                  after a pause; and I knew she was weary for the small conception I had of her
                  full, bursting heart. Nor did she know mine. Nor do any of you know. I have given
                  Perkins a bond, and he may come here to demand her, to torment her to death. We
                  have her safe in Washington, but this thing works hard on my too sensitive nerves;
                  for I shall not refuse him but by this heavy forfeit."</p>
               <p>Here the Judge exhibited the duplicate bond, and then sat down; but as the reader
                  of this history will be curious to know the particulars of my own affair with
                  gentle Ann, I will here state that, ere we had reached Washington, and
                  understanding was come to whereby, on the eve of the inauguration, we were to be
                  made man and wife. So, therefore, when we had, in the court of Judge Francis
                  Underhill, each one given in his evidence, I had nothing more to do than to inform
                  the Judge it was all right. This being the end of the sitting, we were all soon
                  engaged in congratulating one another on the apparently happy issue, and then, as
                  soon as the Judge had given the following charge to the jury, we dispersed:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen of the Jury: You have now the case before you. We may never meet again,
                  and I charge you to govern yourselves accordingly. To-morrow is Inauguration Day;
                  I cannot be with you. Since the days of Thomas Jefferson I have been the hey-day
                  man on these great occasions. You know the peril of that office. I must hold
                  Lincoln's hat while he is sworn in. It is to be on the portico of the Capitol.
                  Buchanan and Lincoln will be taken in a carriage from Willard's Hotel. The members
                  of our court will be the honorary guard. Two thousand seceders are armed with
                  knives and pistols, to mix with the vast assemblage, and then to fall on us and
                  murder us. Scott has an army so portioned out he can sweep the streets at a given
                  signal. Five thousand seceders are expected from Harper's Ferry. They are already
                  crying out for vengeace, because Lincoln was not killed in Baltimore. This is
                  their desperate day. Though it is to be inauguration, they are resolved to make it
                  disorganization day. If we fail, the nation perishes. If Lincoln is inaugurated,
                  all will be well; and, to glorify that great event, I will myself, on the evening
                  thereafter, so astonish this court by what I shall do, that all the country cannot
                  contain your joy and merriment. But look you well to it; to-morrow we shall have
                  some rich adventure."</p>
               <p>Now it so happened that none of us knew for certain that the Judge was
                  contemplating marriage on the next evening; and, being gentlemen, we dared not be
                  inquisitive as to exactness, though we were much interested in querying one with
                  another, to ascertain his meaning. For my own part, I took his arm (not he mine,
                  as many of the newspapers had it),<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6417-00000074"/> and
                  we walked down from the Temple together, on the way to the Jackson House. Not far
                  had we gone, when whom should we meet but Professor Jackson, who stood shyly at
                  the roadside for lack of good clothes, and called to me as we drew near,
                  saying,</p>
               <p>"How are you, Mr. Jenkins, and Judge Underhill?"</p>
               <p>We halted a moment, and he advanced to shake hands, holding his knees close
                  together, for he had a rent in his trowsers that made us look another way.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," said he, "I understand you have been to Montgomery, and I wanted to
                  make some inquiries about matters and things down South."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said I. "Proceed."</p>
               <p>Said he, "Do you think there will be a conflict? Do you believe the South are
                  really mad enough to carry this thing to a trial of arms?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said I. "The South is all in one fever of delusion. Their political
                  leaders have persuaded them that the whole North—twenty millions of people—are
                  determined on the extinction of slavery. Those leaders told the truth of about
                  half a dozen leading Abolitionists, but their hearers credited it for twenty
                  millions. No longer can reason approach them. A conflict is certain."</p>
               <p>"I'm not so sure of that," retorted the Professor. "I have here a project which I
                  think would end the matter without one drop of blood being shed." Saying this, he
                  displayed to our vision a circular, reading, "Professor Jackson, the celebrated
                  lecturer and psychologist, being on a travelling tour throughout the South, will
                  deliver a course of lectures at ——"—(here was a blank to be filled in)—"where-at
                  he hopes to convince the people that their entire ignorance of psychological laws
                  is the chief and only cause of all the trouble between North and South. He will
                  also show them the beauties of the Harmonial Philosophy, and appeal to that higher
                  quality of the human soul, the congeniality of the sexes, and point out the only
                  true road to happiness. The Professor has also a project for establishing a great
                  national library, in Washington, and a general publishing house, where men of
                  limited means may obtain aid from the Government to have their knowledge set
                  before the world, thereby eradicating the ignorance and low passions of which we,
                  as well as the people of all other countries, are afflicted. These famous lectures
                  are divided into a series of four. Ticket to one lecture, ten cents, or four
                  tickets for a quarter."</p>
               <p>"Cheap enough," said the Judge.</p>
               <p>"Dirt cheap," said I.</p>
               <p>"The question is," rejoined the Professor, "will it pay? Is the South prepared for
                  exalted lectures of this sort? You have been down South; now, what is your
                  opinion?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, excellent!" said I, nicking the Judge's foot.</p>
               <p>"Just the thing!" said the Judge, and he nicked my foot a little; "a very fortune
                  to a man of courage."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have the courage!" said Jackson, "and I believe I have some ability; but,
                  do you know, I am rather short today. I sold my newspaper stand, but it took every
                  cent of it to get these circulars printed. If it would not be asking too much, I
                  would like to get a loan of two dollars of each of you. I would go at once to
                  Montgomery, and begin my course. As soon as I shall have paid all necessary
                  expenses, I will remit it to you."</p>
               <p>"The best thing in the world!" we both replied, and thereupon opened our purses
                  and gave the poor fellow two dollars each. Just then that woman, who was always on
                  the street, came up—I mean the veritable Mrs. Lucy Tabiatha Stimpkins—and she saw
                  us give the money.</p>
               <p>"Guess you are satisfied now!" she sneeringly said to the Professor. "You thought
                  you could do better for yourself than I could do for you; but it is nowhere laid
                  down in the Harmonial Philosophy, that a husband shall have aught but what is the
                  wife's. I don't begrudge you those four dollars."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Stimpkins," said he, "I have done you no harm. Why is it I can't walk the
                  streets of Washington but I meet you, and that you must tantalize me at every
                  turn? You caused me to lose one hundred and sixteen dollars, and that ought to
                  satisfy you."</p>
               <p>"I caused you! Must you ever harp on that hundred and sixteen dollars? Now, if
                  ever you mention that again, I will have you searched, and I will take every cent
                  out of your pockets."</p>
               <p>He looked a little scared, and he sheepishly said, "Eh?"</p>
               <p>"What circular is that?" said she, and she took it and read it. "I could make
                  money out of that, but it is not in your breeches to do it.'</p>
               <p>"Eh?" said he.</p>
               <p>The Judge and I turned to go away, but pretended to be inattentive, lingering a
                  little.</p>
               <p>"Professor Jackson," said she, turning square before him, "give me half the
                  profits, and I'll join you in that. And more, too—I'll repay you every cent of
                  that hundred and sixteen dollars."</p>
               <p>"Eh?" said he; "you nearly starved me once."</p>
               <p>"There, now throw that up," said she. "But I don't care; you may eat as many meals
                  a day as you like, and I'll do the same."</p>
               <p>We heard no more, for we had gone too far; though, when we got a hundred paces
                  off, we turned to look back, and we saw them starting off together, as a living
                  illustration of an independent woman, a dependent man, the Harmonial Philosophy,
                  and the congeniality of a foolish theory.</p>
               <p>That night the Judge and I sat alone, with our sparkling Catawba before us. He
                  told me then all about his engagement with Vickey—to be married on the following
                  evening; but owing, he said, to the great disparity of their ages, they had kept
                  it almost a total secret. But, as you are aware, I heard little of what he was
                  saying to me, for on that same evening I was myself to be married, and, at
                  present, my intended was very ill. In fact, I hardly know if it be possible to
                  pass a more tormenting time; that ever-incessant thought, marriage, rising in a
                  thousand aspects, crowding off every other thought as chaff before a hurricane.
                  The Judge, however, talked well and talked incessantly, till about midnight, when
                  some one tapped at our door. I opened it, and there stood Kate, crying. I urged
                  her to tell the cause, and, after she quieted a little she said,</p>
               <p>"I wish you would come to my sister. She is indeed very ill."</p>
               <p>I looked at my watch, saying,</p>
               <p>"Fear not now, poor child; the fatal hour is past."</p>
               <p>We then got up and followed her to the room. Lizzie was propped up a little, and
                  the old doctor and the clerk, and a Mrs. Owens, were standing near. She then
                  tossed up one hand, signifying for me to approach. I did so, and she spoke and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I have much to thank you for. I shall not live to enumerate them. I shall die
                  before the morning sun is here. Some things I must tell you." We then gave her a
                  little water, and she asked to sit up in bed.</p>
               <p>Said I, "You must not talk of dying. You are only discouraged."</p>
               <p>"The life-blood is blocking up in my veins and arteries. In some parts I am
                  already numb. Treasure what I say, but do not interrupt me. Madame Ponchard killed
                  my master. This jewel I stole from her. She is young Wadsworth's step-mother! This
                  jewel was given me by my master; he said it was once my father's. Take them, and
                  keep them as long as you live."</p>
               <p>I took them, and read, on the one she said she stole from Madame Ponchard, "S. N.
                  Wadsworth, P. Miss. 67;" but some of it had undoubtedly been erased. I knew also
                  that the other was a part of the same jewel found in my hallway. Said I to the
                  Judge, "This must have been young Wadsworth's father. And this Madame Ponchard is
                  indeed the Italian stepmother."</p>
               <p>The Judge said, "She was suspected of poisoning the National Hotel; but in this
                  lenient country she got off scot free, because she was a woman."</p>
               <p>Again Lizzie went on, saying to me:</p>
               <p>"Do you remember the place you chased me to, in the Smithsonian grounds?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said I.</p>
               <p>"The exact spot?"</p>
               <p>"Ay, the very spot."</p>
               <p>"Well, go there to-morrow; I will be dead then. Even where I stood, beneath a flat
                  stone the size of your hand, you will find something which will astound you beyond
                  measure. But oh, sir, as I shall be dead when you have found it, speak, nay, think
                  gently, and blame not this bursting heart." She then let go my hand, but looked
                  quietly at me a moment, adding, "Heaven bless so good a man!" Tears started to her
                  eyes, and she asked, "May I kiss your hand, before I die?" Next, she called,
                  "Kate, my sister, come here!" But Kate was crying bitterly, and the doctor told
                  her to come. Now, when she had come to her side, Lizzie said, "Take comfort, Kate;
                  these men will endeavor to have you never a slave again. Oh, that I could know,
                  before I die, that you shall be free! I pray for war, for, in the conflict,
                  justice will arise. If the national Government is too weak, Great Britain and
                  France will join in crushing out these cruel slave-owners. Oh, glorious England!
                  The friend of the bond, I know that thy dogs of war will be let loose on our vile
                  oppressors!"</p>
               <p>After resting a moment, in much pain, she again went on: "Remember, Kate, modesty
                  and virtue are woman's holiest gifts. Remember it. Of Miss Underhill, who has
                  taken so much on herself for you, I know nothing. I have never seen her. They tell
                  me she is too ill to come to my room. This is the hardest blow of all. O Heaven,
                  can I never see so sweet and dear a face!" Here she sobbed out violently,
                  whereupon some one suggested that Miss Underhill<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000075"/> was not so ill but she might be brought in. "No,
                  no," said Lizzie, "I see her now; my soul comes and goes at the beckoning, and I
                  see in the distance as if near by. Come, now, I am nearly done. How numb my
                  temples——"</p>
               <p>This was the last she ever spoke; for, even while sitting there and speaking, she
                  smiled, and died.</p>
               <p>On the following morning I repaired, with a sad heart, to the place in the
                  Smithsonian grounds she had designated.</p>
               <p>Beneath a stone no larger than my two hands I found this most touching note,
                  safely sealed in a bottle:</p>

                              Here, on this spot, even where lies this small stone, I met a true
                              friend. He did all for me that man could. He planned the destruction
                              of a band of conspirators by intent to blow up the house where they
                              assembled. I was employed by him to bear a part; but, O my God, I
                              proved him false! I could not do the just but horrid deed, and so I
                              cut the fuse. The conspirators all escaped, and I behold that they are
                              about to destroy the nation. I have prayed for forgiveness, but I am
                              dying with despair. And my true friend, to whom I was false, is so
                              noble I cannot even mention my own perfidy. Heaven knows I wish I were
                              dead.</p>

               <p>Poor girl, her woman's heart overleaped justice. And she died in remorse, without
                  my knowing her awful agony. Pass on, poor soul; sad tears shall be our lessons to
                  teach us the good heart of a true woman.</p>
               <p>I saved the letter, but was never able to unravel the mystery of her having buried
                  it in the place referred to, unless it was indeed because she visited the place in
                  remembrance of having there found a friend. Scarcely had I got back to the Jackson
                  House, when I met Russel, the owner of both fugitives. He was weeping because of
                  Lizzie's death; he had been up to view her corpse, and he seemed much broken down.
                  Judge Francis offered to buy Kate, but Russel said he no longer cared for Kate,
                  now that Lizzie was dead. Thereupon he gave us, for her, a bill of freedom, and he
                  departed for the South.</p>

                     SMALL COMPASS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the translator read me the above heading, I ordered him to wait a moment,
                  till I ascertained, if I could as a learned man, who Jenkins meant, but the
                  translator replied, "Cervantes and Shakespeare,"</p>
               <p>"Well, then," said I, "it is at fault."</p>
               <p>"Why so?" said he.</p>
               <p>"Because, if Sir Walter be not in, Scotch critics will condemn it."</p>
               <p>He laughed a little and was about to proceed, when who should come in but Jenkins
                  himself. Said he,</p>
               <p>"I am too excited about this great work, to enjoy myself at any other thing till
                  this volume is done."</p>
               <p>We then told him to come in, and sit down, and he did so, whereupon I ordered my
                  men-servants to bring up from the wine vaults another basket of sparkling Catawba,
                  the which, when it had come, we drank freely of; for it is of that peculiar
                  quality which sobers a man when he hath too much natural fire in him, and it makes
                  everything look drunk but the man who drinks it. When we had thus quenched our
                  thirst, Jenkins, having examined how far we wore, began the mystery of his notes
                  to unfold.</p>
               <p>Whether Lincoln was to be inaugurated or to die, those were the questions in
                  Washington. Knots of conspirators clustered near every corner; every boot
                  concealed a bowie knife, every vest a pistol. Cautiously and so silently were the
                  tongues at work, and such oaths as those seceders swore against this great
                  republic, against the law of freedom, and so gently were they tapped on the
                  shoulder by foreign emissaries, that breathless stood the whole of one of the most
                  powerful nations on the globe. It stood in fear and trembling, seeming to have no
                  head; but the consciousness of right inspired the people to believe a way for
                  safety and glory would be pointed out by the finger of Almighty God. Only an
                  answer to the prayer of so many millions could shield the coming President from
                  common slaughter. As terrible as for Daniel to enter the lions' den, was it for
                  Lincoln to mount the steps of the Capitol; and more, for the lions were God's
                  subjects, but the seceders had repudiated Him, and sung His name in blasphemy.
                  They had defied Him. They had covenanted with one another that, ere the 4th of
                  March, Davis should be installed in Washington. They had armies everywhere, and
                  were armed; but the national Government had been sold by James Buchanan, and now
                  stood there penniless and unprotected. Yet, no, not unprotected. Scott was there,
                  and Holt—instruments and nuclei, whereto the Almighty would build up the most
                  powerful armies ever assembled. But they took not His name in vain, nor party nor
                  schism sought—only the rights of man by God's will. And there they stood,
                  invincible Scott and honest Holt. They saw that morning sun, that 4th of March,
                  and felt a higher approval than by the tap of a foreign emissary, or by the puff
                  of an adventurous correspondent. But their position, and ours, and all men's who
                  loved the great republic then, was mocked at by nearly all European governments.
                  What! ten millions of conspirators, and Scott and Holt to dare oppose them! Only a
                  thousand men to guard Washington, against the threatened approach of thirty
                  thousand rebels! Surely Heaven is in this, or Southern chivalry is a coward—why
                  didn't they come, and not blow so? There was the Capital, defenceless—why not take
                  it? Who held them back? Verily, not Scott and Holt with a thousand men. Why, when
                  Cæsar fell, he had a guard, an army, a million strong. Were those conspirators
                  bolder than these? Lincoln goes unguarded; yet not so, his shield is from Heaven.
                  Conscience pricks those conspirators, and they have not heart to butcher a lamb.
                  And why all their bluster and fury? Washington is like a city on fire, but it
                  burns out. The people rush to and fro; they cluster here and there; whisper, pass
                  on, and point to the Capitol. Men do clench their jaws, and do feel for their
                  concealed weapons, all expectant, to hear the bloody deed is done. Scott and Holt
                  calmly wait the rising sun, that never-to-be-forgotten brilliant sun, their troops
                  at times galloping up and down the streets, and the bugle in far-off places
                  denoting solemn tidings for the coming hour. Both Scott and Holt were calm. So
                  unlike Buchanan. He had that day thrice his wrong clothes put on. His trowsers the
                  wrong side before, and his vest inside out. To the window he often ran, shouting
                  to himself, "O God, if only this day hold out! But if it miscarry, and Lincoln is
                  killed, good Heavens what shall I do?" Again he would return, and sit down,
                  burying his face in his hands, saying, "God knows, I have stuck to my party, if
                  they do tear me in pieces. I've stuck to the Constitution, too. Oh, those
                  Commissioners." Then he would sob awhile, and then again look out of the window,
                  really wearing himself out with bodily fear and a stinging conscience. He had
                  ordered, for several days past, that no one should be admitted into his presence,
                  except such as came by invitation. From affairs of state he had entirely
                  withdrawn, existing merely as rotten debris of the government he had destroyed,
                  and his own rottenness was a stench to his nostrils, his conscience a coal of fire
                  to a perjured soul. Thus moaned and groaned, thus pined, feared, and trembled the
                  great politician that was, this shadow that is. But, shadow though he be, he must,
                  for form's sake, hand over the sceptre to the great rail-splitter. Thus it was I
                  came to him; thus I paid him my last visit—to lead him to the Capitol to get rid
                  of him. And thus, too, I found him, weeping and wailing, "Oh, Jenkins, is it you,
                  dear? They told me never more you'd cross my threshold, dear. But, safe at last,
                  you are come, and the morning's come, and Lincoln too is here. Heaven knows, who
                  says I suffer, flatters me with little knowledge of my pain. I'm wild! I'm mad!
                  Tear me off here an arm! These shrivelled legs crush up! Such pain would be
                  comfort. I'll knock this breast in pieces! Oh, I know what it is to suffer! This
                  day a man told another, I was the death of the Democratic party. I pray Heaven it
                  is not so; but if it is so, may God never give me another happy day." I observed
                  his vest was on wrong side out, and urged him to change it, for it was near time
                  to start. He then changed it, but he put on his gown, and I urged him again that
                  he should wear his coat. Said I, "You know, Cæsar was killed in a gown. I pray
                  you, wear your coat." He then<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6417-00000076"/> pulled it
                  off and put on his coat. Said I, "Your valet has not looked after your toilet this
                  morning." "Why so?" said he. "Why," said I, "your shoes are not polished, nor are
                  they laced." "I suspect my valet," said he, "of having left the Democratic party."
                  He then tried to stoop down to fasten his shoes himself, but he could not bend so
                  far. Said I, "These things would try any constitution." Said he, "What! is that in
                  the Constitution too?"</p>
               <p>I saw that he was not of sound mind, and so I then tied his shoes with my own
                  hands, for which he looked very grateful. I told him I considered it an honor to
                  do such service to so true a Democrat. This touched him a little, and he burst
                  into tears, saying he had not had any one speak so kindly to him for many long
                  months. I knew that in a few short hours the country would be rid of him
                  officially, and I cared not to harass his troubled mind with further censure; but
                  I did not, as many of the newspapers had it, caress him for any purpose whatever.
                  I spoke only as I consider any one ought to speak to another in distress, and it
                  was merely my speaking to him in this manner that made him whimper and cling so
                  close to me. Neither was it at the Mansion, but in the carriage, before we reached
                  Willard's, that he said to me, "Now Jenkins, stand by me. For God's sake, stand by
                  me at the Capitol! you are so large and powerful, and I am such a feeble, nervous
                  person. If there be a row at the Capitol, for God's sake pick me up, and run away
                  with me!" I told him I would, and he replied that I was the only one, he believed,
                  in America, who would turn a hand to save his life. He said, also, that he hoped
                  the country would be more grateful to Lincoln than it was to him; but he still
                  thought the time would come when his administration would be revered. We were near
                  Willard's ere he ceased talking, and then he turned quite round in the carriage,
                  and looked back toward the Mansion, crying, "Can these things be, and all the
                  horrors of a four years' strife at end? Fare thee well, thou hole of hell!
                  Farewell, farewell—a long farewell!"</p>
               <p>In a few minutes we were in Willard's, in the presence of that man of destiny,
                  Lincoln, who received us with a hearty laugh; but as I had many things to arrange
                  I left them together, in company of a few friends, and hurried off to find the
                  Judge and members of our court, who were to have entire charge of the etiquette of
                  the inauguration. On arriving at the Jackson House, I found no one I was
                  acquainted with, and, so, to reflect a moment, I sat down on the outer porch. In
                  an instant my attention was directed to persons ensconced behind the lattice
                  shades. No mistaking it,—it was protestations of love on the part of some man, and
                  the tender doubts of some young girl. As often as he praised her beauty and
                  loveliness, she would sigh, and reject it as proof that his attachment was from an
                  immature season. Of course I was too much of a gentleman to look in, and I must
                  not listen to other folks making love; but my curiosity so far mastered me, that I
                  raised up till my car stood opposite the opening in the window, and then I
                  discovered it to be the clerk and Vickey. "Then why," she gently remonstrated,
                  "did you so deceive me, in saying you were heir to such great possessions?"</p>
               <p>"Because I loved you," said he. "I saw that you had a good heart, and I determined
                  to win you. If I took a bad course, it was my head, and not my heart at
                  fault."</p>
               <p>"But that was deception," said she.</p>
               <p>"Certainly; we all deceive one another in these times. The young man pretends to a
                  fortune; the young lady pretends to education and accomplishments, the young lady
                  with half a dozen years at a female college kept by an overgrown egotist, gets a
                  smattering of French, German, music, and gets also a diploma for having a finished
                  education, albeit she has not read Henriade nor Tasso but in the translations.
                  Penelope, Homer and Quintilian are fools to her; but her parents would palm her
                  off on a gentleman as an accomplished lady. Is this not deception?"</p>
               <p>Now, when he began to talk in this style, she cried bitterly, for she felt that
                  she merited the rebuke. But he continued: "If this deception is just, why shall
                  not a man make believe he has a fortune? Anything for getting the best of the
                  bargain. The lady wants a husband more elevated than herself, and he wants a wife
                  wealthier and more accomplished. Anything to win on. A few dashing tunes on the
                  piano, or a loud set speech at a lady's feet. Miss Edge, I am done with this sort
                  of stuff. I am only a clerk at a thousand dollars a year. You have, or will have,
                  a large fortune. If I were to marry a really accomplished lady, I could not
                  support her; if you were to marry a proper gentleman, you would be in constant
                  pain by the society he would take you in. Think you, would you enjoy your husband
                  having with another woman a little chit-chat in French on Fénélon and Lamartine?
                  Bethink you, they make quotations from Virgil, and ask your opinion! Would you
                  hold up your boarding-school diploma? Now, enough of this; I would not see you
                  weep. I am myself no scholar; but my place here has shown me those who were; and I
                  admonish you, as I am a true friend to a good-hearted and innocent girl, never
                  think of using your accomplishments, or your father's money, to catch a husband
                  your much superior. I have tried to make you comfortable at the Jackson House, and
                  I have seen, too, how frequently you have been mortified."</p>
               <p>For some time I heard no more, and I knew not but they had both left; and so,
                  thinking I was losing much of the time in which I ought to be getting the court
                  together, I raised up, and looked into the parlor. There she sat, and there he
                  sat, and both looking another way. Every little while she passed her handkerchief
                  upward. Whether to wait and see the result, or to go about my own business—those
                  were the questions. Pretty soon, however, I saw him rise and stand before her, but
                  she turned her face away. Said he, "Have I abused you?"</p>
               <p>No," she answered, faintly.</p>
               <p>"Shall I thus abruptly leave you, weeping?"</p>
               <p>"As you like."</p>
               <p>"Bid me what you will, and I will do it."</p>
               <p>She gave no answer.</p>
               <p>"To-night," he resumed, "you give a reception, and you are to marry!"</p>
               <p>"What!" she whispered, looking up.</p>
               <p>"Not to Prescott. I know all about it. To the Judge."</p>
               <p>"Ha!"</p>
               <p>Ha! I know, 'tis not all a joke. You call it a joke, and so do others, but the
                  Judge told me all about it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, do not trifle thus."</p>
               <p>"I am not trifling. I tell you, though, I know all about it; and I tell you, too,
                  it is the most foolish thing you ever undertook. He is old enough to be your
                  grandfather. I always thought it was nonsense, till this morning, when the Judge
                  gave me a card."</p>
               <p>"A card!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, a, wedding card; very pretty indeed of you to invent these covers!"</p>
               <p>Here she straightened herself upright—and she is very tall and thin; but ere her
                  astonishment had gone further, he gave her the card. For a moment she perused it,
                  and then she cried out, "Oh, why am I thus abused?" and she cried piteously. He
                  asked her what was wrong about it and she, sobbing, told him there was no truth in
                  it whatever. The clerk assured her it was true. She denied it; said the Judge was
                  engaged to her aunt. The clerk told her it was in the papers. She said it had been
                  in the papers about Prescott and herself. Thus they discussed the matter,
                  explaining and complaining, till he, seeing she was partly recovered from her
                  blues, bade her remember that he must go to the office.</p>
               <p>"Now," said he, "you see they have been using your name as if you were a stick.
                  Your father and mother half believe you are engaged to Prescott; but Prescott
                  knows nothing of it, nor did he ever make pretensions of love for you. The Judge,
                  on the other hand, professes to love you, and you have returned it. You accepted
                  all his presents, and you have boasted he was to give you a large present on your
                  wedding day. So, you see, I know that it is all true."</p>
               <p>"It is not true!" she retorted sharply.</p>
               <p>"What! not true that you will marry the Judge?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly not. I never thought of such a thing."</p>
               <p>"Just so; and yet in your innocence you favored his every advance."</p>
               <p>"Oh is it possible! Has it come to this?"</p>
               <p>"Well, you have gone so far now you will need stick to it."</p>
               <p>"I won't!"</p>
               <p>"But you must!"</p>
               <p>"I will not! Those old silver spectacles!"</p>
               <p>At that they both laughed right heartily, but she hushed quickly, for the thought
                  was so unpleasant to her taste.</p>
               <p>"Why," said the clerk, "I am really very sorry for you. The guests, to-night, will
                  all say you have treated the Judge badly, to have encouraged him and then thus
                  denied him. There is only one way in which you can avoid shame and an ill name by
                  this. You will be booted at by every one in Washington. You can elope with me, and
                  save your honor. Nay, start not; I mean what I say. You are a dear, good girl, and
                  about my own equal in the general getting up, and I will make you an excellent and
                  appreciative husband." She began to pull and twist her handkerchief at a furious
                  rate, and then he went to her, and took her hands in his, adding, "Don't mind what
                  I say, but judge of my former conduct if I will not be kind and dutiful. I may
                  have much mischief in me, but I assure you my heart is as warm as anybody's, and
                  pretty much the same size. I know you need some one to love<pb n="152-153"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000077"/> you, to speak kindly and fondly to you. Pray you,
                  let me be that one."</p>
               <p>I could not hear what she said, but she leaned over on his shoulder, and cried and
                  clung fast to him and I was afraid they might turn round and see me looking; so I
                  dodged down a little, but I heard him kiss her. Soon after that he took a hasty
                  leave, having conducted her to the door, and bade her meet him again at the same
                  place, in two hours hence. From this I concluded they had provised an elopement,
                  but I had no evidence when it was to take place. Not being disposed to waste more
                  time in looking after them, I immediately started in search of the Judge, whom I
                  found in the garden, on his lounge, sound asleep. Beside him lay a paper and
                  pencil. He had evidently been writing, but fallen asleep at it. On the paper was
                  the following: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"To the tall, fair girl with the shining black hair;</l>
                        <l>To the dear, sweet girl with the hazel blue eye:</l>
                        <l>Come, haste to the garden; come, haste to the wedding;</l>
                        <l>A vacuum in store and love running o'er, Is waiting for you."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Evidently his mind was turned, or he had been reading Tennyson, and I ejaculated,
                  "Ha, Poet Laureate!" Thereupon he awoke, and I admonished him it was time to go to
                  the Capitol.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" said he, moving his spectacles and brushing up his thin hair, "I slept
                  so little last night. Let me see, what is the programme? Ah, I remember. I am
                  hey-dey man. Come on."</p>
               <p>So, accordingly, we went, he having told me that Scott had despatched Prescott to
                  Charleston to report on the threatened rebellion. I did not like to tell the Judge
                  what Vickey said, nor did I consider it my business. If she would not have him, he
                  would find it out in due season; and if she and the clerk eloped, that was their
                  matter. Now it was so arranged between us, for we feared a collision of arms on
                  the part of the rebels with the law abiding people, that we made no exertion to
                  have ladies attend the inauguration, choosing to let them come or stay away, as
                  best they might decide for themselves. We had, however, decided to have
                  thirty-four carriages representing thirty-four States, and each one carrying a
                  beautiful lady, to precede the President's carriage, and to alight and assemble on
                  or near the portico of the Capitol before Buchanan and Lincoln made their
                  appearance. To obtain the aforesaid young ladies, we had already spent a week,
                  and, now that the time was up, four States were unrepresented—South Carolina,
                  Georgia, Mississippi and Arkansas. Not but those States had plenty of pretty
                  representatives in Washington, but there were few who would accept of wearing the
                  red, white and blue, unless, indeed, we chose homely, scrawny-necked ones. One
                  lady, a beautiful girl from Georgia, by the name of Emerson, we finally coaxed
                  into the programme; but after she was dressed, and about to start, her mother,
                  then stopping at the Washington Hotel, caught her on the steps, and tore the dress
                  in pieces. The girl's father, however, replaced it with another, whereupon the
                  enraged mother rushed into the house for a pistol, vowing she would rather see her
                  daughter die. The father, though, took care of the girl, and after a while the old
                  woman got over it. The one we got to represent Arkansas was a lean,
                  crooked-shanked old maid, with a coffee-colored face, and such a mouth as made you
                  think of the Mississippi river. For Mississippi State we were obliged to take a
                  little hunch-backed widow, deaf as a door nail, and she grinned incessantly. But
                  for South Carolina there was the rub. We had raced in vain all over Washington; we
                  had offered five presents—everything we could think of—but only one lady from that
                  State would agree to go. She was a lump of a woman, so fat that her eyes were
                  almost hid from sight, and her dark, grizzly-looking eyebrows grew clear across
                  her forehead, which forehead was about half an inch high and broad as your two
                  hands. A dirty, sweaty-looking mustache she had, and a fatty-like wrinkle hanging
                  down from the corners of her low fat nose; a double chin a hand-breadth deep, and
                  such a sickening scowl I never saw on woman. Now, on the morning of the
                  inauguration, we received from said beauty the following letter, directed to the
                  Judge and the members of the court of etiquette:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"Miss Sowsy begs to decline her engagement. She thinks it is
                              incompatible with her dignity to longer wear the red, white and
                              blue.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>"LILLIE SOWSY."</signed>
                           </closer>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>What was to be done? We had not a moment to lose, this despatch having been
                  received just as we came out of the garden. As every lady was to carry a flag with
                  the name of her State on it, the one from South Carolina would be the most
                  observed of all. After a little consultation, we concluded again to go and see
                  Miss Sowsy, and urge her to it. We did so; but what was our surprise at seeing her
                  with a Palmetto flag, and hearing her say, "Anything but this is Abolition."</p>
               <p>On our way back we fell in with Mr. Palmer, of Charleston, and told him about
                  it.</p>
               <p>He said his daughter would go, provided we could get a dress ready in time.</p>
               <p>It was then a quarter past eleven o'clock, and I urged the Judge to go at once and
                  see the young lady, while I would proceed to have in readiness not only our own
                  carriage, but those bearing the young ladies. Thereupon we separated, each to his
                  own duty; but I neglected to state that we had agreed that, if there was any
                  difficulty about getting the carriages, we would take the ladies in a triumphal
                  car. On my way back to the Jackson House I observed many of the people wore pins
                  and plates engraved palmetto. It was almost impossible to get through the crowd,
                  nearly all of whom were men, the gentle sex thinking, no doubt, a collision would
                  occur at any moment. When I arrived at the Jackson House, I had only fifteen
                  minutes left in which to get the Judge's horses and carriage in readiness and
                  drive to Willard's. We were, accordingly, in much haste, and frequently being
                  annoyed by having to seek for remnants of harness and bridles. The carriage had
                  not been used for many weeks, nor had it been oiled, and it now squeaked and
                  squealed and barked most horridly, and some boys had been cutting stone-slings out
                  of the carriage cover, so it looked like a riddle. Finally, however, we got in
                  readiness; but the Judge had not come. Here was a predicament. He was so fat and
                  so old, and he walked so slow, he might not be here for an hour. I then came out
                  and looked down the avenue. It was one solid mass of human beings. Their meaning
                  and purpose was doubtful, and much to be dreaded. Again and again I pulled out my
                  watch, and I was in intense agony because the Judge came not. Only a few minutes,
                  and I must be at Willard's. I thought perhaps the Judge would go in Palmer's
                  carriage. I could wait no longer. Mounting now the carriage, with only my driver
                  and footman for companions, I started on at a rapid rate. On nearing Willard's, I
                  decided to dispense with so many carriages for the ladies of state, but to pile
                  them into the triumphal car in advance, and in rear of the two Presidents. In a
                  little while the state ladies made their appearance, all showing more or less
                  nervousness on account of the importance of the occasion. In vain I looked for a
                  representative for South Carolina. In vain I looked for the Judge. Whispers and
                  jeers, but low and derisive, went up from the vast assemblage, that South Carolina
                  was not there. Over and over I surveyed the ladies, but all to no purpose. Many of
                  them were the fairest that man e'er laid eyes on. Miss Hendricks, of
                  Missouri,—Lord, what a sweet and noble face! Her ringlets were like pure gold, and
                  her large, blue eyes had in them an angel's purity and love. Her form, so noble
                  and full matured, now adorned and adorning the red, white and blue. Miss Haslett,
                  of Michigan, a brunette grace, with two and thirty jet black, curls a yard in
                  length, hiding half the rotund chest now swelling like a bird affrighted, as
                  downward some she meekly held her blushing face, at times her heaven-lit eyes
                  glancing o'er the crowd around. Miss North, of Massachusetts, whose jolly,
                  fun-loving eye all things turned to jokes and merriment; whose smile a dimpled
                  chin and cheek did envy but to strive, as proudly, with a coquettish air, she now
                  and then tossed up the red, white and blue. Miss Hawthorne, of Pennsylvania, an
                  unconscious beauty, not light, not dark, but rosy and life-like, innocent of all
                  things around and child-like, whose heart no room had left for independent
                  thought, and made her thus the most perfect counterpart of man; made her like a
                  fair flower, innocent of her own beauty and sweetness.</p>
               <p>And so it was of all the others,—all so many beauties, only from the seceded
                  States we had to take them as we could get them. And those were pretty fair, only
                  the lean one from Arkansas, and the little widow of Mississippi. The lady for
                  Georgia would do, but her mother had scratched her face some. For South Carolina,
                  though, there was no one present. May-be the Judge would go direct to the Capitol
                  with her. It was the only chance, the only hope. The time had come, we must start.
                  I now sent a messenger in to announce to Buchanan and Lincoln our readiness to
                  receive them and conduct them to the Capitol. They were soon at the door, and,
                  although it was supposed they had no guard provided, yet such was not the case.
                  Scott had for the occasion two hundred picked men in citizen's dress, well armed
                  with private arms, who were to proceed before, behind, and, in fact, all round the
                  carriage, to the Capitol and back again. They were provided with white ribbons
                  concealed, which, in case of a row, were to be uncovered, and the men were<pb
                     n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6417-00000078"/> to sail into everybody and everything
                  that displayed not the color. In a few minutes now the Presidents came down and
                  entered their carriage, Lincoln getting in first, and Buchanan taking a seat at
                  his left hand. Many of us smiled at this little innovation, but were startled by a
                  slight hurrah from some one near the carriage. I looked and there beheld Orsini!
                  It was as if a viper had sprung out of the earth. In an instant did civilians
                  crowd him back, and those civilians were the picked guard. Again and again did I
                  inwardly thank Winfield Scott; for what man else could have invented so great
                  protection with so few men? As yet, however, the public knew it not. We had all
                  heard it said, over and over, that Lincoln should never reach the Capitol alive.
                  But words cannot tell the flight of thought, nor can it show the checkered fear
                  and emotion at such a time. We saw Orsini, and we expected thousands of men on the
                  instant to run into bloody riot. Upward, and where a fair view was had, stood
                  Madame Ponchard, waving her handkerchief. In the vast assemblage did two voices
                  cheer; but ere the sound had passed around, the triumphal car was under way. No
                  more now we feared till near the Capitol. But here, too, had Scott provided for
                  any tumult. Thus we moved along, and thus to the portico, passing by the way full
                  sixty thousand men. On the grounds, above and below, all round the Capitol, were
                  assembled such a concourse of people as were never before in Washington. More than
                  half of them had come to see the portico washed with Lincoln's blood. More than
                  half of them were armed with bowie knives and pistols, with their hands resting on
                  the concealed pockets. Yet amidst this vast assemblage had thousands and thousands
                  of fair women come, to see and to be seen, trembling for their lives the while.
                  Close around the Presidents, and everywhere that danger most appeared, were
                  Scott's two hundred unknown vigilants. No one, save Scott, knew their number or
                  authority, but they were each a man among ten thousand, powerful and resolute, men
                  who felt that they held the great republic on their shoulders and no one apart his
                  own life valued. And yet, withal, another side this adventure had, and full of
                  danger. Davis and Toombs had more than the two hundred, and better armed, but
                  untutored for the deed designed. For this is God's will, a criminal never weighs
                  the chance of failure but with a mortal instrument. They thought in half-concerted
                  riot to kill the President. A woman, Madame Ponchard, and her consort, Orsini, two
                  common assassins of foreign birth, for hire, were to do this great deed of state;
                  and the planners and perpetrators, Toombs and Davis, afar off, to escape
                  uncensured and free, to ultimately fly to the Capitol as the chosen rulers of the
                  nation. So now, as our unornamental pageantry neared the portico, that same
                  mysterious woman, and that same oft-accused and oft-released villain, Orsini, must
                  needs rush to the front, waving the stars and stripes, both bent on the
                  treacherous deed. Again that unthought-of two hundred press them backward, as
                  calmly all as if it were a time of prayer. Now merg forth the four and thirty fair
                  ladies, virgin emblems of the independent States of the great republic, bearing
                  each her flag triumphant—but no—South Carolina is not there! Over and over we read
                  the flags, and over again we bleed at the thought that a star is gone! Fifty
                  thousand eyes look for that flag—ay, a hundred thousand eyes! A murmur begins to
                  arise—such a half-suppressed murmur as was never before since the foundation of
                  the world. It was the midnight hour of human liberty. Come at once, or freedom is
                  dead! Come, and long lives the great republic! But oh, the terrible hour, the
                  second that measured more than the lapse of centuries. Coming here are now the
                  Presidents, and a moving discontent makes manifest the fell omen. Tears of
                  disappointment stream from countless patriot eyes, while the opposite, the foes of
                  freedom, now smile and curl their lips in goading triumph. But lo! What sound is
                  that, and greetings! They move—make way, and on the portico fall back!—the flag is
                  coming! South Carolina! South Carolina! Now look the eager eyes, to see what lady
                  this temerity has. Then, tall, and fair, and smiling, comes the maid of
                  seventeen—our sweet Victoria! Few, so very few did know her, and they thought she
                  was a South Carolinian. She was clothed in red, white, and blue, and so prettily
                  bore her little flag that only in her praise sang all the crowd; yet sang, but
                  breathless held their voices while they surveyed her queenly beauty, and praised
                  her from their very souls as an angel, a symbol come at the final hour to marshal
                  peace and liberty. Now here it was, and at this trying moment, Douglas spoke. He
                  had been obliged to take the Judge's place, to act as hey-dey man; and close to my
                  side had all the while remained to be prompted in the part he must fulfil. The
                  Judge had been to Mr. Palmer's, but the daughter would not go. She snubbed him;
                  called him an old fool; told him South Carolina was out of the Union, and so sent
                  him off. But inasmuch as he had the appointment to furnish the ladies and manage
                  the etiquette, he had no other way left but to call on Victoria, and persuade her
                  to relieve him in this great hour of distress. Accordingly, having, as he passed
                  Mrs. Hamil's silk store, provided himself with a quantity of red, white, and blue
                  silk, he hastened to the Jackson House, where he found Vickey crying severely
                  about the clerk, and the Cupid exasperations between them. She told the Judge she
                  was crying because nobody would take her to the inauguration. Hereupon the Judge
                  exhibited the silk, and expostulated much on her appearance, and so struck a
                  bargain at once, whereby she was to go as a South Carolinian. She was in just such
                  desperate state of mind as makes a woman do anything; and so, between madness and
                  love of adventure, at once assumed the part. Dashing on the colors in more
                  profusion than any other lady would be clothed, she and the Judge and Mr. Edge
                  hastened on foot to the Capitol, and, as before stated, just arrived at what was
                  likely to have been a fatal moment to the Government. Thus coming on the portico,
                  where she expected to be merely as any other of the number, was a signal for
                  greetings she little thought of. South Carolina was really the only State of much
                  interest, and her representative was the very queen of queens. The eyes of the
                  many thousands were all turned on her, and she in turn looked on them all as
                  innocently happy as if she were in a Philadelphia boarding-school. I knew her, and
                  so did some of my friends, and we were all afraid she would speak, and so betray
                  the whole thing; but this showed only how little we knew of the capacity of a
                  green country girl under excitement. Scarcely had she ventured forth, her father
                  and the Judge standing near, and many of the people exultant over her coming,
                  while many, even enemies to the country, were captivated with her beauty, when
                  Douglas stepped forth—to hold Lincoln's hat, and to make some preliminaries
                  preparatory to the oath of office.</p>
               <p>"Again are the representatives," said he, "of our several States assembled, as
                  tokens of love for the principles which have made you (<hi rend="i"/>to Lincoln)
                  the people's choice. To you (<hi rend="i"/>to the ladies), the fair
                  representatives of these United States, I assume the responsibility of bestowing a
                  nation's thanks, and a nation's love. To you (<hi rend="i"/>to Vickey), the gentle
                  representative of South Carolina, may the incoming Administration be the
                  inspiration to peace and quietude to your State as yourself over us all holds
                  command, by purity and nobleness of purpose."</p>
               <p>Here he halted a moment, and she thought he wanted her to reply, and so she
                  said,</p>
               <p>"Our hopes are manifested by myself being here. I would not speak in public; but I
                  love my State, and more, I love my country. This, I do presume, for American
                  ladies, will ever be their highest joy; while noble hearts their lords maintain
                  toward the great republic, to ever decorate their persons with the red, white, and
                  blue." She then smiled, and waved her little flag, striving hard to hide her deep
                  emotion. But as firmly did the people control theirs, for her voice, by its
                  sweetness and purity, had rendered her sentiments most sublime, and to be
                  treasured as one of the most comprehensive and feminine speeches on record. It was
                  a sentiment to make man manly, and this is a rare sentiment in woman's public
                  speeches.</p>
               <p>Baker, of Oregon, then came forward, and introduced Lincoln, and thus ran
                  Lincoln's inaugural, to wit:</p>
               <p>"This is an occasion of painful joy and solicitude. We all do know the questions
                  upon us. We are all countrymen of one country. But we can never separate. A man
                  and wife may separate and go away, but we must remain, even if separated. If we
                  make ourselves aliens to each other, still we gain nothing. Friends can make laws
                  better than aliens can treaties. Suppose we go to war; after many of us have
                  fallen, the question would still arise. I am called by the people, according to
                  the laws of the country. Only will I execute those laws; and the Constitution
                  shall be preserved. The property of the Government must be protected. In your
                  hands, my countrymen, is the issue. The Government will not assail any State, or
                  the laws of any State. If you assail the Government, that is your matter. You take
                  no rightful oath to destroy our country, but I take one simply to protect it. We
                  are friends. Passion may have strained the cords of our affection, but it must not
                  break our ties of national brotherhood. The chords of memory, from every battle
                  field, from every patriot grave, to every living heart in this land will sing in
                  chorus for this Union when touched by the angels of our purer nature."</p>
               <p>Hereupon Taney came forward, bearing the Holy Bible and Constitution, and directed
                  Lincoln to lay his right hand on them, and to raise the left to Heaven, and they
                  repeated these words,</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6417-00000079"/>
               <p>"I, Abraham Lincoln, do solemnly swear before thee, Almighty God, that I will
                  protect the Constitution, defend the national property, and execute the national
                  laws for the term of four years from this date. Help me, God, and make me
                  righteous to do Thy will."</p>
               <p>Such was the end. The vast concourse of people were in confusion, every one
                  turning his own way, every one expressing opinions on the occasion. But the secret
                  guard still kept on duty, still kept beside Lincoln and Buchanan. The former firm
                  and much overcome by the trying scene, the latter pale as death, and trembling,
                  ejaculating to himself continually, "O dear! O my God! O Heaven! My God! My God!
                  Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" At times he would look toward the people as if lost to
                  comprehend what was going on, and then again he would look downward, in the most
                  mortified melancholy that ever man exhibited. Twice or thrice Lincoln spoke to
                  him, but got no answer, only heard the low wailings and sighs of the almost dying
                  politician, who, like a miscreant, now fully beheld the crime of his imbecility.
                  He realized, at last, that of all the five-and-thirty millions of people, not a
                  single one would ever more mention his name but in shame and hatred. He realized
                  that he was not a man; that he had been discovered to be merely a bogus piece of
                  worthless flesh and bones, with none of the spirit or soul of a genuine mortal.
                  Thus, in agony and shame, did we lift his trembling form into the carriage, to
                  take the last ride he would ever take at Government expense. Downward, though, he
                  held his head; he knew no more where we were taking him, nor of what was passing,
                  than does the delirious maniac, when all things seem as devils for his torture. He
                  had had his day, and this was his last. North and South both said, "Tis good, this
                  is his last." Farewell, Buchanan; thou wert a whale in the ocean, and we took thee
                  for dry land; but thou didst dive and leave us at the mercy of the waves. Good for
                  thee that we laugh at our folly and some the fall assume, or we had harpooned
                  thee! Away, imbecile President!</p>
               <p>The writer of this great work here halted a moment, for Jenkins became too excited
                  to continue; but when I told him Buchanan was gone now, he said, "No, not yet! One
                  other view of him you shall yet have, and then he is done."</p>
               <p>In a little while Jenkins reverted to the history as follows, to wit:</p>
               <p>On our way back we changed the programme, all of us accompanying Lincoln to the
                  Mansion, when we alighted, and rather unceremoniously made ourselves quite
                  welcome. Lincoln shook hands with the girls, and was quite humorous; paying no
                  more attention to Scott, Holt, or Seward, than to any one else. Now, although the
                  day was so fair, it was chilly, and Lincoln called a colored chap and ordered him
                  to tell the cook to fire up, or we would all come down in the kitchen. The cook
                  was a Southern man, and, having heard much said about Lincoln's greenness, and
                  having been used to the words "fire up," which means, down South to pass round the
                  whiskey, what does he do, but, filling a two-bushel basket with choice bottles,
                  comes right before the new President, saying, "Here you are, here's fire for the
                  whole Mansion. We've run the machine pretty fast down in the kitchen to-day, and,
                  considering as when a fellow gets anything new he must 'wet it,' we saved this lot
                  for your Excellency." Down he threw the basket, and we wondered what Lincoln would
                  say; but he was never at a loss for a word, and he said, "Oh, excuse me sir, it is
                  the outside we would warm. For four years, terrible as it may seem, this house
                  shall indulge in water." He did not laugh, nor was he moved more than had he been
                  looking at the moon. But the joke is told to this day in the kitchen of the White
                  House. The next chapter will be after this; but as this is the last chapter before
                  the last except one, the last word of this one shall be last.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WITHOUT waiting for an explanation, the writer of these annals informed his
                  informer that the above heading was sufficiently confused to be mistaken for an
                  emanation from that great philosopher who compared Paris to a wheel full of
                  fishes.</p>
               <p>"Why," said Jenkins, "that's not confused at all. Fishes swallow one another, and
                  they turn round and get swallowed in turn; and so if they turn round they are like
                  a wheel."</p>
               <p>"But why," said I, "does it apply more to Paris than to any other city? For the
                  people in all civilized countries live on one another."</p>
               <p>"The philosopher did not say so," said he; but ere I had time to speak further on
                  this weighty matter, he took up his notes, and thus began, to wit:—</p>

                     attack the seventy-five men if he dare to raise his finger in menace, or to

                     court and proprietor of Loudon Heights, are resolved to have a good time while
                     we may. Just as I said to Lincoln to-day, while I held his hat at the Capitol,
                     we have too much pleasure in this country to be meddling with war. What more,
                     Mr. Jenkins?"</p>

                  he saw I had seen, and wished the court meddle not about the hat. Nor did I
                  presume to disturb the harmony of the court, and was favored by one of the most
                  fortunate incidents that ever occurred. The report of two or three pistol-shots on
                  the street started every member in the temple to his feet. Judge Francis adjourned
                  at once, and we all rushed to the door, where, in looking down the Avenue, we
                  beheld some two dozen persons in citizen dress, surrounding Madame Ponchard and
                  Orsini. They were prisoners, and the people bound them with a rope. We then came
                  down from the portico of the Temple, halting near the pillars thereof, till the
                  Judge charged us all to be in readiness for any summons he might from the nature
                  of events be oblged to issue. We then shook hands, little thinking what would
                  intervene before we assembled together again. The Judge and myself then walked
                  together to the before named crowd of citizens, but the other members went another
                  way; for several pistols were fired, and many of us feared we might be shot. The
                  citizens said to one another, "We know these two persons, Madame Ponchard and
                  Orsini, conspired against Lincoln's life; we will have them lodged in prison until
                  the facts are examined into, and, if they are guilty, they must be punished; nor
                  can any man pardon them for such an offence but Lincoln himself." Yet some few
                  others said, "Nay, let them go. If you harm a hair of their heads, this city shall
                  on the instant be laid in ruins." The captors were, however, much more numerous,
                  and they marched off with the prisoners, even though many knives and pistols were
                  used on them. In a little while they reached the prison, and the two prisoners
                  were put in and secured. By this time, however, the citizens had increased in
                  number to upward of three or four hundred. A large majority were undoubtedly in
                  favor of retaining the prisoners, but a forcible rescue was threatened all round.
                  In this predicament—for civil law was nearly powerless—a number of men went to see
                  Lincoln, to lay the case before him, and to urge him at once to declare martial
                  law in the District of Columbia, and to caution him on the dangers that would
                  otherwise arise. Now, when they had come to the President's Mansion, it was closed
                  against them, and hence arose the saying that Lincoln was so glad of his election
                  that he got drunk. But this was false; for, as stated in the previous chapter of
                  this invaluable history, Lincoln had made it a law for the White House, that,
                  during four years, any one could indulge in water as much as he liked. What he was
                  doing, though, that he would not receive the above-named committee, this deponent
                  knoweth not. He knew, though, that the committee resolved to follow the matter up,
                  and that, by careful research, they discovered that he would most probably visit
                  one of the richest of American citizens. As soon as this was ascertained, some of
                  the committee went their way, but others of them waited in the grounds of the
                  Mansion; for not only Madame Ponchard and Orsini were to be feared, but many
                  rebels, made mad by Lincoln's success so far, now declared openly that they would
                  not raise a hand to keep an assassin's knife out of Lincoln's heart. In this state
                  of affairs Scott ordered a small guard, disguised a little, to keep a distant
                  watch over the new President, and the consequence was, friends and guard were
                  alike suspicious of one another, and of known rebels. The arrest of Madame
                  Ponchard and Orsini was really a dangerous proceeding, not so much on account of
                  Orsini, but Madame Ponchard. The American people had been taught so much charity
                  to woman, that any crime she could commit was forgiven. Women could defame the
                  pulpit by preaching holiness, even while in male attire their wantonness boasted
                  pride to have no shame; they stalked the clinique and dissecting room, and, like
                  parrots, learned a choice of words, not for good, but love of notoriety; they
                  clamored for their right to do these things by public harangues which they called
                  speeches and lectures; and these, their bad examples, were seized upon by women of
                  lower grade, who, for notoriety, would horsewhip or shoot a man. Yet, were she
                  arrested and tried, she was always acquitted; nay, she was applauded and
                  encouraged in it, for it was her right; for suppose she horsewhipped a man or shot
                  him—poor, dear thing, it pleased her! Suppose she studied medicine in order to
                  practise sin with good skill; no matter—poor thing, she wanted to! Suppose she
                  vented her grievances in the rostrum, calling it a lecture, poisoning the happy
                  daughter's dreams of the future, by sowing there the leprosy of her own perverted
                  thoughts—no matter; 'tis a free country, and the poor, dear thing had a right to
                  do so! Thus had woman attained a right, where-in she was sapping the foundation of
                  all that is pure and holy between the sexes, establishing a preeminence for
                  herself that obliterated all law, that gave her the fullest liberty to any crime.
                  It was almost impossible to punish her. No matter what the crime, people
                  everywhere, and nearly everybody cried out, Shame! if she were even arrested to be
                  tried. Thus it was when Madame Ponchard was taken. The rebels made capital of it.
                  They called it Lincoln's attack on the women. And because a few men kept guard
                  round the Mansion, the rebels said he was a coward; that he stayed at home, and
                  sent out vigilants to capture women. These stories were seized upon and sent by
                  telegraph all over the country, and the opinions of newspapers in far-off cities
                  were returned to Washington with such exaggeration as pleases best the fancy, to
                  move more than ever the latent fire now kindling there.</p>
               <p>Now it is a good thing in a republic to have a judge to suit you; for, if you are
                  on his side, he'll be on yours also, and, no matter for what you are bound up, he
                  can give you an injunction or habcas corpus, and set you free in an instant. 'Tis
                  a blessed thing to be a judge, or to be on the judge's side, and for this reason
                  look out whom you elect. 'Twas so in Washington. The secession party had their
                  judge in Washington. The vigilants knew this; knew that, for the asking, he would
                  have the body of Madame Ponchard. But they selected one of their number to go to
                  the judge and take him out riding, and so it was arranged.</p>
               <p>Now, with this brief statement on my part, I will revert to the Judge and myself,
                  which is to say, we separated, he going directly to the President's Mansion, and I
                  following the before mentioned crowd of people engaged with Madame Ponchard and
                  Orsini.</p>

               <p>MISS UNDERHILL had now been back some time, but was still quite unwell. The
                  torture had been hard for her, and yet her own remorse was harder. The thought
                  that she had been engaged in such a foolish adventure mortified her feelings. This
                  made her backward and diffident. Mostly she kept her room, and did converse but
                  little. None of us ever mentioned her adventure. We forgot it. We remembered only
                  that she had been on a long visit, and that we had no joy while she was away. In
                  distant strains and on distant themes we conversed; and of all the guests at the
                  Jackson House, only the Judge, myself, and the slave Kate knew what had been, and
                  why so long away our summer flower had ceased to bloom. Yet there was one so close
                  and intimate—I mean Vickey. So kind and true this girl waited near, and all wants
                  supplied. I almost wept that Vickey was so good; for, for her vanity and greenness
                  I had valued her so low, and now must I so much her naked, pure heart acknowledge,
                  I almost did wish it were not so; but most I grieved that society could so spoil
                  and spot such an angel-like creature.</p>
               <p>My part I can never write, of what I said or did, or of what to me was said. The
                  mistress of Loudon Heights was the purest and best I ever knew; and with this
                  belief, I assure you, words can never be of light character. Ignorance of things
                  around may lead to mischief, but not the heart will. Listen, and you shall hear.
                  But let us back.</p>
               <p>About daybreak there did appear before our servant a man so lean and tattered,
                  with sickly cast and melancholy, not one above a thousand had noticed him. With
                  voice from sickness hollow, and full of woe, he thus began:</p>
               <p>"Tell me, sir, is this where Judge Underhill lives? Scarce my sight this house can
                  compass, for long I have lain in a dark room, and am some bewildered. Judge
                  Underhill, does he live here, sir?"</p>
               <p>Surveying him from head to foot, our servant thus gave answer:</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; the Judge lives here, and so does his niece. Shall I ascertain if he is
                  at home?"</p>
               <p>In some confusion the invalid rejoined, "Did I mistake you, sir?"</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                  <p>—"No, sir; the Judge lives here. Shall I ascertain if he is at home for
                     you?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>—"That part I understand, sir; but what said you of his niece? She is
                     dead!"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Why, sir, then she has died<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6417-00000081"/> since
                     breakfast. I carried breakfast to her door this morning, and, if I am not
                     blind, I saw her smile right merrily at the sight of it."</p>
                  <p>In pensive mood, and almost choking with emotion, the pale man gazed on his
                     informer, speechless, and sat himself down. To and fro the servant walked, as
                     if, perchance, he thought this were a poor relative, or a culprit abashed, and
                     seeking audience with great and good people. And so, to give him further hint
                     that this was no time to call, he thus went on:</p>
                  <p>"Miss Underhill and her uncle are both quite busily engaged. Report has it that
                     she is to marry this night, and I am inclined to believe so; for, even while I
                     stood with the breakfast things, I saw such dazzling robes of white, and such
                     golden head-gear, I am myself convinced. I don't think they would see
                     company."</p>
                  <p>Almost the stranger froze, but spoke not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                  <p>—"The Cabinet, and, I believe, the Presidents, are to be here, and the foreign
                     ambassadors. The Judge is a man of great wealth, and very eccentric, and he has
                     presented his niece, for the occasion, some costly jewelry and service in
                     silver and gold. Mr. Edge, the great railroad contractor, is tendered the
                     freedom of the house, and his daughter, to blind the public from believing the
                     marriage is to be, calls the event her reception for this season. But we, the
                     confidential servants of the house, know and understand these sort of things.
                     We have been there before."</p>
                  <p>Again in silence walks the servant, again in silence almost dies the stranger,
                     nor words—for the wild torrent of thoughts was rushing there—could come to
                     rescue. At last he asks:</p>
                  <p>"Can this be the same—Miss Ann Underhill, of Loudon Heights? Was she not long
                     since supposed to be dead?"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                  <p>—"The very same. Oh! ay, she was smitten after a planter down South, and her
                     uncle sent her off till the chap should leave."</p>
                  <p>Oh, burning, burning thoughts, that now in deadening blast swept through the
                     pale man's fevered brain; and yet speechless sat he there, trying to master the
                     flow of grief. The servant saw, but seemed not to notice it, for he, too, was
                     an American, and delicate in feeling; but he mistook the cause, and deemed him
                     a poor relative, who, by the marriage, must lose something of the old
                     bachelor's estate, and thus he tried to comfort him:</p>
                  <p>"But the Judge will never give them anything. The young man is rich enough. I
                     only wish I were a forty-second cousin to the Judge; his niece might go, for
                     the old man can be wheedled into the good graces of anybody who will try. A
                     thousand or two is nothing to him—only take him on the soft spots. A rich old
                     bachelor must be flattered; you must drink his wine, you must call him and all
                     he has the all that is worth having. He, having never been caressed by a wife,
                     falls in love with you, and so gives you his money."</p>
                  <p>"Who is his niece to marry?" ventures now the stranger, with as much
                     indifference as he could master.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                  <p>—"The grandson of one of those would-be Virginian rulers, whose speech-making
                     and writing made his name notorious."</p>
                  <p>The stranger knew, for everybody knows that to this day it is a saying, "As
                     Jenkins says, notorious shall ever be the name of Jenkins, and the things that
                     Jenkins says."</p>
                  <p>So still they were, you could hear the ticking of a watch, as the servant paced
                     to and fro, as the stranger, speechless, sat there. But it must have an end,
                     and so, in time, this was concluded.</p>

                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>—"Sir, I am that Southern planter. My name is Wadsworth. The things you tell me
                     are more than I can bear, for I cannot weep like other men. I thought this lady
                     dead, but I am glad that it is not so. You seem to be a man of much discretion
                     and good feeling, and when you tell me she is to marry another, you almost
                     murder me with the sound of your voice. The man she is to marry is my
                     best-loved friend. Alas! so isolated I have lived, I never had many friends. My
                     life has been one continued scene of trial and deprivation on the ground of
                     affection. I have lived where, and by travelling from place to place, the fruit
                     of my love has had no recipient—till, alas, I crossed this beautiful flower! To
                     tell me that she was sent away, till I should leave, oh, what a dagger is in
                     thy words! Is my nature wrong? And are all the parts whereof I am made unsuited
                     to the world, that all persons do shun my love? Oh, tell me not that this is
                     so, or lo, in fell despair, I rend in pieces the earthly part that gains no
                     favor!"</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Tears came not, but, heaving high his breast, as one of noble spirit unfairly
                  tried, he much smothered and awhile in silence weighed the matter.</p>
               <p>"Say, my friend," he then resumed, "provide me a room adjoining the ballroom,
                  where I can view the evening's doings, but tell no one that I am there concealed.
                  I will see all this gaudy display, and see the marriage, and, if I deem it true
                  that she loves him, and he her, I will rejoice that I saw so good a wedding; and
                  on the morrow I will quit this city. Oh, fear not, sir; I have plenty of money,
                  though I am in rags. I have been confined in an obscure hospital, daily writing
                  letters to my friends the Judge and Jenkins, but, getting no answer, I did suspect
                  foul treatment; and so, having regained a little strength, I climbed over the
                  walls and ran away."</p>
               <p>Thus they struck a bargain, and the servant sent him to the room, to the pantry
                  where the scuttle window looks into the ballroom. Now, some servants betray
                  confidence and let their fellows know their bonds in trust; but this one was an
                  American.</p>
               <p>Peggy Vandorn, Vickey's aunt, was sick. The Judge had not courted her for a long
                  time, and she was heart-broken. The patent whalebone and straps did not work well
                  on so old a form. Her ribs got sore and lame. Gaiters did not well in place of
                  thick shoes; her feet were galled. The bosom pads had heated her, and her skin was
                  smarting with prickly heat. The false teeth and plumpers had stretched her mouth
                  so much that it was all cankered; and thus, in great pain, she denuded herself of
                  the things of fashion, and went to bed. She was sick. She got thin. She was thin
                  before, but now she got much thinner. She got so thin that her false teeth lost
                  their suction. She could not keep them in her mouth. She felt that they were a
                  useless expense. So were the pads and the whalebone. She and Vickey concluded to
                  take them all back—the whalebone and pads to the store, and the teeth to the
                  dentist—and try to get the money back. So they went, the poor old maid and the gay
                  young belle. But they failed to get the money back. So they told it—told how badly
                  they had been treated. Many people heard of it, heard of their foolish, penurious
                  conduct, and so they were laughed at. Only a few did not laugh. These were the
                  Judge's friends. The Judge was a good man, although he had many foolish
                  eccentricities. His friends resolved to cure and to prevent his foolish adventure.
                  Thus they conspired against him, to be his friend, for they leasoned and said to
                  one another, "This Edge family, however educated, and however kind and true, are
                  possessed with notions too low to ever pass long in good society unscathed.
                  Therefore we must prevent the marriage."</p>
               <p>On the morning of the day in mention, a carriage and pair of beautiful bays
                  approached the Jackson House, and was driven to the stables. The carriage was
                  mounted with pearl and silver, and the harness was studded with gold. No one
                  seemed to know whose they were. The driver would not tell, and it had no other
                  occupant. Every one supposed it was the Judge's and that, ere midnight, he
                  purposed bearing hence in it his young bride. The melancholy and non-committal
                  character of Vickey made many believe she was engaged.</p>
               <p>In a separate room some friends of the Judge now held counsel with the clerk—that
                  ever-mischievous clerk—and they told him Vickey did not want the Judge, but that
                  now was his time, to take her in the extremity of trouble, and she would elope and
                  marry him. And they pointed to the carriage, assuring him that they would make him
                  a present of that if he would thus cut out the Judge. The suspicious clerk feared
                  it was a trick—feared they did not own the carriage. They told him to encounter
                  Vickey during the fore-part of the evening, and that they would have the carriage
                  at the door, which he was to tell her was his own, and a present to her. Thus they
                  persuaded the clerk, and he in turn assured them.</p>
               <p>But at about that same hour of the day the Judge called on me to say that Vickey
                  had agreed to elope with him that night; that her father would undoubtedly oppose
                  the match, and she had herself proposed the elopement. The Judge was calm then. He
                  never seemed more calm. Thrice he took off his old silver spectacles, wiped and
                  readjusted them, and I knew by his earnestness to clear them of every speck of
                  dirt that he was at that time perfectly composed. Said I,</p>
               <p>"If it is your, will and hers, I am with you."</p>
               <p>Said he, "I have said."</p>
               <p>I then told him I thought a man of his wealth and position should not elope.</p>
               <p>"But, you see, she's under age," said he, "and, if I wait, she may back out.
                  Better strike while the iron's hot."</p>
               <p>To this we both agreed. I am sure it was a perfect understanding between us. He
                  did not say he had purchased the carriage, but he told me it was for that purpose,
                  and he asked me only to witness his departure, not to urge Vickey in any way, and
                  I was then to return into the ballroom and publicly announce the elopement. No
                  hour was set down, only it was agreed to be in the forepart of the evening. He
                  told me where they would drive to, who<pb n="162 (Illustration) -163"
                     xml:id="VAC6417-00000082"/>
                  <figure>
                     <head>"The old maid wouldn't wear her false teeth. She was taking them back to
                        the dentist."</head>
                  </figure> would marry them, and by whom I should send word to them of the effect
                  produced in the ballroom. We then talked over some matters in relation to myself
                  and his niece—matters that I do not care to have inserted in this history,
                  although I state that most of the newspaper accounts of this whole affair were
                  without truth, and were merely the guessings of those busy like penny-a-liners.
                  One thing, however, was true—that at about five o'clock I called on Lincoln and
                  invited him to be at the Jackson House at about eleven at night, and that I told
                  him that most of the officials in Washington were to make an informal call at that
                  hour at that place. I did not tell him to keep it secret, or to make believe, it
                  was an accidental call. But it is true, too, that, when I called on Lincoln, he
                  was eating a dish of mush and milk. It was then he told me of the story of the
                  log-rolling, which was no story at all. That is to say, as all Western men know,
                  at a large log-rolling the men frequently divide themselves into parties of six to
                  ten men. He was eating his mush and milk at the time, and he said the secession of
                  those States put him in mind of a log-rolling where the men got drunk, who,
                  instead of piling up the logs, divided themselves into groups for the purpose of
                  pulling them down. "Now," said he, "I am captain of this log-rolling, and I am not
                  drunk, nor can you make me drunk on mush and milk. I don't see any difference
                  between thirty-five drunken men at loggerheads—speaking of log-rolling—than I do
                  with thirty millions of people at war. There is just as much danger at a
                  log-rolling as there is here; and the position of the captain of the one and the
                  President of the other is exactly the same. Through my specs they are just the
                  same size. If those fellows at Charleston pull down our heaps, we'll knock them.
                  You see, the clearing is fenced, and the corn is sprouting, and whoever pulls down
                  the fence will let in stray cattle. Did you see Russel's letter—about the South
                  sighing for a foreign prince? By heavens! let them open the gap to foreign cattle,
                  the fur will fly!"</p>
               <p>He set down his bowl with firmness, and then shook his head good-humoredly.
                  "Jenkins," said he again, "I'll come to your wedding to-night; only don't keep me
                  waiting, for I must run the machine on double time for a while."</p>
               <p>I thanked him, and then left.</p>
               <p>Now it was arranged by Mr., Mrs., and Vickey Edge that the house should be opened
                  at exactly nine o'clock. The two former had, by degrees, come to the conclusion
                  that no one was to marry Vickey or the old maid, but they were resolved to make
                  this the greatest reception of the season, partly, no doubt, in spite, to show how
                  gorgeously they could do things. To do this effectually, a suitable line of
                  etiquette officers were appointed, to superintend the invitation cards, the dress,
                  the wine, the toasts, the music, and all things belonging to a magnificent
                  display. To Hon. James Hamilton was awarded the honor of devising the cards, which
                  for neatness were never surpassed in this country. The coat of arms, which were a
                  soapboiler, candle moulds, and railway, were so arranged that, at a casual glance,
                  you would call it the American eagle; but it had a deeper significance: for round
                  the edges, the name Edge was arrayed in gold and diamonds. The dresses for ladies
                  were optional with reference to material, but the trail was specified, and so were
                  the neck and the extent of lace. Gentlemen were to wear coats of either pure black
                  or pure blue, and must be either wool or silk, and not mixed. White gloves were to
                  be presented at the door. The music was to begin at fifteen minutes before eleven.
                  The wine had been left entirely to the Judge, to be provided as he saw proper.</p>
               <p>Now, as all persons are aware, a ball, a reception, a wedding, and a funeral are
                  always behind time; so, on this occasion, everything was two hours out of joint.
                  It was nine o'clock ere the Judge had ordered the barrels to be tapped. It was
                  half past nine before the house was lighted. A few carriages came, and the guests
                  also. One couple, a lady and gentleman, were seen to leave. No one knew who they
                  were. They entered the magnificent vehicle seen during the day, and were now gone.
                  In came the guests; the place was soon one sparkling scene of gold and diamonds;
                  but the lady Vickey, who gave the reception, came not in. Messengers were
                  despatched, to her room, which was locked, and from which often and often came the
                  answer, "Tell the guests I will soon come down." And so the guests were told, but
                  she came not. The committee waited at her door, but the same voice answered, "Tell
                  them I am coming this moment," and they went and told it. But the house was all in
                  confusion; it was looking like a farce. Informal introductions took place; the
                  time for music was now come, but what should be done? In the hall, through the
                  hall, out and in again went the Judge, his old silver spectacles stored high on
                  his forehead. Mr. and Mrs. Edge, arrayed in all their glory, were alike<pb
                     n="164-165 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6417-00000083"/> confounded at the
                  conduct of Vickey. To all their coaxing, to all their scolding, came that only
                  answer, "I'm coming in a few moments."</p>
               <p>But the guests could not wait; they must dance, and so they danced. But Edge
                  became passionate; he declared he would burst open the door if Vickey came not
                  forth. The door was opened. Vickey was not there, only a little girl she had hired
                  to repeat those words. To all their questions she was non-committal. She knew
                  nothing of the belle of the evening. Mr. Edge became enraged. "Give me the keys,"
                  said he. "Go, tell the clerk I want the keys. I'll search every room in the house.
                  Off! off!" He made everybody his servant. Everybody ran for the clerk, but no one
                  found him. The clerk was gone. Whisperings now went round, and rapidly, of the
                  elopement. Mr. Edge was astounded. Could his daughter elope with the clerk of a
                  hotel? Mrs. Edge knew there had been foul play. Their daughter had been forced
                  off. Thus they raved, and thus were the assembled guests astonished. The Judge
                  became agitated, but he remembered that it might all be a trick, and so he told
                  them all. "'Twas just as he once remarked to Daniel Webster: a young girl of
                  seventeen is a slippery thing—too slippery for a king. I'd never trust a girl of
                  seventeen."</p>
               <p>But now, as came the midnight hour, and merriment went on, in came a messenger,
                  and told us all that Vickey and the clerk were married, and that they craved
                  pardon and the right to return to their presence as man and wife. By deceit the
                  messenger was ordered to tell them to return, and all would be forgiven, and so he
                  left. Now, about this nour, when, in fact, were assembled there the highest
                  officers of state, even Lincoln and Scott, the sad announcement was made of the
                  beginning of the battle of Fort Sumter. Full particulars were expected in a few
                  minutes by Prescott himself, who was announced to have arrived in the city with
                  despatches to the President. Mixed, now, was the pleasure of the hour, and all
                  were horror-stricken. Yet the saddest part is not told.</p>
               <p>'In another part of the Jackson House, arrayed in snow-white lace, was the lady of
                  my choice, the dearest, purest, and yet the saddest fair one I ever knew. At eight
                  in the evening we were to have been married in the orange parlor, and to have
                  attended the reception soon after. At that early hour only a dim light was in the
                  hall. The guests of the affair were already waiting us, and I was awaiting the
                  approach of gentle Ann, when, in looking down the dim-like hall, and observing a
                  lady in white, I heard a violent scream, and saw her fall against the partition to
                  support herself. I rushed to the spot, and, turning to the gaze of her fixed eyes,
                  there beheld at the window the face of Wadsworth. Scarce could I move, and my head
                  was giddy from emotion. Fixed she was, and so was Wadsworth. I took her hand, and,
                  turning to him, exclaimed, "My God! Wadsworth, is that you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir!" he said, and burst into tears; but poor, gentle Ann could bear no more.
                  Even at my feet she sank down, and no syllable uttered. "Come!" said I to
                  Wadsworth, "come!" I could say no more. But he came, and we raised her up, and put
                  her on the hall sofa. I then left him with her, and ran to the orange parlor and
                  briefly told what had happened, and they were all sympathy and kindness, coming
                  even every one of them to where she lay. In a little while she revived, and looked
                  up, and recognized us, holding one of my hands and one of Wadsworth's. Said I to
                  him, and I took his other hand, "By the laws of Heaven this is your wife. We
                  thought you were dead, I renounce all claim to her, though, in so doing, I lose a
                  world. You are more noble, and she loves you more."</p>
               <p>Now, when I had thus spoken, the persons present were greatly surprised, for they
                  knew not of Wadsworth's love nor of hers; and when they beheld him in such evil
                  plight, so ragged, and so pale and sickly, they mistook him for a very common
                  person. But, though he was much overcome by the scene, he tremblingly replied,
                  even while the fair one, her face and eyes downcast, drooped between us:</p>
               <p>"Of all my life's bitterness this is the bitterest hour. Were it not wicked to
                  wish to die, I would so pray Heaven!"</p>
               <p>The clergyman, who was to have married us, then said.</p>
               <p>"God's will be done!"</p>
               <p>I then withdrew a pace and halted a moment, when thus Wadsworth explained:</p>
               <p>"Long have I been confined in a private hospital, but all my letters to friends
                  appear to have miscarried. I know not how I came to the hospital. I have been told
                  I was nearly killed by somebody, and thrown into the river. Somebody, rescued me
                  and put me in the hospital. Gradually my senses returned, and so, too, my strength
                  of body. At early dawn this morning I escaped from the hospital, and came
                  here.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6417-00000084"/>
               <p>I heard then that this lady was alive, and to be married this night. The man of
                  her choice was the best and truest friend I ever found. I wanted to see them both,
                  and then, when I knew they were married, I would depart forever. I am here for
                  that purpose, and I pray you, reverend sir, perform that service, even though by
                  it you be my death!"</p>
               <p>"As I live," said I, "that shall never be! I know you are both true and noble, and
                  so much I value your peace and happiness. I will forfeit mine own."</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clergyman.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Now Heaven witness, these are Nature's noblemen, and this silence of hers in
                     woman's greatest power. Say lady, which of the two is your choice?"</p>
                  <p>But all was silent; none of us knew what more to say. After a moment, however,
                     the clergyman spoke and said:</p>
                  <p>"Might it not be well to postpone the matter for a few days, till you have all
                     had time to consider the great importance it may have on your coming
                     lives?"</p>
                  <p>"No!" said Wadsworth. "No," said I; "this must be settled at once. This ennui
                     cannot, must not last."</p>
                  <p>Still she held to Wadsworth's hand, and the clergyman, seeing this, said,</p>
                  <p>"Is it your will and choice that, this man be your husband?" and she said,
                     "Yes!" The clergyman then said to Wadsworth, "Though informal it be to ask you
                     afterward, I now ask if you choose her for your wife." And he said, "I do!"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clergyman.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Then, in the name of God, I declare you married—man and wife!"</p>
                  <p>We then all went into the orange parlor, some of the ladies assisting gentle
                     Ann to walk; and when we were got inside, we called the Judge, and he came and
                     wished us all much happiness. Wine and cake was then served, and I am sure. I
                     never felt happier in my life. In a little while, however, the Judge and I
                     withdrew, both of us nearly distracted with the sudden and unexpected turn of
                     affairs. The Judge sympathized with me; told me, he feared I concealed the
                     grief I had within, and assured me over and over that it was the most
                     unaccountable. And as for himself, he said he never did, nor never would trust
                     a girl of seventeen.</p>
                  <p>While the guests were agitated over the news from Fort Sumter, in came Vickey
                     and the clerk, some of the Judge's friends having kept him entertained
                     elsewhere for fear of trouble.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Edge met Vickey at the door, and the clerk introduced her as his
                     wife.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Edge.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Your wife! You scoundrel! How dare you run off with my child? She's under age.
                     Girl, go you to your room! To-morrow we return to Ohio. You have disgraced the
                     name of Edge. Ungrateful girl!"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clerk.—</speaker>
                  <p>"You sent word that you would acknowledge the marriage, and forgive us."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Edge.—</speaker>
                  <p>"I did not, nor do I now."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Edge.</speaker>
                  <p>—"I am bewildered with shame!"</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clerk.—</speaker>
                  <p>"But we are married; I can claim and hold her."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Edge.—</speaker>
                  <p>"And if I portion her only one dollar, you would not have her. I am master of
                     my own house. Go to your room, daughter; and see you, sir, only one condition
                     will change my will. After one year of penitence, if she wants you, it shall so
                     be; but if not, this marriage shall be null and void."</p>
                  <p>He then marched off with his daughter, but the clerk followed also. Now it was
                     soon after this that I met the Judge, and, as before stated, heard him say,
                     "The girl of seventeen is a slippery thing," etc.; and it now became my turn to
                     offer him sympathy, but he repudiated it. "I tell you," he said, "the whole
                     thing was a joke on my part. I would have showed you the whole plan of it, but
                     thought I'd better only make the assumption. Oh, no; the clerk owes it all to
                     me." Hereupon the guests began to smile, but were interrupted by the entrance
                     of the vigilants, who immediately told Lincoln that the secession Judge had
                     liberated Madame Ponchard and Orsini, and that they would soon be here.</p>
                  <p>"You see," said Lincoln, "I must declare martial law."</p>
                  <p>But before another word was spoken, came Madame Ponchard and Orsini. Wadsworth
                     stepped forward and laid hands on Orsini, saying, "Murderer! 'Twas you who
                     tried to murder me."</p>
                  <p>Orsini withdrew a pace, and Madame Ponchard sprang in between them.</p>
                  <p>Wadsworth started and gazed in astonishment, exclaiming, "Good Heavens! my
                     stepmother."</p>
                  <p>Quicker than it can be told, there was now a flash from a pistol in Orsini's
                     hand. Many men rushed forward, and Madame Ponchard and Orsini were in an
                     instant ejected from the house. The excitement was now at the highest pitch.
                     The evening's entertainment was spoiled, and we were all about to disperse in
                     confusion, when who should come in but Prescott.</p>
                  <p>"Ha, Prescott," said Lincoln, and he and Scott drew near. "What of the battle
                     of Fort Sumter! Out with it at once."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prescott.—</speaker>
                  <p>"Oh, sir, it is true indeed.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Twenty thousand rebels fought and beat seventy-five soldiers. Even at the dawn of
                  day their batteries burst forth, to try the nation's power. On Sumter's parapet
                  like hail the fifty-pounders fell, all red with the fire-lighted dust as the
                  crumbling wall gave way. The Union men long remained in silence beneath the
                  certain ruin; but when Canning's Point and Mount Pleasant shot forth their
                  deadening thunders, our brave men came forth and answered to the battle. Anderson
                  first, and, in support, Snyder and Doubleday, and next the three-and-seventy men.
                  Each as a target stood, each for safety midst the fiery balls and bursting shells
                  his trust had placed in Almighty God! Now toiling at the huge cannon, sweating and
                  faint with toil, those few men the whole nation's battle fought. Beneath them,
                  behind them, all around them was an ocean of powder, and over it and through it
                  fired the rebels their red-hot shot, and it burned not. The floating battery, the
                  forts around, and the far-off batteries, thus for six-and-thirty hours, all day
                  and all night, the roar of battle held; while, suffocating with smoke, and all the
                  woodwork of Sumter on fire, our men, muffled in wet cloths, still to their
                  dangerous call stood forth. But on the far-off places around was the most
                  sickening sight of all. Ladies sat on the housetops and on the distant hills,
                  exultant at the unequal battle, waving their fairy-like hands at the prospect of
                  blood! Thus fought our men, till all things round them were shot away or on fire,
                  and then the rebels came and took the Fort. Even Wigfall, who much had boasted in
                  Congress of what he could do, now came and tore down the nation's flag." Thus
                  ended Prescott's story, and Scott burst into tears. Lincoln turned quite round,
                  saying, "As you say, General, we'll try if we can fight. Call me out seventy-five
                  thousand men!"</p>
