BOSTON: TICKNOR AND FIELDS, 1867.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7785-00000002"/> Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1866, by TICKNOR AND FIELDS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts.'   UNIVERSITY PRESS: WELCH, BIGELOW, &amp;' CO., CAMBRIDGE.    PREFACE. WHEN Congress was suddenly called on to de- vise ways and means for carrying on the recent war for the preservation of the Union, it was graciously pleased to exempt from taxation the incomes of the humble class to which I then belonged. It permitted us to receive six hundred a year without taxation, charging us only on the sur- plus. This exemption included the large body of citi- zens who lived on small salaries, clerks in offices and stores, mechanics, laborers, and women whose incomes "from rents, .interest, or dividends were just sufficient to enable them to live. It was a wise and just concession to the necessities of numerous classes, upon whom great burdens were' about to fall. It was foreseen by those. who thus conceded this exemption that, while the prices of all commodities would inevitably rise, there were multi- tudes of small incomes which must necessarily remain stationary. The clerk, the mechanic, and the laborer might in many cases receive an advance in wages that would equalize the advance in prices; but the wid- ows, the single women, together with the aged and in- firm, who lived on very moderate resources, would have no means whereby they could make up the differ- ence between low and high prices, and a tax of five per cent. Congress assumed that six hundred dollars a year would be sufficient for the maintenance of a family,  &#xD;<pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7785-00000003"/> iv         PREFA CE. and that all beyond that sum was practically a surplus which the receiver could-well afford to- have taxed. The people have assented to -this view of the case, and have patiently borne the burden of the most obnoxious tax ever imposed upon them. I do not know whether' any of the legislators who passed the law have ever tried the experiment of living on so small a sum; but, judging from the high saries they receive, their extravagant allowance for mileage, and the great additional sums which they last winter voted into their pockets, I am disposed, to think they never knew how hard it was to live, themselves, on the small allowance which they considered sufficient for us. But there were thousands who sought to make it enough.. In doing so they practised all those eco- nomic arts which, when -the times become hard, so many of us are compelled to adopt. However we may neglect them in seasons of prosperity, it is still wonderful how readily we resume them in seasons of scarcity. This faculty of adapting one's self to circum- stances seems to be peculiar to Americans. If quick and impulsive, they nevertheless display a flexibility of character peculiar to themselves. I have had my full share of opportunity for exhib- iting my power of adaptation, during the last four years. Some of my experiences are related in the following pages. I feel that they are brighter ones than have fallen to the lot of others. But all will acknowledge that nothing could have so taxed the in- genuity of a housekeeper as the effort to live respect- ably on six hundred a year.   CONTENTS. CHAPTER I.

Such was the salutation which greeted me as, in response to a ring at the bell, I opened the street door one morning, the speaker at the same time handing, me a large printed document. He was a small, dapper-looking fellow, quite civil in his address, but moving and talking like one who had a world of business to get through with. It is probable he had his full share,- as I noticed that he had in his hand a large bundle of documents exactly similar in appear- ance to that which-he had given to'me, while his coat- pockets were almost bursting with bundles of similar papers. The circumstance, anid the man, struck me as being novelties; so as he left the door and went down  the street, I leaned forward and- watched his motions. He knocked or rung at every door upon the street, said something in a hurried way,--no doubt the very words he had used to me,- and delivered one of the  &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC7785-00000006"/> 2  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. mysterious papers to -whoever responded to his sum- mons.  Nobody refused it, for it was not a quack almanac, the reading of which alone is enough to make one sick, nor a cure for some terrible species of human infirmity. I wondered at thus seeing all my neighbors so generously supplied, and felt quite sure 'that, whatever the good news might be, the whole town was in a fair way' of speedily learning all about ;it.  I 'My curiosity at what was going on in thestreet being thus gratified, I felt somewhat desirous of ascer- taining what the document contained, and, closing the door, retired to my little sitting-room, where I had been busily employed with needle and thread during the greater part of the' morning, endeavoring, as best I might, to mend up the tattered garinents that had come from the- weekly wash., I opened the mysteri- ous, legal-looking parcel, to see what it might contain of interest to myself. It was a printed schedule of searching questions, of an intensely personal nature,- so..personal that they-must have been considered downright impertinent and offensive, but for the offi- cial authority which was announced (perhaps by way of apology) at the very top of the page. As I had observed that the man had given' a simi- 'lar paper to each of my neighbors, I consoled myself by thinking that, instead of the insult being limited to ourselves, all the town was to be similarly outraged. Thus in some degree ssmoothing down my half-ruffled temper, I looked further into the contents of the inquisitorial document. At the head of the page were the words, "Internal Revenue,"  , Income Tax," &amp;c., and farther down came the before-mentioned interrogatories, beginning with such items as these:- "What was your income last year?" I , Have you any Real Estate " '"Have you any Stocks " "Has your wife any income?" &amp;c., &amp;c.   S IX VN DRED DOLLARS A EAR.        3 What, thought 1, ask me if I have an corner lots, or stocks, or any income! I knew that Arthur had an eight-by-ten in the ,' Sylvan Cemnetery," in which all of us wil! probably be some day buried, and that beyond this investment he was no more richly en- dowed than myself. All the stock that I possessed consisted of clothing and furniture, such as my own limited means had supplied when I was married. The considerate official whohad prepared this sched- ule had left a space at every query, in which the party addressed was expected to write out a minute reply, solemnly and. truly, under heavy penalties in case of delinquency or evasion. Nay, it must be sworn to, if required.  Such inquisition, thought I, may be for- midable to the wealthy, or to those who, without being rich, assume'to be so; but why need it. have any terrors for us              a  After this came a  list of taxablearticles contained in almost every house, suchas watches, musical instruments, 'siler plate; &amp;c.* of which we were also- to give a strict acchunt, and then, submitto the pre' scribed taxation  Well, in looking it all over, it did seem as if they had remembered even the minutest possession one might be supposed to  have; and I  must own to a certain feeling of satisfaction even in the conscious- ness of our poverty, for the idea of taxation is not a pleasant one, even for loyal citizens such as we have always been. As to silver, the schedule allowed us to have forty ounces, free of tax. But that item occasioned me no alarm.' What had we but the little cup which my father had given to baby when he found his name perpetuated in his grandson, and one or two dozen spoons of various sizes? Our' tea service and forks were merely plated ware, genteel and handsome though, for all that, and looking quite as well as the most pretentious silver. There were no very costly presents at my wedding, such as one hears of in  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7785-00000007"/> 4   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. fashionable life. Hence, as we had no profusion of plate, so we had none to be taxed. It may be some- times inconvenient to do without the one, but it is sur- prisingly consolatory to be able to escape the other. When my husband came home from his daily duties, I confess I did really dislike to show him this irritating and unwelcome paper; so I postponed it until we had finished our evening meal, and then drew it forth cautiously and laid it before him, saying, as I did so,- "See, Arthur, what a blessed thing it is to be poor." He glanced rapidly down the list, and, although it was the first year the income tax had been levied, yet he took in the whole sum and substance of its con- tents. I, not so well informed as he, watched his countenance anxiously, to read his feelings. I knew how very hard he labored for the little income we enjoyed, and how close was the economy practised in our household; and now to think of having new and greater taxes to pay seemed too bad for consideration, and altogether impossible to be borne. But, though closely watching his calm face as he read the docu- ment aloud, commenting upon every item as he went on, I discovered no indication of anxiety or distress. He laughed repeatedly at the idea of his owning pleasure yachts or carriages, - the idea of his being in receipt of rents, dividends, or interest. In fact, he made so merry over the affair as to quite reassure me, and make me satisfied that I had not entirely under- stood the matter. But the fact is, that anything like a legal document is apt to confuse and even to alarm a woman. Why, I can distinctly remember how my heart flattered when I first saw my own marriage certificate. Laying the schedule on the table, he turned to me, and, in a voice so cheerful that I remember its inspiriting tones even now, he said, - "Well, little wife, we need not distress ourselves,   SIX HUNDRED    DOLLARS A YEAR.    5 for our income is exempt; six hundred dollars are allowed us, you will observe, besides our house-rent,- and that is all we have, you know. True, there is your piano, but that will take only two dollars a year; a single performance on it by you, especially when you add the song, is worth that, -at least to me. Then our watches are silver, so they are exempt. I reckon we shall manage -our taxes well enough, with- out cheating Uncle Sam." I cannot describe what a relief it was to hear him speak so, for I had dwelt upon the alarming docu- ment during the entire day, and, strangely enough, had quite overlooked the exemption clause; so, for the- first time realizing the questionable comforts -of pov- erty, I grew contented, and thereby rich, on the small sum of six hundred a year. Of course it was but a moment's work to write in the appointed place, $2, for a piano. The paper was then. folded up and put in a safe placp, to await the Assessor's promised call. It was a firie October evening, not cool enough for a fire, but sufficiently comfortable to be seated around the lamp; with my husband stretching himself lazily in his easy-chair, to read the paper, while I undressed the baby, and prepared him for his night's repose. Occasionally Arthur would read aloud, when any interesting item came in his way; and when the infant had been disposed of in his crib, he was ready to lay the sheet aside altogether, for a quiet chat, in which, as it was Saturday night, we reviewed the week's experience, and discussed those little domestic arrange- mentsron which so much of the future was to depend. Happily, I was able to produce a clear and fair ac- e count of the household expenditure for the week ; I had it down in black and white. We had not gone beyond our allowance, small 'though it was, - to some too small to live upon respectably. Even to us, who were accustomed to the closest calculations and to constant self-denials, it was quite too limited to be entirely agreeable.           e  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7785-00000008"/> 6  SIX HUNDRED DOLLA RS A YEAR. Humble as was our position in the great world, we had a certain status to maintain. We must live in a respectable house, we must dress genteelly at least, and keep a servant too. To do all these, was now a heavy tax. Prices for everything were steadily rising, thus constantly encroaching on the fixed in- come which my husband received. Provisions and clothing were thus so high that, not- withstanding the recent addition of two hundred dol- lars to our former income, we still had but the old sum of six hundred a year to live upon. The land-, lord had doubled our rent, and from the scarcity of dwellings we had been forced to remain where we were, or give up housekeeping altogether. A host of applicants -stood waiting to secure our pleasant little home, if we should decide to give it up. But a careful calculation had convinced us that it was really cheaper to live as we were doing, than to board, besides being so much more comfortable in our own home, than we could possibly be if cramped up in one or two rooms of a boarding-house. Our residence was in a thriving manufacturing town, where my husband was employed in superintend- ing the machinery in one of the factories. His sal- ary of eight hundred a year was very small, but he hoped to win promotion by a close attention to his employer's interests. We had seen among our friends so many lamentable. instances of trying to become suddenly rich, many times by speculation, that we had wisely determined to be satisfied for the present with a bare competency, rather than come to grief through extravagance, or business ventures on a false capital. Of the dangers of the latter we had observed enough among our own circle of friends to check effectually all disposition to risk the present com- parative comfort for the prospect of an increase that might prove altogether illusory. Yet it required some heavy ballasting of the mind to resist the prev-   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A - EAR.       7 alent tendency for speculation. As prices for every- thing were going up, the merchants and traders who had bought low had no difficulty in selling out at a profit. We were in the midst of the-great Rebellion, and government was issuing vast quantities of paper money. No one could predict when these issues were to cease, nor to how large a figure they might reach. As money thus became plenty, so did business of  every description become active beyond all former precedent. There were customers in abundance for whatever could be manufactured. The government demand for army and navy stores absorbed enormous quantities of merchandise, and its competition with the community of consumers sent up prices still higher. Our own town came in for a share of this unexam- pled prosperity. It seemed to me that every one around us was suddenly becoming rich. We heard of neigh- bors quite as unobtrusive as ourselves having made fortunes by a single speculation, -some of them, to , who had not been noted for any particular smart- ness. Nothing more appeared to be needed to insure success than the mere courage to make the venture. Hence it was quite a trial for us to resist the preva- lent example of speculation, and to refrain'lm try- ing our hands at adding something substantial to our meagre capital. Where every one was apparently securing fortune by dealing in something, and that also without the use of much money to begin with, we could not see how it should be otherwise with us, if we could only muster nerve enough to venture in with others.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7785-00000009"/> CHAPTER II. TfE WSONS. SPECULATION. -- THE OIL FEVER. - GROWING, EXCITEMENT. - PRICES RISINO. - GOOD LUCK.- SWNDLING. -- DISAPPOINTMENTS. - GRIEF. ABAN  N the house adjoining us resided a young couple named Wilson, with whom we had lived on terms of intimacy for several years. Their income was a little larger than ours,- eight hundred dollars clear of house-rent. Yet I had never been able to discover much difference in our styles of living, or that they enjoyed many more comforts than ourselves. They were economi- cal and prudent, and, like us, kept out of debt. Mrs. Wilson may indeed have expended rather more on her dress than I did, but still she could not be called extravagant in her wardrobe. No doubt I should have done just as she did with their extra two hun- dred,-one is so apt to spend in proportion to his abundance. We often compared notes in housekeeping, and I confess that I picked up', many valuable hints and items of culinary knowledge from my neighbor. My husband and I had sometimes privately discussed their affairs, as most intimate friends do, and had come to the conclusion that Mr. Wilson must be sav- ing a little money, notwithstanding his small salary. She never said in so many words that they were making deposits in the Savings Bank, but she so often complained of the low rate of interest- it allowed - only five per cent--while government was paying seven-thirty, that I felt quite sure she   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.       9 must have a nest-egg of considerable size on deposit. If it were not so, I could not understand what differ- ence it could make to her whether government allows seven-thirty or not, nor why she should so frequently refer to the subject. Now, I have my full share of curiosity, and was several times on the point of saying that they must be depositing in the Savings Bank, but could not help remembering that, as she did not volunteer to gratify my curiosity, it would have been a breach .of good manners for me to be -more inquisitive. If the questions put to me by the fellow with the printed schedule had given me so much offence, though the law required him to ask them, it was quite reason- able to suppose that mere voluntary catechising of the same character would be equally disagreeable to others. But I felt persuaded that the Wilsons had money at interest. Well, one day our neighbor came home in unusu- ally good spirits, and told his wife that now he was on the high road to fortune,- he had bought two hundred shares of I( Oil " stock. A friend of his who ,had gone in on what -was called "the ground-floor," had let him into the ring at a merely nominal advance; and in a few days, or in a week or two, at furthest, he expected to realize a small- fortune by the investment. Though people lived fast in those days, and great prizes were being drawn continually in the lottery of fortune, all of which Mrs. Wilson well knew, yet a shade of uneasiness was apparent in her manner as she learned what her husband had been doing. So far they had rubbed along without dabbling in specu- lation, and she felt apprehensive of the result, knowing that they had nothing they could afford to lose. But all speculations are infatuating. Wilson made the matter right with her in a few moments. He ex- plained the particulars so clearly - about-as clearly as they had been explained to him - that she, woman like, confiding in her husband's judgment, assented to the \    .

The speculative contagion had taken such firm hold of her, and she was so thorough- ly persuaded that their luck was to be a golden one; that she could do no less than come into our house that very evening, and tell us all about it. She was really full to running over with oil. She spoke enthusiastically of " our company," - the "Pitte-ho-le- o-gumn Oil Company." -"But what a queer name it is," I observed. ,0," she replied, "a good name is everything, especially in oil. People remember a sonorous name like this; it -sounds well, and reads well in the pa- pers. My husband says that there are now so many oil companies that it has become difficult to find names for them. New ones are being formed every day; the stocks are all going up; people can't get enough of the shares, and immense fortunes are real- ized every week. My husband says that oil is to be- come a greater staple than cotton or coal. People are getting to use it for everything; he is half inclined to think they will take to drinking it some day." it They appear to swallow it pretty freely already," I replied. I was amazed at my neighbor's sudden enthusiasm \ on the subject, but was so ignorant of the whole mat- ter. that I could offer no- opinion as to her prospects, and contented myself with expressing warm hopes that her speculation might prove a success. But I could not avoid thinking that, if it were sometimes desirable to have a name so remarkable- that one would -be sure to remember it, there might be other occasions when a less conspicuous one would be preferable, - one that it would be easier to forget. Mrs. Wilson continued to run in daily for a week after this; she wished to keep me , posted up," she said. Most of her conversation was about the Pitte-ho-le-o-gum. She seemed to have fallen in   IXg HiNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. I         v love with the very name. Now and then she dwelt pleasantly on her brilliant future, and intimated what additions she intended to make to her already really comfortable household, when they had sold, and real- ized. Indeed, her confidences on these subjects be- came wonderfully free. On such friendly visits she generally brought her sewing, but when dilating upon Oil, and especially when referring to the Pitte-ho-le-o- gum, she became so excited that ithe work fell from her hands, -- her mind was running more on stocks and prices than on domestic duties. It was filled with "Castles in Spain," whose gorgeous walls, built by her own vivid fancy, were even now growing visible to her inner sight. Every evening, when Mr. Wilsion came home, his wife's first question was,-- "Well, dear, how are stocks?" . The answer, -  uniform for at least a week --, Go . ing up," sent a new thrill of joyful animation through every pulse of the infatuated wife, and confirmed the " brilliant hopes already awakened in her heart. Then she called for the evening paper which he  usually brought with him, and turning first to the stock list, she studied its report of sales with profound interest. In former times her eyes would have sought first the daily list of marriages and deaths. But these ever interesting announcements had lost their ancient charms. She cared little who married, or who died: it was which stock went up, how much, and to what extent it was selling. Thus her experience of excitement was fast becoming equal to that of a veteran at the stock board. I had never before encountered any other female speculator  than the market-woman, who bought eggs at two shillings a  dozen and  supplied them  to me at double that price. Occasionally she sold me a   bad egg, no doubt unconsciously; but then some one must have first sold it to her; as in the perpetual scramble after eggs, anything that has .  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7785-00000011"/> lz  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. a fair outside goes off without examination as to its real goodness. The furor of a female stock-speculator was an entire novelty. My husband and myself often talked over the unnatural interest which Mrs. Wilson manifested in such things, and he was not slow in predicting some kind of disappointment. It has been truly, said, that the constant dropping of water will wear away a stone. Now, as my heart had thus far developed no signs of petrifaction, it should not be matter of surprise that this incipient conversation touching stocks and prices, and vast profits out of comparatively 'nothing, should have some effect upon my mind. No one needed some ad- dition to his income more than Arthur, and if money were to be made thus easily, why should he not embark in speculation like others, and like them be successful? I felt the disposition to imitate Mrs. Wilson increasing; but as I did nothing without con- sulting my husband, all I could do was to sound him on the subject. I knew that, as a general thing, he had no faith in speculation, and also that he had not a dollar to spare; still- I ventured to ask him one evening, after we had listened to a rapturous setting forth from Mrs. Wilson of the astonishing advance in Pitte-ho-le-o-gum, how it would do for him to try his fortune, -, in a very small way," lest the suggestion for an extensive venture should discon- cert him. "What, borrow money to speculate with? You know I have none of my own.   No, Kitty, we are out of debt now, and I mean to keep so. Some- body. may make by these oil companies, I have no doubt, but somebody will surely lose. I don't exactly' understand how they can be gotten up so rapidly, ten new companies every day, with a million of capital to each. There is something behind the. curtain that we don't see; but, depend upon it, if it is ever lifted, we shall discover the worst kind of cheat- ing somewhere."   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.       3 Io was not so wholly imbued with my neighbor's in' fatuation as to urge the-matter after this decided expression- of my husband's opinion. The conversa- tion would have gone into another channel, had not our servant, Jane, at that moment entered the parlor with a paper in her hand, and, approaching Arthur; said that some one had thrown it in at the firont door She said, also, that she had heard of it before, and was going to buy some stock herself. "Buy stock?" inquired Arthur with the utmost astonishment, as he took the paper from the girl's hand.   a What do you mean, Jane?" "W  hy, sir, it is oil stock, and, it is only twenty- five cents a share. I have saved a hundred dollars, and Mrs. Wilson's girl is going to buy some, too We can double our money in a week,--Mrs; Wilson says so."              Ms   - Arthur sat up in his chair and read the paper aloud. It was a prospectus of the c Workingman's Beneficial Oil Comnpany "; capital, $ 500,000, divided into shares "at only twenty-five cents each, to enable working men and women to invest their small savings and realize the great profits which wealthy capitalists are now nonopolizing." "Well," said Arthur, when he had finished the reading, and looking over to me, where is this shamefully swindling game to end . As if it were not enough to draw in millions of money from those wh6 already had millions to lose, here is a trap to take in day-laborers and poor hired girls, and cheat them out of the-little sums they have been long years I accumulatingY! Jane, if you put a dollar into this olff company you will never see it again, depend upon that." He delivered this warning with so much energy that both myself and the girl were confounded. It is certain that such was the case with myself, while the other listener stood for a moment mute.  "Give your money to me, Jane, and I will buy for  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7785-00000012"/> " SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. you a governmenthond, where you will get the high- est rate of interest every six %months; and when you want your money back you can have it on an hour's notice. You will be getting married some of these days, and will need it all."  The girl hung down her head, blushing at the mat- rimonial intimation, but presently mustered courage enough to reply, "But people- say the government won't be able to pay its debts, and then I shall lose it." My husband was as much surprised as we had be- fore been by this unexpected answer of the simple girl. "Show me the money ,you now have,'? he de- manded; and she drew from her pocket a roll of greenbacks which she laid in his hand. "You consider these notes safe, I suppose?" he inquired. "O yes, sir," was the reply.  , Well, Jane," he rejoined, " these are government notes; if the government should break, and not be able to pay its bonds, these notes will be no better. They all stand or fall together. One is as good as the other, and both are better than all the oil stocks in the country. You will find that I am right, and that, while'one set of sharpers are cheating you in stocks, another set is trying to mislead you as to the gov- ernment securities." But Arthur's eloquence availed nothing. She had been bewitched by Mrs. Wilson's constant reference to the money to be made in oil; for, in the -absence of her husband during the day, the lady had, for lack of other auditors, conversed with her servant.- From the mistress the contagion thus spread to the domes- tic, from the latter to her lover, and from him to his friends among the laboring classes; until, stimulated by the constant publication in the newspapers of ex- aggerated accounts of great flowing wells, large divi- dends, and sudden fortunes acquired by' poor men, -one half of such statements being the production   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR.  ,5 of writers hired by speculators to prepare them, - the entire laboring community had become infected. with the prevailing mania. The small savings of this extensive class must be subsidized to swell the flood of speculation which now penetrated into every village throughout the land. The dupes who had paid their money received a finely engraved certificate, and there the matter ended.  No matter how   closely they studied the daily stock report, many of them saw no advance in their shares, nor did quarter-day bring them any dividends.  They had parted with their all, and the speculators had secured it, just as they had intended. How natural, then, that an ignorant girl like ours should be ripe for so specious a scheme as that of the "Workingman's Beneficial Oil Company."  It had been cunningly devised expressly for the swindling of such as she. I confess that I could not then she the trap in the clear light by which my husband viewed it, perhaps because of some little weakness of my own toward venturing in that direction, and was therefore a poor hand at persuading others to avoid what I had been half inclined to embrace myself. If my  hus- band's urgent reasoning with Jane was of so little avail, how was it possible for so weak an advocate as myself to be successful? So Jane invested her whole three years savings. in oil. The example of the par- lor had extended to the kitchen, as it often does; sometimes for good, but too often for evil. The public frenzy was now at its height. Mrs. Wilson could think of nothing but oil,. and, in- deed, rapid and unaccountable was the rise in the market value of this wonderful property. "And what will you do with all the money?"  inquired Arthur of Mr. Wilson.  He would have valued it, in his own case, chiefly as business capital. Reinvest, of course," was the ready answer, for the lucky speculator always plunges in after more. "It will again double itself in a few weeks." I  !   &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7785-00000013"/> I6   SIX HUNDRED DOL LARS A YEAR. But such tension of the mind as our neighbors had experienced must have relief. Wilson had bought the Pitte-ho-le-o-gum at a dollar a share, and now it had gone up to- five. This was his mark,--four hundred per cent profit, - and he sold out, securing a gain of eight hundred dollars on an investment of two hundred. We not only congratulated him on his good luck, but my husband, still unmoved by his suc- cess, suggested to him whether it would not be wise for him to retire with tis handsome profit from the ring. But Wilson was as impetuous as Arthur was :cool. In Ci few days he had invested both capital and profit in "( The Bottomless Well Company." A rare chance had been offered by a friend who was making up the company, and who would let him in on '( first princi- ples"; while all others were to be simply taken in. The prospectus was highly assuring, as it declared that oil had been struck within a mile of the (' Bot- tomless," while in the well then going down upon the latter property there were strong indications of a like result. ,Indications," said Wilson's friend to him, in a confidential way, after he had subscribed and paid his money, -" indications are about all we care for: good enough to get up a company on. The oil is not im- portant to us; that may come or not." Here was a strong intimation to Wilson of how things were managed by the projectors. It seemed that the production of oil was not essential to the formation of a company with a million capital, but that mere ",indications" were quite sufficient, so sharply did the greedy public bite at every new bait. But. in those days the hooks were gilded, and that on which the "Bottomless Well" was suspended glit- tered as brightly as the rest. All these days I could. not help reading the stock list in the morning paper, even more attentively, after seeing the success of our neighbors. I don't know   9* rSIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A PYEAR.      l7 to what lengtls I might have gone, had not my unim- pulsive husband been. ever ready' to keep me in the safe path of entire abstinence. But knowing that the Wilsons had gone into the "Bottomless," I felt inter- ested, at least for them. Ah!" said I one day, after reading the astonish- ing figures of a very active stock board, if we only had the means to try our fortunes! o-    '. "But we have not," replied Arthur. "Slow and sure, my dear, is the safest way to grow rich. We shall overtake some of these fast acquaintances before either you or they suppose." 1 knew-that he had nothing to ihvest, even if dis-  posed to do so, hence I could not reproach him for this. How could I forget that his daily earnings were barely enough  for our daily wants?  So, instead of a reproach, I kissed him tenderly, and forgot my regrets  In a fortnight after this we heard that the , Bot- tomless" had struck oil. A  telegram had been sent down  by the superintendent stating that the well was a flowing one, and was discharging a thousand barrels daily, with a prospect of its reaching fifteen hundred!  The good news circulated amongst the-- expectant hangers-on of the stock board, and up went the   ,Bottomless" from one dollar to ten. Wilson came home intensely jubilant, while his wife's excite- ment knew no bounds. The stock had cost him one dollar; his fortune was therefore actually made, and all from a beginning of two hundred dollars!- How small that sum  seemed in comparison with the ten thousand just within his reach. Of course he told of his good luck. "Better sell out at once, Wilson," advised my hus- band. "Not until it touches twelve," was the reply;, " that is my mark, although it will go beyond that." But events travelled fast in those days. The next evening Wilson came home in very different h- ive difrnha  *    .    :  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7785-00000014"/> r8  SrX 4UNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. mor. Though all that morning the "Bottomless" had been rampant at the board, the stocks chang- ing hands in immense lots, yet about noon a rumor obtained currency that. the superintendent's despatch was a hoax,- the "Bottomless " had, not struck oil. The sales immediately slackened, the price fell off, speculators became shyi and down went the shares to the- subscription price of a dollar. But the lie, had answered the purpose for which it was devised, by enabling those in the secret to "unload," that is, to shift their stock into other hands at great profit to themselves. Wilson's confidential friend had for- gotten to let him into this important part of the game, as, while the latter worked off his own stock at a high figure, Wilson had not parted with a single share. He might have turned his thousand dollars into ten thousand; but that was not enough,--he must have twelve. The disappointment to him and his wife was terri- ble. All her air-castles had vanished. They were perpetually regretting their mistake of refusing to sell. They now saw that-.it would be wise to satisfy themselves with a much smaller profit, and resolved to modify their aspirations in the future. But the ("Bottomless Well" never recovered from the effects of this deceptive telegram. It stood for a while at the original price, a dollar, then ceased Ito be re- ported in the stock list, and subsequently disappeared entirely. It had "gone under." Wilson's capital and profits had disappeared together. The bottom had dropped out of what was/ really and truly the "Bottomless." But if shrewd, intelligent people like our neighbors were to be thus readily imposed upon, what was to prevent the ignorant servant-girls, and working- men frommbeing stripped of everything? In the case6 of Jane, the result was just as my husband had predieted. Her little pile of a hundred dollars had been sucked into the great vortex of "The Working-   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.      1 man's Beneficial," and it was affecting to hear the poor girl's regrets over her folly. She would be glad enough now to have a government bond in place of the swindling "Beneficial," which, during its whole career, had never reached the dignity of a quo- tation in the stock list. Our unlucky neighbors came by degrees to -bear their disappointment with commendable equanimity. I have since ascertained that my suspicion of a de- posit in the savings fund was correct. The two jhundred dollars with which their first oil purchase was made had been their accumulated savings for two years. She would have been quite satisfied' with five per cent now,-the grief was that even that had taken wings and disappeared beyond reach. There must be many who can not only remember these incidents of the gambling era which has so recently passed away, but who have been even more completely impoverished than either Wilson or the servant-girls. There are pecuniary wrecks of every description as consequences of the mighty oil swin- dle. There are widows now beggared by those atro- cious robberies, business-men who have been deeply embarrassed by them, and a miscellaneous multi- tude from whom. millions of dollars have been thus dishonestly taken. I can now appreciate my hua- band's cautious prudence, at a time when even older heads were turned by this extraordinary infatuation. Where should we now be, if he had gone in debt to speculate in oil? /  -   *           *'     s  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7785-00000015"/> CIIAPTER III., THE TAX-GATHERER AGAIN.- HOUS, AD FURNITURE. -- OIJR GAR- DENi-ITS PLEASURES AND ITS PROFITS.- MAKING WiNrE. '  F'- N a few days, punctual to his word, the dap- per little Internal Revenue man called for Mfl, his paper, and found it all ready. I think he was rather surprised to find there was so little due from is, for he looked inquiringly around the parlor, and remarked how comfortably we were fixed. "Have you no more than six hundred a year, madam?" he asked, incredulously. "Only six hundred besides opuse-rent, which is two hundred more," I answered, thinking him very im- pertinent.  ' I do not mean to doubt your word at all," he 'said, apologetically. "You have a pleasant situation here." said, "' Yes," mechanically, for I was afraid he had some designs upon our house, -perhaps was looking for one himself; and so nervous did the idea make me that I was much relieved when he had taken his departure.  As soon as Arthur came home in the evening, I told him my fears, and we discussed the propriety of at once forestalling the man, .in case such was his object, by applying for a five years' lease on our little louse. My husband approved of the plan, so before bedtimne he had called on the landlord, and secured our right for the above-mentioned term.   SIX HUNDRED    DOLLARS Al YEAR.   zI Our house was a pleasant, snug-little affair,- with a cosey parlor and dining-room back, a large kitchen, and a shed for wash-house and summer cooking. Up stpirs were three good chambers in the second story, with bath, and two attics above. The house was comfortably furnished, for I had bought the furniture myself at the time of my marriage, with a legacy of seven hundred -dollars left me by the aunt in whose honor I was named. But for that, we should have been poorly off; for Arthur had little to spare when we began life, and my own father had too large a family depending on him to give much to set out his oldest daughter. A good supply of clothing was therefore the most I could expect from him; and the generous good-   - will with which he gave me that-was as much as many dollars given grudgingly.  Fortunately, at the time of our going to housekeeping the prices of such things were moderate, and I furnished my house entirely with the sum  I have named. My piano, I should mention, had been used for a short time befdre I bought it, and was really worth much more than it cost me. I have only to refer to my bills to tell just what were the items.

This left me just $ 41.50 for table-linen, sheets, pil- low-cases, and towels; which was little enough, it --is true, but as muslin was cheap ,then, it bought me a dozen sheets, a dozen pillow-cases, five table-cloths, a dozen napkins, a dozen fine huckaback towels, a dozen crash ones for kitchen use, and left me some twelve dollars for sundry knicknacks, such as brushes and combs, waiters, dust-brushes, and lamps. So, when everything was arranged in its proper place, our house was indeed a model of comfort and convenience. Then there was the garden outside, which, if it Added somewhat to our labor, contributed very ma- terially to our comfort also. It was not large, - cer- tainly not more than an eighth of an acre, -yet we managed to cultivate it without a dollar's hiring. All but the few shillings'.worth of seed, and an occasional barrow-load of manure, was therefore clear gain. Down on each side, and quite around the lot, was a row of currant-bushes, which, after the first season, produced splendidly. The few original plants that we found there were large, spreading ones, with much dead wood, and the majority of new stalks were with- out fruit. They had grown undisturbed for years, and contained enough to plant around the entire margin. Early in the spring, before the leaf-buds had opened, my husband dug them up, one at a time, undertaking only so much as he could finish up each day, in the   SIX HUNDRED    DOLLARS/ A YEAR.  23 hour before breakfast that he' had determined to devote to this w6rk. The ground next the fence had first been ,well spaded up and levelled, and each large bush when taken up was separated into ten or fifteen pieces, every one having good and healthy fibrous roots. These were at once set out at a distance of three feet apart, before they had had time to wither. Thus, after a' few mornings' work, we had our/ whole garden hedged around with currant-bushes/ which seemed to occupy no room at all, and soon blossomed -forth with great luxuriance. That year's crop was not so large, because the smaller plants did not bear at all; but-by the second season they were very full, and hung in long crimson clusters from every stalk., The remainder of the ground we planted with vegetables, as follows: an onion-bed, which, from three quarts of sets, costing twenty-one cents, pro- duced us over a bushel of fine onions; string-beans, anrid Lima beans; a few tomato-plants which I pur- chased from a gardener at three cents each, and which came into bearing very early. The first six tomatoes / produced me thirty cents, and the green-grocer gladly took them in exchange for other things of that value. The next six brought twenty-five cents, and the next twenty-five cents the quarter peck. All together, we sold a dollar and thirty cents' worth, which more than paid the whole cost of ourseeds, plants, and bean- ' poles, and after that we enjoyed the rest of them ourselves, having them for breakfast, dinner, or tea every day during the season. All this ,Was from ten plants. Besides thpse, we had a few egg-plants, which produced well; t/vo or three cucumber-vines, which furnished us pickles, almost enough to last during the year, having at hand in the cellar a tub of brine, into which they were put every day as they were gathered. Our nice beds of salad, parsley, thyme, sweet marjoram, summer-savory, and sage, especially the herbs, were a great source of comfort during the entire year. At the proper season we cut and dried them for winter *}  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7785-00000017"/> 24  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. use, and I was thus not. only provided myself with the means for making many savory dishes, but was often able to accommodate my less fortunate .and provident neighbors. When the currants were ripe, I made enough jelly to answer our requirements, and then from the rest I made both wine and shrub, - the latter a cooling and refreshing beverage for the hot weather, and, indeed, for any season. My five gallons of wine were of the best quality, clear and beautiful; and as others who read my book may wish to' know how to do the same, I here give the recipe by which I have made it; every year without failure. To MAKE CUTRRANT WINE. Take ripe currants; mash them well, either with the hands or some broad wooden, spoon; then strain the juice through a strong 'bag. Have your cask measured, and allow one third of its contents to be purer juice. As soon as the juice is measured put it, into the cask, which must now be placed in a firm position in- the cellar, with spigot previously provided, so that it may be drawn off without having to move the cask. For every gallon that the cask will hold allow two and three quarter pounds of brown sugar, and, dissolve it in a bucket of water, stirring well; then pour this into the cask, and- add more water to the sugar remaining in the bucket, until all of it is in the cask; then fill up with water to the bung and leave it open. for ten days to ferment. On the tenth day remove from around -the bung-hole all the froth that has collected, using the little finger to reach that inside; then add to a five or six gallon cask? a half- teacupful of good brandy or whiskey, and i'mmedi- ately put in the bung pretty tightly. In a day or two pound -it in securely, and let the cask remain undis- turbed until the first of January, when it may be quietly racked off, and .will be found perfectly clear until the sediment in the bottom is reached. Like all ,?.   SIX H UNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. other wine, it improves with age; and, although when first drawn it is of a light-red color, it will soon ac. quire a rich wine tint. In making all kinds of wine care must be taken- to have the cask perfectly sweet, or the wine will be likely to be sour. If it should smell sour, or doubt- ful, it would be best to have it soaking for a few days beforehand, with a little washing-soda dissolved in the water, rinsing it well before using. Old 'casks are more desirable than new ones, as the first time they are used the wine is apt to taste of the wood.' Always on New-Year's day, or as near that time as convenient,'I drew it off by means of the spigot in- serted in the end of the cask, and then immediately bottled it for use. Every one who saw or tasted my wine praised its beautiful color and fine flavor, and after a year or two keeping it acquired the rich tint that belongs to rarer varieties. Thus we always had wine in the house, whether for our friends or ourselves, for cooking or for sickness, and never indulged in any other sort. The shrub was made by straining the currant-juice, adding to every three pints of it one pound of white sugar-; boil it about fifteen minutes, skimming it well; then when cool add a teacupful of good brandy for every pint of syrup. Bottle it, and cork tightly, A little of this shrub poured into a glass of ice-water makes a  most agreeable drink. Around the door and all about the house were nice grass-plots and flower-beds, these last being my own especial charge. During the first two years after my marriage I  spent much time in sowing, transplanting, and weeding my pretty parterres, and was richly repaid for all my pains in their gay appearance, and the never-failing bouquet, they furnished for my parlor. Even in later years, when my hands were busy with nursing baby, .I still found a little time to use my garden tools; -and- in the morning I had but to take  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7785-00000018"/> z6   SIX'HUNDRED DOLL ARS A YEAR. the little fellow out in his coach, and place him under the shade of a tree close at hand, where he could watch me pull up the weeds, and crow his approbation, until the task was accomplished. I think I have clearly demonstrated that a house with even such a strip of garden room as ours is worth far more than one without it. Yet considerable management is necessary in order to prevent it from becoming a positive expense rather than a profit. My husband loved the care of- a garden, and those early morning hours which he gave to the work were positively the pleasantest of the day. It was wonderful to see how his appetite for break- fast increased by the healthful exercise they gave him, J-is regular business was of a very different kind, so this variety was therefore the more agreeable; besides, as the plants grew and flourished, and bore fruit, only those who have done as he did can understand how well he was repaid for all his toil. That the vegeta-' bles tasted better than those we bought was no mere conceit, for they -were ripe and fresh, and therefore good and wholesome. But if, on the otherhand, we had hired our garden' cultivated, and paid for the work by the day, the cost would have far exceeded the profit, and one of the chief pleasures of our humble home would have been lost to us. . :    w        ' , 'I   CHAPTER IV. BESINNING TO KEEP HOUSE.--GOOD MANAGEMENT. -- COST O "VING. - CLOTHNG. -i BUYING BARGAINS. E HEN  we undertook to keep house on the small income of six hundred a year, i knew  that it would require the strictest economy in order to make our expenses come within that sum, and so, from the beginning, I kept a close account of everything we bought. At starting we had this advantage,--and I mention it here for the benefit of the great family of young housekeepers who, like ourselves, must make the most of a  little, Arthur had saved a hundred dollars before we were married, and with this little capital he laid in the following supplies to begin with: a barrel of light-brown sugar, five tons of coal, a pot of lard, ten bushels of winter potatoes, a box of brown soap, and a firkin of good butter. With these supplies we were able to start fairly, and, by my good manage- ment, I contrived to keep ahead. I soon ascertained that we were able to consume about two pounds of sugar a week, and in my weekly settlements I was careful to charge myself with that amount; alsofor the potatoes and other articles; these sums being laid aside, week by week, until, when the original supplies were exhausted, I had enough saved to buy more. By thus purchasing by whole- sale I  saved many dollars, in the year's expenses. But the accounts must be kept, and these amounts reserved, just as conscientiously as if the articles had  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7785-00000019"/> 28  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. been purchased every week; else this plan of whole- sale supply will prove a positive disadvantage to the housekeeper, by creating the impression that there is a surplus of money in the treasury. In the beginning I laid the following plans, which at once furnished me with the key to my future l operations. The house-rent -was reserved first, and  that left me just $ 600, which, divided by fifty-two, gave me $ 11.54 for my weekly expenses   . Our coal for the year-- five tons,'at $ 7 each - cost $ 35, or a fraction over sixty-seven cents a week; -and this also I deducted and laid aside, together with the other reserves, for sugar, potatoes, butter, lard, and soap. We had laid in ten bushels of potatoes at fifty cents per bushel, and as we used but one peck a week, they cost only twelve and a half cents.  The lard, in these hard times, had cost eighteen cents a pound, and we used, on an average, a half-pound every week; this was nine cents more. Then the butter -three -pounds at thirty cents -came to ninety cents; brown soap cost ten cents, and about three quarters of a pound sufficed for all the wants of the week, includ- ing washing.  I know I saved at least a quarter pound of soap each week by my plan of always cut- ting up a large quantity of it into pieces- of conven- ient size, and spreading them out in the attic to harden well. A piece of soap thus hardened will not melt away in hot water as rapidly as a freshy cut one is sure to do. Well, by the time I had prepared my list of weekly expenses it stood somewhat as follows:- * At the date of which we are writing, when we really began our housekeeping, - -1860,- prices'of provisions were not quite so high as we have here stated ; but by the time we came to lay in our second or third supplies they had risen much higher. Intend- ing these rules to be some guide even in these times, we have therefore given prices to correspond more nearly with subsequent and present rates, taking a medium between the lowest former prices and the extremes which prevailed during the war. q 4          *'    SIX HUNDRED DOLLTARS A YEAR.        29 Coal  .   .  .   .  .  .  . $ 0.67 Potatoes . .  .  .  .  .  ..

Allowing seventy-three cents of this every week for extras that might be needed in the house, we had at least $125 per annum for our clothing; and with careful man- agement we were able to dress ourselves very genteel- ly on that Amount.  For myself, a few good dresses were better than many poor ones, and I have always found it the cheapest to buy good material, even if the first cost is rather\greater, than to get a coarse or thin article, which will last but a single season. I do not mean by this, however, that I bought expensive or extravagant dresses, or showy or costly shawls and cloaks. One dress of a season, of alpaca, cashmere, or all-wool delaine, cost about $ 12, including mak- ing and trimming; for I could sew it entirely myself, merely pta:ing a dressmaker to cut and fit it for me, at a cost of twenty-five cents. For summer, a nice barege, or some similar mate- rial, could be had for about $ 6, and a calico for $ 2 a  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7785-00000020"/> 30  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS 4 YEAR. more. Cloaks and shawls were heavier articles, and therefore but one such item could be indulged in each year, But even for a winter cloak I could buy the materials, of fine, good cloth, for $ 10, and with a paper pattern by which to cut it out, I could make it and trim it as well as a regular cloakmaker, although I had never learned the trade. Then if the fashions changed, I was able to alter or refit it so as to insure its looking well for at least five years. Another year I would spend about the same sum for a shawl or mantilla, and, once in two or three years, a new silk dress. As for bonnets, on which so many ladies expend such large sums, I was able myself to manufacture as pretty a one as I cared to wear. The materials for a bonnet cost but a trifle compared with the price asked in the milliners' shops for the manu- factured articles; so when the season came round for a new bonnet, I generally paid a visit to the city and took a survey of the various styles on exhibition in the windows and glass cases at the shop doors, made my selection, and thentirchased my frame, ribbons, flowers, &amp;c., accordingly. A few seasons' experience had enabled me to judge pretty accurately of the quantity required for any particular shape or style, and I could always work up my old material, and make over the last sea son's'bonnet so as to look as well as new. Very often a handsome silk or velvet bonnet was produced in this way, for three or four dollars, which could not have been bought for less than twenty at the stores. I had a large box into which I always put the odds and ends of bonnet ma- terials, so, as the fashion was continually varying, I was constantly able to bring out of my treasure-house new combinations of silk and lace and velvet, which the world at large would have supposed were al- together new. To me, the consciousness that I had done well, and with so little outlay, added greatly to ,the satisfaction Hfelt in wearing my new bonnets. The numerous little items of shoes and stockings, /     SIX H UNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR,      31 of gloves, collars, pocket-handkerchiefs; &amp;c., were all brought within our necessary limit, although I am free to confess that there were many of those tempting things called bargains which I was obliged to pass by. My husband often rallied me with my passion for buy- ing these bargains; but if I did occasionally indulge my propensity, he was always forced to admit the wisdom of my purchase, and would have been even more unwilling than myself to part with it again. One day I attended an auction sale of furniture, held in the neighborhood, with the intention of pro- curing one or two trifling articles of kitchen ware that were needed. Many of my friends were there also,--it was quite fashionable to go to auctions in our town, - and I walked through the house to see what was to be sold. In one of the upper rooms hung a large mirror, with a very shabby gilt frame, -not broken at all,--but only discolored, and al- most bare of gilding. It had evidently been exposed to flies, as well as to careless management, for many years. I saw at a glance that it was a valuable glass, but it did not enter my mind to bid on it for myself until I heard the auctioneer crying it off at the paltry sum of one dollar and ninety-five cents.- Waiting just a second, to hear some one bid higher before it was sacrificed It that price, his eye sudden- ly rested on my face, and almost without a thought of obtaining the prize, I gave him a nod which indeed secured it for me at the low rate of two dollars. I was as much surprised as any one there, for when I left home, I had not dreamed of making such a purchase.       -     Well, it required but a few moments to have it removed to our own house; but before I had been at home ten minutes, a friend who had heard of my'bar- gain called to offer me double the price, if I were dis- posed to sell. I did not decline the offer then, but promised to let her know the next day, as I had some experiments to be tried first, which I was in haste to  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7785-00000021"/> yz SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. begin. On receiving the glass at home I had had it carried into the parlor, where it was to remain until dinner was over, and Arthur had gone back to the factory. I especially desired that he should not see it until I had exercised my ingenuity upon its time- worn frame. As usual, he did not go into the parlor at all, but went out again immediately after dinner; ,and fobr that once, at least, I was glad to see him depart. Then began my work of renovating the shabby frame. It was indeed beautifully ornamented with scroll-work, and other designs, only that the whole was changed by careless washings to a general whitey- black appearance, which was anything but handsome. It was but a few moments' work to wash and wipe carefully the dust from every part of it. Then with a brush I laid on the brown varnish paint, such as cabinet-makers use for staining wood in imitation of walnut or rosewood. Working it well into all the cracks and corners of the frame, I soon covered up all the shabby gilding, and changed the whole ap- pearance of the thing. I know it did not look hand- somer, even in the days of its primeval grandeur, than it did when I had finished those simple artistic touches. I kept the parlor door closely shut in order to prevent the odor of paint from escaping to tell my secret, for I had determined, if possible, to surprise my husband with a first sight of the new mirror after it- had been hung. I knew thati it vould look so much handsomer when it should be in its place between the parlor windows. As it was summer- time, and flies were plenty, I had a good excuse for proposing that we should sit on the pleasant piazza, instead of opening the parlor, and in the evening we went out to make a few visits, which occupied the hours until bedtime. Thus my secret was unsus- pected that night. the assistance  Next .morning, with the assistance of my girl, and   SIX HUN;DRED DOLLARS A YEAR.      33 a borrowed step-ladder, I managed to hang up my new mirror with its carved rosewood frame, and I could not have imagined' the good effect of such an addition to our parlor furniture. It not only looked .. well itself, but everything else looked better in its company. . In a word, I was delighted with my bar- gain, and was now as impatient to let Arthur see it as I had been to prevent his doing so. I was singing one of his favorite songs, when I heard his latch-key in the street door, and I knew he would be sure to come at once into the parlor, so I only turned-around to see him enter. He was in the act of crossing the room, when he caught a glimpse- of his own image reflected in the glass, and turning around almost involuntarily, he saw the new mirror, and stopped in amazement before it. i( Why, what have we here?" he exclaimed, look- ing into my conscious face. ,(How did this come about?" ( I bought it, my dear. Don't you think it hand- some?"I answered, cautiously, for I knew what he would say next. it Very handsome indeed; but, Kitty, do you think it was right to buy anything like this until we can af- ford it better?" He said this reproachfully, but I knew how to an- swer him, so rejoined, "Why, how much do you sup- pose it cost?" ( I cannot well guess; but some -twenty-five or thirty dollars I suppose,: these rosewood frames are quite expensive." (t Well, my. dear Arthur, it sonly cost us two dollars and -twenty-five cents all together, and I am offered double that already if we choose to sell it. But it shall be just as you decide." He looked incredulously at me, but there was the auctioneer's bill and receipt for the two dollars. The other twenty-five cents were for the paint and porter- age. 3 / '        . \  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7785-00000022"/> 34  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YrA. ,( Well, little wife, you are a rarei hand for bar- gains; but I guess we'll keep this one ourselves and not let Mrs. L. have it." I had privately resolved to save the cost of my purchase by doing without some equPivlcnt item of my own wardrobe, and so I did; but tot fat more satisfactionin my looking-glass than I could have de- rived from the articles dispensed with. After this, whenever my husband would laugh at mnly propensity for "t bargains," I had only to quote this case to turn the joke on the other side.   3 It must not ie supposed, however, that I often indulged in such episodes, nor tad I the means to launch out into those expensiye and attractive items hich more favored housekeepers might hae secured. I knew that, not only was our incoe limited, but that our house was smnall and plain also, and I would have considered it quite out of taste to have in my little parlor anything too costly or pretentious to correspond with my other furniture.  I was, however, very fond of fany-work, and too great delight in making various little articles that came under this name, all of which tended to beau- tify our little home, and render it still more charming in our partial eyes.    CHAP-TER V. EARLY RISING. - FANCY-WORK. - PICTURE-FRAMES. - HANGING- SHELVES. -BRACKETS.-SOMETHNG REALLY USEFUL.-HOW TO MAKE A WORK-TABLE.--MY NEIGHBOeB S WORK. URING the first two years of my married life, I had considerable leisure time. I had a good servant who wassable to do the whole work of my house, excepting only such trifling portions as I chose to do myself. Every morning we rose earty, and thus I gained one or two extra hours each day, which amounted to about four- teen hours in the week, or nearly an extra day. Be- sides, these early hours, when one feels fresh and ready for work, are worth much more than the same time at the close of the day. I am sure, too, that' our regular hours, rising at six, and retiring about ten o'clock, conduced in no small degree to our health, and although, of a cold morning it was some- times hard to leave the warm  embrace of blankets and coverlets, yet it required only a little moral cour- age, and always paid well in the end. It was surprising to see how much I could accomr-  plish in-doors, and Arthur outside in the garden, before our neighbors' breakfst-bell rang. My parlor was aired and dusted; in Linter, the' fire was raked and filled with coal, while, refreshed and invigorated by. this stirring exercise, I was ready to begin my day's employment be it sewing or fancy-work.  Of the latter I have already stated that I was exceeding- ly fond, but my favorite styles were those that paid me best, and could be turned to some useful account,  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7785-00000023"/> 36  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. for decorating or improving our house. Leather- work was one of my favorites, and I was not long in making several pretty things- for -he parlor, which added much to its good appearance, and were univer- salty admired by all who came to see us. For my picture-frames, I took old and shabby 'wooden ones, that I had ferreted out of a pile of rub- bish in an auction-store, and although covered with dust and cobwebs, were just suited to my purpose. The man who kept the shop looked at me in amaze- ment when I said I would buy tlem. I know his curiosity was considerably excited to know what pos- sible use I could find for such trash; but I kept my own counsel, and, paying a few cents for my frames, carried them home, dust, cobwebs, and all. Of course the glasses were soon removed, and needed only water to clear them nicely.. The frames did not look like the same things either, after I had scrubbed them ini several waters; for they proved to be of genuine walnut, only that years of neglect, and dust, had covered up the beautiful quality of the wood.- If the man who sold them to me had been as wise as I, he would have adopted my plan before he sold them; but that would not have favored me as well. I chuckled over my work, however, as I pro- ceeded, and grew still more interested in its progress. - The frames were a pair, nearly square, and meas. ured some fourteen by sixteen inches on the inside They were neatly moulded, and smooth along the sides, but somewhat rough and broken at the corners I was not long in conceiving a plan to cover up these defects; so sitting down to my leather basket, an( selecting good, smooth, thick leather, I cut out oak leaves of various sizes, and ivy-leaves also. Thea moulding them, and drawing veins across each' leal as naturally as possible, I pulled them into shape whil wet and pliable. This occupied my spare time fk several days, and when all were prepared, I tacked tt oak-leaves to the four corners of one of the frame   SIX HUNDRED    DOLLARS A YEAR.    37 placing the larger ones nearest the corners and King them overlap a little where they joined; but th vood was left bare about one third of the centreof the frame, as the corners only were to be ornamented. I used the smallest size-of gimp tacks for this work, and then selecting a few fine acorns, which I had gathered in the woods, I first glued the nuts firmly into the cups, and then attached them strongly to the work, placing them here and there amongst the leaves. When this one was finished,-I put the ivy-leaves on the other frame in the same manner, but using dried peas or cherry-stones in little clusters, to represent the berries of the ivy.  When they were completed, I took my bottle of rosewood staining-varnish and went over the whole surface of the leather, acorns, and ber- ries, using a large camel's-hair brush, and working the paint well under the edges of the work. One coat of this did the staining, but as the leather rapidly ab- sorbed the varnish, when it was quite dry I laid on another coat of good copal, which added a splendid gloss and brought out the beautiful veins of the wood besides. The pictures intended to be framed were a pair of choice engravings that Arthur had had for several years. When they were placed in theseipretty frames, and then hung up by crimson cords, in the broad recesses that were on either side of the mantel- piece, they looked beautiful. I valued them more than any I could have bought. Another useful and ornamental article of my own production'was a set of hanging-shelves, which I could have sold for many dollars had I been disposed to part with them. They consisted, first, of three pieces of smooth pine board, an inch in thickness, each one being cut in the shape of a right-angled triangle, so as to fit exactly into the corner of the room. The sizes of these shelves varied, the largest' measuring twenty inches on the sides of the right-angle, the next seventeen, and the smallest fourteen inches. The fronts of the ,e  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7785-00000024"/> 38  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A      YEAR. shelves were then curved outward in the centre, so as to present a rounded front instead of angular corners. An auger-hole, large ejnough to admit a sash-cord, was then bored in the corners of all these shelves; the sides were planed smooth and made to fit the corner accurately, but the rounided front side was left rough. The shelves were then stained with the walnut or rosewood varnish I have before described, so as to leave no trace of the white pine visible. I was several weeks in preparing the leather-work grape leaves and fruit, for it required quite a number of different sizes, and some nine or ten clusters of grapes for my purpose; but when they were at last finished, it was only one morning's work to tack them on thefront edge, using the largest leaves and grapes for the largest shelf, and graduating them accordingly. For this piece of work I used very thick leather, and each leaf was tacked firmly in its place, as were also the grapes and tendrils. If I had trusted to glue, as some workers in leather do, I should have been con- stantly annoyed with my leaves and fruit tumbling or brushing off. When all was finished and stained, I hung them one abovet another, with the largest for the bottom, and the smallest at- the top, using for the purpose three strong sash-cords, and fastening them under the auger-holes by means of. knots, which, were entirely concealed by the leaves. A large hook, driven into 'the corner of the wall, near the ceiling, answered to hang them on, and I was careful to have them exactly straight and level, and just the proper distance apart. A vine of small leaves and flowers was- made to en- twine around these ropes entirely up to the top, When the work was completed, stained, and well varnished, they looked like rich carvings, and being so firm and solid will last for many years to come, and bear dusting and cleaning as well as if made of wood instead of leather. Upon -the lowest shelves I ar- ranged rows of nice books, and on the upper one I   SIX    HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.      39 placed a vase of dried grasses, interspersed with autumn leaves, polished with a thifn coat of white mastic varnish; and the effect was exceedingly good. Every one was delighted with my handiwork, and I know I could have found customers- for a number just like it, if I had chosen to go into the business more largely. Anothler enterprise of this description excited no little wonder and merriment among my friends, and taught us, thenceforward, to despise nothing, however humble its previous uses and associations. We had had the plumbers and carpenters at work i our kitchen, removing an old hydrant and putting in a new one. When they had completed their work, Jane was set to clearing up the rubbish they had left behind, putting the pieces of old wood into the chip- basket to be used as kindlings. I was directing this work when my eye suddenly lighted on the old-fash- ioned, acorn-shaped top of the defunct hydrant-box, and, taking it up in my hands, I stood looking, at it for a few moments, hesitating whether to sav Rt or at once consign it to Jane's keeping. I had not looked long before an idea struck me, and, in accordance therew'ith, I carried the once humble hydrant-top and placed it in my receptacle for treasures of this de- scription, - the little attic workroom, where my leather, paints, and tools were always kept. In a few days I was ready to put my idea into practice, and having first well scrubbed my treasure, and by means of a little sodta-water removed the numerous layers of paint which during many years had ac:cumulated upon its surface, I called in the'aid of a carpenter who sawed it in two very accurately, dividing it lengthwise directly through the centre. When thus divided, the semi- circular base of each half measured about spven inches across, and three and a half through. I then had the carpenter saw a pair of semicircles of smooth wood, one inch thick, which should measure just twelve inclies by six, and these -I had nailed firmly to  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7785-00000025"/> 40  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. the half-acorns so as to form wall-brackets, with the shelves uppermost, and extending, of course, several inches beyond the old wood. On the back, or part intended to go next the wall, they were even and smooth. After having related my previous feats in leather- work, my readers will by this time anticipate my his- tory; but they cannot tell how well my brackets looked after I had decorated and stained them to match the rest. My husband was never weary of pointing them out to our friends, and many who in the first place would have scoffed at the idea of so humble a thing ever being worthy of promotion to the parlor, now wished heartily that they could do the same. Had some pedler come along just then with a load of shabby hydrant-tops, he might have found numerous customers, at remunerative prices. So I felt well repaid for all my trouble.   ; My parlor being now pretty fairly ornamented with such work, I began to turn my attention to the other parts of the house. In an old chest in the attic I had laid by a set of curtains, made of furniture chintz, gay and showy, but very fine and substantial. They had belonged to my grandmother, and had descended to my mother, but the latter, having no particular use for them, had turned them over to me; thinking that, as I was tolerably ingenious, I might be able to turn them to some account. And so I did. Our house, pleasant and comfortable though it was, had a great lack of good closets. I was often seriously inconvenienced for want of a place for my bedclothes and linen. My miiid was bent on devis- ing a substitute, and at last I determined to use my chintz for -this purpose. It was easy to obtain' two long packing-boxes, about twenty-four inches wide and fourteen high, with a good lid to each. They cost me just twenty-five cents apiece, with an ad- ditional twenty-five cents each for the castors, which last made them much more valuable as articles of   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR.   4I furniture, especially after they were filled with heavy things. My first work was to fasten ,the lids firmly to the boxes, by means of leather hinges put on in the following manner. Each of the lids consisted of two pieces, one of these being a narrow strip about eight inches wide; these strips were first nailed .fast to the open top of the box, along one side, ]eing placed close to the edge, and to it the other portion of the lid was attached by means of- four pieces of strong leather, nailed at regular 'distances along the upper side. This left ample room for passing things in and. out of the box, and allowed of raising the lid without disturbing the pillows at the back. I next covered the inside of the box with a lining of thick  paper, - newspaper would have answered well, or odds and ends of wall paper, - and when this was done, stuffed the top, using straw spread evenly over the wood, with. a thin coating of cotton-batting over it. Some coarse bagging was put on over the stuffing, first, and then the chintz was drawn tightly and  smoothly over that, being firmly and neatly tacked on the under side of the lid, while another strip of chintz formed a lining to conceal the board on the inside.  The hinges being'on the upper side, were of course covered by the stuffing. When the top was finished, a  full ruffle of chintz was tacked around the sides, just long enough to reach the floor, and a plain piece used to cover the back. Square pillows were made and stuffed with fine shavings, until they were very firm and hard, and these were placed in an upright position on the back part of the lid, resting against the wall. . When the whole were finished, I had two very tasteful pieces of furniture; and placing one in each of my largest chambers, I was thus provided with ample accommo- dations for my sheets, pillow-cases, and bedclothes. I had still several yards of chintz remaining, of which I  afterwards made a very convenient work-table  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7785-00000026"/> 42  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. in this way: I bought from a grocery store, for ten cents, a good-sized cheese-box, with a lid that was about one and a half inches too large all round. This box I attached to a square piece of inch board, measuring only a few: inches less than the diameter of the box, by means of a strong stem of rough timber. This being fastened firmly to the centre of the board, and also to the outside centre of the bottom of the box, I had at once the foundation of a table whose top was a capacious box. I next began my work of lining the same, using flour paste to 'fasten the chintz around the edges wherever the tacks could not be employed. No doubt a paper lining would have answered almost equally well, but the chin'tz looked better and will be more durable. The piece of chintz intended for the outside was scalloped around the lower edge, and extended a little below the box, a corresponding border being prepared for the lid. The bottom and stem were covered very much as the well-known hour-glass, tables are done. The chintz, however, was tacked first to the square board at the bottom, and then drawn up and plaited in to the top of the stem, where it was nailed securely close up under the box. A little gimp that I had saved from old dresses served to finish the edges, and a set of castors on, the bottom made it roll easily over the floor. I have found this the most convenient kind of work-table, for it holds my work and basket while the lid conceals them in a moment, should visitors enter, to whose curious eyes you do not choose to expose your occupations. Thus, out of those old rejected chintz curtains were pro- duced all these useful things, the actual outlay for the wholb being about one dollar and a half. The time that I usually devoted to work of this description was that which many, perhaps, in my situ- ation, would have taken for visiting, lounging, or idle, sorts of employment. My friend Mrs. Wilson had as much time as myself, but she did lotsl of fine embroid-   SIX BUN'DRED DOLLARS A YEAR.      43 ery, worsted-work, and knitting. I do not mean to criticise her different tastes, but when I heard her constantly declaring how much, she wished for the ability to do as I did, I only wondered how she should prefer her very different style of fancy-work, or find it easier to accomplish than my own. She had some elegant specimens of knitting, and I almost coveted the beautiful white counterpane which graced her bed on all grand occasions. But when I con- sidered how many little shell-shaped pieces it con- tained, and heard her tell during how many months it had occupied her every leisure 'moment, I did not desire to alter my employments; nor would I have exchanged, even for that elaborate piece of work, either my shelves or my   pictures, although both together had not taken me a tenth part of the time to make them,     &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7785-00000027"/> SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 45   CHAPTER VI.   COUSIN LUCY'S VISIT. - WORKING FOR THE SOLDIERS. - MAKING WAX-FLOWERS. A NEW IDEA. - EARNING MONEY. -A NEW VISITOR. - ABOUT SERVANTS. - BILL OF FARE. - A TEA- PARTY.    IT was during the period of which I am now writing- the second year after my marriage-that my cousin Lucy Gra- ham came to pay me a little visit. She had promised to come for a long time; but being one' of; the useful sort, always employed in good works, and never consulting her pleasure before her duty, this expected treat had been very long deferred. Indeed, when I heard of her many engagements, and of her prominence in all the public movements of the day in which women may take part, I despaired of ever seeing her at all. But one morning she came with- her little trunk to pay that memorable visit. I say memorable; and ii the course of my story I will explain why I may justly call it so. Lucy was much older than myself. She was prob- ably at this time over thirty, and I only two-and- twenty. Ever silIce I could remember, I had looked up to her as a very lovely and superior person, expert in many beautiful arts, intelligent and literary,--in a word, she was a sort of beau-ideal to me, whose good. qualities I continually endeavored to imitate. This was her first visit to me, and I received her with the warmest and most affectionate welcome. I felt both pride and pleasure in showing her my house, and its arrangements, and she entered so cordially into all t'   my plans and contrivances, and approved so much of my system of household expenditures, that I loved to talk over my affairs with her, asking her advice on divers little matters in which I was in doubt. Like ourselves, she was an early riser, so in the morning, as soon as breakfast was over, and my little domestic duties attended to, we sat down together, to our several employments, she in turn telling me of the work in which she was then most interested. It was just at this time that the war was occupying everybody's attention, and patriotic women were beginning to work for the soldiers who had gone to battle for the Union. In every city and town, and even in every village of the North, the "Ladies' Aid "Societies were being or- ganized, and little bands of women were busy making shirts and drawers, or scraping lint, and rolling band- ages for the hospitals. The great "Sanitary Com- mission," too, with its vast machinery, into whose storehouses, as to a huge reservoir, all those little streams flowed, was beginning its work of humanity. I had lived, as it were, out of the world, and needed to be told of these things, and have the grand move- ments of the day explained to me. No one then could do it better than my cousin Lucy, who was one of those foremost in the work. She had devoted almost her whole time to it, and already held a responsible position as a member of the "Commission." ( For," as she remarked, "what else can we women do, at such a time as this We cannot fight ourselves, but we can help those who can, and comfort those who have fallen, from wounds or sicknns, by our sympa- thy, our prayers, and our offerings." Indeed, as I listened I grew so much interested, and my patriotism became so lively, that I wished very much for the means to begin some such work in our own town. I told Lucy how gladly I would do what I could, but my hands were tied because of my slen- der purse; and she knew that I spoke truly. "But there are many others-who could do liberally, &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7785-00000028"/> " S IX HUNDRE:, DOLLARS A YEAR        -  and would, no doubt," she said, "if the thing could only be started."' "Certainly, Lucy," I answered, "but who will take the lead?" "If there is no one else, then why not yourself?" she asked, emphatically. "These are not the times for any to lack courage when duty calls us. Come, I will go with you, and let us see what can be done now, this very day.", If I had stopped to think it all over, and had real- ized how large a matter I was undertaking, I might have shrunk from the task; but not so: Lucy gave me no time to hesitate. The text she quoted to me was this one, -"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might," and, acting in this mind, we set out on our brrand. I will not here recount the particulars of our expe- dition, in which we called on many of the wealthiest people of the town, but will only state that enough were interested to constitute the nucleus of a "Ladies' Aid Society," whose operations continued during the whole period of the war. As the existence of the organization became more widely known by means of its published reports and acknowledgments, contribu- 'tions began to flow in, and additional workers were enrolled, until it came to be a most valuable auxiliary of the Sanitary Commission. Many boxes and barrels of supplies were sent to theI sick and wounded men who languished in hospitals so far away from home and friends, to whom those jellies and cordials, and clean clothes. seemed like a reminder of the absent, while it was so cheering-to them to feel that the coun- 'try that had called them to defend her did not forget her brave champions, nor leave them uncared for in their times of trouble and sickness. So this was the way our society started, and hence my own warm personal interest in its success. We met one evening in a week in each others' houses, and while a few older ones cut' out and fixed the work, the   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR,      47 others sewed the seams and finished off the garments. We sent them off whenever we had enough to fill a box, and this was quite often, so that by the time the war was over, and our Society closed its opera- tions, we were able to show a report of some ten or twelve thousand garments which we had given to the soldiers, besides a large quantity of wines, cor- dials, jellies, &amp;c. But to return to Lucy's visit, which had only just begun. While we sat together during those pleasant mornings that passed so swiftly I became much in- terested in watching her work. She was making wax- flowers,- and such wax-flowers as they were! I had often seen ordinary wax-work in the shop windows, but never such exquisite things as hers. They seemed to rival nature itself, so lifelike and nat- ural were the shapes and tints, and so delicate were the groupings of her sprays. I had never cared to learn the art until I saw Lucy's manipulations, but now I was seized with a strong desire to do so, and she gen- erously promised to teach me all she could. So the lessons began forthwith, and every day I gained some fresh knowledge, until by the time her visit was done- I had made more than one bouquet, and felt myself almost mistress of the art.' My wax-flowers began to be the wonder and admiration of all my friends, even more than my leather-work had been. Indeed, I con- fessed secretly to myself how beautiful they were, and how well I had improved my opportunity. Lucy's wax-flowers were all given to help the funds of the Sanitary Commission. I think by the time her labors for the cause were completed, she must have given, in this way, many hundreds of dollars. When she told me of the ready sale they met with, I began to think of doing the same with some of mine, -a few at least. I would gladly have given more, had I felt able to do so, but the materials were expensive, and every one I made cost me something. The first bouquet Arthur insisted upon having ,  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7785-00000029"/> placed on our own parlor mantel, and the next I gave very freely to the fair we were just about starting for the benefit of the c Aid Society." When the fair did take place, I was surprised and delighted to find how quickly it was sold, and I really believe I could have sold twenty more if they had been there. One day, while Lucy was teaching me, she told me of several of her friends who had made large sums of money, and were still doing so, simply from the sale of fancy-work. Some did this for their own support, and some in order that they might have the means to give to others. Her information made a great impres- sion on my mind. I began to think how acceptable, just now, would be a little accession to my own in- come, and how pleasantly I might thus provide my- self with a fund on which I could draw at discretion. This idea took such firm hold on me that I confided it -to Lucy, and asked her advice and assistance in the matter. After all that I have said of her generos- ity and kindness, I need scarcely tell how willingly she gave me both, and volunteered to introduce me to one who would either purchase my flowers or sell them for me:on commission. The Holidays were approaching, and this I knew was my time to begin; so, as soon as I could prepare a few, I sent them as specimens to the place she had des- ignated, and in a few days afterward came an order for more. I can scarcely describe my sensations as I read the letter, I was so overjoyed at my success; and the idea that I was really able to earn a little money was so pleasing, that I could hardly contain myself; yet I set busily about the bouquets, and in a few days was able to forward the second lot to the large establish- ment in the city. Dear Cousin Lucy,- her visit was so short; and yet, when I look back to it now, and think of all 'that it did for me, I bless her more and more, and feel that the value of those lessons of independence and self-reliance she taught me then can never berestimated, I did not  :1   -.---*UJ ^  fl otte r ..   49 see her again for two years afterward, but I heard of her often, as one of the Florence Nightingales of our own land, who watched beside the sick and dying in the hospitals and on the battle-fields. Many a last mes- sage she carried to the absent friends of the dying sol- dier, and many a prayer she offered for the departing spirits who, but for this, would have had no holy words to comfort them in that solemn hour. When New Year was past, and I received my pay, I had over a hundred dollars coming to me, which was pretty well for my first season. Here my wax-work ceased for many months, for other business came before long, which crowded everything- else out of the way. Before spring another most im- portant and engrossing individual -was added to our family in the. person of our precious baby, who, if he brought with him a world of care and anxiety, and a most weighty sense of responsibility, brought also a love which overbalanced all, and made these new labors seem very light. My little hoard of money, which was doubly valuable because it was all my own, was indeed a windfall, - at this time, especially, when so much was to be provided for the new-comer. v Every article for an infant's wardrobe was so expensive that many dol- lars were needed to procure the necessary amount of flannel and cambric, not to speak of cradle, crib, and little coach. This last article saved me almost the ex- pense of hiring another girl, as I was able to take the child out myself; indeed, after this I was seldom able to go out in the daytime without taking-him with me. Jane was fortunately very fond of children, and this was to me another source of great thankfulness, for, Inasmuch as nursing baby was not her legitimate busi. ness, I  could not demand her services in this new de- partment of our daily'work. I  was often asked by my friends and neighbors to explain how I managed to keep my girl so long, when they were so constantly changing theirs. The only way I  could do this. was by inquiring a little into our 4 &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7785-00000030"/> several modes of management.- Mrs Travis; our op; posite neighbor, could never keep a servant more. than six' weeks, and paid by the year at the intelligence office, they engaging to supply her with as, many of the kind as she might need. I fell sure there must be some mismanagement about it, and that there was prob- ably a little fault on the side of the mistress, as well the maid. One day, when calling there, the subject was brought up for discussion,--the " irrepressible con- flict between housekeepers and servants. I quite envy you," she began, -- "you, who never change; but where you managed to secure such a prize, and how you manage to keep her, too, are perfect prob- lems to me." "Jane is a very good girl," I answered, "and I own myself fortunate in having her; but perhaps she might not suit you as well, if you had her. She is not fault- less, I assure you.  "But -her'faults cannot be bad ones," she insisted, or you could not keep her at all." "Well, Mrs. Travis," I said; i" she has many good qualities, which, in my estimation, overbalance her faults ; but I know that in some families she could not stay a month." "Why, how do you manage her, then?" asked my friend  '  "Well, you see, Jane is a respectable girl, and de- serves to 'be treated as such. She is quite above the common run of 'servants, who; depend on intelligence offices for places, and change them so often as never to become attached to either place or people. She has been with us, more than two years, and I think really loves. us, aped would do almost-anything to serve us. I'm sick she is kindness itself, and would be ready to lose her sleep, or give up any of her own privileges, at such times. Now these are matters which go far towards outweighing those minor faults that all servants have. She is sometimes quite heed- less,and forgets my. directions, but then I know it is    unintentional, and so I do not censure her too severely. If I did, I might lose her, and not be able to suit my- I self again as well." et Heedlessness is a bad fault'? remarked my auditor. "Wastefulness is another, and I have had experience in both; but save me from your (respectable' servaints who think they must eat just the same as you do yourself, and indeed act as if, they were quite on a level with their employers. I always expect to have the servants' stores separate fromi my own, and give them their allowance every week, which, unless they are wasteful, is ample for all their wants." , I see that we differ a little in our views," I said, earnestly. "(I do not mean an impudent or presum- ing servant, when I say c respectable, but one who has right views of her duties and responsibilities, and knows how to value a good home. Besides, it has been my plan to give Jane the same food that we eat ourselves." "What! the same butter, coffee, desserts, &amp;c. that you have on your own table, and as much of them as she chooses to take?" asked Mrs. Travis in amazement. ', Why, I have always heard you praised as such a good manager and economical housekeeper." e'As to that, I may have been credited with more than I deserve," I answered; ,: but I certainly think it would have been poor economy to have a different set of provisions laid in for Jane, when there is always enough left after we are done to feed her well. It would be poor economy to waste that surplus, merely because she -was a servant and required servants' fare. You will now understand what I mean by-having a respectable servant. Our Jane is too .conscientious to waste anything, and eats and behaves with as much I propriety as most people in different circumstances." "Well, I always thought that all ladies pursued the same plan in regard to servants' supplies. You sure- ly do not allow them sweetmeats and desserts 3 " she' said. '  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7785-00000031"/> ea , SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A -YEAR. "Our Jane, as I said before, is honest and decent, and she always sits down after our meal is over, and partakes of whatever we have left. If there are sweet meats,I have always observed that she helped herself to a small quantity, and then put the rest away as carefully as I would have done myself. I could not thihk of telling her she could not have any. i How different are our ideas on this point, or else how different are the servants we have to deal with, she remarked. Ithink you are right in both cases," I answered. Perhaps you would find my Jane a nuisance, and I suppose that under your system she would soon beconie quite a different girl." But there was little use in reasoning with my neigh- bor; for her views were so totally different from mine that it was better for us to differ amicably without con- tinuing the discussion. I am sure, however, that the price which she annually paid to the intelligence office more than equalled the cost of all the desserts and sweetmeats eaten by Jane. She continued to dis- course constantly of servants and their faults, and changed hers as often as ever. In the mean time Jane did our work as usual, and after the housework was over, she, of her own accord, would hold the baby, or sit by the cradle while I rested or went out. She felt at home with us, and had become interested in, qur affairs. She knew and understood, how limited our means were; and she did her best to economize. There are few houses in which there is less waste than in ours, for Jane was both ready and willing to turn everything to good account. When w-e had scraps of meat left from dinner, she would save them carefully, and prepare a nice dish of hash orr croquets for the next day, which were really better than fresh meat would have been. In our luse i can truly say that there was nothing' wasted.' The bread; however stale, was used for puddings, sauces, and dressings; cold potatoes were always fried and 4 ,   .    . .  -a   - .e si   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.       53 browned nicely for breakfast, and even sour milk was used to mix those delicious griddle-cakes which Arthur liked so well. My cookery-book had in it receipts of all kinds. There were rich cakes, expensive pastry, and extravagant bills of fare, but it was the plainer ones that we chose. I Our table was plentiful, but plain. For breakfast we always had good bread or rolls in summer, and in winter griddle-cakes of buckwheat, wheat, or Indian meal, with fried potatoes, broiled mackerel, or fresh fish, an omelette, boiled eggs, or a meat stew, made of  the remains of yesterday's dinner; but only one of those items at'a time. For dinner we rarely dispensed with meat or fish, because Arthur needed strong food to sustain him under such close application to the du- ties of his position. But we bought only the necessary quantity, and seldom indulged in large joints, and fine poultry. A turkey for Christmas, and a goose or ducks for New Year, with a chicken now and then through- out the year, was the extent of our experience in the poultry line. But then every day there were nicely cooked vegetables, frequently of our own raising, and a plain good pudding or pie for dessert. Then for our evening meal we needed little more than tea and toast, with a dish of chipped beef, sliced tomatoes, or ripe fruit. If a friend came to take a meal with us, our rule was  to make no deviation from our usual fare. I might, it is true, set the table with greater care, and display my nicest dishes and finest table-linen, because this-cost me nothing but a little trouble: But, on principle, we refrained from useless profusion. We could not afford to make feasts oir to give parties, and while we endeav- ored to "Tuse hospitality without grudging, we' also remembered, that to live beyond bne's means is not - consistent either with easthn or religion. In my own visiting experience, however, I always found that a warm welcome, and a cordial spirit, was a siter source of gratification to the guest, than a table loaded with costly viands.  i.                  .      .:. .  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7785-00000032"/> e5  X SIX IVNDRED   A , / D A4 1 mA .  On these subjects much may be learned from books whi0ch have been written by sensible women, on the science of keeping house economically. Orie of these writers has made so comprehensive a summary of essen- tials that, as I frequently read it yvith advantage to myself, I transcribe it for/the benefit of others. She says - ,I Much waste often occurs in the boiling of meats,. The cook will throw out the water, without letting it cool to take off the fat, or scrape the dripping-pan into the swill-pail. The grease is useful in many ways. It can be burned in lamps, mixed' with lardl or, when no pork has been boiled with it, madeinto candles. Bits of meat are thrown out which would made hash. The flouris sifted in a wasteful manner, or the bread-pan left with the dough sticking to it. Pie-crust is laid by to sour, instead of making a few tarts for tea Cold puddings are considered good for nothing, when often- times they might be steamed for the next day. Vege- tables are thrown away that would warm for breakfast nicely. Dish-cloths are thrown where mice can de- stroy them. Soap is left in water to dissolve. If bath brick, whiting, rotten-stone, etc., are used, much is wasted uselessly. The Iscrub-brush is left in water, pails scorched -by the fire, tubs left in the sun to dry; anid fall apart, chamber-pails altwed to rust tins not  dried, and iron-ware rusted; nice knives used for cook- ing in the kitchen, silver spoons used to scrape kettles, or forks to toast- bread. .Cream -is allowed to spoil, mustard to dry in the pot, and vinegar to corrode the castor; tea, roasted coffee, pepper, and spices, to stand open and lose their strength.

Dried beef becomes so hard that it cannot be cut; cheese moulds, and it is eaten by mice. Bones are burned that would make soup; ashes are thrown out carelessly, endangering the prem-   ' - ises, and being wasted. Servants leave a light burn-  ing in the kitchen when they are all out of an evening. Clothes are whipped to pieces in thewind. Fine cam. brics rubbed on the board, and laces tornin the starch- ing.   X , Carpets are swept with stumps hardly fit to scrub the kitchen, and good, new brooms used for scrubbing. Towels are used in place of holders, and good sheets to iron on, taking a fresh one every. week, thus scdrching A nearly all in the house.

The table, indeed, was very handsome, and the bright silver and cut glass added very much to the general effect; but I knew that it had cost a large sum to prepare it,- perhaps enough to have maintained the family for sev- eral days, and besides this had wearied thepn all exces- sively. No doubt, when they came to return the visit, they thought our fare. very mean in comparison; but I felt satisfied that, whatever they might think, our course was wiser, because it was honest, and so cared -not for any remarks they may have been disposed to make.

The war, and its attending evils, were increasing daily, and the former prices of 4:11 commodities were now  becoming so' high as to put many things, before considered neces- sary, quite beyond the reach of persons in our circum- stances.. The spirit of speculation, and the oil mania referred to in a previous chapter, were now at their height. Many people were looking after their own gains, rather than to the vital interests of the nation. Government contracts had made multitudes rich, and among others our opposite neighbor, Mr. Travis. His business was to supply, by purchase or hire, ships for the government, and large were his opportunities for money-making. There were many owners of ships whof were eager enough to offer their old weather- beaten vessels at an annual charge sufficient to buy new ones outright -in times of peace; but in order to secure the acceptance of the same it was wisest to make interest with these contractors, for to them was intrusted the whole question of thousands or millions of dollars. Now, Mr. Travis would have held himself quite above so dishonorable a thing as bribery; but [there is much in a name, and old thiigs with new "faces may: Sometimes loge half their offensiveness. It was just as easy for him to give the contracts to the generous Gm amn   tesor   poienihbr      r  rvs  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7785-00000034"/> SIX HUNDRED DO LLARS A YEAR. men, who, in the most friendly manner, made him handsome presents; and, indeed, it would have seemed' ungrateful had he passed them by. So' by means of his well-managed profits and these liberal gifts together, Mr. Travis made a pretty good thing of the war; and this very year of which I am writing they moved out of our quiet neighborhood into a splendid four-story house, which had been most gen- erously presented to his wife by certain shipping mer- chants in one of the great cities. From that time we lost sight of Mrs. Travis, and hence I am unable to tell my readers whether or not she allows her servants more to eat, or whether she changes them as frequent- ly as when she lived across the way. Our friend the Revenue Collector had paid us another visit, and this year, as last, received only our two dollars,--the piano tax; for our income had' not kept pace with that of others around us. Mr. Wilson's had been advanced by the mercantile house which employed him, so that he now had a thousand dollars in all, or eight hundred besides house-rent. Yet we struggled on, and hoped for better times. My wax-work had again come into requisition, and as the holidays approached I sent another lot of my pretty bouquets to the establishment which had taken them last year. The same good fortune awaited me as before. The jewelry store in whose windows they were placed was crowded with new purchasers, who but a year ago, perhaps, had no money to spend for fancy work or fine arts. I cared not who bought my wares, -whether " shoddy" or genuine aristocracy, -so that customers were provided. The returns came to me in orthodox greenbacks, and I was delighted to find what a roll of tlem there was. More than a hundred dollars again, and all gained by the careful use of evening hours, and odd times, when baby was, asleep, or Jane was volunteer nurse. 'By my husband's advice I took the even " hundred" dollars and bought a government bond, reserving the   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A- YEAR.   59   odd dollars as capital for next year's operations. Alas! what a change came over us before the next Christmas, and how. sadly I was to spend it alone- without him.  When we had talked of the war, and I hadprayed that the God of battles would send victory to our arms; when I thought of the soldiers, and -worked for them week after week; .and when I listened, too, to the appeals that were made everywhere for men, I had not thought that Arthur would ever have to go. There had been several drafts in other places, but in' our town none, as yet, for the quotas had been filled by volunteer enlistments. But this new year which was to witness so much joy in the return of peace to our land, and which came in so calmly to me, was not many weeks old when my prospects changed. In the draft whidh then took place, for only fifty men, Arthur's name was drawn, and there were but ten days allowed to prepare for his departure. The country needed all her patriot sons now, the papers said, and a mighty army was concentrating to quell the Rebellion and give us peace once more. Sherman was engaged in his victorious march in the South, Thomas was busy in the West, Sheridan and Meade in Virginia; and Grant's mighty mind directed the whole stupendous plan. The end was near, but I did not know it, for the veil of the future concealed it from me., I thought only that it was my own hus- band that must now go and help to fight the battles, and for the first time I became aware how little my boasted patriotism had cost me. Arthur was more calm than myself, and went about making his preparations as if for a visit, I thought; but I could scarcely tell how th act, so great was my distress. There was puch for me to do, however, in that short time. I would gladly have given my own little investment to procure a substitute, had it been large enough; but my husband scorned the thought of sending another to do his proper work. I thought  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7785-00000035"/> BvHUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. he was rather peculiar in theviews he held on that subject, but could not alter them by any of my argu- ' ments. Yet how would a change of opinion on his part have helped the real state of the case, when sub- stitutes could not be obtained for less than a thousand dollars, and he had not the means of raising so large a suma  The. time drew near for him to depart. I had done what I could to provide -him with comforts for his carpaign. As to myself, I had striven not to think what was to become of me, but he had settled that I should, for the present, pay a visit to my old home, which I had not seen since my marriage. My sup- port during his absence would be certain, for his pay could be drawn by me, and the bounty money of eight hundred dollars had been already invested, for my benefit, in government bonds. So, when the day of departure came, I saw him go with a heavy heart, and I know there were tears in his eyes as well as mine, as he came baiethe second time to kiss the baby and me, and'bid   of good cheer, for God would pro- tect us all. :i d: not bear to look out of the win- dow to see th0G  ient, as it marched past the house; but 'they told me how handsome he looked in his new uniform, and how well he did his part during the final review, before the cars came that were to take them South. Thus I was left alone with Jane and little Percy; and O how lonely I felt, with the dull and gloomy realities of the present to claim me now, while there arose before me yet gloomier forebodings of the future! Arthur's employer, Mr. Landis, had found much difficulty in filling his place temporarily, even at an advanced rate of salary; for the war had taken such large numbers from every trade and profession that comparatively few of the right sort were left at home to fill the many vacant places. The day after the regimint left town he called in to see me. He had never come before, but now, knowing that I was t ' ; '.  -. " 9 X  r  r -i   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. , 6i alone, he came to say that he would be my friend in case of any emergency in which I might need his assistance or advice. I thought it very kind, and told him of my plans for shutting up the house and paying a long visit at my father's. When he heard of this, he said that it would be well for me to do so, and thought that the sooner I could set off the better. ( Cheer up, cheer up, Mrs. D.," he added, kindly. ", These,are hard times in which we live, but the worst is nearly over now, and peace will come before long." But my husband -"I was beginning. ' O, he will come back to you again, never fear. I miss him almost as much as you do. I wish now that I had bought a substitute for him myself, so as to keep him at home." I felt worse than ever when I heard that. Of course a thousand dollars would have been of small consequence to' him, compared with losing a compe- tent and faithful person like Arthur from the head of his establishment. But Mr. Landis had the name of being a close man, hard at a bargain, and eight hun- dred dollars seemed like a great sum for him to pay to one man. I suppose he thought, too, as he looked arodnd the house, that we must get along well on it; as if the furniture and other things had been bought with any of the money earned from him. We both attended the same church too, and I suppose that Mr. Landis had observed how respectably we were always dressed, and this might be another evidence to him that we had plenty -to live upon. I thought of all this in an instant, and for the moment it'seemed as if even our good management and economy were turning witnesses against us. If we had looked different, I thought, we might have won his pity,. and gained an advance in salary, or a continuance of some portion of it during Arthur's absence; yet I was better satisfied to have it as it Was. "Why not rent your house, Mrs. D.?" asked Mr. Landis, as he rose to go.  ,A &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7785-00000036"/> 62  SIX BUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. : I had not thought of doing so, I answered; " but if acarefal tenant could be found, I would not object.'" I think I know of one who would take it, -a 3small family of grown people, and who would pay you:a good price for it besides. How much would you want for it?"he inquired. -I scarcely know," I replied, timidly; "would five hundred dollars be too much to ask for it?" ,4 Not enough; madam, - not nearly enough," was the answer, for he was not bargaining for himself now. , People are paying enormously for furnished houses, and there are few to be had. Leave it to me; I will make it right for you; I will see the people -and bring them to look at your house, and we will have it settled at once." The idea of renting the house had been a very sudden one, and after Mr. Landis had taken his depart- ure, I sat down to reflect upon the subject. It was somewhat of a trial, at first, to think of haing strangers come into our home, and use our things, but there were other considerations that would easily counterbalance all this. The family was said to be a respectable and careful one, and our things were not so grand or costly after all. If they were injured,'the price paid would enable us to replace them; so upon the whole I determined to let the people take it at whatever sum Mr. Landis thought proper to name to them, feeling sure that if Arthur were here he would advise the same. Alas! how strange the- idea seemed to me still,- that he was away, and I was left to decide all these momentous questions alone. In a day or two-Mr. Landis brought his friends to see the house. The family consisted of an elderly, couple, with two grown-up daughters, - very lady-like and civil in their speech and behavior,-and after they had examined everything well, and inquired into all particulars of the establishment, the gentleman of the party turned to me and said, - "Madam, Mr. Landis tells me that you will rent     SIX HUNDRED   DOLLARS A YEAR. i   63 your house and -furniture, for a year, at one thousand dollars, I will take it at that price, paying quarterly in advance              .  I was so much astonished at the sum mentioned that I could scarcely believe my ears, for I well knew how much the whole furniture had cost originally, but I caught Mr. Landis's expressive glance, and answered, quietly, that I would be glad to accept him as a tenant. There were some preliminaries to be settled, which were soon agreed upon, the gentleman, Mr. Gregg, proposing to buy all the balance of supplies then remaining in the house. -The coal and groceries would be ready for them to begin on, he said. So it was agreed that we were to Ihve the premises in readi- ness for them in a week, which I thought would be little enough to allow for cleaning up and packing our clothing. Another very important question, which had troubled me not a little to decide, was what to do with Jane. I knew she could find places enough, but could I find another girl that would suitrfme as well, when I should come back to the house.  But this was also settled,' much to my relief, before the family left the house, by their engaging her services for them- selves, -an arrangement which was exceedingly satis- factory to all parties. I thanked Mr. Landis from the bottom of my heart, for this act of friendship. I know he felt rewarded for his kindness by the very sight of my grateful countenance, as I let them out of the door. The first thing I did after they-were gone was to sit down and write to my husband, telling him of all I had done since he left. I had not yet heard of his arrival at his destination in Virginial but I knew he would write as soon as he could, and a letter from home would be the most welcome thing he could receive. Then, after this act of love and duty, I rose and proceeded to my preparations.  Jane and I emptied all the bureaus and closets, and packed away the clothing, books, and little things, which were not included in the agreement, and day after day the work X .  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7785-00000037"/> O4t O, H A' I ffz ^AJlr@]u IvI JN InQ' r o o .lf progressed, until, at the appointed tim' I resigned my hoise and its belongnggs to their new owners, the Greggs. ' On that day I carried little Percy in to Mrs. Wil- sons -while I made the final preparations, and then my d fried and and neighbor accompanied me to the depot, and stayed with me until the train started. The hardest thing, I believe, was parting with the faithful Jane, who cried as if 'her heart would break, and kissed the baby as lon'g as there wastime to do so. She was an affectionate creature, and I know her grief was genu- ine; but it seemed like leaving a protector in my house to have her stay behind.  I felt that she would exercise a care over everything, during the period of my absence. , After all, Jane," I said, trying to comfort her and myself at the same time,-- ,after all, a year is not so very long, and if all goes well we shall be back then." But her heart was too full for reply, only. she wrung my hand as if unwilling to let us go. I think I must have dropped a few tears on her rough but cordial hands, even while I tried to be calm. Our journey occupied some five hoars, and was marked by no remarkable adventure; for the baby proved -to be a good traveller, and gave me no trouble. He played awhile with his rattle, and talked in his baby way until sleep came to his drowsy eyelids, and then I laid him on the soft seat before me, where he rested until the cars stopped in my native village and I placed him in my father's arms. He had not seen the boy since he grew to be so large and intelligent, and-it was hard to realize that the weighty personage he then held was indeed the same little specimen of a namesake that had been shown him once, all -wrapped in flannel and long clothes. Well, we reached home, the home of mychildhood, and a warm reception met us. Father, mother, and three sisters were there to welcome us, and indeed so pleasant was this reunion, after more than three years' absence frorn the old place, that I almost forgot, for the time at least, what had brought me there.   aIX HUNDRED DOLL,A RS A YEAR.      65 - I had been a week in my new, or rather in my old home, when I received Arthur's first letter from the seat of war, and he had also had mine, containing the'proposals for letting the house. Of these he much approved, and was pleased to hear of Mr. Landis's attentions to me. I had done wisely, he said, to follow that gentleman's advice, and I must listen to his counsels during the time he was to be absent. Of himself he wrote cheerfully, and described his camp-life in such a manner as to makeit appear less uncomfortable than I know it really was. Dear Arthur! he did this in order to make me feel happier, and less anxious; but O, I could not forget that he was constantly exposed to the greatest dangers. The papers prophesied, hard fighting before long, and I knew that, even while I read his letter, he might be on the battle-field. But I hoped on, and prayed, and trusted, and busied myself with the daily care of the child, my  odd time being filled up with sewing, read. ing the papers, or writing to the absent. Thus the weeks passed until spring, but all the time the plot was thickening fast. History travelled as it never did before, and destinies were decided in a few days, which had hung in the balance for years. The days of the great Rebellion were at last about being numbered. One day in March, (I shall never forget it!) I was doing some shopping at the principal store of the vil- lage, and was loitering over my purchases, with, my little sister holding Percy's coach at the shop door. Suddenlytherewas a   commotion outside; the various bells of the village began toq ring; the people seemed beside themselves too;  "Richmond is ours " shouted the town-crier, as he ran through the street, and every one hastened to take up the animating theme. The articles I   had been bargaining for dropped instantly from my hand. Other and very diffthrent thoughts came crowding with impetuous vehemence over 'me, -joy unspeaka- ble for the astounding intelligence, and a wild, con-  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7785-00000038"/> : 66  SIX HUArDRED DOLJLARS A    YEAR. fused, but heart-scalding apprehension for what might be the fate of my poor husband. All business was suspended for the day. The news ran with lightning speed from street to street, and the entire population poured out of their houses, congre-? gating in the open air to congratulate each other on the glorious event. Though confidently expected, yet when the news of the crushing out of the Rebellion, and the fall of the rebel capital actually came, it was difficult to realize the fact, The public joy was un- bounded. Bells rang, men shook each other by the hand, boys shouted through the streets, and innumer- able -flags were hung out from loyal houses. The sympathizers with treason alone were undemonstrative -and dumb. They shunned the public streets. The news was as unwelcome to them, as it was glorious to us. But how could I, and thousands of other wives and mothers feel, when the first exhilarating thrill of joy had subsided? There were such in every city and village throughout the country. Along the tele- graphic wires the victory was flashing exultation into the remotest hamlet, then to be succeeded by the same joy, the same misgivings, and the same alarrA which came over me.  O, how many griefs even a great victory must invariably bring! Could the joy of any family be full until assured that its dear ones were safe!' What was even Richmond to us, if they were not? So I waited, watched, and prayed, until at last -O0 blessedness of relief! -a letter came from Arthur, to tell me of the glorious news, and of his own safety in that awful campaign. Then I could listen .to the news of Lde's surrender, and feel that there was indeed comfort in the message; for he had helped to earn the laurels, and yet had gone through the battle without a scratch or bruise. But other homes had been darkened by the loss of fathers and sons. The same mail which brought news that the light of mine had been spared came freighted ,.   SIX HUNDRED DOL,LARS A     YEAR.   67 with intelligence that theirs had been extinguished. There were dreadful lists of the killed and wounded in every newspaper.. Our own little village contained several families wherein there were new-made widows and orphans. As time rolled on, the maimed and wounded were brought home, some to languish and pass away, others to survive as helpless cripples dur- ing the remainder of their lives. I could not forget these. Peace, grateful as it might be to the nation, could bring no adequate consolation to these desolated families.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7785-00000039"/> CHAPTER VIII. MY NEw HOME. - INVESTMENTS. - PLANS FOR 'THE FUTURE.-- ANXIETIES, AND CONSOLATIONS. -MY MOTHER. - HER EXPE- RIENCES. -- ARTHR'S RETURN. - GOING HOME AGAIN. - IM- PROVED PROSPECTS. --HOUSEKEEPING ONCE MORE. -B   -Y father, who still lives in all the vigor of I, a green old age, is one of the most af- / fectionate' of parents,-one to whom we always look up for counsel and sympathy in all our trials and emergencies. He has had a mul- titude of ups and downs himself, and is not now by any means rich, yet he had welcomed me to his home, the old home of my birth, with all the generosity of his warm heart. There was room enough, he said, and this should be my home as long as I might choose to stay. When I spoke of some remuneration, he re- fused to listen to the idea, and bade me avail myself of this opportunity to save a little, and ( grow rich." I know he felt too glad to have me once more at home, to think of wishing any compensation for my board; and as he did not need it -at all, being himself in very comfortable circumstances, I determined to act on. his advice. I already had the eight hundred dollars of Arthur's bounty invested, and in three months more added to it the five hundred which I had by that time received from Mr. Gregg for rent, having paid the owner of the house myself from the soldier's pay that I had drawn from government, the deficiency being made up by my own fancy-work, still pursued as opportunity offered. Thus I had thirteen hundred dollars invested, which drew enough interest to pay all my trifling expenses for self and baby.   SIX HUNDRED DOL LARS A YEAR.       69 I felt that we were really growing rich, and began to lay plans for the future, against the happy time when Arthur should return, and we should once more dwell together in our cgsey little home. How well-it would be, I thought, to own that dear little place, and to feel that it really belonged to us; and how much delight we should' take in making those various im- provements which we had so often planned together. For, whether we admit the fact or not, we are all some- what selfish, and would rather increase our own riches than work exclusively for our neighbor.  Ever after this thought entered, my head was busy, and my hands indeed as well.   I knew that, from present appearances, I should have eighteen hundred dollars invested by the end of the year, and this was more than half enough to buy the house, which was valued by the owner at three thousand. How delight- ful would it be, I thought, if I could increase the sum by my own sales of fipcy-work during the next holi- day season! It was an idea which seemed very rea- sonable, after my previous experience, so I resolved to put it into practice. My sisters were so fond of little Percy that I was relieved of much of my charge of him, and the child'went toddling around the house in high glee, with Aunt Fanny or Sophy always beside i him to guard against mishaps. So, with all these circumstances to favor mv plans, I began my fancy-work once more, and this time with a strong incentive; for to surprise my husband on his return would be a  pleasure indeed. I was exceed- ingly saving in my own expenditures, even more so than of old; for what did I care for# dress, or such things, when he was away? It gave me, far more pleasure to fill a box with comforts and delicacies, and send it to him, than to spend the price on my own gratification. When I read his amusing descrip- tions of the receipt and distribution of such stores, I wished myself able to send one every week, instead of doing so occasionally.               \-  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7785-00000040"/> 70  SIX H-UNDRED D OLLARS A    Z'EAR. Arthur always wrote cheerfully, and thought of everything pleasant and encouraging to tell me; for he knew well that I needed a little cheering up, but I felt all the time that he must be enduring hardships which he concealed from me. When he spoke of a slight aching of the bones, after a night on picket duty, I always imagined that a violent or confirmed rheumatism had set in. So my life was one constant season of anxiety now, and not even the pleasant society of home, and old friends, could quite dispel the cloud whichi hung about my heart. Are there not enough who understand these feelings, and who have passed through the same uncomfortable experi- ence, while husband or sons were away? I know it, and to such I look for sympathy, rather than to the disinterested crowd of outsiders. But the time passed rapidly, notwithstanding; and now 'that the fighting was over, and the summer weather coming on, I hoped it would bring him back to me; for what need of soldiers, I thought, when the war is at an end? I did not know, however, that there was still a great necessity that a certain force should be kept in twenty places, as a guard in neigh- borhoods where treason and rebellion were only put to sleep, not killed, and where they might again give trouble to the government. The men who had been for years away, and had braved the storms of witlter and the heats of summer for so long a timne, had the best right to go first, and as they, too, had families waiting for them, I could not say a word of complaint when Arthur wrote me that- those last mustered in would be the last. mustered odt, and so would be detained for an indefinite period. In- stead of looking for his early return, then, I need not think of it before winter. It was a great disappoint- ment, of course, but O so much better than, might have been if peace had not already come! There would be no more toilsome marches or nights on picket duty, no more captures, and no more battles ;.so that I could           ,  ,   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 71 find some ground of consolation, even in the' midst of my grief at that long absence. As yet I have scarcely spoken of my mother. She was one of those quiet, gentle women whose sphere is home, and of that little world she is, and always has been, the light. Affectionate and unselfish, she was always ready to make sacrifices for the happiness of others. She ruled her household by love, not fear. Whatever I know of housekeeping and good managte- ment I learned from her. She entered, moreover, in- to all my plans for economizing and saving money withl as much interest as if her own future welfare in- stead of ours depended on their successful realization. When the news of Arthur's being drafted reached her she wrote at once to urge me to come to them, and everything that a mother's love could suggest for my comfort during the stay was done. Now that we were once more together, how many notes I had to compare with hers, and as we did so, day after day, how much I  could yet learn from her ripe experience!  In the kitchen she knew so well how to direct the cook, for she was an excellent one herself. If a  dish were not properly served, she detected it at once, and knew how to order it improved, for her cookery knowledge was in great measure derived from her own good sense, and a natural aptness for comhin- ing good things. If she went out to make a pudding, and was met by the announcement that there. were no eggs in the house, she did not give up all idea of the pudding for dinner on that account; but her brain was fertile in expedients, and some other variety was pro- duced without the missing ingredients, Which proved to be almost or quite as palatable. - The most savory meat pies, and stews, and delicious soups, and the light- est bread and cakes, were made when cook was sick or absent, because mother herself presided then. I   recollect my father once delivered this sage opin- ion to a friend, who was conversing with him on matters and things in general, and marrying one's daughters in particular.  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7785-00000041"/> 72   IX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. "ffto girl is fit to be married until she can make preserves and sweetmeats properly. We can always buy the bread, but not always the sweet things." Perhaps he said this because he was uncommonly fond of such articles himself; but my mother believed in teaching us the plainer, but more essential, branches of household knowledge, as well as these mere accom- plisnhments, so to speak, which are more ornamental than strictly useful. She argued that one could keep house a year without a cup of preserves in the pantry, but not a day without good bread or biscuit. During my mother's twenty-five years' experience in housekeeping, and rearing a family, she had met with various changes in fortune; for my father had not al- ways prospered as he deserved to. There had been times of great comfort, and plenty, when business was -brisk, and prices of- living low; but then would come reverses in trade, and sickness and trouble in the fam- ily. I have heard of one season especially - the year that the great National Bank suspended - when there came a universal crash, and nearly every one was more or less involved in the general ruin. In my father's o   business it wrought a sad change; not because of his owning a large amount of stock in the bank, or having deposits there, but because the credit system was large- ly in vogue, and he had a multitude of creditors, whose whole reliance was on that great institution, which, ever since the days of Washington, had ruled the financial destinies of the nation. There are enough who remember the panic of that year, and know how many widows and orphans were beggared- by the catas- trophe, - those, too, Who had lived in affluence, and never known a want. My father was doing a thriv- ing business, yet this state of affairs broke it up, and obliged him to seek other employment for the support of his growing family. Nor was he long in going to work. There was no pausing to despond or complain, but to work he went in good earnest, and before very long was on his feet   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS -A     YEAR.   73 again,-this time the wiser for experience, and not quite so ready to trust every one that wished to borrow his name or his notes. But. on my patient mother came the actual burden of stinted ,means and pinching economy.  How   often I have heard her tell of the straits in which she found herself during those cruel times; how the clothes were-.turned, and twisted, and made over many times, because new ones were not to be thought of. I know that she denied herself many comforts and  conveniences, because she preferred to see her husband  and children well clothed. These hard times lasted for a number of years, and it was a long time before my father felt able to return to even our former plain style of living. But a blessing once more crowned his efforts, and although not-yet a rich man, as this world counts such things, he nevertheless enjoyed a sufficient amount of prosperity to live at ease. Our family was once a large one; but now a brother in the far West, and three younger sisters, with myself, constitute the entire number of living children. There are five little graves, of various sizes, in the village churchyard, and they contain the -mortal part of the dear young brothers who were called so early away. When I   Iook at my mother's calm and quiet face, - - still beautiful to us, --I wonder that all those years of trouble and disappointments should have left so few lines, and so light a sprinkling of gray hairs; and I also fancy that, when my  book of experience shall be as large as hers, I shall present a far less favorable ex- terior. The longest year, however, draws: gradually to its close, and so did that year of 1865. My time had been well improved, and I had originated several beau- tiful floral designs in wax, which were sold to excellent advantage. Altogether, when my New Year's returns mere made, they amounted to two hundred and fifty dollars, - so busily had I worked, and so well had the public been pleased with my wares. Neither had my child been neglected, for I had provided him with all  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7785-00000042"/> 74  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS      A  YEAR. necessary clothing, and attended to his wants before all other business. -He was already two years old, and could talk as well as walk. I was confidently expecting my husband's return, and watched the papers with intense interest, to see when the regiment would be discharged. I knew that others who left home about the samne time were re- turning, and his turn must surely come soon. It was now the 20th of January, - bright, cold winter weather, and the ground covered with snow a foot deep. The girls- Fanny, Mary, and Sophy - had gone out for a sleigh-ride, mother had gone to visit a sick neighbor, and father was busy in his office; so I sat alone, on that winter afternoon, with Percy playing on the floor beside me. * I fancy I must have. fallen into a momen- tary doze, for I did not hear the door open softly, nor the strange footstep beside me, but I felt a kias upon my forehead, and looking up, in a half-dreamy state, I saw a pair of black eyes looking down at me from the back of the chair in which I was reclining. In a moment I was wide enough awake, and found myself clasped in my husband's arms.  He had chosen to surprise me thus, instead of writing to announce his coming. O, there were two happy hearts in that house then! Then little Percy - who could not'remember how his father really looked, but who had nevertheless grown familiar with his face from gazing often at the likeness on the wall -clapped his hands for glee, and shouted. How much we had to say to each other, and ho* quickly the hour passed before the family returned, the reader will readily imagine. When father, mother, and the girls came home, they were properly surprised to see Arthur seated be- side me, with Percy on his knee. I feel certain that no returning veteran received a more cordial welcome than he did. from all the family. There were true and heartfelt thanksgivings offered that night-by more than one inmate of-this household, because God had   SIX BUNDRED DOLA RS A     YEAR.    75 preserved him, and restored him to us again. The more I heard of his hair-breadth escapes, and various exposures to disease and danger, the more did I feel that a special Providence had protected him. Bow often had he seen the comrade just beside him fall in his place; how often the fatal bullets had whistled past his ear, and grazed his very cheek, yet found their deadly lodgement in another's breast. During the bloody battles before Richmond, those last mighty death-throes of the Rebellion, when the dead and dy- ing were falling by hundreds on every hand, he bore despatches from one side of the lines to another, and rode along the front,-a-mark for a thousand murder- ous shots; yet here again the goodness of God was his protection. It took some time to realize that he was really once more at home, and that there were no more long letters to be written or received; but I found it quite easy to reconcile myself to the change. The year was now about up for which we had let the house, and I felt a great desire to see the dear old place once more, as well as a curiosity to know how the premises had been cared for during our absence. I had heard occasionally fromn Mrs. Wilson; but, as she had merely exchanged a few calls with the Greggs, no very intimate friendship had arisen between them. Jane was still there, and was longing intensely for our return; hut it was her opinion that we would not have her long on any terms, for she had a constant and at- tentive admirer, and lwas probably thinking of soon setting up an establishment of her own. This was un- pleasant news, certainly; but how could Hblame her? Servant though she was, she had the same natural de- sires for a home of her own that I had: human nature - was much the same in her circle as in ours. It miglit be that in her own  little domic'ile she would have to work harder than in mine, with less apparent wages; but then there were other considerations to be placed in the scale, which would make them balance. I have a little toy, bought one day at a fair, which  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7785-00000043"/> 76   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. taught that moral. A pair of pincushions served for scales, and in one was placed a supposititious bag of gold, while in the other lay a heart, which far out- balanced it. So it was with our Jane, I suppose. After a few days of rest, Arthur went to town to see Mr. Landis, and talk over his future prospects. Before going, we had consulted together on the pro- priety of his demanding a large advance in salary, as a positive condition of his resuming the situation. Both my father and I thought it would be but justicelto himself and'his family, that such a demand should be made; so he departed on his errand, determined to make this proposition. Mr. Landis was really very glad to see him once more at home, and voluntarily proposed that he should resume his old duties, at an advance of two hundred dollars on his former salary, making it in future one thousand instead of eight hundred dollars. But Ar- thur, who would once have thought this a liberal offer, was convinced that he wis in a position to demand more. Heretofore he had worked for Mr. Landis with too small a remuneration, and he was determined to do so no longer. The goods produced in this factory were bringing the proprietor more than double their former prices; the cost of an employe living was also doubled; and why should we be taxed,' and nar- rowed down to such pinching economy in order to enrich him? Arthur had ascertained, moreover, that the man who had temporarily filled his place had re- ceived a compensation of fifteen hundred dollars for the year he had been there, and he knew that another could not be had at a less price. So he demanded as much, or, if Mr. Landis thought best to withhold it, he would seek employment elsewhere. Mr. Landis was ati first in- clined to demur at this bold request; but, knowing how best to promote his own interests, he at length agreed to the proposition. The day soon came for us to return once more to our house. We had been so long at the old' home that   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. " it was really painful to part again, and my sisters could hardly bear to let Percy go, - the house would be so quiet without a baby, they said, and half their employ- ment would be gone. But it was finally settled that Fanny and Sophy were to come and pay us a long visit as soon as we were settled at home, and the pleas- ant spring weather had set in; so in view of that the parting became less sad. My mother's visit is still in prospect, but will come yet, I trust. Well, almost the first thing I saw when we stepped upon the platform, as the ears stopped, was Jane's broad, bright face. Mrs. Wilson had volunteered to keep house, while she came to meet us; and the cordial grasp she gave our hands spoke very plainly how de- lighted she was to welcome us home once more. It was scarcely to be wondered at if Percy did not quite remember her at first, for he had grown so much, and even at three years old began to take on a few young gentleman airs, preferring to have his father carry him to the sidewalk, at the same time resisting all her ef- forts at sociability. But before we reached home, he had so far overcome his preferences as to yield. to the earnest importunities; and Jane bore him in her arms into the parlor and  seated him on the sofa. Here, then, we were again, in the compact little home I have so often described. How   strange it looked, at first, and yet how strangely familiar. There-were the self. same articles that I had left, and in much the same state and position, yet a curious feeling came over me as I passed from room to room, as when one tries to recall the half-forgotten pictures of a dream. Still, I had tangible evidence that this was not a dream at all but rather the realization of my hopes, -the answer to my   prayers. The Greggs had been very good tenants, and had taken excellent care of everything. A  few broken articles in the kitchen and china closet, with some slight evidences of the year's wear and tear of carpets, &amp;c., was the extent'of damage done to the property, so  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7785-00000044"/> 78  S^IX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. far as we could perceive. This was no doubt owing, in great part, to Jane's presence, and care. I do be- lieve that the conscientious girl had felt almost as much interest in keeping our things in order, as if they had been her own; and such services as these no money can buy. It was astonishing, even to ourselves, to find how soon we were again at home, as well in our feelings as in our employment. A few weeks sufficed to bring back the old routine of every-day life, together with my former plans for household expenditure. There were many changes to be made in my allowances and estimates, for wages had risen as well as other things. But then we were better able to pay the differcnce: we could not complain of these, when our income was so much larger. It was no longer only eight hundred, but had grown to fifteen hundred, with a respectable sum in government funds.  Upon the whole, now that it was all over, I sometimes began to think that it was a good thing for me that my husband had been drafted; for we were so much , better off now than a year ago. No doubt I should have thought very dif- ferently, had any calamity happened to either of us in consequence. i   An.   CHAPTER IX. GLIMPSES OF OUR NEIGRBORS. - THE WILONS. --THE STEVENSES. - THE ARDLEYS. - HGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS. - THE PAGES. - A TOUCH OF ROMANCE. --LOVE IN THE KITCHEN. --SPRING EMPLOYMENTS. - CHANGE IN KITCHEN CABINET. IN renewing our acquaintance with old friends and neighbors, and inquiring a little into their affairs, we found that some few changes had occurred in their re- spective circumstances. The Wilsons still lived in the house adjoining ours, which was very agreeable to me. Mrs. Wilson had considerable news to communicate, for she was somewhat of a gossip, and liked to under- stand a little about other people's affairs, as well as her own.  Besides, she thought I would feel interested to know of the prosperity or adversity of the various members of our social circle. To begin with their own matters, she told me that Mr. Wilson had accepted another situation, and was now getting twelve hundred dollars per annum instead of a thousand, as before. With her economical management, she    had again saved enough  to replace the two hundred dollars so hopelessly lost in the tc bottomless 'well " and being disgusted with their former experience in such matters, and undecided how to invest it safely, she had at last concluded to expend it in buying certain long-desired articles of household furniture. A new carpet covered her parlor floor, and several items of ornament had been added, which looked exceedingly well. t These are a few of the things I was to have from the profits of my  oil stock," she said, in mournful  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7785-00000045"/> 80   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A    YEAR. tones, as the recollection forced itself upon us both; "and now I am convinced that the best way to secure them is to buy at once, and never trust to future profits.' I confess that there was some reason in her remark, but I did not tell her what a huge plan I had treasured up in my head, for I hoped to surprise them all one day with the news that we had bought our house. The money was still safely invested in-government bonds, while the interest was now being compounded by constantly adding it to the principal, so that my hoard was increasing daily. I had no less than twenty-two hundred dollars thus laid up, and Arthur hoped to increase it by at least four hundred, saved from the income of the present year, for we could well endure to -still economize, and deny ourselves the extras which larger means would have furnished, in order to secure ourselves a comfortable and permanent home. There was one class of citizens upon whom the pressure of the times came with the heaviest weight, and that was the widows, or others, who lived upon limited incomes, derived from real estate or stocks. The increased cost of all the necessaries of life was met by no corresponding increase in their means of living. Their rents might be somewhat higher, but the taxes were also doubled. For such, therefore, these, were very cruel times. Our friend, Mrs. Stevens, was one of this class; and her income, small in the beginning, and requiring, even in good times, the strict- est economy to render it sufficient to support them re- spectably, was now altogether inadequate. I suppose this had been the case for some time, and that they must have been getting behindhand sadly, although they kept up the same appearances, and never hinted, even to their most intimate friends, how straitened they were. 'But within a few months, Mrs. Wilson told me, the two daughters had been obliged to open a school, and by this ineans contribute to their own support. It will be hard for them to give up their good suppers,-   SIX HUNDRED E  DOLr,  8 A  YEER.  8, for they really enjoyed treating their friends,-but I trust they-will, nevertheless, do so in future. Surely no one would enjoy partaking of their feasts when their circumstances are so well'known. I still think our own plan is best. In looking around further among our friends, what different ideas I find prevailing, -ideas of enjoyment, of expediency, of economy and household nanage- ment.  After Mr. Travis moved away from     the house across the street, a' family named Ardley came into it. We had some knowledge of them before they came, and so of course went to call on them as soon as they were fixed. The parlor was not only elegantly, but gorgeously furnished, with a grand display of lace curtains, rosewood and brocatelle sofas, mirrors, and mantel ornaments of the most costly description. There was a, pretentious style about the whole estab- lishment that impressed one exceedingly, and the white- aproned colored boy who opened the front-door would have answered the same purpose in a millionnaire's man'sion, so well had he been trained to the business. Mrs. Ardley entered the room with her oldest daughter, a pretty but idealess girl of twenty, and received us with great ease and affability. Their conversation was commonplace, though there was always something about the whole tamily which pleased me, in spite of tie dif- ference in our views and styles of living. We had exchanged several calls before I left home, and now that we were once more settled, the acquaintance was renewed, and we grew quite sociable, occasionally com- paring notes in housekeeping. I  then discovered how differently we two' families lived, on about the same income. Mrs.- Ardlev's thoughts were all on show, while mine were on com - fort.' She kept no servant but the black boy I had seen, whom she had taken to bring up, thus securing his services with no further cost than his food and clothing.  She and her daughters did the rest of the work, and lived on as little as possible. I/have heard 6        - *  /  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7785-00000046"/> 82  BIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. that often they had only mush and potatoes, or some such thing for dinner, and bought the cheapest meat in the market, drinking also the cheapest substitutes for coffee, and the poorest tea. This was when they were alone, of course; but when company came, it was quite different, and a temporary cook was employed, who served up the most sumptuous meals in the high- est French style. Once when Mrs. Ardley was ill, I was sent for to see her, and went up into her chamber,- a poorly furnished- room, with the commonest wooden- bottomed chairs, f coarse straw bed, and no carpet on the cold floor. I was surprised to see it, for the grand appearance of everything down stairs did not corre- spond with the poverty displayed above. I caught a glimpse of the large front bedroom) however, and there saw that things were in quite different style. A large and massive walnut bedstead, with carved head- board, a handsome dressing-table to match, with all the other belongings of an elegant chamber, a rich carpet also covering the floor. This. was the state chamber into which company were shown ; but it was kept shut up on all other occasions, as too good to use. The money, moreover, that had been expended on the furniture of that one room would have furnished all the others in neat and comfortable style; but this would not have comported with Mrs. Ardley's notions. She had been seized with a sudden illness, and was alarmed, or she would not have had me see her bare and uncomfortable-looking, room, and but for that ac- cident I probably never should have been allowed to enter it. Both Mrs. Ardley and her daughters dressed in splen- did style. Several new silk dresses apiece, with costly trimmings, were their annual allowance, besides bon- nets, gloves, and such thingS, in great profusion. Every year they went to one or other of the fashion- able watering-places, dashed away for a few weeks, and, then returned to their peculiar way of living for the remainder of the year. All that meanness and   SIX HUNDRED   DOLLARS A   YEAR.    83 stinting was practised during the other months, in order that they might appear wealthy to the world. As for those splendid clothes, I presume I enjoyed th6 looking at them quite as much as I should the wearing of them. I do not know whether Mr. Ardley enjoyed such management or not, but Arthur always pitied him, never feeling any desire to exchange establishments. At the corner of the street in which we live there is a little grocery store, where for many years a worthy couple had dwelt, and dispensed the little packages of sugar and tea tO the surrounding neighborhood. The head of the business-one George Page--had been in poor health for a long time, and so the greater part of the management devolved upon his wife. Like all others, they felt the pressure of the times, for their profits were no larger, though the prices charged were higher. The business would scarcely have supported them, and paid the doctor's and apothecary's bills too, but for Mrs. Page's industry. She toiled constantly with her needle to supply the deficiency. We had always patronized the store from a feeling of duty, as well as because it was convenient to send there for the supply of hundreds of-little every-day wants. I had observed how sick the poor man looked, as he sat be- hind the counter at the books, and had often stopped to ask after his health when my purchases were com- pleted; yet I was hardly prepared to hear of his sudden death, within a month after we left our house. Now Mrs. Wilson -had some further intelligence for me, which seemed very romantic "indeed,- and explained why Mrs. Page was .no-'longer behind the counter of the grocery, or interested in the business. It seems that the Pages 'had a friend, who was wealthy and lib- eral, and had many a time stepped forward to help them when they were hard pressed and could see no way to escape from some troublesome creditor. He was a bachelor, past middle age, of rather eccentric habits, and although possessed of fashionable relatives, who would have willingly tolerated his peculiarities  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7785-00000047"/> 84  SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. for the sake of - his liberal gifts, 'and the anticipated reversion' hereafter, yet he preferred the society of such unpretending people as the Pages, and passed the greater part of his time in their little back parlor, reading the papers and smoking. Go there when you would, you might see Mr. Temple, sitting with his feet up on a chair-back or table, enjoying his cigar, while the Pages waited on their customers. Occasion- ally,'when business was very brisk, I have seen him come into the shop to help a little, although I must confess he did it rather awkwardly. I had heard of Mr. Page's death, or rather read it in the newspaper, at'the time it occurred, but ince  then had heard nothing further of, his widow. No doubt she grieved for her kind husband, but was as well able to maintain herself now as before his death, because she had done most of the business for many pre- vious years; so she continued the little grocery as usual. Mr. Temple was a man of strict propriety, and from the time of the old man's death he discontinued his long visits to the house, only calling in every day to inquire after the widow's health, and undertaking any commission in the way of business. Indeed, he saved her many a walk down along the wharves, when her stock needed replenishing. But the habits of years were rot so easily to be yielded. He missed the little back parlor, and those pleasant hours of quiet loung- ing with his cigar, but most of all he -missed Mrs. Page herself. He could not go there now, as in former times, because propriety would be violated by the fre- quent visits of a bachelor to a widow. So, after think- -ing it all over, and trying to devise an expedient, by --which both himself and the'public should be entirely satisfied, he made her an offer of marriage, and- surely, not strange to say - it was accepted by the widow, - not, perhaps, from any disrespect to the dead, or forgetfulness of all he had been to her, but because, at her ripe age, she had come to regard such momen- tous questions in a common-sense light, and the choice   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 85 between a life of toil and one of luxury and rest was not difficult, to make. -So, to close my story, they were married, without waiting to prepare a grand trousseau, or issue many invitations. They went out one evpning, as if for a walk, called at the minister's house, told their errand, - a very common one, - and were quickly made one. Next day the paper con- tained the simple announcement, with the addition of "No cards." This, then, is why Mrs. Page is no longer behind the counter of the old corne grocery. There is no Mrs. Page now; but Mrs. Temple lives in an elegant house at the other end of- the town, has servants to / wait on her, and plenty of money to spend as she likes. They have just been off on an extensive tour, to visit the White Mountains, the great lakes, and Niagara, and I hope soon to call and congratulate her on her pleasant prospects. So moves the world. We are down one day, at the bottom of fortune's ever-revolv- ing wheel, and up the next. I cannot help hoping that even we, too, are now moving in the upward di- rection. I remembered with considerable uneasiness the ru- mor I had heard in regard to Jane's probable matri- monial intentions, and intended, as soon as I could, to ascertain how much truth there might be in the story. One day when I was in the kitchen, mixing some cake, I began sounding her on the subject. " Jane," I observed, in a half-indifferent way, "I hear you are talking of leaving me soon; I hope it is not so." Her face became suddenly very red; she was evi- dently much confused by the unexpected question, but was too truthful to deny that I had some reason for asking it. "Not verv soon, ma'am," was all she could answer. "Well, Jane, and who is the happy young man?" I inquired, kindly. "I hope you will do well, and get a good husband."  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7785-00000048"/> 86  SIX HUNDRED DOOLTARS A YEAR. -"His name is William Burns," she replied, with 'face still averted. "He is drayman at the factory." It was manifestly an effort to tell thus much of her private business, and yet she no doubt wished me to know it,- we so naturally wish others to know of whatever good luck\. befalls us, - and as I. pressed the subject still further, I learned that in one short month she expected to go to room-keeping with the said William Burns, She declared that she was glad I had asked her, for she did not know how to tell mre herself. The subject was one in which I was nearly as much interested as she, I thought, and a month was none too long for me to look around for a new domestic. Although Jane was still an excellent servant, and did my bidding as of old, there was evidently some change in her, and she was not quite so particular about her work as formerly; but I made great allowance for her under the circumstances. During her stay with the Greggs she had acquired new ideas, and had fallen, I suppose, into a different routine of duties, for Mrs. Gregg was a person who seldom   went into her kitchen, while her daughters were too indolent and fond of reading and walking to undertake much in the housekeeping line. So all devolved upon Jane, and she' had, as a natural consequence, learned to think rather too highly of her own knowledge. But as the change was near, I did not care to create a dis- turbance by fault-finding, and so things remained for the present as they had been. The ice being now broken, she frequently talked to me about her plans and prospects, which were very moderate and reasonable. I saw William once in a while, when he called for her on Sunday afternoons. He was a smart, good-looking fellow, and I hope will make her a good husband. I know she will manage his house well, and be a kind and faithful wife. The first of April was now here, and Arthur had resumed his morning hours in the garden. There was considerable to be done in the way of tying up 's   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR.  87 and trimming the bushes, with some changes to be made in the order of arrangements, having in view our permanent occupation of the premises. A row of ,raspberries was to be set out, as well as a bed of straw- berries, while one or two pear and peach trees were already planted. These, of course, will come into bearing hereafter, but it will be pleasant to have such things as an abundance of fresh and ripe berries and peaches in our own garden, especially as they are always scarce and dear in the markets. It was an early spring, this year, with us. By the middle of the month our beds of salad, radishes, and onions- were all planted, while the flower-beds were spaded and smoothed ready for the seeds, all which I preferred planting myself. In-doors, I was making the most of Jane's remaining weeks, by having the house cleaned and put in order for spring. Carpets were taken up and shaken on the grass out- side, and paint and windows well cleaned, while the closets were my especial charge. , I always chose to do them myself, excepting only those in the kitchen, as I thus became acquainted with the contents of the vari- ous bundles and boxes, which might otherwise be lost sight of altogether. In doing up the rolls of such articles as coats, pantaloons, and dresses, and scraps like them for mending, it is always well to write on the outside what the bundle contains, as it will fre- quently save the trouble of opening the wrong one. It is in; that way that one's scrap box or basket often gets into such confusion; for there is not always time to put everything back in proper order, and so the bundles are loosely done up and thrqwn in, trusting to the more convenient leisure moments that are never found until the next house-cleaning time comes round. In cleaning our house my rule has always been, to undertake only one room a day, and to finish it before night; then if sickness or company should come,-- for at such a timenone is nearly as unwelcome as the other,- or if one has even an evening call, you are *            ;  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7785-00000049"/> 88   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A    YEAR. not found in confusion, and tired almost to death, in the bargain. I know some housekeepers, and good ones too, who are so anxious to get the dirt all out of the house at once that they begin this annual nui- sance by taking up every carpet at once; thus leaving the family without a single comfortable place to live in. Then, of course, the upper. rooms are first finished by degrees, and afterwards the lower ones; but t/he oper- ation lasts for more than a week, during all which the men of the household are so incommoded as to be in a perpetual ill-humor. I have known families in which this domestic'chaos has been kept up so many days as to compel the male portion to dine out until order has been restored. It is this ill-judged method of cleaning the house that makes the operation a sort of periodical horror to, all concerned. If there is sick- . ness or death, or if visitors come for a night's lodging, under such management, no place in' the house is in order. This mode of upsetting things may be satis- factory to some people, lut I prefer my own plan; hence there is always a comfortable place, both for sitting and sleeping, during the whole period we are at work. When the carpets were to be put down, I ex- amined them well, to discover if there were any worn places or :moth-holes, and wherever I perceived any evidence of the same, they were turned round so as to bring the worn portion into another part of the room, first neatly darning the holes. - By using these precau- tions my carpets will last three times as long as if I omitted them, and these times of high prices are not such as to encourage waste, or to Wear out carpets needlessly. By the time we were again in order, the month of Jane's notice had expired, and-she was married to her admiring William.  I gave her a few useful items of furniture towards housekeeping, or rather room-keep- ing, in consideration of her long: and faithful services, and they-began their married life with every prospect of happiness.  Had it not been for her unfortunate   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR.    89 investment in that oil stock, which proved , beneficial  only to the knaves that set it afloat, they would have had a nice little sum laid up. But she had saved enough from subsequent earnings to buy a tolerably good supply of needful articles, and with these they were as really happy as many in higher life could have been with twenty times as much. One always has so muchrto say, or at least to think, about servants, that I must relate my subse- quent experiences with these nymphs of the kitchen. Though much has already been written on this sub- ject, yet it is one about which a great deal more talking is done. I have been in? numerous social companies wh re the whole conversation was concern- ing each speaker's servants. Somehow we always, seem to select topics which give full swing for scold- ing; and as every housekeeper instinctively recognizes this as affording unlimited scope for the indulgence of that propensity, so every one naturally falls into the habit of discussing the plagues of domestics. These long discussions and-recitals and complaints are very great annoyances to me, - so much so that, when entertaining company, I never introduce them, con- -sidering it an evidence of deficient breeding, or a dearth of topics, to make them more than an incident. But now they are a part of my story, as well as a very essential one, as my readers may be assured that, unless one looks sharply to the ways of her servant, she will find six hundred a year to be so scant an allowance that there must indeed be pinching times in the house. My new girl was an individual of thp Hibernian per- suasion. Of latter years we seem to have no other choice. Although she came well recommended by her last mistress for sobriety, honesty, and good temper, yet I felt sure, before she had been in- the houtse one hour, that my domestic troubles were now about to begin. I went through the usual process of introducing her to the kitchen and cooking utensils, explaining fully /  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7785-00000050"/> go- 90 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. the rules of the house respecting hours, meals, &amp;c., to all of which she listened attentively, and gave assent; but my heart misgave me when she inquired how the meat should be cooked for dinner, as any one but an ignoramus would have known, from the very look and shape of the -piece I had provided, how it was to be done.  Holding up the steak in her fingers, she asked, , Is it bilin' or bakin' I 'll do to this?." "Why, Biddy," I said, in dismay, "that is a steak; did you never cook one.?" There was a vacant look upon her face, as she an- swered by another question. ci Steak, ma'am? An' sure I niver heared o' the like.' "What! never heard of a beefsteak? and you pro- fessing to be a cook?" "( An' may be it's another name ye gives it here," she said, by way of explanation. I saw, however, that reasoning was useless, and directed her to bring me the gridiron. At this she was again confounded; so I pointed it out in the bottom of the kitchen cupboard, and rolling up my sleeves in regular cook style, I pro- ceeded to wash and prepare the steak for broiling, merely bidding her to watch me closely. When I had sprinkled salt and pepper on it, I directed her how to finish the operation, which she managed to do, declar- ing as she placed it on the table that she would know how to cook it our way the nekt time. The following day we had boiled meat, and she did that pretty well, making very good soup too; but when, in a short time afterward, we had a large piece of corned beef for dinner, what was my horror, on going into the kitchen, to find the meat just burning to the bottom of my little brass preserving-kettle. She had selected this article to boil it in, rather than use the large iron pots kept for the purpose. I began to think- that my cook was not merely deficient in culinary knowledge, but, worse yet, in common sense; yet when I expressed my doubts whether or not I could keep her, she protested : '    SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR.    9x so strongly, and declared that these little mistakes would never happen again, that I felt obliged to give her a little longer trial. This Biddy, be it remembered, came to me with the highest recommendations. More- over, when catechizing her, on her first appearance as a candidate for Jane's place, there was nothing in the whole range of culinary perfection that she did not pro- fess to be fully acquainted with. *'   &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7785-00000051"/> CHAPTER X.

The running rose on the side of the building was covered with buds, and the wistaria which completely enveloped the sup- ports of our little back piazza was gorgeous with its large purple clusters. The woodbine, too, was very fragrant, and the flower-beds in front had a good show of pansies, hyacinths, and daisies. This was the first visit the girls had ever paid me, and they were pre- pared to enjoy it fully. There was much to be seen in such a large town that was quite new to them, and near- ly every day we went-to some of the standard places of interest. By degrees they made acquaintance with quite a number of the young people of the neighbor- hood, which led to various schemes of social enjoyment. Had I been better suited in the kitchen department, I should have taken greater pleasure in their society, and indeed could have had more-of it; but in the present culinary dislocation, my presence was necessary before every meal, as well as in every other depart- ment of the household work. I had found that in order to bring Biddy to anything like a reasonable degree of efficiency, I must educate her in the various departments of domestic lore.   SIX HUNDRED DOLLA1RS A     YEAR.   93 f Biddy," I said, one day after my sisters had come, sI observe that you do not use the table-brush. You know how, I hope?"  Och, yes, ma'am," she answered, and without a moment's hesitation, ( sure an' it's me that can do that same, an' did it at Mrs. Smith's." "Very well," said I, (then I would like you to brush off the crumbs every day before you bring ori the dessert. See, this is the way," I continued, taking the waiter and making the motions with my hands, as I went around the table; for I felt almost sure she did not know as much as she professed. "You will find the brush inside the closet, hanging against the, door." Notwithstanding all tlis, she would have forgotten it again, had I not reminded her as she was removing the dinner-plates after the first course. The brush, Biddy," I said, softly. She hurried to get it while I was adjusting Percy's capacious bib. Just as I looked up from that momen- tary occupation, I caught Arthur's comical look, and in an instant perceived the cause. There was my green Biddy sweeping the table with as much force as if some dusty carpet were the subject of her efforts, and using for the purpose the large black-bristled dust- ing-brush kept for stairs and corners. "Biddy!"I exclaimed, ' what on earth are you about?" "Brushing the table, ma'am; an' sure ye tould me to do it," she replied, at the same time ceasing ,opera- tions. "( Yes, but what did I tell you to do it with?"I in- quired, trying to keep a straight face, while the rest were laughing outright'at the ludicrous scene. "s An' was n't it the brush ye named, just? An' I got it fra' the cupboard where ye tould me, sure." t I supposed you knew what a table-brush was, Biddy, or I should have shown it to you," I answered as quietly as I could, but I was vexed at this fresh. proof of the girl's stupidity. I felt thankful, how-  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7785-00000052"/> " SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. ever, that no strangers had been present to witness the scene. "Can I ever teach her ' "I asked myself, for I 'was almost discouraged. Och!" she exclaimed, as I showed her the crumb- brush, "an' is it that quare, crooked thing ye maned? Sure I wondered mony a day what yees could find to do wid the likes o' that." This was her last mistake in that quarter, but, alas! there was no counting how many more unlooked-for blunders she might yet make, so I prepared to continue my instructions for an indefinite length of time. More than once I thought of Jane, and longed for another like her, but doubted whether such could again be obtained. I was paying the present apology two dollars a week, the same that I had given Jane since our return; but if that sum was a full equivalent for the latter's services, it was certainly a vast over-pay- ment in the former case. Jane and Biddy ought not to be named the same day. After a few weeks' expe- rience with this troublesome kind of help, I resolved to bear it no longer, but Arthur begged me to try her-yet a little while, for she had many good properties in spite of her stupidity, chief of which was her fondness for Percy. One day she was sweeping the parlor, and I was directing the work. "Biddy," I said, "bring me those wet tea-leaves which I told you to save for me last evening." She brought them, forthwith, and I sprinkled them over the dusty carpet. "See, Biddy, how nicely they will clear the colors of the carpet. Always save your tea-leaves for this purpose." ' Yes, ma'am," she answered, as if she fully com- prehended my meaning; and after she had swept the room by my direction, twice over, and had been around the edges with a wisp and dust-pan, the carpet looked very bright and clean. Next day we came down to breakfast and I poured out the coffee as usual,   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.       95 but no sooner had Arthur tasted the first mouthful, than he exclaimed about the peculiar flavor of the bev- erage. It was easy to tell what ailed it, for there was a decided taste of tea mingled with the coffee; 'so Biddy, known by intuition to be the Culprit, was sum- moned to explain how it had happened. "How did tea get into the coffee, Biddy?"I in- quired. "Sure, an' I put it in to clare it intirely," she an- swered. "To clear it!"Hexclaimed in astonishment. c Why, what will you do next, Biddy?" "An' it was yersel' then that tould me to do it," said the girl, in a half-frightened tone. -( Sure I niver knew that it wad do the likes till I heard it fra' yer own lips, ma'am." "I told you to clear the coffee with tea, Biddy?"I asked, more amazed than ever. "Why, you must cer- tainly be going crazy." "Sure, an' ye 'll mind on it yersel', me lady," per- sisted the girl, " for ye tould me always to save the tay- leaves for clarin' things, an' so Hjust tuk it for the coffee, - an' ain't it dare an' beautiful as ye 'd iver wish to see?"  It was simply impossible to repress the smile, al- though it was very provoking to lose one's coffee, and I knew Arthur would all day miss its cheering effects. But it was idle to argue with a person so devoid of reasoning powers as poor Biddy seemed to be. What was the use of wasting words in explaining the difference between cleaning dusty carpets and clearing or settling coffee? So I said nothing further, except to tell her never to put tea into the coffee again, andjmmediately resolved to hunt up another servant without delay. In the course of a week's time Biddy had taken her departure, and we had a tidy-looking Matilda in her place. The new incumbent seemed very efficienttand capable, entering upon her duties with the evident desire to please us. She was the very reverse of the l   &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7785-00000053"/> 96  SIX HUNDRED D OLtARS A     YEAR. last one, so I did not find it necessary to be constantly directing her. She served the meals in very nice order, waited on the table, and went through the work as if she were familiar with the business she had undertaken. It was a comfort I could not fillly express, after my late vexatious experience, and we rejoiced that our troubles in this line were over, at least for the present. My sisters' visit was now drawing to a close, and the young people had made up a picnic party in their honor, which pwas to come off a day or two before they left us. About fifty ladies and gentlemen of our ac- -quaintance were to take part in the frolic, and Arthur had prevailed on me to accompany. them. Matilda was perfectly willing to take charge of little Percy for the day, and as he was quite well, and there was noth- ing in hand to prevent her giving constant attention to the child, I finally determined to go, We left home with our well-filled baskets of provi- sions, and for once I felt like having a day of real en- joyment, - and so I did. There were no misgivings about home, for I felt sure Matilda was to be trusted; and, besides, Mrs. Wilson had promised to look in upon them in the course of the day. Well, the young folks danced,/and sang, and played games, while the older ones spread the tables and enjoyed looking on, until the shades of evening warned us that it was time to withdraw from the gay scene, and again the carriages were packed with the noisy crowd, who sang and laughed until they reached home. It was quite dark when we arrived at our door, and Arthur was waiting to receive us. I saw at a glance that something had gone wrong. "Where is Percy?"I asked at once. ,All right with him,"' was an answer that relieved me greatly; still, I wondered that the child did not run as usual to meet me, when he heard my voice. -tC Tell me, Arthur," I asked again, -, where is Percry, and has anything happened?" "(Percy is well, and Mrs. Wilson has him in her charge," he answered, "but Matilda -"   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.       97 "What about Matilda?"I inquired. , I hope she 's not sick." "Come out into the kitchen, my dear," he said, "and you shall see for yourself how nicely things have gone on since you left home." I was quite mystified by his manner; but we went out together to the kitchen, and there, to my disgust and astonishment, lay my once prized cook in all the besotted unconsciousness of a drunken spree! Around her were evidences of high doings before she had final- ly lain down, overcome with the fumes of liquor. The pans and dishes were thrown promiscuously about, as if there had been war among them; the fire was out, and consequently there was no preparation for the supper which should have been ready for us when we returned. "This is a pretty state of affairs!"I exclaimed. I I wonder what we shall do for supper." I 'll make the fire," said Arthur, ,( and we'll do with as little cooking as possible." So, suiting the action to the word, he began to remove the cinders from the grate, and to build up a fire, while I filled the tea-kettle, and set it over, and then went into my neigh- bor's to hear the particulars, and recover my child. The little fellow was playing quite contentedly on the floor, with lMrs. Wilson's cat running after his ball; but all was dropped at the sight of, mamma," and he was soon seated in my lap, ready to give his account of the day's transactions. They would have been rather unintelligible, however, if Mrs. Wilson had not first explained matters. As I had desired her to keep watchover the house and its inmates, she had done so, and went in about the middle of the morning to see if everything was well. Finding nothing amiss, so far as she could discover, she: had returned home again;, but by the middle of the afternoon she heard strange noises in the house, loud talking, and the child's screams. Of course, she flew to see what was the matter, when she found Matilda in 7  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7785-00000054"/> i  SIX HUNDRED DOLA RS A YEAR. a: high state of excitement, slamming and banging the . doors, and scattering general disorder throughout the premises. In vain she tried to reason with her - for what understanding has a drunken woman ?- so, fastening her into the kitchen, that her mischievous acts should extend no further, she carried Percy home, and awaited Arthur's return,, This was her brief but sufficient history of the unfortunate day. I felt so much indebted to her for the care and judgment she had shown that I could not find words to express it. "Bad 'Tilda," --strike Percy," -- break win- dows - and such like sentences, were all the child could say as I carried him home; but I was convinced that, but for Mrs. Wilson's timely interference, some calamity might have happened to my child. When we came into the dining-room, the whole scene had changed, and I found the table spread with bread and. butter, cold ham, and cheese, while the tea was only awaiting ouv entrance to be placed on the table also. Fanny and ,Sophy, like two useful girls, had gone to work as- soon as I went out, and had in that half-hour prepared the whole meal. After it was over they insisted also on clearing it away, while I put Percy to bed and attended to other matters about the house. When we were at length ready to sit down, the next question for settlement was, what to do with the drunk- en creature in the kitchen, who was-now snoring away in a profound sleep. It was not very safe, certainly, to leave her in the kitchen all night, yet it would be no small undertaking to move her up to her chamber. So we decided to let her stay where she lay, on the floor, but Arthur ~was to come down occasionally during the night, to see that all was safe. I passed a very uncomfortable night, with dreams of drunken orgies and houses on fire to annoy and startle me,; but at length morning came, and when Arthur went down early to wake her, the effects of the liquor had in great measure passed off.  She was no doubt :i:. ~   ashamed of her conduct, and sorry that she had be- _:~ _   1*   ".  ,f1     .  -   '                        . - SIX HUNDRED DOLLTARS A         YEAR.  trayed herself; but nothing was said in allusion to the subject that day, only I was resolved to part with her as soon as I could hear of a substitute. I thought that even another Biddy, with her unconquerable stupidity, would be better than one with this dreadful failing. The month of my sisters' visit had come to its end, and they left us alone again.  They were so full of life and gayety that we missed their society sadly, but I knew that mother was missing them even more, so I could not say a word. As soon as they were gone I set about finding another servant, and this time took a rough-looking yet civil-spoken Irishwoman, who made no professions of knowledge, but said she was willing and anxious to learn.  Having gained some experience within the last few months, I was ready to try this representative of ~ rather different class, and once more began the business of education, in hope of producing something passable. Perfection is a thing not to be thought of, - certainly not at two dollars a week. Thus far my plan has succeeded, and Peggy has fallen into our ways remarkably well. She fulfils all her duties according to our established routine,- washes on Monday; irons on Tuesday; cleans up the cellars, kitchen, and pantries on Wednesday; sweeps the upper rooms on Thursday, and thealower ones on Friday; and bakes, scrubs, and rubs the silver.on Sat- urday.  Besides this, the staircases are swept and dusted twice a week, the front hall every day and windows are washed whenever necessary, - say once in two or three weeks. There is always time on Thursday or Friday for any extra jobs such as this. Thus the work is pretty equally distributed over the six days of the week, and there is no undue crowding or weariness, because of doing too much and too many things in one day. If it rains on Monday, of course we cannot wash, but we can do something else, -clean the cupboards, rub the silver, or sweep some part of the house; so nothing need get behindhand that week,   &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7785-00000055"/> Oo SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. merely because the usual arrangement is disturbed. Peggy is by no means a perfect girl,- not even as good as Jane; still I live in hopes of making a very excellent servant of her in time, and after my last two experiences I can be truly thankful that I have lighted on one as good as she. I began my history with the intention of showing how we managed to live, in a tolerably comfortable and genteel way, on six hundred a year, and think I have proved by actual figures that it was done. Prices of everything then were high, - very high, - but now, in this year of 1866, they are still higher, and where they are to stop no one appears able or willing to tell. If we had not received that acceptable and most timely increase of our income, we must have made up our minds to one of two thins,- either to cut down our expenses, by doing without many of the articles named on my list as among the most ordinary comforts of life, or we should be cqmpelled to go in debt. Of the two evils we should c'tainly choose the lesser, and so preferred to live' on mush or potatoes rather than go beyond our means. With our present thirteen hun- dred dollars, clear of house-rent, we were indeed very comfortable; but even this sum in paper money is not very different from six hundred in gold a few years ago. When we bought sugar at nine cents the pound instead of twenty, and coffee for sixteen instead of fifty, - when the servant's wages were a dollar and a quarter instead of two dollars and upwards, and good butter could be had all the year at an average of thirty instead of sixty cents, I surely need not argue the question. Butter appears to be a great stumbling-block in the way of every thrifty housekeeper.  It goes up and comes down as spasmodically as even oil stocks did.. .The conspiracy to put them up was a merely tempora- ry affair, running its course and then collapsing, all within two years. But in the bread-and-butter market the combination to put up prices, and make them stay *                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~/   i~SIX HUNDRED DOT7rJAS A YEAR*.  SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR1S A YEAR. 1o0   up, appears to be as enduring as it is formidable. When a spell of dry weather occurs, the farmers have always excused themselves by saying there was no grass for the cows. When, on the other hand, the rains were abundant and pasture was at its best, I inquired why they continued to extort such prices from us, the cool answer was, "Because we can get them." One of them, an impudent fellow, told me one day that the grass, like everything else, was rising. But when a joke is aimed at one's pockets and happens to go direct to the mark, I do not consider it particularly palatable. If thus suffering in the butter line, we had the satis- faction of knowing that our money still obtained for us a full pound. But. it was very-different with the baker. His loaves and rolls had a habit of diminish- ing in size- that at last became chronic, and this not- withstanding that his price was doubled. If flour went up, then down went the loaves. The baker was evi- dently a close observer of the rising flour-market, blit strangely indifferent to a falling market. Thus there seemed to be a conspiracy between the bread-and-butter men to advance prices, which is in full operation as I write. The butcher also should come in- for an equal share of housekeeping denunciation.  His prices be- came as extortionate as either of the others', nor is there any present appearance of abatement. I had ascertained long ago how much cheaper it is to make one's own bread, and hence we rarely called on the baker. One morning, however, being unexpect- edly out of home-made bread, we were forced to: send to him for a supply. When sitting, down to breakfast, Arthur was almost confounded at the shrunken appear- ance of the loaf upon the table, compared with those of former times. He made no complaint, for where would have been the use ? but said the thing brought to his mind a conversation he had read, the day before, in the newspaper. A man was roused up on morn- ing by a ring at the door-bell, and, putting his head out at the window, inquired, - &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7785-00000056"/> Ioz SIX HULNDRtD DOLL4RS A YEAR.  What is it  Who's therel?" "- The baker, sir, witi bread," was the reply. ',Nonsense!  What's the use of waking one up for such a trifle? Put it in at the keyhole." We laughed over the caricature, and found the mag- nitude of our appetites quite adequate to the loaf. But the subject subsequently attracted so much of my" husband's thoughts, that he went into quite an elaborate investigation of the question of how much profit the baker was making out of us.    He could find no one able to give him the exact particulars; but in the end discovered'the following statement in a newspaper, which further inquiry satisfied him was correct, or very nearly so. "A barrel of good flour will make 280 pounds of dough, which will lose in baking one eighth, or 35 pounds, leaving 245 pounds bread, which makes, at 1 pound 6 ounces per' loaf, 178 loaves, which at ten cents per loaf amounts to . $17.80 Flour-costs from $6 to $ 10, call it $9 . 9.00 Leaving gross profits per barrel . . . $8.80 Rolls are 10 cents per pound, making . $ 24.60 Deduct cost of flour ..         9.00 Gross profit . $15.50 "Qake .at 50 cents per pound, the profit varies from $ 125 to $175 per barrel.

It seemed that the careful author of these calcula- tions had been as crusty as the loaves about which he was writing, and he went on to say that there was a rem-        , *  -  *"  *    /  *  -   SIX HUNDRED DOT, lRRS A     YEAR.   3 10 edy for this extortion. He recommended every house- keeper to require of his baker fifteen ounces of bread for five cents, or stop dealing with him; but better yet, let every family bake its own bread. He concludes by saying:- "Let every family that is not ashamed to save, for fear of being called parsimonious, buy a hominy mill, get their corn and wheat by the bushel, and grind their own Graham flour, cracked wheat, hominy, and meal. They will save one half in the cost of these articles, and by eating more coarse food, save some doctor's as well as baker's bills." But we were not reformers, and could not think of undertaking the great task of making twenty or thirty bakers do what we thought right, so we continued to live as before, avoiding the craft as much as possible. I can distinctly remember when my mother would buy a quarter of fine mutton from the farmers, at four cents the pound. No doubt it paid them to sell it at that price, or they would not have thus sold it from year to year. The calves' heads from which she mades such delicious mock-turtle cost only, twelve cents each, and made a plentiful dinner for the whole family. Now the mutton brings twenty cents the pound, and the calves' heads forty cents apiece. Yet we must have the meat, and the butter, and all such things, be the price never so high.  If we have, therefore, a larger nominal sum to live upon, I contend that, while prices continue as they are at present, we have in reality very little more than the six hundred a year with which we began housekeeping. But granting, for the sake of argument, that we have a little more than formerly, - how easy it is to enlarge our phylacteries, and the borders of our gar- [ ments. How easy to indulge in a few more luxuries than in former times, and how  small an apparent increase in our expenses will absorb the whole differ- ence in our means. That reminds me to mention that I lately called on our old acquaintance Mrs. Temple, once Mrs. Page.   .              .  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7785-00000057"/> I04 4IX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. I found her in her beautiful house, and I could see that she took great pleasure in displaying every part of her! complete establishment. Here was the elegant drawing-room, furnished in Wilton, rosewood, broca- telle, and--lace, with several costly paintings upon the walls, and many items of tasteful bijouterie upon the tables and etagere. An elegant dining-room, with a profusion- of cut glass displayed upon the massive side- board, and appropriate frescoes upon the walls; while up stairs the library and chambers were models of taste and convenience. I was filled with wonder at the discernment displayed in the selections, for to a person who has filled Mrs. Temple's former humble station, and never enjoyed anything grander than the back parlor of that little grocery, the very question of what to get must be of difficult solution. She was so full of her house, however, that she soon enlightened me on that point. Mr. Temple had purchased the entire establishment front a gentleman about to sail for Europe,- a connoisseur in everything beautiful; hence- the perfect taste and harmony of detail, which I had remarked. When we had gone over the house, she took me into a third-story back building, in which, was gathered the- old furniture of her former little back parlor, -a worn-out sofa, a round, table, secretary, and a few old chairs. A faded carpet covered the floor, and there stood the cigar-stand just as it used to do when Mr. Temple smoked behind the grocery. All was complete, except the gentleman himself,-who had just then gone out for a walk. This Nas their sitting-room, she said, declaring at the same time that it -felt more like home than any other part of the house. When she went into the grand drawing-room she was not at home. Books had no special interest or value in her uneducated mind; and indeed, had the rare volumes which filled the shelves of those gothic cases been mere shams of wood and paint, they would have been quite as attractive in her eyes. It sounded right   SIX HUNDRED D OLL4a RS A YEAR.     o05 to talk of " the library," but what idea did the words convey to a vacant mind . So the case resolved itself into just this: the entire house was to be kept for show, shut up for fear the sun would fade the blinds or injure the carpets, and quite too good to use, whilst the true home feeling which cheers and brightens their lives is found, after all, in that back up-stairs depart- ment, with the old and freely-used furniture. What a comment,' I thought, on our capacity,  for enjoyment, I mean, - and how small a space will contain the essentials of our happiness! Yet Mrs. Temple's employment was her show-house, wherein she doubtless took the sincerest pleasure, displaying it- to her friends, and. walking around it many times a day herself, as a visitor would do, to admire and arrange its beauties. She could not trust a servant to sweep and dust those delicate things, although several were kept; but, true to her old lifetime habits of labor, she did the hardest of the work herself, and found that with increased possessions came also an increase of care. So I took my leave of Mrs. Temple and her. splendid establishment, and came back to my own humble little home, without one feeling of dissatisfac- tion, or the shadow of an envious thought. Here, all our modest furniture is for use, not show, and nothing is too elegant to be used. Our parlor is cheerful, bright, and home-like. It is true, the sun will yet fade the gay colors of the carpet, and the footfall of con- stant occupation may wear it bare, and even into holes; but the years of social comfort that must intervene will more than compensate for such depreciation. A - prime luxury of home is the habit of freely using its best portions for yourself. !  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7785-00000058"/> CHAPTER XI. CHANGED TIMES. -THE SHODDYITES. - SCARCITY OF HOUSES. - DISASTERS AND STRUGGLES. - THE TWINS. - CONTRASTS. HE reader may have been surprised to learn -that the comparatively moderate house we occupied had commanded so high a rent as a thousand dollars a year. But the war had broken up the old order of prices, and changed the lowest into what in former times would have been the highest, I presume it must have been the abun- dance of paper money that produced this change, - at least, this is a reasonable inference. These new thou- sands of millions of paper dollars, which were scattered over the country by the necessities of the war, fell to the share of numerous government contractors, who -thus became suddenly rich. The government, as we have before said, was a huge customer for every de- scription of manufactured goods, and bought its supplies by contract. Judging by what the newspapers said, it appeared to me that whoever was lucky enough to secure a large contract was equally sure of a large fortune. No matter how poor a man might be, if he only obtained a contract, we might expect to witness his speedy transformation from absolute poverty to abundant wealth.  Some of these instances were really wonderful. -There was a very ingenious middle-aged man within our knowledge, whose dissipation had reduced him to the condition of a pauper in the almshouse. While thus domiciled, he invented a little convenience for the   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. 107 soldiers in their tents. I think it was a light, portable cooking apparatus. By help of an acquaintance he had it patented, and then that acquaintance, who- had a friend at headquarters, managed to secure a contract for the supply of an immense number for the army. The profit was so great that all three became rich. Two of them had previously been living on their wits, while the other had lived on the public. As might have been expected, the sudden change from poverty to wealth tempted them all into lavish expenditures,. -their money had come easily and it must needs go in the same easy way. The pauper came out of the almshouse, and forthwith set up as a gentleman. This description of people were known as " shoddy- ites." The origin of the word is easily traced to the worthless imitations palmed off by unprincipled manu- facturers for genuine cloth. Perhaps it is quite as easy to detect the 4' shoddy" in society as in goods: time, at least, will prove them both. Every city was full of this class. As all had abundance of money, so all spent it with' a sort of reckless extravagance that as- tonished such plain people as ourselves. If they wanted any luxury, the price was no discouragement. It was not the men only that were thus foolish: the wives and daughters of the "' shoddyites " were carried away by the same mania for spending money. Never having had any until now, they appeared to have no just conception of its value, and became impatient to part with it. I think that women's dresses were never so extravagant; and it was curious to think .how we had all accustomed ourselves to the high prices of ma- terial. Though silks and laces were two or three times as high as formerly, yet those who wanted them bought them just as readily. Indeed, the high price of an article really seemed to promote its sale, and common things fell into comparative disuse. It was xyell ascertained that more trinkets and jew- elry, gold watches and precious stones, found buyers in one year of these times than in three preceding * O  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7785-00000059"/> I08 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. ones.  Then, at the watering-places there was an un- precedented crowd of parvenus, who really seemed to enjoy themselves in proportion to the unheard-of prices charged by the landlords.   This general rise must -necessarily extend to house and furniture.   Apart from  the bewildering abundance of paper money, there were two other causes operating to produce a rise in them. There were fewer houses being built than formerly, owing to the advance in wages and materials. Then there was a large influx of refugees from the South, who crowded the cities and villages of the Noith, having been driven from home by the discomforts existing  there. A   demand was thus created for houses, which could not be supplied except at an advanced- price.  The newspapers contained multitudes of advertisements from persons offering large premiums to any one who would procure them a house.  Several of our neighbors were tempted by even higher prices than we obtained to give up house and furniture, and take to, boarding with their friends. Thus it was that I found' the unsettled condition of public affairs, and the hazards to which my husband had been exposed in the army, had some slight show of compensation. To put on record a memorial of how matters stood at this time, I copy from a New York paper the fol- lowing remarks, descriptive of the condition of things in a great city':- "H Houses are prime necessities and absolute conditions of civili- zation. A city may be extremely wealthy, and growing still richer every year ; but if it lacks domiciliary conveniences for all its population, if it has more heads to be covered than it has roofs to shelter them, it has failed comparatively toiemerge from a con- dition of primitive barbarism. As evidence of this condition, it will continue to exhibit the vices, and succumb to the vicissitudes, of a ruder life, not merely in the lack of material comforts, but in a low average of longevity and a low standard of morals. Society without houses id society without homes i and this implies both the absence of the purest enjoyments of which man is capable, and a deficiency of those influences which secure the peace and per- 1/   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR1. og9 petuity of States. Yet every year New York exhibits the spectacle of thousands upon thousands of well-dressed vagrants, of beggars with money in their -pockets, wandering wildly about, consulting fran- ticly the advertisements in the newspapers, holding agitated inter- views with the brokers, and yet not at all sure that on the first of May they will not be driven to elect between a tabernacle upon the Battery, and the cold and greasy boarding-house with third-class accommodations and first-class prices. There is hardly a man in New York who has a family to shelter, and whose means are too , moderate to admit of the luxury of a fee simple, who has not gone through the purgatory of house-hunting, and been driven almost to the depth of despair by the extortions of landlords, and the ap- parent impossibility of finding a suitable residence. High rents are the inevitable result of a limited supply of houses. While the demand continues, landlords will continue to ask an enormous slice out of your income, for that which does not feed you, does not clothe you, does not give you a chair to sit upon nor a bed to sleep upon, but simply a roof to protect you from the sun, the rain, and the wind. A house, and a decent one, you must have, for it is the house that keeps up appearances. You cannot live in a cave, nor in a basement cellar, nor in a garret. So you cut the Gordian knot by emigrating to the rural districts, and spending most of your precious life in riding to and from the city; or you take your children to a boarding-house or hotel, in which they kno)v nothing of home, are stuffed with indigestible food, and p .sheir hours of recreation in the street with chance playmate, r in the kitchen with the servants. We have been going on in tis hand-to-mouth way for a good many years, until accumulated evils and inconven- iences have grown intolerable. 'House Wanted ' has become the mournfhllest heading next to I Child Lost ' which can be affixed to an advertisement. People believe that there is no possible way of avoiding all this botheration, trouble, and anxiety ; and, some with more and some with less philosophy, they submit to it, as in old times everybody submitted to spring phlebotomy and physic." \ But the times were out of joint in many other par- ticulars. While one 'set of people were thus easily acquiring and spending fortunes, others sank into com- parative destitution. I know that to such the former gave abundant charities; for when our cup runs over, we sometimes permit others toodrink the drops that fall,- but too rarely a drop from within the rim, - and call it charity. When the war closed, and the soldiers were discharged, our town had its full share of stragglers  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7785-00000060"/> 1o: SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A      YEAR. of various descriptions. Some of these were wounded soldiers, some mere camp-followers, others were im- postors; but all knocked at our doors, and demanded help of some sort, either of food or clothing or money, to help them homeward. I never could find it in my heart to turn away the sick or crippled hero of the loyal army without giving him whatever he solicited. A moderate contribution was rarely too much for my limited means, and while thus relieving their wants, how could I fail to return thanks to God that he had given me both the ability and the will to do so? I found, even in the closest of times, that, when the heart was all right, a trifle could be spared for such purposes, from even six hundred a year. Then, besides these, there were wives whose husbands had been reported as c( missing," some of whom may return, but many will never again be heard of; and widows, from whose stricken hearts even this faint hope had wholly gone out. All were to be sympathized with, and most of them to -be relieved. Hundreds of them, however, were nobly endeavoring to help themselves; hence there were daily calls at the door from somebody who wanted to sell the little necessaries which another class of pedlers had formerly brought, - song-books, stories of 'the war, portraits of the great generals, pic- tures of the dreadful battles, soap, combs, and shoe- lacers, and all such simple articles of trade. Little children sometimes came on these errands, all seeking to do something better than to beg.' Poor orphans! the legacy of heroic fathers to a nation which can never repay the debt it- owes them! Many of these I have taken in, and treated to the remaining cakes and coffee of the breakfast, or the fragmentary residuum of a din- ner; and I never thus took one in without feeling amply repaid by his grateful looks and words. There is one Scripture passage which cannot surely be intended to command a literal obedience. Else how can people with our limited means ever hope to be faith- ful, or win the promise? i   SIX HUNDRED DOLLTRS A     YEAR.  ixX , Never turn thy face from any poor man, and then the face of the Lord shall not be turned away from thee." How often I had heard it read in church, and medi- tated upon the subject; for with only six hundred a year we could not well feed every one who asked an alms. The residuum of our table or wardrobes we could spare, but there was certainly a limit to our giving much be- sides. Now that we had a little more to dispense, I had set apart a certain sum, which was sacred to the cause of benevolence and humanity. I could enjoy giving now, and surely it was but right that I should lend the Lord a portion of the plenty he had bestowed on me, by thus giving to his poor. One bitterly cold morniing, soon after we returned home, when the frost lay thick and crisp on every chamber window, while getting up from the breakfast- r table, a faint movement of the bell overhead gave notice that some one Was at the street door. I knew by the feebleness of the ring that it must be the effort of a child. Sure enough, on opening the door, I discovered a girl of apparently ten years, who stood shivering in the snow upon the marble step, her little arms and shoulders covered with a thin and faded shawl. A common cotton sunbonnet protected her head; but it was clean if not very warm, and from underneath it H Her sunny locks Hung down her temples like a golden fleece." I think I never saw a child whose appearance so imme- diately secured my sympathy as this one, and I was about telling her to come in out of the cold, when a boy, apparently about the same age, ran up on the steps, and, touching his hat politely, said, - , Clean off the snow, ma'am? - only a dime." Just then my husband came to the door, and, hearing the boy's question, told him to go to work, whereupon I brought the little girl in. "I 'll wait for you, sister," said the boy to her, as he saw her entering the door.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7785-00000061"/> xI2 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS, A     YEAR. "What," I inquired, as we traversed the hall on our way to the dining-room, c( is he your brother " ," Yes, ma'am. Henry and me are twins," was the reply. " O,"' she continued, as I led her up to the stove, how good it feels to be so warm!" and she put down her little basket, rubbed her benumbed hands together, and drew closer to the stove. Looking up to me as she said this, and the light falling directly on her face, I saw the two most beautiful hazel eyes that ever were set in human countenance, soft, gentle, and con- fiding. (, Am I to give this one her breakfast too?" asked Jane in a low voice. I nodded assent, and, turning to the child, I inquired if she had breakfasted. , We never get breakfast till we've made a quarter, ma'am," she replied. , But how long are you in making a quarter?"I rejoined. , Sometimes not for several hours,.sometimes not till noon, ma'am, but we've got a shilling already, this morning, and brother will get a dime from you, and that is nearly a-quarter," and a smile of satisfaction came over her young face as she counted up their col- lected earnings on that inclement morning. Then, as if alive to the fact of being still deficient, she lifted her basket from the floor, uncovered it, and, holding it up to me, inquired,- ' , Would n't you like to buy some cuffs and collars, ma'am,?" I took the basket from her hand in order to examine its contents; just as Jane looked in from the kitchen and said that breakfast was ready for the child; so, set- ting it down again, I directed the little one to- go out first, and invite her brotleto come in also. She looked at me in momentary surrise, and then bounded off to the door, where I could Pear her call out in gleeful tones,- .  "Come, brother, the go6 lady is going to give us our breakfast. Come, brother."   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 113 The boy came in, cold indeed, for it was the bitterest morning of the winter, but well-bred and respectful. He was a bluff,: robust, and honest-looking lad. - We set before them a plentiful meal, but as I sat by, appar- ently attending only to Percy, and his morning ablu- tions, I could not help noticing the strong affection which these two children manifested towards each other. The butter on the table had dwindled to a mere trifle, and Jane had forgotten to replenish it, so that a modi- cum only was left on the plate, when, not at the moment understanding what was referred to, I heard the boy whisper, - "Take it, Nancy," and, looking up, saw him handing her the plate.  ,Dear Harry, I won't have it; you take it your- self," was the reply. , And you say that you are twins?"I remarked to Henry, when they had concluded a meal which both had eaten with evident relish. ,i And how old are you?" , Nine and a half, ma'am." , What is your father's name?"I inquired. , Father's dead, ma'am; he went to the war, and got killed at Gettysburg, and mother's never been right since," replied the boy. Alas! I thought, how often I have heard that terrible story. It sometimes seemed as if I only had- escaped the common grief. "u How does your mother live?"I inquired, address- ing Nancy. "O, we help to keep her," she answered with great sprightliness. , Brother John works in a factory; and grandfather stays home, and cooks' and watches mother; and I sell collars that I buy at the factory where John works; and Henry, he does any jobs that folks give him to do."' "But do you not go, to school, Nancy?"I re- joined. "O yes, ma'am, two days in the week, and twice on Sunday; and we can both read and write." 8      &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7785-00000062"/> X14   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. She told me her mother's name and residence, and then, dismissing Harry to finish his job at the front door, I bargained with Nancy for enough collars to last me a year, and prevailed on Jane to become a purchaser also. Paying Nancy her money, and advancing Harry from a dime to a shilling, I let them go. They left the door, thanking me gratefully, and walked away hand- in-hand, he -to shovel off the snow for some one else, and she to find other customers for cuffs and collars. Next day, I took time to call upon the mother. All that the children had said was true. The father had in- deed fallen in battle, and to the delicate wife the shock b had brought a lingering death. She was sinking under a weight of grief from which, thus far, she had found no alleviation. But this is only one of a thousand unwritten domestic histories of the day. The tremendous consequences of the great war were manifestly operating almost as powerfully on the generation of mere children as upon their parents. The necessities of the latter were send- ing them into the streets to supply by premature effort the wants created by the havoc of the conflict. If its vast expenditures made thousands rich, there were still more impoverished. One of our neighbors, on returning from a trip to the West, encountered, in the cars, a boy of twelve years old, who had with him an infant sister that had not been weaned. The father, who had been living in Minnesota when the war broke out, joined the army, and was killed'in battle. The very day after the news of his -death came, the mother died, leaving the two children with none to take care of them. The boy, as if nerved by :the- crisis, set off immediately with his little sister, intending to take her to an aunt, who rej sided in Pennsylvania. -Our neighbor travelled with them several days. It was a great charge for so young a nurse, and he a boy. But when the passengers became apprsed of the circumstances of the case, the manifestations of sym-,    SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.       rS5 pathy were so general that there was no scarcity of nurses. The lady passengers relieved him- of his charge, and occasionally one who, had a baby of her own permitted this little waif to drink at the same natural fountain, while the men contributed in money. But here was a small boy laying aside childish things, and developing traits of manliness that would do honor to maturer years.  It will be remembered by many how numerous were the anecdotes of boyish ,heroism in actual battle which the army correspond- ence brought to us in the newspapers.  Thus the juvenile spirit rose, like that of the adult portion of the community, with the magnitude of the national- crisis. It appeared to. me that there were strange contrasts and incongruities about those times. Some of them, it is true, have since disappeared under the regulating in- fluence of peace, but the reader cannot have forgotten them all. At the same time that those poor little twins, with perhaps hundreds of other children, were tramping over the cold streets, endeavoring to gain a scanty livelihood, the brilliant displays in those very streets presented striking contrasts to the condition of such as sought them out on similar errands. The shop windows were surpassingly gay and tempting to the crowds which thronged the pavemehts. All ap- peared to have money wherewith to indulge their various tastes. Trinkets and precious stones, in un- precedented profusion, glistened in the plate-glass win- dows of the fashionable jewellers. In the counter- case of a single establishment a, dozen fortunes were displayed. Costly silks and shawls hung gracefilly in other equally elaborate windows, unfolding tints and patterns which would draw thousands from the delighted multitude who stopped to admire them. All that art and taste and ingenuity could chmbine, to please the fancy and exhaust the purse, was concen- trated on te shelves and counters. Surely the people had forgotten that there had just been a bloody war  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7785-00000063"/> I 6 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. in the land, and that the nation was now struggling with-a heavy debt, which would require many years of taxation to discharge. These)contrasts are visible everywhere. While hutmble homes, like that of the orphan twins, are scantily supplied with even the commonest food, the market-houses are overloaded with every possible lux- ury of the land, I see this for myself, as I mostly-do the marketing, and often think it would be impossible to collect in one place a greater profusion of good things for human consumption.  Nothing that the appetite can crave seems wanting to the well-filled and open purse. But the nation has come out safely from its long and perilous travail, and it is perhaps natural that public joy should succeed to public sorrow. It is equally natural that these contrasts and discrepancies should happen. Human life, I find, with its diversi- ties of trials and compensations, is a mystery which my poor philosophy must vainly seek to unravel. How manifold are our allotments! how checkered our destinies! We live in vanity and grossness, as well as in greatness. The Divine Intelligence alone can lift the curtain which hides from us the profound mysteries of our existence.     * '  . ' ;           '   CHAPTER XII. BurGa A HOUSs.-MRS. WLSON'S IDEAS. --FUTRE PLANS.-- MSS ARDLEY. - FASHONABLE VISITING. - MRS. PRINGLE. - A DEATH,-BED.- A LEGACY.- NANCY'S NEW HOME. WFTER all I have previously said of our in- tentions and prospects, the reader will not be astonished to hear that we have pur- chased our house. By good management, we were able by the first of August to pay $ 2,400 in cash, the balance of- $600 remaining on mortgage. Arthur hopes that in the course of a year or two that also will be paid off, so that this little home, in which we have passed such pleasant years, may be altogether our own. Mrs. Wilson was -properly surprised, as I knew she would be, to hear of such an extensive investment, and we had various confidential conversations in regard to the future alterations and improvements. I had so often, in imagination, altered the plan of the house, and seen in fancy the improved appearance of the newly papered walls, that I, longed greatly to begin. Mrs. Wilson's plans, however, were very ex- tensive, and included additions as well as alterations; for she had very grand ideas of -houses, and ought to have been born rich. Had this been the case, she would have lived in a perfect. little palace, having everything about her to correspond, - elegant and tasteful. I knew this, as I had listened to her plans at the timeoshe was building her air-castles on the oily foundations of the"Bottomless Well Company," which, e  .           ;     &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7785-00000064"/> Xt8 SIX HUNDRED DO0TLARS A    YEAR. unfortunately for her lofty architectural designs, were not of sufficient Sstrength to sustain, even those airy structures; the , Bottomless " having left in fact scarce- ly a grease-spot behind. But now that we, more moder- ate mortals, had really accomplished our desire, and were about to realize our own less pretentious dreams, she seemed tot forget her own disappointments, and enter with real:interest into our future intentions. (, Ho.* nicely you can improve your house," she said, as- we talked the matter over. "There are the old mantels, - they must come down; and the corner cupboard must be taken out of the dining-room, for nobody sees such things in handsome dining-rooms now-a-days. Then you ought to have fine inside blinds as well as outside ones. Your parlor is quite too light for my notion, and this glare will fade your carpet dreadfully after a little while. 'Besides all this, you ought to put up a library beyond the parlor, with, windows opening on to the piazza, --it would be so nice, and give such a stylish air to the house, espe- cially when you put up oak book-cases around the sides." , But, my friend," I exclaimed, -" where is the money to come-from with which to do all this Q You know'we have made a tremendous effort to pay as much on the house as we have done, and I want to feel that it is quite clear before we make any very ex- tensive improvements." , Well, of course," she rejoined, you cannot do it just now, but instead of paying off the mortgage I think I would do the improvements first, as you have it so nearly paid for.", , To tell you the truth," I said, confidentially, "I -have a little project in my head with regard to the said improvements. I have raised several hundred dollars myself towards the purchase of the house, besides helping to save all the rest;' and now I have. deter- mined to take up my fancy-work once more, and with this year's profits I mean to fix it up a little. But I   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 1I9 shall not think of adding a library yet awhile; better wait until we get enough books to fill it." "Well, to be sure, there is something in that," she continued. "But I know of one, or two persons who have no more books than you, and who yet have high cases, and glass doors lined with chintz or damask to conceal the bare shelves. No one knows how many volumes they do or do not contain; and if there is occasion to display the books, they are careful to open the door behind which the shelving is tolerably well furnished, the empty ones being kept locked." "That may do for them," I said, , but not for me. I desire nothing like a sham, - nothing for mere show. For the present, our little parlor closet in the recess by the window holds all our literary treasures; but among my purposed improvements I think of supply- ing'it with a glass door, with diamond-shaped panes. This will be both a tasteful and convenient change in our parlor." "Perhaps you are right," rejoined my friend. "A library is often such in name only, and I have often thought that there was a vast amount of pretension among these would-be literary people, who thus desire to curtain their empty shelves while they hope to be thought clever themselves." One of my long-planned improvements was a bay- window in the'parlor, in which I could place a stand for flowers in the winter. This did not meet with Mrs.- Wilson's approval, for ever since-the advent of her own new carpet, she had studied chiefly to keep out the rays of the sun, feeling sure that those bright colors would not stand in their presence.  Indeed, this care of hers had quite changed the order and atmosphere of their house. The parlor, in old times, was, like our own, plain and none too good for. daily use; but now   she could not bear to take her work- basket into it of an evening, much less in the day-- time, or let her husband smoke his cigar there while taking his ease in the large rocking-chair. No, the  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7785-00000065"/> 20o -SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. rockers would assuredly spoil the carpet, and so the chair itself was banished to the dining-room, whither the old carpet had gone before. There the sewing- chair and work-basket were also placed, and there, too,. the evenings now were always passed, instead of in the parlor as in former years. All this change in their habits had been wrought by the introduction of a new carpet, and the few other articles of strange furniture which had accompanied it; yet as she seemed to enjoy it, I did not meddle with her tastes. When my improvements are made, and my bay-window and flowers arranged, I cannot help thinking- she will ad- mire them. As to my own carpet, the colors are still good, nor-if a stray, sunbeam does occasionally shine upon it through the leaves shall I fret myself about it, but will enjoy the cheering influence and trust to the future for a new one when this has become unfit'for service. This reminds me, and perhaps the reader also, of Christopher Crowfield's experience when his wife and daughters compelled him to purchase new carpets and furniture for the bright and sunny parlor, where their pleasantest years had been past. I think'Christopher is a sensible man, and I usually take the part of wo- men on all house and home questions, yet I strongly, incline to sympathize with him on that occasion, and declare that no fears of sunshine or flies shall ever in- duce me to shut up my windows in such funereal style, while the whole family is forced to take refuge in some gloomy back room. Now, aQl our friends love to drop in, as his did, and join the cheerful circle around our evening lamp; and although it is true that I am opposed to bringing large or unsightly work into my parlor, yet I always have something ready on the cen- tre-table, - a little piece of sewing or my wax-work,- which is thus ever convenient to be picked up. Be- sides, the habit of filling up these stray half-hours produces me quite an amount of accomplished work ih the course of the year; and I know that my friends     *   SIX HUNDRED   DOLLARS A YEAf.    I2I come with more freedom, and stay longer when they do come, because they perceive that I am not losing time while conversing with them. "I cannot imagine how you manage to do so much, Mrs. D.," said Belle Ardley one day to me, as she threw herself listlessly into a corner of the sofa. , , You are always busy about something." , You know that minutes make the hours, and hours the days," I replied. "Even a few minutes at a time are worth saving." "But when one only has a little while to sit with a friend, it seems hardly worth while to hunt up work to do," she continued. "That's not the way to manage," I answered. "If I waited to hunt up the work until the visitors came, I shbuld not do much either. The right plan is to have something ready beforehand." "But our callers stay so short a time," she re- joined, " and make such-formal calls, that orie could not take the liberty. Besides, our parlor is so dark, you know, it would be quite impossible to see to do fine work." "What need of keeping it so dark in cool weather?" I asked. "Perhaps your visitors would stay longer if it were made more cheerful." "O, mamma says the curtains would be ruined by the sun, and you know it would be a pity to fade those window divans; besides, Carlos could not attend to sweeping and dusting the parlor as often as it would require, if we often sat in it." i' Of course, an apartment that is in frequent use needs more chre than one which is seldom opened," I said, (I and besides, in the dark, the dust and cobwebs won't show so plainly; but I think I should rather spend two extra hours every week, in cleaning my par- lor, than give up the use of it altogether."

I knew well what she meant by "at home," for I had so often seen elegantly dressed ladies leaving cards at their door, when I knew that the family were in. "I believe you do not see every one that comes," I said, quietly. "O dear, no," she answered, as if surprised at the remark. ( Why, do you?" ( Certainly," I said ; " if my friends take the trouble to come and see me, how could I refuse to admit them?" "O, as to that," she returned, " there are so many of them who do not dream of seeing you when they come, and would be positively disappointed if told that you were in, that it is a real kindness to them to say we are engaged, or not at home., They all know what it means, and do the same thing themselves. A card thus answers every purpose of a call." "t But what use or satisfaction can there be," I in- quired, " in continuing such visits as these from year to year?" ", None; except that one must keep up a genteel list of acquaintances," replied Miss Belle, " and then every winter they all give large parties, and we, of course, are invited." "So, after all, you know very little about there peo- ple, as I suppose your calls are made in the same way," I observed. "No, not much," she answered; "but, dear me! it would be impossible to keep up so many visiting- places if we paid regular calls to every one, just as I am doing now to you. Now, we hire a carriage for a day or two, two or three times a year, and can pay off all our visits in short order, whereas, according to the old-fashioned way, it would keep us busy forever, and we 'd never be done, either." "Then you and your friends seldom meet?"I said. (0 yes; we have a reception-day in every week; you know that is the fashionable way,- Tuesdays from eleven intil four,-and all who really wish to  *I   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A TEAR.      I23 see us can come then. If they choose to come on other days, why, whose fault is it but their own?" How much insincerity, I thought, is to be found in the world, and how many falsehoods are uttered every day by the genteel people who bow at the altar of fashion. Probably these very individuals who directed their ser-' vants to say they were "t not at home," will, next time they meet you, express their deep regret at losing your visit, and yet a fresh repetition of the same treatment must convince you that the apology had meant nothing but politeness. For my part, I am thankful that I have not many of this kind of acquaintances; for there are few things more aggravating than to be told, after walk- ing miles to see your friend, that she is ( engaged," - a phrase which in most cases means simply that she does not wish to be troubled with visitors. , I was so sorry it was you," said one of these to me, when I met her a short time after having been re, fused admission. "Why did you not send up your name, and I would have seen you?" "Because I Was told that you were engaged," I re- plied; " and when I am told that, I suppose it to mean that you are too busily employed to be interrupted." "O dear, no, you dear little unsophisticated coun- trywoman," she returned, laughing heartily; 'I was only reading a charming novel that afternoon, and thought it would be troublesome to see every one that came."            , If sincerity or insincerity is the distinguishing at- tribute of country and city ladies, then save me, thought  I, from the customs of the latter. 'When. once or twice a year, at the busy seasons of house-cleaning,or some similar employment, I find myself obliged to be " en- gaged," I always regret to hear that some dear friend has called on those unlucky days; but never intentionally, or without great cause, do I imitate the custom of my fashionable friends.

TIdid not wafer in my preferences for the sincere and truthful, rather than for the false and showy. It is surprising to find how widely I have wandered away from Mrs. Wilson, of whom I have something further to tell presently. I had visited poor Mrs. Pringle - the mother of the twins - very frequently since the accident, if I may so call it, which had brought the family to our notice, and the oftener I went the more interested I became in the case. She had suffered long from an inward dis- ease, which must have ended her days before many months; but this great grief of losing her husband had laid her at once on her back, and made her depend- ent on her children. Both Mrs. Wilson and I had now taken her under our care, so far as to send her every day a portion of our daily fare; and little Nancy came with willing steps to carry it to her mother. Ar- thur had used his influence with Mr. Landis to pro- cure constant employment for Henry, and ever since April he had been at work in the factory. His in- dustry and punctuality-are making such an impression upon his employer that' I feel satisfied he will make his way from this time forward, and some day may become a rich man.  One day, about the first of July, when the days were very sultry and oppressive, I was sent for in haste to attend the sick woman. Tears were in poor Nancy's eyes as she spoke to me, and told me how her mother had suffered during the previous night. I hastened to  the upper room which was now the home of the family, and there, as I gazed upon those haggard features, wasted by long disease, I saw that the final change was very near. She was conscious of her situation, and calm in mind. A Bible lay open upon the bed. I knew she had often studied its truths, and rejoiced in its comfortable message. Her anxieties were not now for herself, but for the children she must leaveehind her. "O Mrs. D.," she said, "what wil become of Nancy, - my poor little girl?" L  .     .   i    SIX-HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.      15 I could enter into her feelings, forI too was a mother, so I tried to satisfy her mind by promising to look after the child. But this was not enough. The little one, that very day, would be homeless, and this terrible thought was clogging her spirit with earthly cares. Could I but remove this one weight, her mortal sor- rows would be at an end. I was in a position from the peculiar responsibilities of which there seemed to be no escape, nor was there time to think of all that'might be involved in my decision. The eyes of the dying woman were fixed on my face, as if she would read there the answer to her prayers, and the fulfilment of the promise, "Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me." I must have been destitute of feeling, and unworthy the name of Christian, had I hesitated how to answer. So, taking little Nancy's hand in emine, I promised the mother to provide her with a good home, and be her friend as long as I lived. O, what a look of unutter- able gratitude lighted up that wan face, as I said the words that gave comfort to her maternal heart! It was with- this last hope that she had sent for me, and she could now forget the world, and commend her spirit into the keeping of her merciful Saviour. Nor was it' long before the gentle sleep into which she had fallen became the calm repose of death. When I went again, in the latter part of the day, all was over, and Henry and Nancy, with their older brother John, were keeping watch beside the clay that was once their mother.. The funeral expenses were paid from John's earnings, assisted by a few contributions from generous friends, to whom we told the case, and ther, having found a shelter for the' old man among some of his atquaint- ances, I brought little Nancy home with me. Henry was to share his brother John's lodgings hereafter, and from his own earnings he chose to share the cost also. I liked this spirit of independence in the boy, and feel assured that one day he will make his mark. When my husband came home that day, I told him / r                 j       -  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7785-00000068"/> I2a6 SIX-HUNDRED DOLLARS A    YEAR. 'what I had done. Indeed, I felt that .I had taken a -great responsibility on myself to thus act without first consulting him. "Have I done right?"I inquired, anxiously, when I had rehearsed the sad history. i' You could do no other, my deaf," was his assuring answer. "God has- sent the child to us, without a doubt, and we must do the best we can with our charge." But this was not to be Nancy's home, after all. Mrs. Wilson, who had never had a child, had always taken notice of the little girl, and praised her beautiful eyes and golden tresses. I knew she would have given al- most anything for such a child of her own; and now that the little orphan was thrown upon our charity in this unexpected way, she, of her own accord, proposed to take her herself, and adopt her as a daughter. The child was but ten years old. She felt sure -there was yet time to train and educate her for a useful and affec- tionate companion. So we gave her to our friend, knowing that her motherly care would be as tender as ours, and that the promise to her mother is still sacredly kept. Little Nancy is very happy in her new home. . As she trips along every morning to school, there is no brighter-looking child to be seen. She learns readily, and as she can already read and write, she is not far behind others of her age. There is an evening school near the factory, at which many of the hands attend, and both John and Henry are regular pupils. The former is a promising lad of some sixteen years, and seems to have a good turn for mechanics, which in -iime, I think, will bring him into notice. His fond- ness fIr mathematics is remarkable, and his teacher - speaks well both of his talents and his industry. The same affectionate feelings which we had, noticed on -the first day of our introduction to the twins prevails throughout the family, and marks their intercourse with each other.

N looking over my history, written with a wish to benefit my countrywomen whose incomes are no more than ours was when I JB  began to write, I have not undertaken to give too minute directions for managing a household, or lay down any programme which would not be prac- ticable for all. Myself an American woman, living in one of the Middle States, I have endeavored to give my own experiences in housekeeping in a plain and com- mon-sense way, and feel sure, that my rules can be carried out in any parf of the United States. There have been one or two books written lately in England, which are now being read with interest ev- erywhere, but the chief difficulty is that they are not altogether practicable for American housekeepers. The reason for this is obvious. The customs of society differ so greatly, at least the customs of domestic man- agement, and the very articles of diet vary so much in the two countries, that a common rule could not be of universal application. A good English or French cook will serve up the same article in twenty different ways, and will both astonish and puzzle us with the array of hard names applied to them. But then they have but these few things to work with,' and must make the most of them. Had they the variety of vegetables and fruits   SIX HUNDRED DOTLLARS A YEAR. Iz9 that we have here in America, how many courses would they serve, and in how many delicious combinations would they exercise their culinary tastes! Those who have travelled in England, or on the Continent, tell of -the nicely served chops, and cutlets, and cauliflower, the 'omelettes, and cafe-au-lait, which tasted better than anything before, because so well cooked and sea- soned. Here, with so much more to cook, how seldom we find one who really understands the art. If one calls for a chop, or steak, or cutlet, at some restaurant, it will be brought to him either raw and cold, or cooked to death, with all the juices dried up, and the tough fibre alone remaining. The appy medium of well- cooked meats is seldom met with at these places. Yet, when a good cook is found, what ample mate- rial is at hand at every season of the year; for the present methods of preserving fruits and vegetables by means of air-tight cans furnishes the housekeeper with a variety of dishes at any time during the winter. I have frequently seen fifteen kinds of yegetables on a dinner-table in midwinter.  There are various ways of preserving these articles, and each family has some pet method of its own. The most common one, perhaps, is by using tin cans, which are filled with the fresh fruit, cold, and then are her- metically sealed by means of the soldering-iron. When they are thus closed, the cans are thrown into a large kettle of cold water, and kept down by means of a broad dish, or something similar, with a weight upon it. This kettle is then placed over the fire, and the; water allowed to come gradually to the boiling point.  When they have boiled ten minutes, the cans are taken out, one at a timne, and a puncture made in the top of each by means of a small awl driven through the tin. I The air from the inside will be instantly expelled, and the hole must be as instantly closed again by a drop of solder and resin. These air-tight cans will keep for years, and the fruit or-vegetables in them be found fresh and good as when put in, while the process is so simple 9'   &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7785-00000070"/> t3O  -B'fNfDR ED DOLLARS A     YEAR. - s to be Casily managed by any housekeeper. So com- moni has this branch-of business become, that the stove nrd tin Workers tre'kept busy in going from house to house during the canning season.; In large towns, this Will-- be fowund the most convenient way-for a house- keiper to do her canning. I Let her fix on the day whien she will ,do the work, and notify the workmen of the hour at which the cans will be ready for sealing. Then put the fruit or vegetables in the cans, and have ready the kettle of water. This is all she has to do. A few cents apiece will be the charge for his wifrk, and the same cans, if -carefully washed and put away when emptied, will answer for another season. l But this plan is, after all, liable to some objections, andin country places will be attended with obvious difficulties. There is another method, which, for my -own use, I greatly prefer, because it is less expensive And 'more genei'ally satisfactory. Many persons object to using tin for putting up sour fruits, from some idea that the acid will act upon the metal, and in that way make the fruit itself unwholesome. I know there is some 'reason in ithis idea, although I do not, at this time, intend to enter into the merits of the question. i I use, for myself, glass or stone jars of any-and every shape, size, and kind. The broad-mouthed ones I re- seive'for the larger fruits, such as peaches, pears, &amp;c., while the others, if only wide-mouthed bottles, will an- swer for tomatoes, corn, green peas, and similar things. Before proceeding' to the work, I prepare a cement by imelting together ovet the fire. three parts of resin with he of mutton suet or tallow, stirring it well with-an iron spoon.- For this purpose I have appropriated an olA rusty iron pot, and hiving once prepared a good tuantiftyof the, cement, I htve it ready for use at any time, as it merely requires to be heated up whenever I comle to use it. Witfi peaches and pears, I prepare them as-fok ordinary preserving, by paring and remov- itg thfecores, and then put them into a preserving-ket- a tfle,-iththIree pounds of white sugar to a three-peck  .                   .   SIX HUNDRED bOLLARS A      EAR.  3I basket of fruit. This quantity of sugar will'be suffi- cient for very acid peaches, but less will answer for-  pears or sweet peaches. Add about a pint of Water to that amount, anid let them cook slowly until the whole are boiling hot. Then fill the jars, one or two at a time, carefully tempering them first, to -prevent their cracking. This tempering is easily done by putting in a single spoonful of the hot syrup and allowing it to pass round and round the sides of the-jar, until the glass is well heated. Before putting in the fruit, have ready pieces of strong white muslin, - thick drilling will be the best,-cut large enough to tie over the mouths of the jars. They can be prepared while the fruit is heating over the fire. Fill the jars, two at a time, with the fruit and syrup, and when full pass a silver fork down through the contents, so as to let the bubbles of air which can be seen near the bottom find their way out at the top. Then lay down the bits of muslin, spread a thin coat of the hot cement on them, and put them over the tops, with the sticky side down, which will cause them to adhere closely. Then tie a string tightly around the neck, and spread another 'and thicker coating over the entire top outside. This will render them entirely air tight, but must be done quickly, before the fruit becomes at all cooled. An- assistant should always be had, if possible, as it will expedite matters very much. I am always careful too set back the preserving-kettle, so as to keep up the heat, while I am sealing up the jars,and whenever the cemeht becomes too thick, a moment's heating will make it right, again. After they are cool, the tops of the jars will become quite hollow, like a saucer, which -is an evidence that all the air has been expelled. I have rarely lost a jar of anything done in this simple  way, and must confess that the taste 'and flavor of this slightly cooked fruit is more agreeable to me than that of the raw and  harder contents of the tin cans. We have, also, an excellent plan for putting up greed, corn fior, iter use, which I learned from my mother.  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7785-00000071"/> I32  SIX-HUYDRED DOLLARS A YEAR, I take the nicest sugar corn, in good order for the table, and cut it off the cob; then have readv a stone jar and plenty6f fine table-salt. Spread upon the bottom of the j'r a layer of the salt, and then a layer of the corn, another of alt,-and so oqn, alternately, until all the corn is in, when a good layer of salt is put over the top, and the jar tied up tightly with a piece of silk oilcloth, or a large bladder. The jar is then set in the cellar, or some other cool place, and when it is to be used, the corn must be well soaked before boiling for dinner. We serve it with: a little milk and- butter, stewed with it for a short time, after it is already well boiled in water, and enjoy it much in winter, when other vegetables' are scarce. Another' standard store for winter use is tomato sauce, whidh no doubt is made by nearly every house- keeper in the land. Yet as this may fall into the hands of some young beginner, who has life still before her, and perhaps no mother to instruct her in the arts and sciences of good living, and good providing, I will just mention my own way of preparing tomatoes for this purpose. I avail myself of the height of the season, when the fruit is plentiest and cheapest, and take off the skins, just as one would do for ordinary stewing. By throw- ing them into scalding water for a few moments, the thin skin will peel off very easily. Then, as they are peeled, let them be sliced, and spread on a dish, heap- ing them up until all are skinned. Now have ready a large porcelain-lined kettle, and put them into it with- out a particle of seasoning or water. While remaining on the dish they will probably run a great deal of watery juice, which should not be-allowed to go into the kettle: they are such a very juicy fruit that it is well to get rid- of as much as possible. They will need nothing but careful watching, to prevent their burning at the bot- tom, and, after two or three hours' steady cooking, may be put into the glass-jars, and sealed with the thick rags and cement, as before described. When we wish , c'We                 ews   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS    A YEAR.  133 to use them for the table, a jar is easily opened by cut- ting off the top with a penknife, and, the contents being emptied into a stewpan, the seasoning is added to suit the taste. I have found also that a portion of this tomato sauce, put into soup, gives it a flavor and rich- ness that nothing else will. The following is my recipe for tomato catsup. To one peck of tomatoes skinned add one pint of good vinegar, half a pound of salt, two ounces of black pep- per, half an ounce of cayenne pepper, two ounces of allspice, half an oince of cloves, one ounce of mustard, three good onions, and half a pound of brown sugar. Boil this all for three hours, stirring it to keep from burning. When cool, strain it through a sieve or fine strainer, and bottle it for use. Later in the season, I get the green tomatoes left on the plants when overtaken by the early frosts, and of these are made a delicious pickle' which every one who'  eats such things will not fail to like. I take these green ones of all sizes, cut them into slices, halves, or quarters, just as it happens, and spread them out on flat; broad dishes. Then. sprinkle salt over them, and leave them over night, or at least for six or eight hours. The salt will extract a great deal of clear water, which, if left in them, would weaken the vinegar,/ and, prevent -their keeping well. Now take up a double handful of the -shrunken tomatoes, and squeeze them  between the palms of the hands, so as to wring them as dry as possible; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle, add ground spices, mustard7seed, celery-seed, a few sliced onions, and very little salt, - because they have already been well salted, -with eriough vinegar to cover them. They must stew away slowly for several hours, until the tomatoes are clear of spots, and the, whole seems pulpy and soft, when they may be put into stone or glass jars, and tied up tightly with thick paper or oil- cloth. I have not-given the proportions, because it is so much easier to season these sauces by the' taste. Some do not' wish many onions, because the flavor is -! / * s      ,                    a,  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7785-00000072"/> 134    B S0DRE)  DOT   US V Y EAR4  4'gi eerble to them, and some prefer more spice than others; sp let: each one6 add these things in greater or less proportion, as will best suit her- individual taste. :ve:ryi good manager will take care to. provide her- s*lf tW:it. t .ra oinable 'supply of these good things at the proper seasons; for, although one can keep house, it is true, with only good bread and butter, and a few othe r staple necessaries, yet how greatly it adds to one's relish to have a few nice pickles, catsups, sauces, and such things ready to put on the table besides. !" have another excellent recipe for making mixed pickles, which cannot fail to please the most critical taste It. was obtained from an old Virginia house- eeper, and hence we call them  our , Virginia pickles." To two gallons of cider vinegar add, one pint of blacl mustard-seed, well bruised, four ounces ginger, three ounces black pepper, three, ounces allspice, -one ounCe cloves, and one ounce mace; pound them well tOg e  ther, ptthem all into the vinegar with a large handfull of: horse-radish .grated, and a bunch of garlic, ounce of celery-seed, three lemons sliced, and half pound of brown sugar.

DOLLARS A    YEAR,  1i the skins are too tough and woody for the purpose. The old recipe, in my cookery-book tells me to steep. them in strong salt and water for a week or more, and   . then change them into another brine, in which they should be kept as much longer. All this was to -be- done preparatory to the vinegar and spice. But I have another, and less troublesomeway, which I find to answer even better than that one, because it pre- serves all the flavor of the walnuts, instead of soaking it out in the brine. I gather my, walnuts, and prick them well with a coarse needle; then put them at once into the stone jar, and pour the hot spiced vinegar over them. This last is prepared by boiling ground spices -cloves and allspice - with plenty of salt, in a quart of good cider vinegar, Having poured it on the walnuts while boil-  ing- hot, I then add enough cold vinegar to cover them, and, tying up the jar with thick paper, I set it away for a year. At the end of that time I examine them, and all that are soft enough for a fork to penetrate easily are taken out into another jar for present use, while the hard ones are treated to fresh-spiced vinegar. The old vinegar is then bottled for catsup, and very. nice it is for boiled fish, lamb, mutton, or poultry. By doing a few every year, I always have a supply of these favorite pickles, as well as the walnut Catsup. For several years, I have found it well to. put up a good-sized hog every winter for our own- use; and although the price of pork is indeed very high, com- pared with former times, yet there is much to be saved by curing one's own pork. If it were not so, how would the pprkibutchers grow rich. We generally choose a pig that: weighs about two hundred and -fifty pounds, and from this we will have two fine hams, two shoulders, thirty pounds-of lard, ten pounds of sausage, and the remainder in souse, corned; pork, a few nice, roasting-pieces, spare-ribs, &amp;c.

Whein al/lthe meat is thoroughly done, it is to be taken out, and well drained; then separated from the bones, sand chopped on the board, until the pieces are tolerably small, when it is returned to the pot. Season it well with salt, pepper, and dried sage, rubbed fine, and all the stems picked out. When this is done, a few ladle- fuls may be takeri out, not drained, but, with a con- siderable quantity of the liquor also, put into bowls, and set awy -to cool. This will be the head cheese, :-which is so nice for tea, eaten generally with vinegar  or catsup  A little more hot water may now be added to the liquor and scraps remaining in the pot, and it is then  to be thickened, by stirring in dryicorn-meal and buck- wheat,- about equal quantities of each,- the whole being well seasoned with pepper, salt, and powdered sage. This forms what we call scrapple, and is with us a favorite dish for breakfast or supper. When' it is "1 cooked, as above directed, and about thick enough - fr a: spoon to stand alone in it, I pour it out into 'bowls or pans, and set it away for use. To prepare it for the table, we cut off a number of thin slices, as one would-cut cake, dust them with flour, and fry them until crisp and brown, serving hot. No grease is re- quired to fry thdm in, as there is enough in the scrapple itself. Many persons prefer it to sausage, as it is not so fat and rich. I can assure my readers that our hams and shoulders were not surpassed by any that I have ever tasted, for juiciness and sweetness. Their color 'as a bright red, and the fat white and solid. My recipe for curing them was obtained from an old New Jersey farmer, whose sugar-cured hams have long been celebrated. F or my two hams and two shoulders I take one quart d6f -common molasses, an ounce of finely powdered sali- petre, two quarts of fine salt,/and half a pound of brown sugar, mixing them well together. This is done an hour or more beforeI am ready to'begin, which will  .  .          *     .   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 137 allow the saltpetre time to dissolve.. I use, for packing them, either a small tub or a large, flat-bottomed  earthen pan. Laying a ham on the kitchen table, I ' + begin to rub it with the mixture, using my hand, and working it well into every part. When all are done, I go over them again, until it is all used up, and then lay them in the tub or pan, and put them away in the cellar for twenty-four hours. By this means the salt-  petre and sugar have time to penetrate into the flesh, and this is what gives; such meat that fine color and flavor which the ordinary Western hams never have. At the end of the twenty-four hours I pour over them a strong brine, which will bear an egg, and let them remain covered with it for six weeks, when they are ready to be smoked. Ash there are always plenty of pork-butchers who cure hams, one can always get them  smoked, without difficulty, for a few cents; but before sending them to the smoke-house, I am tery careful to tie a strong string through them by which they may be hung up, and also to attach a piece of chip, with my name on it, so as to prevent any difficulty' about- getting my own again.  The next thing is my sausage. When the butcher cuts up my pig, he does it according to my direction, first cutting off and trimming the hams and shoulders, and then cutting the pork into large 6r small pieces as I may prefer. Now as ours is a small family, I usual- ly order them to be. cut into four or five pound por- tions, except one or two to be kept fresh for roasting, which may be six or eight pounds. The scraps and trimmings are thrown into a pan, and, when he is done,. they are weighed, -usually about ten pounds, -and ' then he takes them away with him to be chopped and sea- soned. In old times, when families did their own chop- ping, with an ordinary chopping-knife, it must havebeen quite an undertaking to make much sausage,:but now, by means of the chopping-machine,ft requires but a few moments to do twice as much as I have.

Then the recipes. are so extravagant that people of our limited means cannot afford desserts at all. When eggs are selling at fifty cents a dozen, it is well to know how to make a few good things that will not require many. I have so often found it convenient to be able to get up something in a hurry, and- it invariably happens that, if unexpected company comes in' to a meal, it is on the days when' you 'have.;no dessert' provided, .or'a make-up, scrap dinner, These days occur in ali mod- erate families: perhaps once or twice: a week; for, where there is but one servant, her busy days must be re- membinered, and slice she o ,ly possesses one pair of hands, it is simply impossible for herto wash i'd beat eggs, or make pastry aet one anid the same time. Then,  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7785-00000076"/> "1 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. if the mistress of the house is occupied with enter- taining the guests in the parlor, how is she to help much 1 Like most other families, we have our favorite stand- bys in the way of desserts, -rice and tapioca puddings, puffs, apple-dumplings. fritters, custards, bread pud- ding, and a few plain and inexpensive pies. These form a sufficient variety for ordinary times, and even such a cook as our present one can soon learn to pre- pare them; but now and then, for grand occasions, we add something rather more elaborate and pretentious to our bill of fare. One day - washing-day, as usual - a dear old friend, whom I had not seen for years, came unex- pectedly by the morning train, arriving only about one hour before dinner-time. I was really glad to see her, although I confess that I wished she had happened to come on any other day in the week; but I welcomed her cordially, and kept on talking pleasantly about old times, even while revolving in my mind how I should, manage to provide something impromptu. Arthur was away to dinner that day, so we were to have.-less than usual, even on washing-days, while the kitchen fire I knew was low, and the oven consequently cold. Things were certainly in a most unpromising state. But I slip- ped out into the kitchen for a few moments to recon- noitre, and found the girl just putting away the tubs, and preparing to scrub up the kitchen. I directed her to make a-nice-hash of the cold joint left from Sunday's dinner; and, by way of dessert, the remaining batter of the morning's breakfast cakes, which was al- ways set away for " rising," needed only to have more flower, a little milk, and one egg added, When We had nice pancakes ready for her to fry. Being. cold weath- er, this was a very good dinner, after all, and when we came to the table, nicely set, the dish of minced hash, with gravy poured over toasted bread, two or three kinds of vegetables, and pickles, with my im- prohmptii fritters, as light as possible, answered every   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. 143 purpose, and seemed to give general satisfaction. Had I made a list of apologies, and expressed my regrets that she had come on a washing-day, it would have spoiled all the pleasure of her visit, and perhaps pre- vented her coming again. In making rice or tapioca puddings, I allow half a teacupful of rice or tapioca to a quart of milk, - no eggs, - a pinch of salt, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, a little nutmeg, and sugar to the taste. Bake it in a pretty warm oven and stir it down occasional- ly, letting it scum over, and brown at the last. This constant stirring gives it a creamy richness, and if the rice or tapioca is well soaked in milk first, it will cook sooner, and be much better. Puffs, or "pop-ups," are very easily made. Two eggs, well beaten, two teacupfuls of milk, and flour enough to make a thin batter, with a pinch of salt, are all that are required. First mix together the flour and milk smoothly, then, just as they are ready to go in the oven, add the eggs, beaten very light. Cohn- mon queenswar6 teacups, kept for the purpose, are used for baking them; and, having greased them well, pour in the batter, filling the cups only half full. A little piece of butter on top of each cup will make them better and richer. The cups may now be ar- ranged in a drilping-pan and set into a quick oven. When done, they will be found puffed up far beyond the tops of the cups, and browned beautifully. They will come out of the cups readily, before being brought to table, and are to be eaten with wine, butter, and sugar, or with syrup, as each imay prefer. They should be put, in the oven just before the family sit down to dinner, and will be ready in time for serving at dessert. Apple-dumplings are made of pastry rolled out as for pies; the apples, pared' and cored, being enclosed in it so as to form round balls. They may be either boiled or baked.

In our house, as should be in every well-regulated one, there is a "{ save-all "jar, into which are put all the pieces of bread left from meals, crusty ends of loaves, and dry slices.  Servants have a careless and extravagant habit of cutting more bread for the table than is needed, and often, when, as the meal is nearly over, they are asked to bring a little more, instead of a small quantity merely, they will bring as much as at first. This is wasteful, for no one cares to eat stale and dry slices. But still the thing will happen, and careful housekeepers must find a way to use these odds and ends, which really amount to considerable in the course of the .year. Some of these slices may be toasted for'the next breakfast or tea; but after all, there will be a portion left for bour jar, and of these we make, as nice a pudding as one need desire. Upon about half a pound of these pieces of broken and stale bread I pour a quart of milk, and let it stand until all are well soaked; then add sugar, and nutmeg or cinnamon to the taste, with three eggs well beaten, half a teacupful' of finely chopped beef-suet, and a little salt. If the suet is not convenient, use a lump of butter the size of an egg instead, Stir all together, and bake the pudding in a tin pan three quarters of an hour, until -nicely browned. This is to be eaten with wine sauce, made by stirring three table-spoon- fuls of. flour, mixed smoothly with a little cold water, into a pint of boiling water, adding a little butter, sugar, and wine. The wine need not be added until it is taken frdon the fire. Another pudding, made with bread-crumbs; which is a great favorite, is' the Apple Betty.' To about half a loaf of grated bread-crumbs, take -halft a pint of stewed and sweetened apples,-a goodrsized' lump of. butter, a- little cinnamon and:nutmeg, and a teacupful of milk..

Bakeit half an hour, and eat it either cold or hotwit butter nd sugar sauce. - Still another usefor stale bread is to make griddle- - eakesofit.. OccasionaillyJwhen the bread is not very light or well baked, we find it convenient to use up a whole loaf in this way, and find it far mnore palatable than stale or heavy bread would have been. Te crumbs and !crsts are first broken up into small pieces and well soaked in milk; then enough more milk and flour is added to make a thin batter with the bread smooth- iy mashed, and mixed in. Add -to this an egg well beaten, a little salt, a teaspoonful of cream-of-tartar well mixed' in a little water or sweet milk, and a half- teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, also dissolved in water or minilk.- Add the soda last of all, and bake on a- griddle. They are very nice and tender, andif sour milk-is -used, the cream-of-tartar can be omitted. '.Another bread pudding may be made very quickly ,ithout baking. Spread several slices of bread with butter, and put!alyers of fruit between them ; cherries oriblaCkberries are best. The fruit is first stewed nth -pIlenty of juice; if there is not enough of its own, a little water may be added to make more. When thebread ,and ,butter and fruit have been piled up alternately in :a bowl, the hotduice is to -be poured -over the whole, and set away in a cool place. The juice thus melts the butter and carries it through the whole, and the bread swells as it soaks up the juice 80so that by the time all is cold it is soft and tender. When it is served, it is mcut down through the layers, W1th ::Xilk or cream to pour. over it. It will do very wellwithout this, however. wFor iavoring purposes I use extracts of my own :- prepayg, as the prices charged by the druggists are ':y-:iihigh. ':I' take a bottle contanining a pint of alco- hol, :and: put into it six or eight fresh vanilla beans, ;thismitsDi a few weeks will become a strong extract, :'a:fewdrops of which will be sufficient to flavor a quart ,:fmilk. "In another bottle, with a like quantity of al-   SIX HUNDRED    DOLrARS  A YEEAR. 147 cohol, I put the yellow rinds of lemons, pared as thin- ly as possible. In a very short time the alcohol will extract all the coloring and flavoring principle from these rinds, and they can be taken out to admit of fresh ones. Whenever w e have lemons in use, and  the rind is not wanted, it can be turned to good account in this way.           t For more stylish or company desserts, there are a few favorites, easily made and inexpensive, which occasionally appear, even on our plain table. One of these is what we term -' a trifle." Make a soft custard, with the yolks of three eggs and a quart of milk, and set it away to cool. Now take slices of stale sponge-cake; moisten' them well with wine, and lay them in the bottom of I la pudding- dish or glass bowl; next spread over them a coat of jelly or preserves,- an acid kind is preferable, - and over this pour a little of the custard. Then 'add. another layer of the cake, jelly, and custard, until all are used or you haive the required quantity: Beat up the whites of the three eggs with a little thick cream, sweetened and flavored with vanilla, ard spread this over the top of the dish. It makes a beautiful and delicious dessert, and requires no cooking. Another favorite- is c floating island," and is made by simply beating the whites of eggs together with any kind of jelly or jam.. Instead of cream, which' cannot always be had in sufficient quantity, a soft- boiled custard is prepared, with a quart Of milk and the yolks. of the eggs; and in serving. it a portion of that- is first poured into the plate, and then a* spoonful of 4te. light-beaten jelly is placed on it, forming a "floating island," - very pretty and good. Apple-jelly, or marmalade, and pine-apple jam make a white island,' while, currant and quince jellies are deli- cately tinted. . Another recipe, which I consider the best and sim- plest for ,( Charlotte Russe," is the following - To half a pint of milk put one ounce of isinglass,- .  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7785-00000079"/> - {      e  . i -x^ SIf -ZSUKED    DOLZARS A YEAR B: or Cox's gelatine; to this add a vanilla bean; let it, simmer over the fire.

Then line the mould or dish with strips of sponge-cake, or lady-fingers, pour over the mixture, and let it stand in a cold, place until perfectly firm, when it may be turned out, if desired, into a glass, dish. In case the cream cannot be had, it will answer/s very well without, using milk instead;, but the cream makes it much richer. Besides these, there are many others, both simple and;good, too well-nown to need description here; suchas corn-starch blanc-mange, which looks pretty turned out of moulds;, slip, or junket, made by put- ting a little liquid rennet into milk or even simple; rice, well boiled in milk, and eaten cold, with flavored&amp; cream.  In a family like ours, a few plain cakes will gener- ally answer all purposes; and very rarely will any- thing richer or more costly be required. A few of these ftvorite recipes I will give, and can assure the reader that they are good and reliable, like the cakes' they describe. ,           ' SPONGE CARE.

To the foregoing recipes, copied from my private collection, and tested by my own experience, I will add an excellent'one for making yeast; and since it is so little trouble to make it, and the lightness of bread, I biscuit, and cakes depends so much upon the quality of the yeast, I should advise-every housekeeper to try making it for herself.

YOU will not close your book, surely, without a word about the education of children?" said a confidential friend, to whom I had read the foregoing chapters. "It would be very incomplete, I'think; and since you have one of your own, who will soon need a little curbing and training, I advise you by all means to give a few prac- tical thoughts on the subject, for the assistance of the multitudes of young heads of families, who either are, or one day will be, in want of a little advice." There was certainly something in my friend's sug- gestion. Although I have not, as yet, had much ex-, perience in the actual business of training a child, Percy being not yet four years old, still I have very decided ideas on the subject, which I have obtained from observation of the examples of others, and espe- cially from the sensible views and practice of my own parents.  As to the period when a mother's duties in regard to the training of her child begins, it is impossible for us to identify it, because we cannot say precisely the moment when its comprehension of, right and wrong begins. s Obedience is the first lesson to be enforced. A little child, oP even a year old, can be taught Some lessons on this important point. One may not be able go make him understand at -that tender age what sin   -SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR 153 is.; but he can, nevertheless, be made to feel that dis- obedience'is displeasing to the parents whom he loves, and that certain punishments and penalties await on it. No sooner has a child learned to talk, and walk, than it shows its natural tendency to do disagreeable and naughty tricks: - indeed, its aptitude for learning evil things is far greater than for learning good -ones. This is natural, -a proof only that it has inherited the evil nature of its first mistaken parents; yet "we must bear with it, having compassion on its weakness, while, by slow and careful steps, we instil into the little mind those good things which come down from above. It is the erring notion of weak parents, that it is cruel to cross or thwart the wishes of a little child. "Give him what he wants: I will not allow his temper to be spoiled by denial," I have heard mothers  say. Alas! as if in his after life there would come no crosses nor trials. In that case such a policy might be wise; as it is, how much better to- begin early to train him in the practice of self-denial, and teach him that he cannot have everything that he cries for. How will it prevent an ill temper, and a selfish spirit in his subsequent career, - how will the seed thus sown in the soft and mellow ground soon germinate and grow into principles the most lasting and love the most enduring! We all remember the story of the thief on the gallows, who bit off his mother's ear, saying that, had she only trained -him properly in his early years, he would not have come to that sad end. I know it is a popular idea that these earliest years, of a child's life are unimportant; that the ground can lie fallow for at least three or four years; ibut herein is the mistake, of which the Evil One will not be slow to avail himself. I lately dverheard a little talk between Percy and his playmates, which showed me the use of training a child early, while it rejoiced my heart that my own child could so soon apply the principles I had in- stilled.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7785-00000082"/> 154 SIX HUNDRED DOTLLARS A YEAR. "Let us play in the yard, Percy," said one, a little older than he. ' No,' answered my child, "it is damp, gnd mam- ma will not let me." O yes she will," urged the others; "go and ask her." "There's no use," returned Percy; "she never changes her mind." "My mamma does," said the first speaker; "I just worry and worry her, until she gives up." Here I interrupted the talking, as I'saw that it was not tending to edification, and afterwards took occasion to impress still more forcibly upon Percy's mind both the duty and the policy of obedience. Gradually in this way he is learning to understand what sin is, and that, as disobedience to parents is sin, so all sin is simply disobedience to our Divine Parent, whose earthly creatures we are. But- while we strive to lead our children in the right way, and curb the wayward spirit that so early shows itself, the natural instinct of a mother's love must be our motive power; not that kind of love which is blind to the child's faults, and which refuses to reprove or rebuke its errors, but that wiser and better love which corrects the little one for its own good, even while sorrowing at the need which invited it. Then, when the punishment has been duly en- forced, and submitted to, and the desired contrition sends the little creature to ask forgiveness, how ten- derly should its tears be wiped away, and itself folded in loving arms. It is far better, when dealing out punishments, to cause -them to follow certainly and immediately after the offence. I have known parents speak thus to a little child: "You have been very naughty; I will not punish you now; but to-morrow I shall do so." So all day the- child was under a cloud, for the threatened punishment would surely come. It seemed hardly worth while for it to try being good that day.   S'IX HUNDRED DOLLTARS A YEAR.     X55 The parent, too, must feel that the fault was not for- given until it had been expiated. Next day, per- haps, the child gets up in a bright and cheerful humor, and has quite forgotten the doom that hans over it. But the conscientious parent, who thinks this is the true plan of, procedure, suddenly takes the little one from its play and leads it out to receive the whip- ping promised yesterday. Of course this opens afresh the grief; and, although strictly fulfilling his word, I doubt whether that parent has really accomplished what he aimed at,-namely, the true benefit of his darling child. Firmness and strictness in discipline are very differ- ent from severity and unkindness. The mother of Washington was one of those firm and decided parents who required strict obedience, and we see the whole- . some results in the characters of her children. It is in these earliest years that a child's character is formed. If a little one of three years old is made to understand that disobedience will bring punishment, he will re- quire to be punished very seldom after he has reached seven or eight years; for by that time he will come to understand and appreciate the principles upon which the system is based. "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart - from it." Gradually he will reason thus: "I will not do this or that, because my mother has forbidden it; she would not have done this if it had not been wrong for me to do it, therefore I will obey her." A double motive is here operating in the child's mind: First, of love and respect for the mother who commands him; and second; of confidence in her wisdom; which two reasons compel obedience. I had this matter of training children brought to my mind in a very practical and philosophical way, by an old black woman whom I overtook one day, as she was on her way to church, with her two little grandchildren. I stopped to ask after their health, for the old woman was very feeble, and these orphan children, the legacy  *           !1/ - 1  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7785-00000083"/> :156 SIX HUNDRED DOJLLARS A YEAR. of her only son, had been a great care to the poor creature.  "Well, Betsy," I said, kindly, "and how are you getting on with your children?" ', But poorly, ma'am," she answered; "the chillen was spiled afore I got 'em, and it's hard for me to mend matters now." "But how so?"I asked, for the little girls, as they walked along, looked the very picture of tractableness and obedience. "-Well, ye see, ma'am," she responded, "their, mother spiled 'em by not punishin' 'em when they needed it, an' I lay the blame all on the fashion of wearin' gaiters, -mothers oughtn't to wear gaiters, in old times we did n't, and that's why the chillen use to be so much better behaved than now-a-days." "But, Betsy," I said, "I cannot quite see the con- nection between wearing gaiters and: bringing up chil- dren properly." "Can't ye, ma'am?" she replied. "Why, it's as clear as daylight. Ye see, when we wore low shoes, an' the chillenG wanted a whippin', ire jess tuk off a shoe, mighty quick, an' gave 'em a good spankin'; but now, how's a body to git a gaiter off in time? So the chillen gits no whippings at all now-a-days." I was obliged to admit the philosophy of old Betsy's argument, although expressed in so homely a style. Not that I should approve of that mode of punighment exactly, or indeed of " whipping" in general, 'refer- ring a milder code, whenever it can be made available; yet the principle of punishing a fault as soon as com- mitted is that to which I still adhere. But let these punishments-be as rare as possible. Do not visit every little fault and failing of a little child with a severe reproof; for the natural activity of the infant mind will often lead it into mistakes which are unintentional, and thereforemust be treated with lenity and forbear- ance. There is another very important point in the traia-   SIX HUNDRED DOTLARS A YEAR. 157 ing of children which will have a great influence upon their conduct and character. A parent should encour- age the confidence of his child, and never treat him with suspicion. Show him, that you trust in his prom- ise to act properly behind your back, and immediately you appeal to his sense of honor, and he has a double. motive fei fulfilling your wishes. Interest yourself in all his little griefs and pleasures, and he will thus in- trust to you all his secrets and temptations, while, with loving advice and gentle warnings, you may guard him from many apitfall, and point out the snares which are everywhere around him. There are some little faults which begin very early, and which parents are to blame that they do not per- ceive and check at once. Some children have a habit of meddling with other people's things; and, unless they are at once taught the impropriety of this habit, there will, be no end of trouble both for themselves and their parents. I have often seen this in the case of one of my friends, who has an interesting family of boys and girls. She generally brings one or two of them with her whenever she comes to call here; and, to 'be perfectly candid, I do not altogether enjoy her visits on account of the ill behavior of her children. No sooner are they in the parlor than they begin their investigations of every little notion that is t9 be found: on tables or the mantel-piece, handling them and mov- ing them from place toe place, until I am forced to request them to be still aid keep their hands off. The last'time they were here, little Percy, into whose mind I have long ago instilled the knowledge that things are not to be touched by children, followed them around with reproachful language, when he found that his cau- tions were disregarded. "Mamma won't let you touch her wax-flowers," I heard him say, and, looking tip, I saw the oldest one, scarcely five years old, lifting the shade from my wax bouquet. Of cpurse I sprang to take it from his hands, and by 'so doing narrowly escaped having a smash, t                    - O   ^  '       '  ,  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7785-00000084"/> x58 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. The mother looked on quite unconcerned, and only remarked that she firmly believed that her it Tom will make a great man some day, he has such an inquiring mind." Soon afterwards they collected my handsome daguerreotypes and photograph album from the centre- table, and set themselves to opening and shutting them, until finally, they made a train of cars of the whole number and Awent :pushing them around the room, shrieking and whistling in imitation of the locomo- tive. I certainly expected that the mother- would check this; but she only looked around complacently, and said to them, encouragingly, "There, that 's pretty, to play so nicely." Little. Percy scarcely knewlwhat to think of such behavior, and had crept up into the corner of the sofa next me, looking on all the while with perfect amaze- ment. I was much relieved to see them depart, and when they had gone explained to my own child how naughty and disagreeable such conduct was. H know that he could be trusted in any parlor, among the most fragile things, because he has been early taught that touching was not permitted to children. Nor do I take it as any evidence of want of acuteness, although -it certainly shows greater obedience. Another matter on which I have very decided no- tions is the subject of children's diet,- the kind of food and the times for feeding. Of the kinds of food suitable for a young child, of course it is reasonable that it should be plain and nourishing, without too great a variety. Very hot and highly seasoned dishes are injurious to the delicate stomach of a child, while tea and coffee are too stimulating to the nerves. Milk is the most wholesome and natural beverage, and it should enter largely into the preparation of other articles of its diet. Then of the frequency of meals. A physician will say that a young child should be fed only once in three or four hours, yet children of four or five years old are crammed con- tinually by inconsiderate parents, who provide cakes,   SIT HUNDRED DOLLARS A      YEAR.   5 9 pies, and candies without limit, and suppose that they are showing kindness to their children. It is a great mistake, however; for the child thus Constantly eating never has a hearty, healthy appetite for meals. Its stomach is cloyed, and it is never hungry when it ought to be., With Percy, I am as positive with re- gard to his eating-hours as of the things he eats. A hearty breakfast of bread and milk, or some such' sim- ple diet, and dinner of meat and potatoes, with a lunch in the middle of -the morning of bread or crackers. Thus he is always hungry at meal-times,-- and the regularity of his eating-hours has much to do with his uniform good health. The same rule applies to. ourselves, except that we rarely need anything between breakfast and our two-o'clock dinner. I say- it thankfully, not boastingly, that we have scarcely ever had occasion to call in a doctor during the past six years. But if we had followed the examples of some of our friends, who constantly stuff themselves and their children with all manner of unwholesome food, keep irregular and late hours, and in fact live without any particular rule, our doctor's bill would have been a considerable additional item in our ex- penses, while we ourselves would erelong become sickly and miserable, --the victims of dyspepsia and all its train of horrors. Perhaps if people only pos- sessed the power and disposition to trace evils to their proper sources, they would know better how to avoid and remedy them.

Mrs. Wilson is beginning to see already what a vast charge she has undertaken; and, but for the child's winning and affectionate man- ner, I think she would sometimes become discouraged, Perhaps this state of- things has grown out of the harshness with which she had been treated in her earlier years, thus often inducing her to conceal her actions from her parents, or when discovered to deny them. Bad examples of others have no doubt helped on the evil, until, at ten years old, it has become a habit as common as the daily meals or nightly rest. It is a discouraging task, truly, if we rely on man's wisdom, to kill the weeds so deeply rooted; but the Divine blessing and assistance can make even this hard undertaking practicable. Already my friend has begun the "line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little," and I doubt not that in due time the fruits of her patience will become apparent.

E have lately had an important addition to our household, in the' shape of a sew- ing-machine; and what a wonderful/insti- tution it is! I had long desired to pos- sess one, but hard times, and the necessity for such close economy, had made it altogether impossible for me to spare the money for its purchase. So the sub- ject had been awaiting the advent of better times, while. I, well satisfied that it would be both expedient and economical to invest my first spare money in such a machine, quietly looked around me, to see which was the best kind to purchase, when the propitious mo- ment should arrive. It was rather difficult to deter- mine that question, however, for each lady praised her own as being the most perfect and reliable one in use, and as a proof displayed the tucking and -braiding she had done upon it. No wonder if, under such circum- stances, I found myself in as great a dilemma as ever, with the question as far from being settled. One day in August - it was my twenty-sixth birth- day- this weighty matter was decided for mein quite an unexpected way; for up to the door came lumbering a car, containing a mysterious-looking box, directed to myself, which, upon opening, proved to be a hand- some sewing-machine all in order for immediate use. II  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7785-00000086"/> i6z SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS     YEAR. It was a' birthday gift from Arthur, but he had not hinted his intentions, because he meant to surprise me. I had so often practised on this kind of a machine that I was able to sit down at once to the handsome walnut table, and, turning the wheel with both feet in the treadles, away went the needle at the swiftest rate, until, by the time my good husband came in to din- ner, I had quite completed a garment, and was ready to dance with delight, both -at the beautiful work and my own expertness. It was so kind and thoughtful and generous, to think of such a gift; and if, hereaf- , ter, I should become rich or famous, I shall attribute all to this grand and fundamental capital, -my sewing- machine. Do I seem to joke I do not mean it. For how much can a woman do towards educating and improv- ing her mind, while tied down to the ,perpetual drudg-, ery of the needle? Yet the sewing must be done, and who but she to do it . The husband must have shirts, and drawers, and such things, and the chil- dren need frocks, and petticoats, and a dozen other notions continually; while the house must be replen- ished now and then with sheets, pillow-cases, and' table-linen. So the mistress of a family finds herself busy all the time, in looking' after the ways of her household, and providing for their wants. No matter if she does love to read, and some one has just lent her the last new book, which she longs to begin: she must attend to duty before pleasure, and only by snatches, now and tlsen, can she find the time to read at all.. But some one will say that I am contradicting my own teaching, having certainly given the public to understand that it was both better and pleasanter to be constantly employed. So I think still; but because I have endeavored to set forth themerits of good housekeeping, and prove that there is both com- fort-andt compensation in economy, I do not therefore unduly glorify the kitchen department, or rejoice in do-   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A a      L. x63 mestic drudgery. A wiser one than I can ever hope to be has said that there is a time for everything; and if so, I contend that even a married woman should have a little time now and then to attend to her own mental cul- ture, instead of tying herself down exclusively to the details of making puddings and polishing furniture. Employment will be employment still; and while some would prefer to scrub and clean continually, their per- ceptions of dust and dirt becoming every day more nice and discriminating, there are others to whom God has given a different talent, - a higher calling, and one still more capable of development. I do not condemn the nice housekeeper for her nicety, nor would I be thought to advocate slovenliness, or even indifference to dust and dirt. " Cleanliness," says some wise au- thority, , is next to godliness." With some over par- ticular people I think it has precedence of the latter- named virtue; for if to have an idol and worship it is sinful, then are these house-worshippers idolaters in every practical sense of the word.- I know of one person who compels-her servants to scrub just so long by the clock, on every square foot of floor in the house. Her staircase is swept down five ti*p9 every day; that is, first with the large broom, secondly with a little one, thirdly with a dust- brush, fourthly with a dusting-cloth, and fifthly with a tooth-brush, to get the cracks and corners all right. Unless it is done precisely so,'she is unhappy; and did she but know of the existence of a cobweb or thimble- ful of dirt in any part of her establishment, she cou/ld not sleep quietly in her bed at night. This lady has her nicely-folded linen' sheets and pillow-cases taken from the drawers, at least once a year, and washed up again, lest they become yellow, instead of having them  used occasionally, which would have answered the same purpose without giving such un- necessary work to a servant. In that nice establish- ment there is an endless succession of window-washing, pavement-scrubbing, and slopping generally; while  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7785-00000087"/> DRED DOLLARS A, YEAR. the persecuted husband, driven from place to place by these domestic discomforts, and forbidden to smoke, write, or move, for fear of making a litter, naturally seeks his pleasure outside the limits of his own house- hold. :Now it is plain to see that such perpetual slavish- ness and drudgery must have a narrowing effect on the heart and mind of any woman, just as the constant service of Mammon will harden the heart of man. A woman was surely made for higher employments. It is but cruelty to require that she devote herself, in the extreme way that I have described, to the tedious and uninteresting details of housewifery. An educated nature will shrink from it, and hail with thankfulness the dawning of a brighter day, which brings to woman an escape from some of. her wearing toil. To come back to the idea with which I began this digression, I shall consider my newly-acquired sewing- machine as a boon bdeond value, and the foundation of my fortune. Hereafter I may hope sometimes to be done my work, - to finish the pile of sewing which now seems never to grow less. Then, having my house in tolerably good order through my daily oversight, and my sewing always done, I can apply the brush to my mind and cultivate that-innate love of knowledge which God has implanted in -my nature. I can sometimes even hope to take up my own pen, in the wish to serve my generation by giving expression to such sim- ple experiences as these. When all these collateral issues are considered, I am surely justified in pro- nouncing my birthday gift as valuable beyond calcula- tion. My book has been written somewhat like a diary; not, indeed, furnishing a daily record of our living and doing, but written, as it were, by snatches, and noting the chief events and lessons of my quiet and uneventful life, pretty nearly in the order in which they occurred. The welcome remembrancer of my birthday had not been-long in the house, nor had I   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 165 become very expert in its use, when I had another visit from my dear cousin, Lucy Graham, whose former one, now five years ago, has jeft so pleasant an impres- sion on my mind. I gave her a very cordial welcome, and was prepared, as before, greatly to enjoy her visit. As may be expected, we had enough to talk about; for in five years how much had befallen us both! I had passed through trouble, as well as prosperity, and she had seen enough of others' sorrows and suffering to make a wondrous history. There was a strange fascination which compelled me to be, interested in those dreadful and touching stories of her war'experi- ence in the hospitals. Iconfess that I felt as before, during her previous visit, a sort of softening influence, which brought to me a more thoughtful mood,--a thankful spirit for the many mercies which I, above others, had received. Lucy was exceedingly expert with the sewing-machine, for she had learned to oper- ate upon it during her services for the soldiers. Mopy a garment had been cut and stitched by her own hands. She seemed to have come just at the right time, and set herself to teaching me the various won- ders of this great labor-saving improvement. I could already do any amount of plain stitching on my ma- chine, but how to cord, and tuck, and braid I did not entirely understand.  Before she left me, however, I was an adept in the. art, and could display some rare specimens, very much like those kept on exhibition at the manufacturers' rooms. "Lucy," I said one day, when we were sitting together, "we have bought our house, and I would like to implove it by degrees.  How much' do you think it would cost to have our dining-room painted ? It is so shabby that I am quite ashamed of it." "If you hire it done," she replied, "it will cost quite an amount; for paint and painters' wages are both very hirh in these times; but if you do it your- self, it will cost merely the price of the paint." "Do it myself!" I exclaimed in surprise, for the  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7785-00000088"/> "66- SIX HUNDRED D-OLLARS A    YEA'R. idea of such a thing had not occurred to me before. ( Why, how could I do it myself?  You know I want to have it oaked, and that is quite an art." i( So it is, my dear," she returned; ( but cannot a woman practise the fine arts too?" (, Some of them', no doubt, dear Lucy," I replied; ( but the graining of wood-work must be very diffi- cult, I think." "Suppose we try it," she said, ( while I am here to teach you; and if you don't succeed, why, when you've done a single door we can stop and wipe it all off again." I was rather incredulous, I confess, although I had a high opinion of Lucy's ability to do almost any- thing she might attempt; but this being, as I thought, rather out of her usual department of the arts, I felt doubtful as to the probable results of our experiment. But I resolved to proceed ia once, since she had so kindly offered to assist me. Next day I directed Bet- sy to clean the paint in our little dining-room, window- frames, doors, and washboards; thus removing all roughness, grease, or finger-marks, which might pre- vent the drying of the paint and mar its effect. Then having provided four or five pounds of light buff paint, mixed in turpentine, and a suitable brush, 'bor- rowed from the obliging painter, I began the operation by putting a smooth coat of paint on the wood-work, all over the room. In this I succeeded pretty well, by Lucy's direction, for the main thing was to avoid streaking it,- to spread it an evenly, brushing it up and down on the sides of the panels, instead of cross- wise, and always following the grain of the wood. This part of the work was easily accomplished be- tween breakfast and dinner, -for Lucy insisted on doing a part of it herself; and then, by dint of watch- ing and cautioning Percy, who was constantly forget- ting the fresh paint, we managed to get it entirely dry before the next day. The next step was to give it another coat of paint !   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 1i67 of a different shade. The painter, to whom I told my story, mixed it for me just as it should be, and again, very obligingly, loaned us his brushes. This second coat was mixed rather differently from the first, being not only of a darker shade, but I observed that he added a little .bees-wax melted in oil. . That was done to prevent the paint running, after it is grained. The tools now required Lucy showed me how to prepare, and they were very simple and easily pro- vided. They consisted merely of combs of different sizes,- an old steel pocket-comb, one or two side- combs, and a long toilet-comb that had lost several of its teeth, answered an excellent purpose. By Lucy's advice, I was to experiment a little first on a piece, of board, which, like the wood-work of the room, had al- ready had the first coating of light buff. I now laid on an even coat of the new paint, and then taking one of the side-combs, I drew it straight down from the top of the board to the bottom; then beginning again, another breadth of the comb was given, until the whole surface was covered with these fine straight lines. I next took the steel comb and went over the same ground, but giving a slightly waving or zig-zag motion to the comb, which made the same kind of wavy lines among the straight-ones of the previous combing. I had a nice piece of real oak to look at, which was a good guide in the figuring.  The next thing was to imitate these figures as well as I could, by putting a rag over the thumb-nail, and rubbing over the surface here and there, wiping off a portion of the upper coat in indistinct figures. This seemed rather difficult at first, but I soon egan to do it readily, Lucy standing by and directing me all the time. "Now," said she, It you have done so well with the board, I think we will proceed to one of the doors." I soon spread on the coat of paint, and combed the whole jlst as I had done upon the board, sometimes using the long comb instead of the side-comb, by  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7785-00000089"/> DRED D OLJTLARS A YEAR. which means I got over the ground much more quick- ly; and sometimes the zig-zag lines were made with that instead of the steel comb. By degrees I grew quite bold in my dashes, and became delighted with the work, forming the figures in the panels in great variety, which prevented all tendency to monotony. The sides of the doors required no figures other than the wavy lines, aid the washboards and window-frames were done in the same simple manner, with here and there a spot wiped off to represent a knot, with the veins going all, around it, as if turned out of their natural course.  When all this was done, it looked very well, but Lucy said there was something further necessary, in order to give it-that soft and finished ap- pearance that I had noticed in some of the elegant doors about town. It was still to be ' overgrained," as she called it, but not until this was all dry; so we waited until the next day to finish our work. We now carried back the brushes kindly loaned us by the painter,-and borrowed his ovcr-grainer, and badger's-hair softener, as they are termed, procuring also a little dry Vandyke-brown, blue-black, and some fuller's earth. Lucy then mixed the latter in a basin of water, and, dipping in a sponge, we gave the door a wash over with it. I had also procured a little stale beer or ale, and in this, poured on a plate, I mixed a small quantity of the Vandyke-brown and blue-black, -a very little of the latter, - and dipping in the over-grainer, I drew it down over the surface of my door-panels, and then went softly over it with the bad- ger, which produced a beautiful effect, in softening and blending -the colors. It was now complete; and as I looked at my finished work I congratulated myself on my remarkable success, with acknowledgments to my teacher at the same time. Even the despised corner cupboard, which had been such an eyesore to my neiglbor, was now a very elegant piece of furniture, and I felt less disposed than ever to part with.an arti- cle so capacious and useful.   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 169 "If you choose to varnish your doors," said Lucy, , they will look still handsomer; and, besides, they will then need nothing but wiping occasionally with a wet wash-leather to remove the fly or finger marks." a I will wait to do that," I replied, ," until the wall is papered, for the new paint already makes it look very shabby. I shall have to hire that done, however, as we could not turn paper-hangers ourselves." " Why, yes, we could," she returned. "t Pray what is to prevent?  Where there's a will, you know, there 's always a way." I looked at her with rather an amazed expression, but she was evidently in earnest about it, and at once began to measure the walls. With a yardstick she took, first the height, and then the dimensions of the sides, and spaces between the windows and doors; and very soon ciphered out the amount of paper required as, fourteen pieces. These, at twenty-five cents apiece, would cost just three dollars and a half, besides the border, which would be fifty cents more,- all together only four dollars. " Now, dear," she said, "do not undertake it unless you are sure that you can afford it; but if you can, and intend to have it done at any rate, why, you can save just half by putting it on the wall yourself, and I will help you do it." I had already begun to lay by me a little fund toward these much-needed repairs, and had more than this saved, already; so I did not hesitate a moment in my answer. "0 yes," I exclaimed, "(I will do it by all means, if you really -think we can manage! it all by our- selves." "I have papered my own room," she answered, "without any assistance, and certainly, with two of us together, we can do this little dining-room in a single morning; so let us choose the paper at once." We set out for the paper-hanger's immediately, and selected a pretty oak-ground paper, which matched  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7785-00000090"/> 170 SIX HUNDED DOLLARS A YEAR. well with the paint we had just finished, and, having trimmed the edges the same evening, so as to gain time, were ready to begin our work as soon as break- fast was over next morning. ", There 's nothing like an early start," said Lucy, jocosely, as we spread out the rolls, to match and cut the breadths. ' You know the old maxim, --He that would thrive must rise at five, but he that has thriven may lie till seven.'" I looked at the clock, and saw that we were in good season, for it was only half past seven now, with breakfast over and cleared away. By dinner-time, we would probably be nearly or quite done our work. I had made a nice pan of paste, smooth, and without lumps, and the whitewash-brush, which is always kept clean and free from lime, answered very nicely to put it on the paper. So with the broad top of the ironing- table for a pasting-board, and a good step-ladder, we began our operations. The wall was hard and smooth, and therefore needed no preparation, which saved us much dirty work. I had often looked at -the paper-hangers, and observed just how they spread the paste on the back of the paper, and then doubled up the ends toward the mid- dle, --the pasted surfaces together. So I easilyimi- tated them, and as I had pasted a breadth, handed it to Lucy, who stood on the step-ladder, armed with a large towel, with which she smoothed and patted the paper, causing it to adhere closely to the wall, without air-bladders or wrinkles underneath. By the time the first breadth was in its place, the second .was already pasted, and as we had matched several beforehand, it fitted exactly as intended; and thus' we proceeded around the room until all was done. Then the bor- der, which had also been trimmed the nilght before, was cut' into strips about two yards long, and pasted on at the top, thus finishing it off very tastefully. By the time Arthur came home to dinner we were all done, and his surprise may be imagined when he   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. 171 saw the dining-room beautifully papered and painted, in the highest style of excellence; and all by the artistic hands of these two female amateurs, who were quite -as much pleased with their work as himself. When wp came to sum up the cost of our work, it amounted to just six dollars for the whole; the paper being four dollars; nine pounds of paint, at twenty cents, costing one dol- lar and eighty cents; and the other materials used, twenty cents more. This was a vast saving over trade prices, ,for the graining alone would have cost us more than the whole outlay for paint and paper. I thanked Lucy, over and over again, for her valuable lessons and assistance, but she seemed well paid in witnessing my satisfaction. I expect that every one who comes to the house, for some time after this, will be escorted by Arthur into the dining-room to admire the work of his ingenious wife; but Lucy deserves the praise, because the idea was entirely her own. I sometimes think that she could do almost anything she cared to attempt, she has so universal a talent for the useful and beautiful. I can clearly remember every word she said during that pleasant visit, which is in fact but just ended, and it seemed too short for all the questions and lessons I wished to ask and learn. Yet she gave me many pre- cepts, and much good advice, which I have treasured up in my head for future use. "Now that your income is rather larger," she said one day, as we sat at our wax-flower work, ( you will find a constant inclination to spend more;; and although you can indeed do so in a moderate degree, without the danger of,embarrassment, yet be careful of your pennies. Save them still, as carefully as when your income was but six hundred a year, for, at present rates of living, it is not really as much greater as it sounds. Your husband works hard to earn it, and with you lies the ability to save or to waste it. The world is said to be governed by three kings, - cash, commerce, and calico; so let the latter, which is per- ^ -  I '  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7785-00000091"/> 172 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. haps as powerful as either of the others, exert its power for good and not for evil. By the industry and frugality of the female portion of the population, homes prosper and difficulties innumerable disappear. 'If you know how to spend less than you earn,' says one, 'you have the philosopher's stone'; for, after all, it is not what we make, but what we save, that enriches us.' "I think I have already proved that in our own case," I replied; " for had Hfollowed the examples of many other soldiers' wives, who had the same opportunities, though not the same disposition, we would not have owned this house now. To be sure, I might have had a larger supply of silk dresses and finery in my ward- robe, but then I am satisfied to wait for these until the house is clear, and times change. In the mean time, I am willing to dress plainly, as before." "You were wise," rejoined Lucy; "for, situated as you are, you are yet far from being independent of contingencies. Suppose your husband was to die, or even be laid upon a bed of sickness, how much would a stock of fine clothes avail you then? A little fund, well invested, as yours is in your house, would be of far more value to you. You have proved that the rent of the house and furniture alone would sup- port you in case of such calamity. I have seen it somewhere stated, that a larger proportion of those who are called rich are in embarrassed circumstances than of the poorer population. The reason for this is, that a real or imagined necessity calls for greater out- lays and expenses among those-whose means are large than among those whose incomes are slender. A man, struggling along with only six hundred a year, may, through accident or miscalculation, be'forced to go fifty dollars beyond his income; but his neighbor, with twelve hundred, will, through greater efforts after show, incur a debt of two hundred, 'with less real ability to pay it than the former. Bad management lies at the bottom in both cases, but the man with   SIX HUNDRED DO LLARS A      YEAR.   173 double the amount of income need not quadruple his expenses." "Cousin Lucy, what a philosopher you are!"I exclaimed, as I listened to her remarks: "I sshall treasure your maxims, and endeavor to profit by them." . ,   &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7785-00000092"/> CHAPTER XVII. SAVING MONEY. -THE NEW ASSESSOR.- EXPOSING ONE'S SECRETS. - NATURAL REPUGNANCE. - INCREASED INCOME, LARGER TAXES. - PUBLISHNG INCOMES. -THE MORAL EFFECTS.- CONSOLA- TIONS. - CONCLUSION. T is singular how easy the business of ac- cumulating money becomes, when one has actually begun to save. A very rich man declared that his greatest difficulty had been to get possession of the first thousand dollars; but after that, it was the easiest thing to acquire a fortune. I do not know how this may be, never hav- ing been the self-complacent possessor of the prelimi- nary sum referred to but I do know that when we discovered there was a small surplus over our wants, it was remarkable how easily we were able to increase it. In our lowest condition, we never despaired of see- ing better times. If a sailor were to turn back when- ever a head wind came on, he would never make a voyage. We thus rarely permitted ourselves to be baf- fled by adverse circumstances; otherwise, like the sailor, we should have made no headway in the voyage of life. As to wealth, the prevailing idea is, that its chief power is to supply wants. In our case it was really so. But from the course pursued by some of our acquaint- ances, it appeared to have no other power than that of creating them. Soon after the beginning of the present year, as I saw by the newspapers, there grew up a great deal of trouble in the government about what was called i the reconstruction of the Union. I never studied the ,    SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. 175 merits of the question at issue, further than to get a correct understanding of the few primary principles, which lay at the bottom of this very exciting contro- versy. But my husband was thoroughly conversant with the whole subject. As he had fought for the Union, so he was now intensely interested in seeing it not only preserved, but purified. He read everything that catne along, and was thus able to repeat to me the sum and substance of everything that happened. Now, the reader-must know so much more of these matters than myself as to make it unnecessary for me to go into particulars. Still the controversy became so pervading as to affect even us. This happened in con- sequence of our old friend, the assessor, being turned out of office, and the appointment of an impudent igno- ramus in his place. My husband said that this turn- ing out of officers was a general thing over the coun- try, and was done solely on account of political prej- udices and partialities. Those who took their places were persons with more flexible consciences, who were willing to think and vote just as they were bid, for the sake of their offices. Well, one morning this summer, a ring at the bell was followed by the ushering into the parlor of a man of very coarse appearance, who looked to me as if he had been drinking. Without even taking off his hat, or bidding me good morning, he sat down on the sofa, and, opening a large book, looked up to re, and with great abruptness demanded, - "What is your income?" I was quite confounded by the unexpected question, thus bluntly asked, yet contrived to stammer out that I scarcely knew. "But I want to know how much it is," he continued. "How much silver plate have you? - how many watches? - and what do you live on " If the questions had been propounded in a gentle- manly way, one at a time, it is probable I could have answered them. But being put with clownish blunt-  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7785-00000093"/> DRED DOLTARS A    YEAR. ness, and all in the same breath, I became. confused, and unable to answer. I had never heard of people being questioned in this style. Moreover, these inci- dents of our domestic affairs had never been subjects of conversation with strangers. It was repugnant to my feelings to be obliged to expose, to one whom I had never before seen, all our little private matters; and I am sure this repugnance was greatly heightened by the uncouth manners of the new office-holder. i( You must see my husband, and get this informa- tion from him," I said at last. " But I can't be running after people's husbands," the fellow replied. " Then," I rejoined, quite indignant at his want of manners, "leave your paper, as the assessor did last' year, and when my husband has filled it up, you can call for it again." " Indeed I won't," he replied, with an air of newly- acquired consequence;  you may bring it yourself to my office." However, he handed me the familiar printed sched- ule, and left the house as unceremoniously as he had entered it. This new appointee was exactly calculated to render the collection of a disagreeable impost even more un- pleasant. Under any circumstances, we all dislike to make revelation of our pecuniary condition, - of how much we are worth, what is our income, how we made our money, &amp;c. People speak freely of other domestic incidents; but this of income is a sort of forbidden topic.  It was the invasion of this general family silence made by government, when it levied the in- come tax, that rendered it so unpopular. It compels us to lift the veil from family secrets that we are all unwilling to have exposed. The satisfaction of know ing how much our neighbor was worth was no com- pensation for the exposure of our own affairs. Up to this time we had been in the habit of having no reserve among our friends, as to how we got along in the   SIX HUNDRED DOLJLAIRS A YEAR. I77 world.    They all knew what salary Arthur :had re- ceived, what rent we paid, and that six hundred a year allowed no surplus. But no sooner was our income increased, and we had begun to save a little, than we became reserved, never afterwards going into particu- lars, as we had done when we were saving nothing. Hence the rude inroad of the newly-appointed assessor was peculiarly unpleasant.  It seems that other folks agree with us on this ques- tion. What surprises me, however, is, that there are supposed to be some real advantages flowing from this universal catechism about our incomes. A recent writer. for an English paper gives both sides of the question in the following article. "There is nothing about which an ordinary Englishman, and still more an ordinary Scotchman, is more reserved than the amount of his income. He would rather let you into the secret of the family skeleton than hint with truth how much money he is making every year. The notion of having this printed, and published in a book to which anybody who ever heard his name might have access, would make him uncontrollably furious, in spite of the great compensation he would have in being able to find out how much money everybody else was making every year. Yet it is not to be denied that he is not by any means dead to all curiosity as to the measure of his neighbor's prosperity. And, to a certain extent, there is some sort of moral justification for what at first seems a sheer piece of prying impertinence. For the knowledge of a man's income is one guide to the knowledge of his _character. If his income is of his (own earning, and not inherit- ed, its amount is the measure of his industry and perseverance, of his judgment, foresight, and general ability. Along with other things, it served as a rough index of his success in making the best of himself and his chances. Then again, whether he has earned it by the sweat of his own brow, or inherited it with- out this trouble, it is an excellent test of mahy of the most im- portant virtues which enter into character. " If you know how much a man earns or receives, you have some means of judging whether he is stingy or prudent, whether he is unjustly profuse or wisely generous, whether he has an eye to the contingencies of the future or is leaving the future to take care of itself, in order that he may snatch full enjoyment of the present. Besides all this, it is your neighbor's income which is in some sort the measure of the value of your own.

I An American may seize the admission both that there is this curiosity, and that, o0 the whole it is not altogether indefen- sible, and proceed to argue that the religious dimness with-which we all surround the amount of incomes is only a part of that half- morbid, half-sly reserve which is commonly thought by ignorant strangers to be an exhaustive account of the national character.  But there is something to be said on the other side. Is it not possible that a man hates talking freely about his income for the same reason that he -hates talking freely about anything else which concerns nobody very much but himself, from a dread of exhibiting one of the most offensive kinds of egotism? He thinks, perhaps, that a richer man than himself does not care one straw about the subject, while a poorer man is rather aggrieved. And even the richer man may be annoyed that his friend should be likely to run him close, because not even the best of men is ab- Solutely unwilling to think himself a shade better off in worldly goods than his acquaintance. The dread of intruding your own affairs on other people, which is one of the most respectable char- acteristics of the Briton, applies particularly when they are money affairs. And, by a reasonable inference, he dreads the in- trusion of other people in his affairs, throwing himself back on ,the ancient saw that, as an Englishman's house is his castle, so is his income. "But usage has probably more to do with the reserve on this point than any subtle moral considerations, or any deepllying national qualities. In India, for instance, there is whatseems an amazing frankness as to the amount of incomes. A European will tell you, without a question, exactly how many rupees a month he receives. For this, however, there is a reason. The most prominent and numerous class of Anglo-Indians are in the public service, ant the salary of even the most exalted among them can be discovered with the utmost nicety, on reference to an official directory, by anybody who cares to know. Parents and guardians, and anxious mammas with daughters and marrigeable mconsignments from England, have an infallible guide-book through the- crafty mazes of the suitor. No inextricable social embarrassment that we are aware of follows upon this publicity, any more in India than in the-United States. And it has its ad- vantages, which would scarcely vanish if the practice could be   SIXr, HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.!79 generally introduced at home. If every man's incone were pub- lished, it would, to begin with, act in the same way as the com- pulsory use of the word a c limited '? after the title of the joint- stock companies established on that principle. It would be a guide to tradesmen as to the amount of credit which they might safely give; though, indeed, from cases which occasionally come before the public, it would appear that most tradesmen are liter- ally very fond of trusting people whom they know to be thorough- ly insolvent. Again, if every man's income were known, nobody would be tempted, as so many are now, to live beyond, their means, just for the pleasure of making believe that they are much better off than they really are. "If a man with a thousand a year were spending two thou- sand, he would be aware that all his neighbors would look upon him as a great fool and knave. As it is, if he manages judicious- ly, it is surprising how long he may persuade them that he is really making the two thousand which they can very plainly per- ceive him to be spending. After all, however, this is only one out of several greater advantages which would flow from the practice of men showing themselves up in those true colors which are only known authentically to themselves. In- order to procure so desirable an end, one must invent a magical flute, which shall constrain every man who hears it to blurt out the truth about himself. Most unhappily, the necessity of making an income-tax return is singularly wanting in this magic virtue. Would it be too much to describe it as a preternatural instru- nment for turning even decently truthful men into liars? If King, David had found it advisable to levy an income-tax on his sub- jects, he would have continued to repeat at leisure what he'con- fesses to having said in his haste." Well, Arthur filled up the schedule, and sent it to the assessor. Of course we were no longer exempt from taxation; for' the difference between the six hundred dollars of former necessitous years, and our present more adequate fifteen hundred, must now be reported for taxation. Our tax was norw forty-seven dollars, in- stead of two, as in previous years, yet we were abund- antly better able to pay it. Though thus obliged to tell exactly what we were worth, still we Congratulated ourselves that no one knew anything of the matter but the assessor.   Judge, then, of our vexation, when, a few weeks afterwards, we saw    the list of- incomes of the whole town, published in the newspa- 1?  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7785-00000095"/> Ixo SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A     YEAR. per. We had seen similar lists in the great city papers, but our publishers at home had not had suffi- cient enterprise to serve up the same kind of local in- formation until now. It seemed that just as we were getting a trifle to report, we were to be exposed in this public manner. No doubt every-other person so reported felt exactly as we did. Indeed, there was. a general denunciation of the. editor, for committing so great an outrage. Every one of us thought that everybody else was scrutinizing his individual condi- tion; for we are all apt to think ourselves of much more importance than we really are. I confess, however, that, when I got a little over the first mortification of seeing ourselves in print, I went to examining the entire list, to see what were the incomes of our acquaintances, and even of others of whom we had only a hearsay knowledge. - It was certainly quite interesting to thus learn that Mr. A was not nearly so rich as he had been reported, and that Mr. B was a great deal more so, while Mrs. C was not justified by  her husband's slender income in giving so many expen- sive parties, and dressing herself and daughters so ex- travagantly as she did. The publication gave rise to an unheard-of amount of town gossip; for, though everybody denounced it, yet everybody wanted to see it. There was, of course, an unprecedented demand for the newspaper -containing it, showing that, after all, people are really eager for disagreeable things. I have no doubt that the editor's success in selling - papers will induce him to serve us up every year here- after, as long as we may have incomes to report. There was one feature of this publication that was quite remarkable. Many persons were denounced as having cheated the, revenue by not reporting their real incomes. There was a great amount of private accu- sation, but the assessor did not interfere to ascertain whether a fraud had been committed. The govern- ment was used to being cheated, and why should he trouble himself about it? Of the real usefulness of   SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. -181 this practice of publishing our incomes, I hardly know what to say. But on this point I may add some ob- servations of the writer just quoted. "It is difficult to see how the practice of giving publicity to the returns would improve their truthfulness. The people of whom the Chancellor of the Exchequer tells us from time to time would probably persevere in their dishonest courses, if their returns were ever so much exposed to the scrutiny of neighbors, who would be sure to detect the under-estimate they had too modestly made of their own good fortune. One cannot forget the story of the firm who, when their business premises were destroyed for some city  improvement, having to apply for compensation in proportion to their annual profits, represented those profits at just double the figure which appeared in their -return to the .income-tax; nor that other firm which submitted, without a word, to an increasing surcharge of ten thousand pounds for each of three consecutive  years. "If public morality is so low asuto permit men, in other respects of average passable honor, to perpetrate frauds of this kind on the government and on their honest fellow-tax-payers, we can hardly suppose- that the publication of a notoriously. untrue return would subject them to anything more unpleasant than a half-sympathetic laugh at their coolness. There is this, to be said, that, if the re- turns were published, it would be in a manner to one's own advantage rather to overestimate one's income. That is, a firm might make more than the fourpence in the pound they would have to pay, by the greater credit and standing which the reputa- tion for a larger income would give. Certainly, in the non-com- mercial world, there are plenty of people who would be very happy to pay twice fourpence in the pound, on an imaginary in- come, for the sake of the' advantages they might get from being supposed better off than in truth they were. A young barrister, for instance, might find it worth while to return himself for an income of twelve hundred pounds, when he was only magking six hundred. The greater prestige might be worth to him much-more than the fifteen or twenty pounds which he would have to pay on the imaginary six hundred. Social advantages of various kinds 'might be purchased by ingenious and insincere adventurers, by the same process of losing a sprat to catch a whale. In this way the publicity of incomes might be the means of foisting a thou- sand social counterfeits upon the world. It would be interesting to know how far any results of this kind have come of the American practice in the only country, so far as we know, where it prevails; and how far also, in the opinion of competent persons, it has the  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7785-00000096"/> i82 SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. ' effect of preventing people from shirking their public duties and cheating the revenue. "There is unquestionably a great deal of false and unintelligible delicacy about money-matters. The possession of a small income is too often spoken of in an under-breath, as we should speak of a man's father having gone mad, or of his wife having run away from him. A poor man mostly resents the assumption, in any pro- posed plan for business or for pleasure, that he is poor. A grace- ful hypocrite might make himself wonderfully popular by letting every man he met see, in a delicate way, that he reckoned his in- come to be not less than two thousand a year. Of course, there is a well-known form of affectation of a highly offensive kind, which consists -in perpetually hoisting your comparative poverty up for the wonder and admiration of the bystanders. L On the whole, this is more preposterous and disgusting than the vulgar boastings of the newly rich. But even these tiresome aunatrs of their poverty are Dno unwilling that you should sup- pose them to be much less poor than they pretend. There is another strange and unmanly affectation which is worth noticing. People in distress frequently decline to be assisted except on a false pretext. They won't take your help unless you will swear that it is only a loan, and not a gift. The fact that they can never by any possibility repay it counts for nothing in the debate. Or, they won't take it unless you accept an equivalent; that is to say, you pay them a five-pound note for a piece of embroidery which, if you happen to want it, you could buy in open market for three- pence; or else you must take a trumpery drawing, or some liter- ary trash, in order that the recipient may not lose his or her self- respect. As if there were any reason for men and women to cease to respect themselves because they have fallen into tribulation, or as if they could respect themselves the more because they insist on a strictly business transaction, which, as a business transaction, is simply an impudent swindle. . But, just as it is difficult in polit- ical economy to teach people that money is only a commodity like another, so it is to persuade them to look. at it in a frank and sen- sible way in ordinary social dealings," ( But time works wonders in our feelings, as it some- times does in our circumstances. We have already nearly recovered from the mortification of seeing our little income paraded in the newspaper.    We have a consolation, moreover; for we know that it is gradually increasing under a strict adherence to our original plans of economy.   When it reaches up   into the   SIX HUNDRED D OLLARS A YEAR.        3 thousands, neither Arthur nor myself will care a penny who knows what it is. It will be enough to be assured that, so long as we report even a sipgle dollar, there is a guaranty that behind it will be found the really all-sufficient six hundred a year.
