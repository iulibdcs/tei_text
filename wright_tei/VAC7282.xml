            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Days of Shoddy, as the reader will readily anticipate, are the opening months of
               the present war, at which time the opprobrious name first came into general use as a
               designation for swindling and humbug of every character; and nothing more need be
               said to indicate the scope of this novel. It would be easy for the writer, if he felt
               disposed to forestall criticism, or if he doubted that the work itself would be found
               its own apology,—to point out those features in its construction most likely to
               provoke unfavorable comment, and to prove (at least to his own satisfaction) that all
               such points, possibly to be considered blemishes by others, were really beauties of
               the first prominence. The fact is, meanwhile, that he does not feel that any
               prefatory apology is necessary, while he does recognize the propriety of a few words
               of explanation that may not be supplied by the body of the work. The considerable
               number of footnotes appended in certain portions, giving to the book at times more
               the appearance of a dry statistical volume or an erudite history than a mere work of
               current romance, may be regarded as an innovation, but the writer hopes cannot be
               considered objectionable in a novel having for its foundation the hard facts of
               contemporary history,—in spite of the denunciations of August William Schlegel, the
               distinguished German critic and essayist, against<pb n="24-25 (Table of Contents) "
                  xml:id="VAC7282-00000006"/> "notes to a poem," which he declares to be as much out
               of place as "anatomical lectures on a savory joint served up at table." The objection
               may lie quite as strongly against "notes to a novel"; but if so, Sir Walter, whose
               prefatory and appendiary remarks in many of his novels were merely notes set in
               another form, must be called as the quite sufficient antagonist of the German.—A
               second objection might lie against the discursive character of certain portions of
               the work, but it is hoped will not do so when we remember how we trifle with
               side-issues that seem pleasant, in every relation of life, from the child turning
               aside to pluck flowers or catch butterflies on his way to school, to the soldier
               loitering his night at the theatre when he knows that the interests of the country
               call him to hurry on to the field without an hour's delay.—And still a third might be
               urged against the large aggregate of denunciation of national vices, with so small a
               proportion of pointed personalities; while the explanation of that feature, if any is
               necessary, lies in the belief that the exposure of the vices and follies of the time
               will be found much more effectual for the common good, if it indicates, and provokes
               examination of official documents, than it could be if it closed inquiry as well as
               excited it, by merely gibbeting a few prominent wrong-doers, under their real names.
               The writer, in conclusion, takes the opportunity of thanking press and public for the
               very great kindness shown to a previous venture in the same direction, and of
               promising that if their favor continues, the mine of romance of the rebellion, thus
               opened, will not be allowed to lie unexplored.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ROUND the corner of Ann Street into Broadway, at Barnum's Museum, broke a newsboy,
                  and ran rapidly across towards the Astor House and the mercantile streets on the
                  north side of the town, a bundle of papers under his arm, just procured, after a
                  tough scramble and a short fight, from the Herald press-room on Ann Street, the
                  door of which was hopelessly beset by a multitude of the anxious disseminators of
                  general information.</p>
               <p>Very dirty faced was the newsboy, known at the "hotel" which he patronized, by the
                  soubriquet of "Coffee Joe," and shabby and ragged were the ill-fitting clothes
                  that sheltered him from the statute against indecent exposures in the street, and
                  kept him out of the clutches of the police. The wreck of a blue coat that he wore
                  had once belonged to a full-grown man, and the sleeves were turned back six
                  inches, to expose his grimy hands, while the draggled skirts nearly swept the
                  ground; the patched and greasy trowsers might have been reduced from their
                  original size in the same proportion; one<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7282-00000010"/>
                  boot and one shoe, both in a state of serious dilapidation, the former run down at
                  the heel and the latter guiltless of a string, covered so much of his feet as did
                  not peep out at the yawning toes; and the cap smashed low on the top of a shock
                  head frowsed by his last night in the Newsboys' Lodging-House and since uncombed,
                  seemed almost certain to have passed through a dozen previous ownerships and been
                  at least two or three times thrown away before it had come into his
                  possession.</p>
               <p>Not a romantic or even a picturesque figure, certainly—this type of the modern
                  Mercury, who has not only supplanted the ancient but outdone him both in speed and
                  lying. And yet he becomes a highly important figure at times, as he first holds in
                  his hand the intelligence which is to thrill thousands of hearts with pride or
                  sorrow. And in this instance, as Coffee Joe hurried across Broadway, skilfully
                  heedless of carts or omnibuses, and took his way past the Astor House towards some
                  of the jobbing streets in which he seemed to have special customers, he formed for
                  the moment a leading attraction. Others of the fraternity followed close behind
                  and scattered themselves among the throng that seemed to fill the whole lower part
                  of the city; but Coffee Joe, who had succeeded in securing the first instalment of
                  the latest edition, was ahead and consequently in great demand. Yelling as he ran,
                  a cry which seemed to strike with terrible force every heart upon which it fell,
                  he still did not pause to gather the fruit of the excitement he had sown; and the
                  cries of "Here, boy!" "Give us a paper!" and the grasps made at the package under
                  his arm, did not prevent his making excellent time to one of the corners above,
                  and dashing down, with his cry still ringing, into the mercantile precincts of
                  Murray Street. Let it not be supposed, meanwhile, that the fever of the seekers
                  after information who lined the sidewalk in front of the Astor House remained
                  uncooled; for some of Coffee Joe's compatriots came on rapidly and in good order,
                  and the damp sheets with half a column of intelligence and twenty lines of
                  sensation-heading, flew around as if they had been another description of leaves
                  and blown by another gale than the breath of general anxiety.</p>
               <p>When it is understood that the time was Saturday afternoon the 13th of April,
                  1861, and that the cry of Coffee Joe was "Extry Herald! Burnin' and surrender of
                  Fort Sumter!" the cause of all the excitement will be apparent. Nor is it
                  necessary to do more than merely allude to the feeling over all the loyal States
                  at that crisis, the events and the sensations of which are yet a part of the late
                  memories of this generation. How about Anderson and his little band, upholding the
                  flag when all around it floated a bunting unknown to Washington and the Fathers,
                  had clustered a feeling not more personal than natural. How the whole land had
                  rejoiced when he removed from Moultrie to Sumter and seemed to hold Charleston at
                  his mercy. How the popular heart had writhed over the exhaustion of his supplies,
                  the miserable failure of the attempt to reinforce him with the Star of the West,
                  and the action or inaction of a government which seemed to have neither power nor
                  will to sustain the national honor. How a miserable hoax with the statement that
                  Anderson had attacked and reduced Moultrie and bombarded Charleston, had a few
                  days before created a wild delirium of delight, that settled back to despair when
                  the falsity of the story was known. How Saturday morning had brought the
                  intelligence of the bombardment of Sumter and the outrage on the flag; and how all
                  day long the reports of the conflict had varied but gradually grown more
                  threatening, business suspended, the newspaper offices and bulletins besieged, the
                  corners occupied by infuriated crowds, and the popular heart sick unto death as
                  the last rumor came that Sumter was in flames and must surrender.</p>
               <p>It was at the moment when this report had been for a few minutes bulletined, when
                  the first sheets of the extras announcing it were just damp from the press and in
                  the hands of the excited newsboys, that Coffee Joe made his way, hot, dirty and
                  self-important, past the gesticulating crowd at the Astor House and down into one
                  of the commercial streets leading to the North River, just above it.</p>
               <p>"Extry Herald! Last edishin! Burnin' and surrender of Fort Sumter!" rang his
                  shrill cry, broken at every moment by some one stopping him on the sidewalk,
                  jerking one of<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7282-00000011"/> the sheets before he had
                  fairly extricated it from the bundle and tossing into his hand the half-dime or
                  five pennies that the politic newsboy demanded for so late and so precious an
                  announcement.</p>
               <p>He was half way down the street, midway between Broadway and College Place. No
                  matter what letter of the alphabet would supply the initial necessary to designate
                  that particular street. He was in front of a large iron-fronted importing and
                  jobbing cloth-warehouse, the wide gilt sign over the door of which may read, for
                  the purposes of this narration, "Charles Holt &amp; Andrews."</p>
               <p>"Here, boy!" in a loud tone; and Coffee Joe ran up the iron steps to supply an
                  extra to one of the junior clerks who stood in the half-opened door, pennies in
                  hand. The trade rapidly effected and the pennies pouched to the satisfaction of
                  the vendor, that important personage ran on down the street with his accustomed
                  yell, while the clerk, glancing for an instant at the display-lines at the head of
                  the first column of the paper, shut the door and disappeared within.</p>
               <p>It was later than the hour at which most of the jobbing-houses generally closed
                  their business for the day at that time of the year; but the necessity of packing
                  and shipping certain goods sold to Western customers, and the impossibility that
                  day of attending very steadily to any description of work for more than five
                  minutes at a time, had prevented the store closing up; and the principal and
                  several of his clerks remained at their posts, making occasional darts out into
                  the street and even up as far as the Astor House to catch the latest news, and
                  then returning to make some pretence of examining accounts and comparing invoices,
                  but really to talk more or less connectedly over the events of that day for which
                  it seemed that all the previous days of the nation must have been made.</p>
               <p>The interior of the heavy importing cloth-house of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews at
                  that moment presented an appearance very familiar to all those whose business has
                  frequently led them into places of corresponding character, but novel and
                  instructive to those who have either never seen such places at all, or merely
                  passed them with a glance in through the doorways at what seemed to be
                  wildernesses of merchandize.</p>
               <p>An immense room, perhaps one hundred and fifty feet in depth by thirty wide, with
                  high ceilings finished with ornamented cornices and a row of slim fluted iron
                  pillars extending from front to rear in the centre and supporting the weight
                  stored in the stories above. No less than three pairs of heavy double doors
                  opening to the street, but two of them closed, with a "fist" scrawled on a piece
                  of paper inside the glass, and the direction: "The other door." To the left, in
                  front, nearly one quarter the width of the whole room taken away by the space
                  occupied for the outer stairway, closed in with ground glass and iron
                  lattice-work. In the centre and towards the rear an oblong skylight, through which
                  the light came softened down from above, throwing into bold view certain
                  descriptions of goods that the buyer could be allowed to view closely without
                  damage to the interests of the seller. At the right, a heavily balustraded
                  stairway leading up to the floor above, and below it another running in a parallel
                  direction but leading down into the dusky basements. All around and on every side,
                  covering every available foot of space and making blocks of goods with aisles
                  between, something like the squares and streets of a city, woollens of every
                  color, cost and texture, from the finest and softest Saxony broad-cloth that ever
                  the Emperor put on, on a night when there was "a good deal expected of him in
                  society," to the heaviest and clumsiest pilot-cloth that ever wrapped Pilot Joe in
                  a rough night off the Hook; woollens in cubic roods of unopened cases, and in
                  great piles of uncut rolls that spoke only of wholesaleing on the most magnificent
                  scale and seemed sufficient to clothe all the generations that had lived since the
                  Flood. Here and there a costly velvet glittering like a diamond among ordinary
                  gems; and at rare intervals some cube of brilliant stuff for the wear of the
                  softer sex, enlivening the whole like some sprinkling of the sex itself amid the
                  rough mass of its opposite; but the great bulk woollens of weight, of cost, and of
                  undeniably male destination. Up that heavy stair, down its opposite into the
                  regions below, everywhere within those massive doors, the stock and<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000012"/> the general appearance of what is so well known as
                  an extensive cloth-house in the metropolis. Extending nearly across the room at
                  the rear, the counting-room, only separated from the rest by a massive and high
                  walnut railing, with half a dozen desks, single and double, broadly lighted from
                  the rear end of the skylight, some of them bearing heavy canvassed account-books,
                  and others devoted to the more hurried purposes of cashier and salesmen. A
                  coal-burning Franklin stove, not yet closed up for the summer and with a slight
                  fire of Breckinridge coal yet sparkling and sputtering there—an immense safe built
                  into the wall and one of the doors standing half open—two or three high stools for
                  the desks and as many comfortable office-chairs for lounging during more idle
                  hours. Such was the picture presented, in all inanimate particulars, at the moment
                  when Coffee Joe's extra flew into the house of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews, late on
                  that April afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Charles Holt, the senior partner of the house, and head of what was believed
                  to be one of the most prosperous dry-goods firms in the city, had remained at his
                  place of business, like his subordinates, somewhat beyond ordinary business hours,
                  and sat leaning back on one of the office-chairs within the railing, solacing
                  himself with a prime Havana, silent and apparently in thought, and his right hand
                  listlessly (or perhaps nervously) playing with the heavy chatelaine guard-chain
                  that dangled from his vest. The merchant might have been forty years of age, or
                  perhaps two or three years past that mature period. He seemed above the middle
                  height, well-formed, in fine health and preservation, with dark hair, dark eyes,
                  and a placid if not pleasant face, wearing no beard except a very short
                  side-whisker running down to the level of his mouth,—was faultlessly dressed in
                  black, except that his coat was an "office" one instead of frock or dress, and the
                  hat that stood on the desk near him was new, tasteful and becoming. He looked the
                  successful and, at the same time, respectable man of business, to perfection; and
                  something more than the average keenness of observation was necessary to perceive
                  that there were certain lines under the eyes and about the mouth, easily worn by
                  passion at forty years or before fore, but seldom set even by hard work without
                  some proportion of indulgence.</p>
               <p>At one of the desks close beside him stood Mr. Wales, the book-keeper,—a
                  gray-haired, quiet and respectable-looking man, running down a column of figures
                  in one of his books, before delivering them over to the care of Silas C. Herring
                  for the night. One of the clerks, Mr. West, was reading an evening paper, standing
                  and leaning against the railing on the opposite side of the counting-room from his
                  employer; and another, Mr. Burtnett Haviland, was arranging some packages of
                  goods, at a little distance, into more becoming order before closing.</p>
               <p>As the latter is destined to play quite as important a part in this relation as
                  even his employer, he is entitled to the same justice of a brief personal
                  description. He was apparently not more than twenty-five or twenty-seven years of
                  age, a little above the medium height, rather slight than stout, but with no
                  impression of weakness or ill health. He was brown-haired and hazel-eyed, wearing
                  his brown beard full but short, a little of the ruddy tinge of exercise and
                  constant employment upon his cheek, dressed in a dark-gray business suit fitting
                  him very loosely—altogether a pleasant, clever, good-looking fellow, a successful
                  salesman of dry-goods, and popular enough in his general demeanor to make him a
                  desirable acquisition in the dry-goods trade there or elsewhere, though scarcely a
                  man of peculiar mark to catch the eye of the casual observer.</p>
               <p>"See here, Mr. Holt, the thing is done!" said Foster, one of the junior clerks—a
                  bright-eyed, dark-haired, round-faced boy of twenty—stepping hastily back from the
                  door, with the extra in his hand. "Sumter is on fire, and Major Anderson has
                  agreed to surrender!" Foster was very young, little more than a boy, in feeling as
                  well as years, and there was a grief in his tone that might easily have been
                  followed by weeping and sobbing. Some of these very young people take griefs and
                  shames much harder, whether they have reference to a lost love or a lost land,
                  than they are likely to do after a few years of hardening in the world. The lazy
                  young scamp was only teaching a great moral truth, when he turned over<pb
                     n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7282-00000013"/> on his bed at midnight, informed of the
                  sudden death of his father, said: "How sorry I shall be—in the morning!" and
                  dropped to sleep again. He was too busy, with sleep, to be grieved
                     <emph>then!</emph> The young have not only freshness of heart to feel grief or
                  joy, which their elders lack, but they are less busy and absorbed, and have
                     <emph>time to be sorry.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Eh!" said Holt, the merchant, taking the paper from Foster's hand and glancing
                  his eye over the heading. "Yes, so he has. The thing is done, indeed. Wales," to
                  the book-keeper, "who knows but that may bring on a regular fight? and then all
                  those Southern accounts that have been doubtful would not be worth a snap of the
                  fingers!"</p>
               <p>"Just so, as you say, Mr. Holt," said the placid and gray-headed Wales. "There may
                  be a war, and then I do not see much chance for collecting them."</p>
               <p>Charles Holt, the merchant, rose to his feet and walked two or three times across
                  the counting-room. His face looked sombre, and his mouth was working with
                  displeasure. Of what was he thinking?—the shame and wrong that had fallen upon the
                  country, or the fact that all the Southern accounts were apparently gone beyond
                  recall? No one who saw his face at that moment, could answer. There was an Eye
                  looking down into his heart, meanwhile, and the sublime intelligence informing
                  that Eye could have decided the question. But it did not, to mortal mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holt had laid down the paper after glancing at the heading of the news, and
                  Wales, after also glancing at it for an instant, handed it over to Haviland, who
                  stepped forward a little eagerly to catch a glimpse of it after he had finished
                  his work. The clerk took it, threw himself hastily upon an unopened case of goods,
                  and seemed to be perusing the double-leaded column with almost painful
                  interest.</p>
               <p>The front-door again opened at that moment, and a small figure came in from the
                  street and back toward the counting-room. It was that of little Tim, the
                  errand-boy, who had probably never known any other name. He had a letter in his
                  hand, and brought it at once to Mr. Holt, displaying, as he did so, a face and a
                  figure equally singular. Perhaps it may have been some idea of benevolence, and
                  perhaps it may have been mere oddity, that induced the merchant to take this queer
                  little morsel of humanity into his employ. He was some fourteen years old, stout
                  enough for his age, but not too tall for ten. He had a shock head of stiff,
                  straight red hair, too unmanageable to allow of his putting on his cap in the
                  ordinary manner, that useful head-covering being accordingly hung upon half a
                  dozen tufts of the human scrubbing-brush, springing from the back of his crown.
                  His broad face, which would not otherwise have been ill-looking, was marred by a
                  cast in the left eye which gave him the most comical squint imaginable. Though the
                  other eye was straight enough, no one had ever been able to discover exactly the
                  direction in which Tim was looking; and it was generally supposed that he would
                  have been invaluable as a spy, from that qualification. An orphan, or worse, he
                  had been for two years in the employ of Holt and Andrews, quick and willing enough
                  as an errand-boy, able to read the direction on a letter or a package when not
                     <emph>too</emph> badly written, capable of making, very slowly and with
                  difficulty, certain odd hieroglyphics which were just decipherable as writing, and
                  supposed to have little knowledge or observation beyond. A couple of suits of
                  ordinary dark cassimere or satinett, with cheap caps and coarse shoes to match,
                  furnished the little fellow with outer clothing for a year; and he was known to
                  sleep somewhere over on the east side of the town, in poor lodgings but a little
                  remove better than those of Coffee Joe. That was all, known of him by his
                  employers or those employed with him: that was all, cared for him by any except
                  perhaps one of the whole number. And why was not that enough? What more of
                  interest could there possibly be in the life or fortunes of the insignificant
                  errand-boy?</p>
               <p>Little Tim's one straight eye seemed to be quite sufficient to make him aware that
                  something unusual was agitating the people in the store, and perhaps he had been
                  listening to the conversation that had taken place there during the earlier part
                  of the day, or caught something of the purport of the talking in the street, for
                  he squinted worse than ever in the effort to look serious and respectable, as he
                  handed the letter to Mr. Holt; and then he fell back into his normal condition,<pb
                     n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7282-00000014"/> so expressive of abject poverty and
                  dependence, by crowding himself between two dry-goods boxes that were separated a
                  few inches, and sitting on the floor, his odd face peering elfishly out, and his
                  crooked eye seeming to play about like a flash of heat-lightning as he twisted it
                  hither and thither in the effort to look into the faces of all his superiors at
                  once.</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland held the newspaper before his face with one hand, while the
                  other supported his shoulders on the box, for several minutes—long enough to have
                  read over the half column of telegraphic announcement at least half a dozen times.
                  His face was sheltered from the others by the paper, and as he uttered no word
                  they could have no idea what was the effect produced upon him or what were the
                  thoughts passing through his mind. But directly all doubt on the subject was
                  dissipated, for they saw him drop the paper, throw his face between both his
                  hands, and give vent to such sounds as showed that the strong man was sobbing.
                  Yes—sobbing; the word is written, and it need not be recalled. It has been said
                  that poor young Foster, the junior clerk, came very near to shedding tears as he
                  glanced at the heading of the intelligence and saw how the country had been
                  insulted and disgraced: here was a much older man than he, who should have had
                  more knowledge of the world and whose years should have made him firmer and
                  calmer—actually breaking into sobs over the disgrace inflicted upon his country,
                  as he might have done over the body of an only child. Shame upon his manhood? No!
                  Shame upon the cold and sluggish heart that does not realize how nearly deep
                  feeling and true courage are allied, and how exquisitely above all pathos are
                  those words of Bayard Taylor, concluding his picture of the Crimean soldiers
                  singing "Annie Laurie" and thinking through tears of Mary and Norah at home, then
                  marching to death before the iron mouths of the Russian cannon on the Malakoff,
                  without a blench or a tremor:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The bravest are the tenderest;</l>
                        <l>The loving are the daring."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There are hearts that have bled over the wrongs and outrages inflicted upon the
                  country, since that day, and over the fear of final loss which must ever haunt
                  devoted love,—more sadly than the same hearts have ever sorrowed for the death and
                  burial of their dearest. And if there is a hope that the Land of the West will
                  ever arise from the ashes of its humiliation and put on the full glory which
                  belongs to it as the freest and greatest among nations, that hope must be born of
                  the belief that the God of Nations has been besought for it in prayer, with such
                  agonized wrestlings as would have pleaded for the life of one dear beyond all
                  expression, or for the safety of a perilled soul.</p>
               <p>But enough of this. Burtnett Haviland was sobbing over the degradation of his
                  country, beyond a question, and his employer and his associates saw the strange
                  spectacle. The two mismatched eyes between the boxes saw the exhibition, too, for
                  the queer face was drawn into as near an approach to sympathy as it was capable of
                  expressing, and there may even have been moisture trembling under those short,
                  stubby eye-lids.</p>
               <p>Not a word was spoken by either of the persons present, for several minutes. Each
                  was thinking, without doubt, in his own way and from his own point of view, of the
                  crisis which had been reached and the evidence before them of even morbidly
                  patriotic feeling. At length Mr. West said, illustrating the mercantile habit of
                  thinking that there must be material and action before results:—</p>
               <p>"Talking about fighting—what are we going to do it with? We have no army. No army
                  at all—not more than eight or ten thousand; and to punish those hounds as they
                  deserve we shall need a hundred."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said Charles Holt, though he added no words to explain whether the
                  expression was one of assent or dissent. The face of Haviland was yet buried in
                  his hands, though his sobs had ceased and he was evidently listening. Who knows
                  but he was a little ashamed to meet the gaze of his companions, after such an
                  exhibition of child-like emotion?</p>
               <p>"The Mexican War game must be played over again," West went on. "We must have men
                  enough to sweep over every one of the seceded States like a whirlwind——"</p>
               <p>"Enough to tumble down every house in Charleston, and<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000015"/> sow salt where every blade of grass grows in the
                  neighborhood," broke out young Foster, who had before with difficulty restrained
                  himself.</p>
               <p>"We shall need at least an hundred thousand," repeated West. How little he, or any
                  of the others, realized the miserable insufficiency of that "hundred thousand,"
                  for any such purpose as putting down the gigantic rebellion, or how many more than
                  that hundred thousand would lie in soldiers' graves before the struggle had more
                  than commenced! How little even the President, surrounded by his Cabinet at
                  Washington, and preparing to call out <emph>seventy-five thousand troops,</emph>
                  realized the extent of the task upon which he was about to enter! How little has
                  he, and have they, and have we, realized the stupendousness of the undertaking to
                  restore the Union, many a day since the 13th of April, 1861!</p>
               <p>"An hundred thousand?—a great number of troops! Where can they be got?" said the
                  gray-haired and prudent Mr. Wales, whose habit of dealing with the hard reality of
                  figures necessarily made him exceedingly prudent in his calculations.</p>
               <p>"Got? by volunteering!" replied young Foster, who sprung to the solution with a
                  bound, as is the manner of unchastened youth.</p>
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> will be one of the volunteers!" cried Burtnett Haviland,
                  uncovering his face, springing from the box on which he had been seated, shaking
                  back the hair from his forehead with the gesture of one who is throwing off an
                  incubus, and standing firmly erect in the aisle between the piles of
                  dry-goods.</p>
               <p>"You?" asked the merchant, in a tone of surprise, which indicated that if he had
                  considered the raising of an army as necessary or possible, he had thought of it
                  as taking place somewhere in Maine or Wisconsin, and by no means at his own
                  door.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>I!</emph>" repeated Haviland. "Let the call be made, as it
                     <emph>must</emph> be made if they are not all traitors at Washington as well as
                  at Charleston, and I will be one."</p>
               <p>"And your family?" asked the prudent Mr. Wales. "You have a wife and child. Can
                  you <emph>afford</emph> to leave <emph>them?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"God help me!—I had forgotten <emph>them!</emph>" said the young man; and deeply
                  as he had been excited, a smile flitted over his face at the thought that even for
                  one moment he could have forgotten the two dearest objects of his love. "No, I
                  suppose I cannot go, even when the call is made, for a soldier's pay is very
                  little, and I cannot leave Mary and little Pet to suffer and perhaps to starve.
                  Eh, well! Heigho!"</p>
               <p>During all the conversation just recorded, Mr. Holt, the merchant, as before
                  indicated, had seemed to take little interest in it and to be absorbed in thought.
                  Now, there was a marked change in his manner, though only a close observer could
                  have detected it. There was a new light in his eye, and a slight flush upon his
                  cheek, making him decidedly finer-looking than before, while he rose from his
                  chair, threw the remains of his cigar into the grate and stood erect near the
                  railing, outside of which Haviland yet kept his position. What could have produced
                  this sudden change in the calculating merchant and the cool man of business?</p>
               <p>"There may not be any such call for troops as you anticipate, Mr. Haviland," he
                  said, "and even if there should be, I certainly was for the moment surprised at
                  your idea of quitting my employment to become a soldier. But we all owe something
                  to our country, of course; and I can only say that if a call for troops does take
                  place, and you really wish to do your share in revenging this gross insult to our
                  flag, you need not think so discouragingly of the pecuniary affair. I should of
                  course continue your salary during your absence, and in the event of any
                  misfortune to yourself I <emph>believe</emph> that I should be liberal enough to
                  see to it that your family did not suffer."</p>
               <p>There had been persons disposed to say of Charles Holt, in previous days, that he
                  was not the person to display Quixotic liberality—that he never entered into a
                  contract unless he had at least a fair probability of getting the best of the
                  bargain. How must those narrow and illiberal persons, had they been present at
                  that juncture, have acknowledged the falsity of their allegations and owned the
                  grandeur of the spectacle of the American merchant standing boldly up in the<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7282-00000016"/> first hour of his country's need, and
                  offering to pay out of his own coffers for the services of a soldier to swell the
                  ranks of her defenders!</p>
               <p>At least such was the aspect of princely liberality which the proposal bore to
                  Haviland, who allowed his feelings to master him sufficiently to step forward to
                  the railing, grasp his employer by the hand (a liberty which he was by no means in
                  the habit of taking), and thanking him out of a full heart.</p>
               <p>"I thank you indeed, very much, Mr. Holt," he said, "and I am too poor to refuse
                  your kind offer if I really have occasion to become a volunteer. There may be no
                  occasion; but if there is, be sure that I shall be among the first, now that you
                  have made my mind easy as to the duty I owe my family,—and that I shall try to
                  keep you from being a loser by your generous kindness."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you will have occasion," said young Foster, who had no doubt by this time
                  fully planned out half a dozen campaigns to avenge Sumter, and who certainly had
                  acquired the soldier-fever to quite as great an extent as Haviland. "Perhaps I
                  ought not to ask you, Mr. Holt," he went on, after a half moment of hesitation,
                  "but suppose that <emph>I</emph> should find myself in the same condition, would
                  you continue <emph>my</emph> salary and look a little after the welfare of my old
                  mother?"</p>
               <p>It could not have been that the merchant was any respecter of persons, in
                  providing prospective soldiers before they were demanded; but certainly his face
                  fell a little at this question, and he did not answer in quite so high and
                  patriotic a tone:</p>
               <p>"You? Why—yes—I suppose so."</p>
               <p>It is just possible that there was even a shade of vexation in his voice. Perhaps
                  he knew that if the country really did need protectors, enthusiastic boys like
                  young Foster were not likely to make quite such reliable soldiers as older and
                  better-seasoned men like Haviland. Perhaps he merely hesitated in pity for the
                  extreme youth of the boy, thinking of the chances of the battle-field, the
                  possible grief of the mother over her son, and all that class of emotional
                  speculations. Perhaps—but the other hypotheses must develope themselves in due
                  course.</p>
               <p>During the course of this conversation the spring afternoon had closed nearly into
                  dusk, the remaining business of the day had been completed by the junior clerks
                  and the porter, no more extras were bawled in the street—in fact no more were
                  needed or looked for, now that the catastrophe was known; and the house of Charles
                  Holt &amp; Andrews closed for the night, the persons we have named separating with
                  widely different feelings. It is not necessary, at this period, to follow the
                  reflections of the merchant as he wended his way through the still-excited and yet
                  gesticulating crowd on the corner of his street and Broadway, to catch one of the
                  omnibuses for his up-town residence—what those reflections really were, will be
                  much more satisfactorily developed in the action which soon followed. Grave old
                  Mr. Wales took a car for his quiet home on the west side of the town, his head a
                  little confused, between the figures of his daily habit and the strange excitement
                  which had just burst in and sent them flying hither and thither. West was not so
                  excited by the thought of the peril threatening his country, as to forget the
                  little game of billiards which he had promised to play with one of his brother
                  clerks at a saloon not far from the Park, after dinner; and he strolled away to
                  keep his engagement. Young Foster, who still would keep jumping at his
                  conclusions, almost forgot his hat as he left the store, in the excitement of the
                  national crisis and the thought how proud his old mother would be to see him in a
                  gray uniform precisely like that worn by the Seventh (he had made up his mind that
                     <emph>his</emph> corps, at least, would certainly dress in that highly becoming
                  manner), and how much prouder still she would be when, after performing some
                  wonderful feat of arms as a common soldier in the ranks, he should come home
                  radiant under a somewhat rapid promotion and with the epaulettes (the
                  shoulder-straps were not then known as they are to-day) of a general!</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland, as he left his place of employment and walked for some distance
                  up Broadway before taking the car which was to bear him to his home, bore a heart
                  filled with conflicting emotions. He had within him, perhaps, none of the
                  materials of the hero except courage and devotion. His<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000017"/> reading, though somewhat extensive and very general
                  had not led him much among the demigods of romance and romantic history—he knew of
                  them, but had never sat at their feet and worshipped. Possibly he had never even
                  been aware that his heart beat more warmly for the honor and welfare of his native
                  land, than that of any one of the first half dozen men he might happen to meet in
                  the street; and possibly he would have been as much shocked at the very idea that
                  he could do any thing patriotically heroic, as he could have been by the knowledge
                  that he had done something dishonest and shameful. He was simply a wholehearted
                  and patriotic citizen, proud of the flag under which he lived, and the country
                  that had been growing so fast in power and glory; grateful for the peace and
                  protection which had been accorded him under the best system of government known
                  to the history of the world; pained, shocked and horrified at the thought that
                  red-handed traitors against such a government and such a country could be found;
                  and determined, so far as in him lay, that the means should not be wanting to
                  crush out the rebellion which began to threaten the national existence. He had
                  felt and resolved thus, as a matter of duty—not because he thought of being, or
                  wished to be, a hero.</p>
               <p>But what a change had one short hour made in his position in the world! An hour
                  before he had been engaged in the peaceful pursuits of mercantile life, with no
                  thought that he should ever change the sphere of his action,—a happy husband and
                  father, with no intention of ever being separated from the objects of his love,
                  for any longer period than an occasional day passed in business or recreation. Now
                  he stood committed to his companions, his country and his own heart, to don the
                  garb of a soldier, to separate himself for perhaps a long period from all that he
                  held dear in the world, and to plunge into a mad exposure of his life on the
                  battlefield. For not for one instant had he doubted, after reading the contents of
                  Coffee Joe's extra, that a war for the preservation of the Union must come, and
                  come at once; and not for an instant had he faltered in his determination,
                  expressed in that moment of excitement, to be among the first to respond to any
                  call made upon the citizen soldiery of the land. Of the life that was to be
                  perilled he thought but little—fewer men think of the exposure of their lives,
                  when going into difficulty and danger, than the popular belief would warrant. But
                  Mary and Pet—his dear little wife and the one child of his love—he did think of
                  the possible parting with them, with a prescient anxiety little short of agony;
                  and it is not strange that he passed along the street, and saw the groups of
                  gesticulating men gathered upon every corner, and saw the old flag drooping from
                  flagstaff and shop-window, with such a feeling as if he had become suddenly set
                  apart and separated from the world—a determined but a sad-hearted martyr to evil
                  times and inevitable duties.</p>
               <p>Tim, the errand-boy, also went home, with his head quite as full of new sensations
                  as either that of his employer or his employer's clerk. As he plunged down
                  Frankfort Street and across the Swamp towards the garret where his straw pallet
                  was nightly spread out, he muttered words between his teeth which were almost as
                  unaccountable to himself as they may possibly be to the reader.</p>
               <p>"Don't know 'bout that!" he said. "Boss was a big sight williner to hev Misser
                  Hevlin go 'way, than he was to let Fosser go, an he keers a great deal the mos'
                  about Hevlin, for Fosser ain't much use, no how. Wonner what he wants Hevlin to go
                  'way fur? Dern him! he does want Hevlin to go 'way—I know it! Missers Hevlin cum
                  down to the store tother day, and I seen Boss look at her so funny! Dern him! I've
                  seen him look at her two'r three times, jes so—jes as if his mouth was a-waterin'
                  an' he wanted to eat her up. Wonner if big men like Boss ever <emph>do</emph> eat
                  up wimmen, when they're other fokeses, or wot they want of 'em! Dern him! he'd

                  since. Dern him! don't know!" and here Tim's speculations ceased to rumble out of
                  his misshapen mouth, though it is highly probable that he thought the more
                  intently because he closed the vent which had so far given him partial relief.</p>
               <p>Is it as true to-day as it was many a century ago, that the<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000018"/> "weak things of this world" are "chosen to confound
                  the mighty?" And had the little squinting errand-boy, from his loop-hole between
                  the two dry-goods boxes, seen at a glance what had been entirely overlooked by
                  other and straighter eyes? We shall see.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>"GOING away to-morrow. How can we spare you?" and the hand of the speaker moved
                  caressingly over the chestnut hair of her companion, as if there was something
                  gained by touching in as many places as possible the form that would soon be
                  beyond even the reach of sight.</p>
               <p>"Yes, aunt, going away to-morrow," was the reply, with a return of the caress, in
                  the laying of the brown head close up against the sheltering shoulder, and a
                  closer pressure of the other hand that was not busy smoothing the glossy hair. "I
                  am sorry to leave you all, especially you and grandpa; but you know that I can do
                  better in the city, and that I am really tired of this ceaseless labor in the
                  school-room. Why aunt," and there was a quiet smile creeping away from the corners
                  of her mouth as she spoke, "do you know how much I have really made at trying to
                  drum knowledge into those stupid little heads, in a whole twelvemonth?"</p>
               <p>"No, Kate," was the reply of the aunt. "I suppose not much, but enough to——"</p>
               <p>"Buy a pair of Congress gaiters, exactly. You know, aunt, that my strongest point,
                  as a teacher, is arithmetic. I think I have coaxed and pounded more of
                     <emph>that</emph> into the little numskulls, than any thing else. Well, I have
                  been applying it to my own labor and its receipts, and I find that after laboring
                  seven hours a day for a whole year, the amount I have cleared by teaching a
                  country school, over and above what it has cost me for my board, clothes and other
                  necessary expenses, has been exactly two dollars and fifty cents!"</p>
               <p>"Why, child, it can't be possible!" said the aunt, the caressing hand still moving
                  over the brown hair meanwhile. "Is that all you have made? Well, it isn't much, is
                  it! But the board, you know——"</p>
               <p>"The board I could have had for nothing? Yes, I know it, aunt; but what would you
                  have said of my teaching school at all, if I could not even pay my board and was
                  obliged to be dependent upon charity after all!"</p>
               <p>"You were always so sensitive upon that point, Kate," said the aunt, "that——"</p>
               <p>"So sensitive that I was <emph>right;</emph> was I not, aunt?" and the young face
                  for a moment looked up at the elder one bent above it, with so bewitchingly gentle
                  and loveable an expression, that the answer was a kiss, and the words in reply
                  only came murmured through it:</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, Kate, you were always right!" Then after a pause. "But we shall be so
                  lonely without you, when you are away in the great city."</p>
               <p>"And yet I shall not be far from you, aunt," said the young girl. "Not fifty
                  miles; and I can run home and see you any afternoon when I can get away. I shall
                  have only two children to manage, at Mrs. Fullerton's, instead of thirty or forty;
                  and think of my receiving more money for doing that little labor than for teaching
                  that whole noisy school! I <emph>must</emph> go, I <emph>should</emph> go, you
                  know, dear aunt."</p>
               <p>"Of course you must—of course you should," was the reply, "and it is only my
                  selfishness at thinking how lonely I shall be when you are gone, that makes me
                  talk in this way as if I could hold you back by speaking. Go, Kate, fulfil the
                  duty to which you seem to be called, and God bless and keep you." The hand laid on
                  the young girl's head had stopped its caressing movement, now, but it still rested
                  there, and<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7282-00000019"/> beside it lay another, and
                  they were both giving the dear pressure of love and blessing, as the lips
                  syllabled that short and fervent and unstudied prayer.</p>
               <p>"Hark! what was that? It sounded like a hurrah, and yet it could not be, here on
                  Sunday morning."</p>
               <p>The speakers were Mistress Bessy White, widow, and her niece, Kate Haviland, the
                  only daughter of a dead brother. And the place where the conversation occurred was
                  in the doorway and on the porch of a pleasant little farmhouse, in the out-skirts
                  of what may be here designated as Duffsboro, a country village within forty miles
                  of the commercial metropolis, and on the edge of one of the great battle-fields of
                  the Revolution, that is oftenest named from the intimate connection of the Father
                  of his Country with the details of the conflict which took place there on one hot
                  and bloody day of 1777.</p>
               <p>The humble but comfortable-looking little farm-house, only a story and a half in
                  height, with a porch that was covered with roses and vines in the later season,
                  stood half-hidden among the trees that bordered the main road leading into the
                  village, and on the southern slope of a gentle knoll that gave it cool breezes and
                  seemed to elevate it above the dust of the road and the level of the travel that
                  passed along it. An hundred yards past the house, to the west, the road curved,
                  and the houses of the village could be seen glimmering through the trees, in
                  summer, rising on the slope of an opposite and higher hill, with a little village
                  church standing near the summit, and its sharp white spire thrown out clear
                  against the blue sky. The houses of the main village could be seen even more
                  easily than usual, in the soft but clear air of that April morning, for a slight
                  shower had laid the dust late the evening before, and the spring had only brought
                  forward the foliage to that condition of bursting from the bud in green and
                  satin-like sprigs, graphically designated by the country farmers as "the size of a
                  crow's-foot." Not only the church spire but the church itself, and the outlines of
                  most of the houses of the village, could be seen through the trees, looking from
                  the porch of the farm-house. A little later in the morning, and the sound of the
                  bell from that spire would be heard ringing pleasantly across the intervening
                  fields, calling the villagers and the country people to morning service; and half
                  an hour still later, the road and the path that bordered it would be dotted with
                  people in carriages, and people on horseback, and people on foot, all pressing on
                  through the fresh April sunshine, at least to the form of worship of the
                  Benevolence whose smile it seemed to typify.</p>
               <p>Perhaps that April sunshine might have peeped through many a window and glinted
                  through the opening foliage of many a broad tree, before it rested upon a fairer
                  vision than that on the piazza of the little farmhouse—age and youth, both in the
                  perfection of physical beauty and mental goodness.</p>
               <p>Sixty years might have passed over Mrs. Bessy White, widow, and they had of course
                  done their work, but they had done it gently and lovingly as beseemed the good.
                  Her brown eyes had lost something of their light, but no opacity in their
                  circumferences indicated that the sight had been seriously impaired; there were
                  many wrinkles on the once fair face, but they seemed to have crept and nestled
                  there, not been graven there by the sharp touch of passion or the agony of long
                  sorrow; the hair that peeped beneath the front of the widow's cap was heavily
                  grayed, but it was grayed evenly, there were none of the heavy dashes of white in
                  the midst of the dark, denoting intense suffering, mental or physical, and the
                  gray hair was almost a halo round the head; the tall form was bent a little, but a
                  very little, as it showed beneath the carefully pinned kerchief and under the gray
                  morning-dress, but it did not need a keen eye to see that that form had once been
                  almost a sculptor's model, and that it had lost little of its roundness or
                  elasticity as thirty crept on to forty, and forty to fifty, and fifty to the sixth
                  decade. A very pleasant picture, to any eye capable of taking in the beauty of
                  coming age, would have been the motherly woman, even had she held beside her no
                  foil to throw her into contrast without undervaluing her.</p>
               <p>No fitter foil could have been presented, than that shown in bonny Kate Haviland,
                  twenty-two and as fair that day as her aunt had probably been forty long years
                  before, of medium<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7282-00000020"/> height, two inches
                  shorter than the matron beside her, she was not eclipsed and obscured by a
                  morning-wrapper, as she might have been at the same hour in the city; and her
                  neatly-fitting dress of light print showed a plump and well-rounded form, broad
                  though slightly sloping at the shoulders, pliant at the waist, the chest well
                  thrown forward and the figure erect, and a springy little foot occasionally
                  peeping out from beneath the skirts and patting the floor of the piazza, to show
                  that nature, careful of the face and figure, had not disdained care even upon that
                  portion which spurned the ground.</p>
               <p>We have said that nature had been careful of face as well as figure; and yet
                  hundreds of observers might have been found, not willing to concede that Kate
                  Haviland could lay any positive claims to beauty. They would have been
                  out-numbered, however; for only a small proportion of mankind are aware that
                  beauty cannot be found except in features moulded after the Medician Venus or some
                  other pattern of Greek antiquity, and there are quite a large proportion of
                  observers who find it in any combination which pleases them, makes them happier
                  when they behold it, and indicates the possession of true goodness. The head may
                  have been a shade too large for due proportion with the body, especially in the
                  frontal region, and the brow may have been a little too fully rounded for perfect
                  elegance. Then, again, the very dark eyes, almost black, with sweeping dark
                  lashes, may have been a little too close together, and the nose too much depressed
                  at the root, so as to rise a little too obtrusively from the level of the face.
                  But all this was forgotten in the wealth of chestnut brown hair, swept plainly
                  back from the full fore-head and presenting on the back of the head a luxuriance
                  that owed nothing to false braids and painful matching among the stock of the
                  wig-maker—the clear cheek, very fair, but a little browned by the sun and showing
                  a rose fighting with a dimple in the centre—the lips full and with a little pout,
                  slightly petulant, perhaps, but much more merry, loving and mischievous—and the
                  full chin and rounded throat, exhibiting rather determination than weakness of
                  character.</p>
               <p>Such was the picture presented by Kate Haviland, the whilome
                  country-school-mistress who was about to abandon that any thing-but-sinecurical
                  profession for the life of a private school teacher and governess in the city; and
                  Aunt Bessy had certainly full warrant in personal attraction, as she had in the
                  knowledge what a good, and true, and brave and loving heart lay within all this,
                  for the long continued caress with which she seemed to protest against the young
                  girl's leaving her.</p>
               <p>There was another portion of the picture which would have been presented to a
                  spectator who stood on the steps of the portico in front and looked towards the
                  house, but which was not taken in by the knowledge of either of the persons just
                  introduced. The two had stepped out from the door, during their conversation,
                  entirely upon the floor of the piazza, and the instant after they had done so the
                  door had been filled by a third person. This was an old man—very old, to all
                  appearance; his once tall form thin and bent, his hair only a mocking memory of
                  the thick locks that once clustered on his head, and the little remainder white as
                  the driven snow; his poor old face one mass of deep wrinkles crossing each other
                  like the line work on a fine steel-engraving; his eyes opaque and apparently fixed
                  on vacancy; his lower jaw dropping and the toothless mouth exposed, as if from
                  very inability to keep the nerves at sufficient tension to hold it in place; his
                  withered hands so thin that they were little more than claws, one keeping its
                  trembling hold on the top of a stout bone-headed cane and the other an equally
                  trembling grasp on the lintel of the door, the whole frame shaking as if it would
                  soon tremble itself away to the dust of its original elements. Old—very old;
                  standing on the last crumbling verge of possible mortality. And all this had Amos
                  Haviland warrant to be, for he had once fought, though then only a boy, in the
                  closing battles of the Revolution, and had himself seen the proud face of
                  Washington and heard the cheers that went up from the thinned ranks of the patriot
                  army, when Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. He had afterwards fought with Brown
                  on the northern lines, in the battles of 1812-15, and won a commission there which
                  had given him a sword; but he had always regarded that portion of his career as
                  secondary in glory to the other, and while<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7282-00000021"
                  /> the brain had remained clear enough to make his relations intelligible, they
                  had almost always been of what he saw when a boy during the great struggle,
                  instead of what he had done and seen done in the flush of his manhood. Old—very
                  old: death seemed almost to have forgotten him, for ninety and ninety-five had yet
                  escaped the spoiler, and he stood on the verge of that almost impossible age—one
                  hundred! A few months more would see him a centenarian. He talked little, now, and
                  not very intelligibly, though he had still enough brain remaining to understand
                  what was said to him, and still enough left of his decaying vigor to crawl out
                  from his little room on the ground floor, leaning on the arm of his daughter or
                  one of his grandchildren, or tottering along alone on his heavy cane. He had
                  crawled out, now, without either of his relatives being aware of his presence, and
                  stood thus framed in the door behind them, looking out, through his dim eyes and
                  in silence, on them and on the clear April morning.</p>
               <p>"Hark!" again said Kate Haviland, when a moment had passed after her last
                  exclamation. "It <emph>is</emph> a hurrah—I can hear the words distinctly! What
                  can it mean, here on Sunday morning?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know, my dear, I am sure," answered the aunt. "It must be some of the
                  wild fellows from the city, who have no respect for the day, coming here to
                  disturb us."</p>
               <p>Another moment of pause, and then</p>
               <p>"Look!" said the young girl, whose eyes were something keener than those of Aunt
                  Bessy. "See—there are people on the roof of the church yonder, and one is climbing
                  to the top of the steeple!"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, my child, that cannot be," said Aunt Bessy. "They certainly would not
                  permit such work up at the village, on the Sabbath, unless the church was on fire;
                  and I do not suppose they would hurrah about that."</p>
               <p>(The good old lady had probably never been present at a fire in any of the
                  metropolitan cities, or she might have been aware that there is no occasion in all
                  the line of accident or adventure, more likely to provoke noise or bring out any
                  number of shouts of the most enthusiastic description, than a fire! But of that
                  hereafter, possibly.)</p>
               <p>"One of them <emph>is</emph> climbing the steeple," persisted Kate, while the old
                  lady was rubbing her spectacles for a more accurate view. "There, he has reached
                  the top and is busy fastening something there."</p>
               <p>"True as you live!" said Aunt Bessy, when she had polished her spectacles, put
                  them carefully upon her temples and fairly surveyed the strange proceeding. "The
                  church must be on fire, or they would never allow such things on Sunday! But why
                  don't we see the smoke?"</p>
               <p>"No—see, aunt!" cried Kate, with a strange tremor in her voice, and a still
                  stranger trembling at her heart, as she saw the figure that had been at the top of
                  the spire glide down again, then a dark mass of something soft and loose-looking
                  go up as if it ran upon a rope, and the moment after a flag floated out on the
                  westerly breeze from the very top of the steeple. "See, aunt, it is the American
                  flag!"</p>
               <p>"I declare it is!" exclaimed the old lady. "Well, I believe I love that flag well
                  enough to see it anywhere else, but of all the pranks I ever saw in my life, that
                  is the oddest to climb the church steeple and hang it there on a Sunday
                  morning!"</p>
               <p>"Aunt!" said the young girl, a sudden thought striking her, and the recollection
                  of the troubled news from the South coming into her mind, though they at the
                  little farm-house had heard nothing since some days before, when Anderson was
                  known to be leaguered in Sumter, and the government was talking of trying to
                  reinforce him—"Aunt, it is no freak! Something has happened! that flag does not go
                  up for nothing! Who knows? Perhaps Major Anderson has taken Charleston, or burned
                  it down! I hope he <emph>has,</emph> and then they may raise flags anywhere they
                  please on Sunday morning—on the top of the pulpit, if they like!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, Kate, you are crazy!" said Aunt Bessy. "You are a good girl, but you must
                  not think of putting flags in the pulpit. They don't belong on churches, my
                  dear!"</p>
               <p>"Anywhere—everywhere!" cried the young girl. "After the Cross, the flag of one's
                  native land is the holiest thing in the world. I would not have it put
                     <emph>over</emph> the Cross, but any where beneath it, or even beside it. As
                  there does not happen<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7282-00000022"/> pen to be a cross
                  on the top of our steeple, I think they cannot get the flag too high, if there is
                  any news from the South that demands it."</p>
               <p>The young girl did not know it; but that day and that hour, the morning of Sunday
                  the fourteenth of April, 1861, was proving that others besides herself believed in
                  setting the flag beside the Cross, or immediately beneath it. She saw one flag go
                  up; it was the type of ten thousand floating up at the same hour. She heard a
                  faint hurrah, from a few voices: the sound was but the echo of a shout that was
                  jarring the very heavens, as it went up from a thousand miles square of loyal
                  American territory. She saw, though faintly and afar off, what she and others may
                  remember with pride to the last day of their lives, whatever may be the after fate
                  of the nation—<emph>the apotheosis of the American Flag.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It will long remain a question, perhaps, whether that moment was not the most
                  glorious in all American history. Nor has the history of any land its parallel, in
                  the sudden springing into life and vigor of a feeling that had slept and seemed to
                  be dead or dying. The flag had been the emblem dishonored—it was now the emblem
                  worshipped. A week before, it had hung as a limp rag from the flagstaff, scarcely
                  noticed—apparently powerless—degraded for the first time in its long record. It
                  had seemed, during the days and weeks through which the authorities at Washington
                  had paltered and wavered, as if any reprobate might have torn down that flag, spat
                  upon and trampled upon it, subjected it to any shame and degradation, without any
                  man born under it having nerve and hope enough to strike the traitor to the earth.
                  A few hours—a few days—and what had been the change, in country and in city! No
                  longer, then, a weak and inanimate thing, drooping from flagstaffs scarcely able
                  to support it, and moved by no breeze that had power to shake out its folds,—it
                  blew out, that Sabbath morning, free and clear to the heavens whose morning flush,
                  and blue of noon, and midnight glory of azure and starlight, were in its stripes
                  and stars—blew out on the winds of the free and unconquered North, the breeze that
                  fluttered it added to and strengthened by the voices of twenty millions of people,
                  who had never before known that flag to be dishonored, and who had resolved to
                  give up their lives before they would permit dishonor to be entailed upon it. Let
                  some rash hand have been <emph>then</emph> laid in violence upon the bunting which
                  had before seemed of so little consequence to the men of America—let some rash
                  hand but have been laid upon it <emph>then,</emph> where the eyes of men, or
                  women, or even of children, in the loyal States, could see the outrage, and the
                  life of the owner of that hand would not have been worth a pin's purchase. He had
                  better, at that moment, been in the midst of that howling pack who in the ultra
                  South were bearing the flag to mocking and dishonored burial—he had better been
                  there and dared be true to his country, than in any portion of the loyal States
                  and fallen under the anger of those who dared not be false to it!</p>
               <p>Should the American Union have crumbled away to ruin the very day after, and the
                  old flag under which it had won its three quarters of a century of triumphs been
                  pulled down and laid reverently away forever, in curious museums and the old
                  arsenals where they gather the warlike relics of the past—could this impossible
                  thing have occurred—never saw any flag on earth so bright a close to its destiny
                  as that which would then have been recorded of the Flag of the Union. One moment
                  eclipsed, it had burst at once into a glory and a sacredness unmatched by any
                  banner ever borne since that behind which the crusading hosts marched out to
                  Palestine. Not one man, but the collective strength of all the loyal States, had
                  hugged it anew to the heart. Not one had gazed upon it with a new devotion, but
                  every eye that could see the blue sky and the spring sunlight. Not from one
                  building in a hundred had it waved, as in ordinary times, but from every
                  flagstaff, and front, and roof, and awning-post, where it was possible to display
                  the emblem of the national pride. Not from one mast or gaff at our docks, had it
                  floated, but from the spars of every craft that bore one yard of bunting, from the
                  proudest ship to the humblest fishing-boat. Not alone had it waved in flaunting
                  silk and enduring worsted—in great flags that might have headed an army,—but in
                  every size of flag and description of material, from the standard large enough to
                  wrap a dozen dead gloriously in its folds, to the<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000023"/> penny toy-flag of the boy. It had been seen on the
                  stage-top, on the harness and bridle of the cartman's horse, on the lappel of the
                  gentleman's coat, on the point of the lady's parasol. From hotel, and store, and
                  private house, it had waved; and raised to the top of Bunker Hill Monument of the
                  Puritan, it had been answered by the flap of its mate from the spire of Old
                  Trinity of the Churchman, and even that answered back by the flutter of still
                  another mate from the dome of the Cathedral of the Catholic. Had ever flag been so
                  honored? Had ever devotion to a flag told so pregnant a story, of what it costs to
                  be a great nation, and what it must cost to plunge one into disruption and
                  destruction? And would not the Flag, could it have disappeared forever from
                  national view the very day after that apotheosis, have ended is career more
                  gloriously than any formed by the hand of man since the creation?</p>
               <p>But all this, which is to-day a matter of history and of historical speculation,
                  was unknown and unthought of by Kate Haviland, in whose heart was merely bubbling
                  up that feeling of true though blind patriotism which has seemed to be the
                  characteristic of woman in all countries and in all ages,—as she saw the emblem of
                  her country's pride flung from the spire of the little village church at so
                  unseasonable a time as to indicate that some event of importance must have
                  occurred.</p>
               <p>Her words of devotion to the flag, which have been so long interrupted by this
                  digression, had indeed scarcely left her lips when her attention was attracted by
                  a horseman riding rapidly down the road from the eastward, and about to pass the
                  house toward the village. She recognized him at the same moment as Ben Davidson, a
                  stripling brother of one of her girl scholars; and as the young man happened to
                  have his head turned toward the house, the recognition was mutual. He drew rein as
                  he came close to the gate, threw his hand over his shoulder toward the church, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Do you see the red, white and blue there? They have got it out, away at the top
                  of the steeple!"</p>
               <p>"Yes" said the young girl, "I see it. But what does it mean? Has any thing
                  happened? Have you any news from the South?"</p>
               <p>"Why, haven't you heard?" asked Davidson, speaking in a loud voice, but evidently
                  in too much of a hurry to think of alighting. "The secessioners attacked Sumter on
                  Friday; it is burning and must be surrendered to-morrow. We got the news last
                  night, up in the city. Winter and Drexel came down this morning, and they are
                  having a terrible time there. Everybody going crazy, and they're about as crazy up
                  yonder at the village. Flags going up everywhere, I guess."</p>
               <p>"Were Major Anderson and all his men killed?" asked Aunt Bessy, in a voice
                  agitated enough to have belonged to a much younger woman.</p>
               <p>"Nary a one of them," said Davidson. "They have promised to surrender the fort and
                  come away. But that don't make any difference. There is going to be a war,
                     <emph>sure.</emph> They have got some of the city papers down at the village,
                  and they say there will be a call made in a day or two—perhaps to-morrow—for
                  troops to put down the rebels. What do you think of that? That's what the flag
                  means, upon the top of the steeple yonder. But I mustn't stay any longer. Good
                  mornin', ladies. G'lang, Bob!" and away gallopped Mr. Ben Davidson, to do his late
                  share among the flag-raisers and other national demonstrators up at Duffsboro.</p>
               <p>Neither the aunt, the niece, nor the young stripling who gave them this
                  intelligence, had seen the old man standing in the door. Had they done so, they
                  would have seen that he put one trembling hand up behind his ear, to catch the
                  words of the horseman more plainly, then that he seemed to shake and shiver even
                  more than his habit, and that he turned and tottered away from the door just as
                  Davidson gallopped off.</p>
               <p>"Good heaven!" exclaimed the young girl. "They have fired on the flag and burned
                  Sumter. And there is to be a war. Oh, how I wish I was a man!"</p>
               <p>"I am very glad you are not, my dear," said the old lady, and the look of love
                  with which she regarded the young girl showed that she really was grateful for the
                  impediment of sex which would keep that fair young head from danger when<pb
                     n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7282-00000024"/> war should break upon the land. "There
                  will be enough men without <emph>you,</emph> and God is over us all!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, aunt, God is over us all," answered the young girl. "But he does nothing for
                  us without human hands, and he allows some of us to work confoundedly hard for the
                  bread we eat and the clothes we wear. Calling for soldiers all over the country.
                  And only think how many thousands they may need! And then if they should not come!
                  But they <emph>will</emph> come, aunt, if there is one spark of the spirit of the
                  old times left among us—and I hope there is!"</p>
               <p>"I hope so," said the aunt. "But come—this will be your last day at church, and I
                  suppose they will <emph>hold</emph> church today, even if there is a flag flying
                  from the top of the steeple."</p>
               <p>"Yes, aunt, it is nearly time, now!" and the two turned away from the piazza, to
                  go in. But they were not to go to church that day, though perchance to enter a
                  place equally sacred.</p>
               <p>As they entered the door from the portico, there was a loud, ringing crash heard
                  in some portion of the back part of the house, a clank as of metal, ending with
                  what seemed to be a heavy thump on the floor. Both aunt and niece started, though
                  without the least idea from what the sound could have proceeded.</p>
               <p>"Something must have fallen in the kitchen, I think," said the aunt, after a
                  moment's pause, and she passed through the hall, directly back, to see whether
                  some marauding dog or cat had not disturbed the equilibrium of a pot or a kettle,
                  and sent it crashing down to the floor in that manner. Kate had a fancy that the
                  sound came from the story above, and passed through the door to the right and up
                  the stairway to ascertain. Neither discovered any thing out of due order, and the
                  moment after they again met in the hall.</p>
               <p>"Something has tumbled down <emph>somewhere,</emph>" said the young girl,
                  oracularly. "Things don't make such noises as that when they are lying still and
                  behaving themselves." Suddenly the light went out from her face, and an expression
                  of intense anxiety took its place. "Aunt, maybe it was in grandpa's room! Only
                  think—suppose he has——."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you dear child, don't frighten me to death!" exclaimed Aunt Bessy. "If he has
                  fallen so as to make that noise, he must be dead as a stone by this time!" So he
                  would have been, for she quite forgot that the poor old man had not weight enough
                  remaining to produce such a crash, had he fallen through the entire house, from
                  garret to cellar! "Dear me, Kate! come with me; I am so frightened!" and together,
                  aunt and niece, both trembling with apprehension, opened another door to the left,
                  passed through the half-darkened "best room," or parlor, and opened another door
                  which led into the little room of old Amos Haviland. There and then a sight was
                  presented which fully explained the sound they had heard, and which neither of
                  them will ever forget, to their dying day.</p>
               <p>The poor old man (as <emph>we</emph> know, though his relatives did not) had heard
                  Ben Davidson telling of the attack upon Sumter and the flag. How much his dimmed
                  sense had caught of the truth involved in the attack, of the plans and purposes of
                  the rebels, and of the President's call for troops, can never be known until the
                  secrets of all hearts shall be revealed; but that he had caught something of the
                  peril of the nation, and of the need of soldiers, was evident; and it was the most
                  touching thing in nature, to see how the old fire lived yet—the merest slumbering
                  spark, but pure and steadfast, in the very dying ashes of his mortal frame.</p>
               <p>Over the little looking-glass in his room, for many a long year, had hung the
                  sword used by him in the war of 1812—a heavy old sabre, brass-hilted, and in an
                  iron scabbard. The old man had wished to have it hung in that place, on the
                  opposite side of his little room from the bed, so that he could look upon it and
                  recall the past, even when too weak and ill to remove from his pallet. And there
                  it had remained—not even taken down when the careful housekeepers dusted the room;
                  and it is probable that the old man's hand had not rested upon it for a quarter of
                  a century, however often his dimmed eyes may have taken in that parallel to the
                  reminder of the weak and broken Richelieu, of the time when he "at Rochelle did
                  cleave the stalwart Englisher."</p>
               <p>Coming in from the door, after hearing the news brought<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000025"/> by the horseman, the centenarian had evidently
                  first paid a visit to the kitchen (the next room), and possessed himself of the
                  large file used for sharpening knives at the table. Then he had crawled back to
                  his own room, managed to mount a chair, and tried to take down his old sword. The
                  chair had given way beneath him, or his weak limbs had refused their office, for
                  he had fallen to the floor, and the chair lay overturned at a little distance from
                  him. At the same time the sword, loosened from its nail, had come clattering down,
                  striking the little table under the glass and then the floor, making the loud
                  noise they had heard upon the piazza, and flying out of the scabbard, as his weak
                  hand could never have extricated it from the rust in which it was imbedded. The
                  poor old man had been so badly hurt by the fall, as to be unable to rise (he would
                  never rise again, it seemed probable, till the day of the last resurrection); but
                  he had managed to grasp the hilt of the sword, and to retain the file; and at the
                  moment when Aunt Bessy and Kate entered the room, in a cramped sitting position,
                  and evidently in such suffering that he uttered a low moan at intervals, he was
                  trying to draw the file over the dulled and rusted edge of the weapon, sharpening
                  it for use!<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>"Grandpa! dear grandpa!" spoke Kate, kneeling down beside him, while Aunt Bessy
                  seemed so much alarmed that she could scarcely keep her feet and could not utter a
                  word. "Grandpa! dear grandpa! are you hurt?" But the old man did not heed
                  her—perhaps he did not even hear her. His eyes, less opaque-looking and more
                  life-like than they had been for years, still seemed to be staring at vacancy; he
                  was still trying to draw the file across the rusted edge of the old sword; and as
                  Kate knelt beside him, she could catch his broken words—very low and fitful, and
                  intermingled with moans, but yet intelligible to her watchful ears:</p>
               <p>"Sharpen it—sharpen it—rebels—fight—soldiers—sharpen
                  it—rebels—fight—soldiers."</p>
               <p>Who shall say that this was not the Spirit of 'Seventy-Six bequeathing its
                  blessing and its injunction to the men of 'Sixty-One—sharpening the national sword
                  destined to execute judgment upon the foes of the land and the enemies of the
                  human race?</p>
               <p>With the help of one of the farm-hands called in for that purpose, Aunt Bessy and
                  Kate carefully and tenderly removed the old man to his bed and disposed his
                  tortured limbs there in comparative comfort. Aunt Bessy was about to hang up the
                  sword again, but Kate interpreted aright the look of his eye and the clutch of his
                  hand, and laid it on the bed beside him. There the weak right hand grasped it and
                  never released its hold until it let go of life. His eyes closed after a time, and
                  the moan ceased. He was dropping away to his last sleep—the excitement of the
                  moment and the shock of the fall had been too much for the frame worn and
                  enfeebled by nearly a hundred years. He seemed to know but one thing—the news of
                  the morning; for the only utterance they caught was an occasional repetition—very
                  low and broken—of the words he had been uttering when they entered the room:</p>
               <p>"Sharpen it—sharpen it—rebels—fight—soldiers!"</p>
               <p>When the two grieving relatives, kneeling by his bed-side—grieving, and yet with
                  no bitter tear to shed over so appropriate a close to a life so much prolonged
                  beyond the common lot of mortality,—when they and the half-dozen of neighbors who
                  had gathered into the death-chamber at their call, heard the words no more and saw
                  that the right hand had released its weak clutch upon the sword, they saw, too,
                  that the old soldier had departed on that long march some time ordered for all of
                  us by the Great Captain.</p>
               <p>When Kate Haviland, after the death, went out again to the piazza, it was
                  afternoon, the stars and stripes were yet waving from the top of the spire of the
                  little church at Duffsboro, and she caught the rattle of the drum of the little
                  militia company, somewhat prematurely called together,—from the village. "There
                  are no Sabbaths in war," says some writer who must have passed through a national
                  struggle something like our own; and the centenarian soldier, without his dulled
                  senses knowing the fact, had died with the old flag flapping above him, and the
                  fife and drum—most martial of all martial music—sounding as if for his
                  departure.</p>

                     HOLT AS A SON-IN-LAW.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A HANDSOME house on East Twenty-third Street not far from Madison Avenue. A very
                  handsome house, brownstone with high stoop of the same material, very wide front,
                  the window-caps sculptured into fruits, grape-clusters and vine-leaves, and over
                  the door a heavy mass of fruit and floral sculpture, enclosing an oval shield,
                  with—alas for American aristocracy!—never a single quartering of arms to place
                  upon it. The basement windows heavily barred, perhaps to prevent the servant girls
                  looking out at the grass-plats in the front yard. The railings of the front yard
                  very heavy and massive. The door-way from the landing, very deep and heavy, in
                  dark oak, with lace curtains showing through the glass panellings of the inner
                  doors. At the windows on the drawing-room floor heavy lace curtains, and outside
                  of them at each window one red and one yellow side curtain of rich satin heavily
                  fringed and tasselled, evidently for the placing of sallow faces, or their
                  opposites, in proper lights for display. Within, a wide hall, guiltless of
                  oil-cloth or carpeting on the stair, and hall floor and stair-steps in polished
                  oak. A Flora, in marble or plaster (the casual observer could not say which) in a
                  niche at the first turn of the stairs. Still further within the penetralia, a
                  double parlor or drawing-room on the first floor, with arch between, the carpets
                  of velvet tapestry, the walls painted in the faintest blush rose color, and the
                  heavy foliated cornice matched by a massive floral centre-piece supporting a large
                  chandelier of glass over bronze; with a dozen burners and a perfect cloud of
                  dripping and tingling reflectors. The furniture in dark wood and hair, with an
                  oval piano standing behind the arch, and a harp near it. On a marble centre-table,
                  in front, a sweet little bust of Mozart, under a glass shade, and half a dozen
                  picture albums and books scattered around it. On the walls some ten or a dozen
                  pictures, all landscapes in oil, and all (as close observation would show)
                  compositions of European scenery or transcripts of Floridian swamps or Carolina
                  coasts.</p>
               <p>On the floor above, in front, a large parlor; the walls in the same color, the
                  furniture corresponding with that below, but more massive; a heavy bronze
                  chandelier, with shades of porcelain; an upright piano beside the door opening
                  from the hall; heavy rose worsted and white lace curtains at the very deep
                  windows—each really forming an alcove; a centre-table with a few books; a
                  card-table, with a chess-board lying upon it; the few pictures on the walls,
                  engravings, mostly portraits, and these, again, of Southern statesmen or soldiers.
                  This room evidently affected by the family and by those visitors who had enough of
                  intimacy to be received for pleasure and not for the mere show of acquaintance.
                  The whole house rather a success than otherwise, in point of style, and needing
                  either wealth to support it, or excellent credit. Mrs. Fullerton, the lady whose
                  name figured on the cards sent out from it, considered it as decidedly the most
                  stylish house in town, asking nothing from Townsend or John Anderson; and all her
                  visitors, who wished to be received a second time on as good footing as that
                  achieved at first, took especial pains to make the elegance of the appointments
                     (<emph>as well</emph> as the beauty and grace of the hostess and her family)
                  matters of no infrequent mention.</p>
               <p>Three persons occupied the parlor on the second floor, at a certain hour on Sunday
                  evening the Fourteenth of April. The first (by seniority as well as by virtue of
                  her proud position) was Mrs. Olympia Fullerton, widow of Randolph Fullerton,
                  purser in the United States Navy, now some years deceased. She was understood to
                  have been born, some five and forty years before, near Columbia, South Carolina,
                  the wealthy daughter of the still wealthier Judge Brixtone, of<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000027"/> that locality; while her husband, dating back a few
                  years earlier than herself in age, had sprung into existence not far from
                  Carrolton, Maryland. She had been educated (so it was said) at one of the female
                  academies of Virginia, and had consequently escaped any infection of Northern
                  heresy, to which so many Southern young ladies, a few years ago, were so
                  dangerously exposed while pursuing their studies in the private academies of New
                  York and New England. Mr. Fullerton, never resident in the North until long after
                  his marriage, had consequently escaped any Northern infection, in like manner; and
                  it might have been said, with truth, during the life-time of the worthy purser,
                  that a more decided and thorough-going couple, as to Southern sentiment, could not
                  very well be found within the limits of the free States. Their four children were
                  not much more likely to suffer from any Puritan taint, than the parents,
                  especially as they were zealously guarded against evil influences; and when Mr.
                  Randolph Fullerton, purser in the United States Navy, one evening undertook to go
                  on board the United States brig Guineahen, then lying at Port Mahon, in the
                  Mediterranean, with more bottles of wine under his uniform than exactly conformed
                  to the navy regulations, and fell overboard from the boat and was drowned,—his
                  widow, even in the midst of her grief, did not forget the obligations due to
                  herself as a Southern lady, and had always since kept up that broad line of
                  demarcation which should exist between those who are sound on the Southern
                  institution and those who have any disposition to waver. The money upon which the
                  style of the house on Twenty-third street (not at all diminished since the death
                  of her husband) had been kept up, was supposed to be derived from her paternal
                  estates near Columbia; and we are not at all prepared, at this stage of the
                  narration, to say that the popular belief on this point erred in any
                  particular.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fullerton, occupying a cushioned rocking-chair near the window, and rocking
                  backwards and forwards in what we may before have designated as a peculiarly
                  American fashion, was a decidedly pretty woman, in spite of advancing years, and
                  under the gaslight might well have been taken to be ten years younger. She had
                  never forgotten the art of so disposing herself, on chair or sofa, as to throw out
                  the best points of her tall and well-formed figure to the best advantage; her dark
                  evening-dress, with only one heavy gold chain around her neck, and descending to
                  her watch and waist-belt,—only this too much in the way of jewelry, well threw out
                  a complexion that might have been a shade too dark, if falsely relieved by bad
                  dressing; her very dark eyes seemed to have lost nothing of their youthful light;
                  and there did not seem to be one thread of silver in the dark hair, with its
                  slight wave, drawn back from her proud forehead, and tastefully disposed above the
                  small ears and under a head-dress which seemed to be a marvelous combination of
                  her own hair, velvet, and alternate beads of pearl and jet. She had a proud lip—no
                  one could deny it—a little full and pouting, but wonderfully well-shaped; her nose
                  was almost classical in the fineness of its outline; and the whole result was, as
                  we have before indicated, that she looked much younger than her actual age, and a
                  decidedly pretty woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Place aux dames</foreign>—all of them—here as well as
                  elsewhere; and the next sketch of the group must be that of Miss Eudora Fullerton,
                  usually denominated Dora, the eldest unmarried daughter of the hostess. It needed
                  almost a second look on the part of the person first introduced to the two—to
                  believe that they could be mother and daughter; so different seemed to be the
                  style of their faces in almost every particular. And yet, strangely enough, after
                  that second look, no one could doubt the relationship, even if previous
                  information left the matter an open question. There was an indescribable
                  something, no one could say precisely what, common to both, which only needed
                  observation to develope itself. Was it in the eyes?—yes, perhaps so; for Dora
                  Fullerton, though she had inherited her father's light-brown hair, and was really
                  a blonde in that particular, had taken her mother's dark eyes—eyes dark enough to
                  be counted as black, at a little distance; and the combination of dark eyes and
                  fair hair, was that singularly effective one, so much prized in some of the
                  Southern countries of Europe, and sometimes seen, here, when Mrs. Thalia Wood
                  takes a fancy to put away her own<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7282-00000028"/> dark
                  hair and appear in the characteristic wig of the "Fair One with the Golden
                  Locks."</p>
               <p>As to the other features of her face—the young lady had a singularly bold and
                  prominent forehead, a little too high and a little too full, the intellectual
                  evidently predominating over the feeling and passional (which some of us do
                     <emph>not</emph> hold to be "an excellent thing in woman"); the nose was sharp
                  cut, clear, handsome and decided, without a fault in its outline, but perhaps a
                  shade too high from the face at the base; the cheeks were handsomely moulded, and
                  with a suspicion of a dimple at times in each, but too thin for perfection; and
                  the complexion was that blending between brown and fair, which seems to combine
                  the charms of both and leave nothing to be desired. The bust was very full and
                  mature, for her age (less than eighteen) and for the supple slightness of arm and
                  shoulder; and it was evident that when standing she would be taller than the
                  middle height, and a most proud and queenly (not to say defiant-looking) figure.
                  Nothing has as yet been said of the lower features of the face, because here
                  admiration ceases, and the gazer, half spell-bound in admiration, shakes off the
                  influence and becomes unpleasantly free again. All the lower portion of Dora
                  Fullerton's face was too thin and insignificant for the upper. The cheeks fell in
                  too fast, and actually hollowed below the level of the nose; the mouth was too
                  small, the lips too thin, proud, and hard, with indications in a droop at the
                  corners, that they might easily be sullen and petulant; and the chin was small,
                  sharp and weak—the very worst index of character presented in the whole catalogue.
                  A pretty girl, certainly, and a stately figure in parlor or ball-room, and yet one
                  at whom the close observer might be disposed to look more than twice before
                  putting the happiness of a life-time into her keeping. It should have been said,
                  before this time, that the young lady wore a light stuff evening-dress, with
                  ear-rings and a fair display of jewelry, the picture being thus concluded.</p>
               <p>And even this long description must be followed by another—that of the third
                  person of the group on that Sunday evening. And here the apology of the old French
                  royalist again comes into play; for as he could only have his head cut off, and
                  make the bother appertaining to that operation, once,—let it be remembered that
                  these people will never need a second photographing. Beside Miss Dora, who was
                  lounging on the sofa under the full light of two or three of the burners of the
                  chandelier—sat a gentleman on that occasion. A man of perhaps twenty-five years of
                  age, tall and rather slight in figure, dressed in dark clothes in the very extreme
                  of the mode, with a head of very light brown curling hair, side-whiskers long and
                  pendant after the Dundreary pattern, blue eyes, well-cut features, except a slight
                  snub in the nose, and a face that might have been good-looking enough, and even
                  handsome, if relieved of an expression of lazy, smiling inanity, very nearly
                  approaching to idiocy in appearance. His collar was garotte to an extreme, though
                  that fashion was only then being introduced; the diamond ring on his right little
                  finger would have furnished the stock in trade for a jeweller of moderate capital;
                  the cornelian seal ring on his left was nearly large enough for stamping an
                  official document, and must have made sad havoc with his innumerable pairs of
                  gloves from Bajeux and Courvoisier; and his patent-leather boots, which he
                  generally extended at full length when sitting, could only be matched in the
                  magnificence of their polish by his extensive and immaculate wristbands, that only
                  needed to be ruffled to excite the envy of the departed spirit of some beau of the
                  time of Charles the Second, or roué of the Regency of the Duke of Orleans.</p>
               <p>This person was known as Edward Minthorne, Esq., the name being taken from the
                  innumerable invitations to balls, parties, suppers, conversaziones, opera-parties,
                  etc., which continually reached him in the season; or from the covers of the
                  perfumed billets, boxes, hampers, and other packages, which at short intervals
                  came to him while lounging away the warm season at Newport or Saratoga. There were
                  some persons who called him Ned Minthorne; but they were people of quality and
                  condition, and could do bold things; for Mr. Minthorne was known to be the last
                  heir and representative of one of the richest patroon families of New York City,
                  worth a million in his own right, with nobody able to say how many more millions
                  might come to him at the death of<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7282-00000029"/> various
                  relatives who must drop off out of his way in due season. He was a fool, of
                  course—had never been known to utter ten words that could be construed into strong
                  common sense—had never done any thing, except eat, drink, ride, smoke and
                  dawdle—and appeared to be about as capable of taking care of himself, if placed in
                  circumstances of want or difficulty, as a kitten of ten days old. But then, what
                  occasion had he to take care of himself? Was he not rich enough for ten men? And
                  what vicissitude could possibly fall upon his landed property up the river or his
                  houses and stores in the city, leaving <emph>him</emph> to the mercy of the world?
                  None whatever; and the good people of the set in which he moved, especially the
                  marriageable young ladies and the prudent mammas and guardians who managed them,
                  petted and idolized him as if he had been a young demi-god.</p>
               <p>All but one, that is to say; and the exception was just then very near him. For
                  more than a year before the period of this story he had been a frequent visitor at
                  the house of Mrs. Fullerton; and for more than six months all the other
                  marriageable ladies had virtually given him up as beyond their reach, he being
                  understood to be under a tacit if not an explicit engagement to marry Miss Dora
                  Fullerton. <emph>She</emph> did not treat him with studied respect—not even with
                  common civility, at times. Was he not "hooked," to use a vulgar, but very
                  expressive word? Could she not hold him, no matter what was her line of conduct?
                  She rather <emph>thought</emph> she could! She had brains—he had none: what hope
                  could there be for a man placed at that disadvantage, crawling out from under the
                  moral thumb of a pretty and attractive woman, no matter whether she treated him
                  with marked respect or the very opposite? Not that she dreamed of openly insulting
                  him—of course not. That would have been ruin to her hopes; for even fools
                  sometimes know when they are kicked, though they may be oblivious when a large pin
                  is thrust into them. And all her "hopes" lay in the wealth of Minthorne, once in
                  possession of which she would ride over the world at her leisure. She had been
                  taught by her mother—and in fact needed little teaching to that end,—that it was
                  not a matter of the slightest consequence whether she loved or even respected the
                  man whom she expected to marry; that every man and every thing born or made north
                  of Mason and Dixon's line was of course wretched, plebeian and contemptible; but
                  that, with a sufficient quantity of gilding, even one of these poor wretches could
                  be matrimonially swallowed. She had determined to swallow Minthorne, as the
                  richest morsel (pecuniarily) that had yet come within her grasp, or could be
                  likely to do so, unless she went to Europe (a step, for certain reasons, not
                  practicable) or unless one of the favorite aspirations of certain people on this
                  continent should be carried out, and an order of nobility created for her to pick,
                  at her own sweet will, among the dukes, marquises and earls thus scattered over
                  the land. She had determined to swallow him, but not gingerly, or with any
                  indication that <emph>she</emph> was the obliged party in the engagement. On the
                  contrary he must be made to know and feel his place continually—to come at her
                  will and go when she pleased; and to do the young lady justice, there really was
                  every appearance that she had made an accurate calculation. Ned Minthorne made no
                  "scenes" and no harsh remarks whatever, when he came to fulfil an engagement to
                  drive her out, and found her just stepping into the carriage of one of his rivals.
                  He never sulked, when he came in to spend an evening and found his inamorata
                  enjoying a fit of sullenness which she called "headache," and paying him no more
                  attention than she might have done to a dog whose place was at her feet. He never
                  presumed to argue with her at any length or with the least ill-feeling, when her
                  ultra-southern sentiments came out in their full strength and she took the notion
                  into her head to denounce every Northern man, without a single exception, as a
                  poor, white-livered, thin-blooded milksop, not fit for the wiping of the shoes of
                  a real Southern lady. While the secession had been going on, he had borne with all
                  this and as much more as she chose to heap upon the North, including, of course,
                  her declarations that the Southern rebels were patriots, the Northern loyalists
                  all brutes and would-be tyrants, and the idea of ever getting back the seceded
                  States into the Union, something to be laughed at, loathed and spat upon.</p>
               <p>At the moment when our observation falls upon them, Miss<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000030"/> Dora had just subjected her devoted slave to one of
                  those tasks which seem to have been devised by the malignant fates for the special
                  torment of impatient mortality. She had set him, with a very stylish but signally
                  inconvenient paper-folder, to cutting the leaves of a book of several hundred
                  pages, and insisted upon having them all cut before she deigned to look at one of
                  them, while she would certainly look at not more than two or three before she
                  would throw it down in disgust. (Let us put in another parenthesis here, to say
                  that the man who first practised the enormity of sending out a bound book with the
                  leaves uncut, should have been compelled to cut book-leaves with a lead-pencil or
                  a pair of scissors, during the whole remainder of his existence, in which case he
                  would perhaps have suffered a punishment somewhat commensurate with the injury he
                  has inflicted upon humanity.) The leaves of this particular book were thin and
                  limp. Ned Minthorne's fingers were not the nimblest in the world, and he was
                  making a decidedly slow job of it, while the beauty sat idle upon the sofa, and
                  pouted and "poohed" and patted her foot upon the carpet in the most violent
                  dissatisfaction at his slow proceedings. At last she broke out:</p>
               <p>"Well, slow-motion, how much longer are you going to be before you allow me to
                  read a word?"</p>
               <p>"Really, Miss Fullerton, I can't say—that is—yes I can, in a minute." And the
                  millionaire, while the young lady was so stupefied with anger that she could only
                  stare at him in surprise, actually laid down his folder, counted the number of
                  leaves he had cut, and the number yet remaining to be experimented upon, drew out
                  his watch and made a calculation in the rule of three, that if he had been so many
                  minutes cutting a certain number (about one-sixth), he would be able to complete
                  the task in about such a period.</p>
               <p>"You are a fool!" exclaimed the young lady at this juncture; and the unfortunate
                  book, which had been temporarily laid upon her lap, found itself flying across the
                  room with singular rapidity, and going plump into the bosom of a very <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">decolleté</foreign> lady represented in an engraving on the
                  opposite wall.</p>
               <p>"Really, Dora——" was all the expostulation the young man was able to utter, for
                  the divinity cut him short with:—</p>
               <p>"Don't talk to <emph>me!</emph> You are the most provoking man in the world, and
                  you are never satisfied half so well as when you can put me out of temper and get
                  me to make a fool of myself!" It is just possible that the spectre of a lost
                  million or more had loomed up the instant after she committed the unladylike
                  action, and that she felt the necessity of calling herself a fool in order to
                  balance the account of having designated him in the same manner the moment
                  before.</p>
               <p>But she need not have given herself any trouble on that account, for the stupid
                  placidity of Mr. Minthorne's temper did not seem to be in the least disturbed. He
                  merely looked at the Southern girl as she bounced up from the sofa and then sat
                  down again, and remarked, in the most matter-of-fact manner possible:—</p>
               <p>"Well—ah—yes, I believe that I <emph>do</emph> like to see you a little out of
                  temper, Miss Fullerton, better than when you are in a good humor, because then you
                  are so demned piquant and pretty, you know!"</p>
               <p>"Do you really think me pretty?" asked the young lady, her face all smiles again
                  in a moment, and her narrow mind (so sadly belying that full forehead) always
                  caught by compliments to her personal attractions. She was so gracious, now, that
                  her hand managed to drop upon if not into that of Minthorne; and Mrs. Fullerton,
                  who had heard and seen all the preceding from her place in the easy chair, and
                  thought for the moment that her dear Dora might be playing the game of temper and
                  superiority a little too far,—felt completely reassured and dropped back to her
                  rocking with a sweet motherly confidence that her darling was doing honor to her
                  training and managing her future husband with much address.</p>
               <p>But calms are sometimes short and treacherous, especially in the tropics, and the
                  worst of squalls follow them, habitually. Mr. Ned Minthorne, putting his hand into
                  the skirt-pocket of his coat to extricate his handkerchief and fill a little heavy
                  time by dabbing its perfumery to his nose, accidentally drew out a newspaper,
                  which fell upon the carpet. He reached<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7282-00000031"/>
                  down to pick it up and return it to its position, but Miss Dora took it (not to
                  say jerked it) from his hand, opened it, and the sensation headings of one of the
                  daily Sunday papers stood revealed, prominent among them the "Dastardly Outrage on
                  the American Flag!" "No Terms to be Hereafter Kept with the Rebels!" etc., a
                  statement that the Cabinet were in session at Washington and that a large body of
                  volunteers would be called out to put down the rebellion, flanking the account of
                  the Sumter outrage in another column. Instantly the face of the young lady fired
                  up, her black eyes darted cruel lightnings, her whole frame seemed to be quivering
                  with indignation, and she broke out, dashing down her hand upon the paper:—</p>
               <p>"You dare, sir, to bring such a paper as that into this house!"</p>
               <p>For just one instant there was a curious expression on the face of Ned Minthorne.
                  A person who had seen it and who did not know what an absolute ninny the young man
                  was, would have believed it to be keen, searching and self-confident. Of course
                  any person who had seen it and who <emph>did</emph> know him, could only have
                  supposed that he had been mistaken. At all events, if there had been any thing
                  more than usual, it was gone in an instant, and the face was just as placidly
                  stupid as ever. He merely replied in a tone of very great surprise:—</p>
               <p>"Why—that paper? That is only the ——!"</p>
               <p>"Only the ——!" almost yelled the young lady, tearing the paper to atoms meanwhile
                  and dashing down the pieces on the carpet. "Only the ——! And what more could it
                  be, I should like to know! A nasty black abolition paper, trying to stir up our
                  slaves," ("our" was good, in that connection) "to murder us in our beds! I would
                  not have believed it of you, Mr. Minthorne! Would you, mother! Oh! oh! oh!" and
                  either overcome by her emotions or thinking that tears ought to make their
                  appearance at about that period, for the effectiveness of the tableau,—she fell
                  back upon the sofa and sobbed, with her face hidden by both her handsome white
                  hands.</p>
               <p>Ned Minthorne was affected. If Dora Fullerton was charming when angry, she was
                  overpowering when in tears; and the young man had proceeded so far as to put both
                  his hands on one of the young lady's, and endeavor to remove it from her face,
                  with a few endearing words, when Mrs. Fullerton, who had likewise been watching
                     <emph>this</emph> scene in the drama of courtship, thought it politic to
                  interpose.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Minthorne," she said, rising so suddenly from her chair that the young man
                  did not see her until her stately form loomed immediately before him. "Mr.
                  Minthorne, I really feel it to be necessary, in this instance, to interpose the
                  authority of a mother. Whether you have intended to do so or not, this is twice
                  already, within a few minutes, that you have managed to excite my daughter in a
                  manner very painful to me as well as to herself."</p>
               <p>"But, madam—" began the offender.</p>
               <p>"I beg you will allow me to finish," said the stately woman, while Miss Dora still
                  kept her hands over her face, displaying not only the hands but the rings to
                  excellent advantage. "You should have known, sir, that the wrongs and outrages
                  suffered by the South have made a great impression upon <emph>us!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You allude to the—the whipping of the slaves, setting blood-hounds on them, and
                  all that sort of thing—pshaw! that is the other side! You mean the—the—" and here
                  he broke down. Had any man, not an acknowledged ninny, dared to hint at the things
                  conveyed in the early part of that sentence, in the house of Mrs. Fullerton,
                  perhaps not even the recollection of several millions at stake could have
                  prevented her ejecting the offender with ignominy. But Minthorne <emph>was</emph>
                  such a fool, and he had so evidently blundered, that she did not think it either
                  necessary or politic to pay any attention to the remark; and she merely went
                  on:</p>
               <p>"We have been brought up, Mr. Minthorne, both of us, among a society and in a
                  section of country where high and chivalrous feeling has some regard paid to it.
                  You are somewhat excusable if you have not been surrounded by the same influences;
                  but I ask it of you, as a mother who has the welfare of her daughter very much at
                  heart, that at this moment when the miserable hounds here at the North are<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7282-00000032"/> heaping still worse insults upon our dear
                  down-trodden South, you will not introduce into this house any thing calculated to
                  injure our patriotic feelings, and especially those of my daughter, who is very
                  sensitive and not a bit strong."</p>
               <p>There was only one thing that Ned Minthorne could possibly say at that stage of
                  the peroration, and he said it.</p>
               <p>"No, madam."</p>
               <p>At which gentlemanly promise, and a sufficient time having elapsed to make that
                  measure proper, the hands of the young lady came gradually down from her face, and
                  her tears ceased, though there was an occasional catch in her breath, bearing the
                  same relation to a sob that is borne to a hurricane by a gentle spring zephyr.</p>
               <p>"As for that <emph>thing!</emph>" and the dignified lady touched the —— with her
                  foot as it lay upon the floor—"it has always been a lying, deceitful, abominable
                  abolition sheet, hounding on Sumner and Greeley, and doing every thing it could to
                  trample upon every Southern institution and every Southern feeling!"</p>
               <p>When it is known that the sheet alluded to had never up to that time, and has
                  never since, referred to either of the agitators named, without abusing them—that
                  it had been upholding and defending the Southern side of the national question,
                  during all the difficulty, so continually that its loyalty to the Union was more
                  than doubtful—and that not many days after the time treated of, its editor and
                  proprietor was obliged to throw out the flag from his windows, under the threat of
                  having his building torn down and being himself taken out and hung,—the justice of
                  Mrs. Fullerton's adjectives may be estimated, and some calculation may be formed
                  of what description of Northern sheet it would have needed to be, that she did
                     <emph>not</emph> designate as "lying, black abolition."</p>
               <p>"There—there, mother, go back to your seat and don't say any thing more about it!"
                  said the gentle and impulsive Miss Dora, who probably felt well assured that her
                  lover could not answer her mother's tirade if he would, and who had by this time
                  enjoyed quite enough of the peculiar sensation of the quarrel, to be anxious for
                  another novelty. Her mother was about obeying the gentle behest, and the white
                  hand would in another moment have fallen again on that of Minthorne, sealing a
                  full reconciliation,—when there was a ring at the bell, a foot heard ascending the
                  oaken stairs, and the moment after Mr. Charles Holt, merchant, entered the
                  room.</p>
               <p>Each of the persons previously there rose to meet him and shake his hand,
                  establishing the fact that he was an intimate acquaintance. But in his salutation
                  of "Mother!" to one of the ladies and his familiar mode of saying "Dora!" to the
                  other, something more was revealed. The merchant was a son-in-law of the handsome
                  hostess of the Southern proclivities; and a sister of the impulsive young lady on
                  the sofa presided, or had presided, over his house and heart. Whether from his
                  family connection, or from some other cause, he did not seem to be at all in awe
                  of these terrible people; and a closer observer than Ned Minthorne appeared to be,
                  would have seen that something very like forced deference, unaccountable in the
                  descendants of the chivalry of the South, towards a man who had not a drop of
                  Southern blood in his veins and who was a mere merchant, was actually paid to
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Torn papers on the floor!" he said, after the greetings were over. "What does
                  that mean? Eh, Dora?"</p>
               <p>The young lady colored as if she had before been known to tear papers (and other
                  things), and as if that phase of her disposition was no novelty to her
                  brother-in-law. "Only an old paper," she stammered out after a moment, "that
                  I—that has not been picked up."</p>
               <p>"Not very old—only this morning," commented Holt, stooping down, picking up a
                  portion of the torn paper, looking at the date, and then throwing it down again.
                  "However, one day is an age now-a-days. Of course, you saw what it contained?"</p>
               <p>The inquiry seemed to be addressed to both mother and daughter. Neither answered,
                  and Minthorne looked as if he had sense enough to feel for both and to be
                  uncomfortable. Holt went on:</p>
               <p>"I did not allude to the Sumter business—that you saw last night,—but to the
                  statement that the Cabinet had been<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7282-00000033"/> all
                  night in session; that active measures had been decided upon, and that there will
                  probably be a call for troops, tomorrow, over the whole country."</p>
               <p>Strangely enough, neither Miss Dora nor her mother, who had been so outraged at
                  the very sight of the heading-lines conveying the intelligence of that
                  proclamation, a few moments before,—went into tears or raved over the insults
                  offered to the South, now! What a mysteriously calming if not depressing influence
                  the merchant seemed to exercise, the moment he entered the room! Was it merely the
                  iron will of a hard man of the world, radiating out and affecting insensibly all
                  whom he approached, or was it something more?</p>
               <p>"There is a devil of a row brewing," he continued, meeting no answer. "They will
                  need fifty or a hundred thousand men, and that is no small army. I wonder whether
                  they can all be raised immediately?"</p>
               <p>"If they are, the whole fifty or a hundred thousand ought to be hanged before they
                  had marched one mile!" broke out Mrs. Fullerton, who could endure the restraint no
                  longer. "And the man who would help to raise one of them—"</p>
               <p>"As <emph>I</emph> shall do," interrupted the merchant. "Well?—the man who would
                  help to raise one of them, ought to be—"</p>
               <p>"Bah!" was the singular word with which the dignified lady concluded the sentence
                  which had threatened to end in such a wholesale denunciation.</p>
               <p>"Come here, Dora!" said the merchant, in a tone very like one of command, walking
                  towards one of the front windows at the same moment. The young lady obeyed, while
                  Mrs. Fullerton rose from her chair near the other one, and left the room, as if to
                  avoid hearing what was to be said, and Minthorne, who had walked over to the other
                  side of the room and picked up the unfortunate book, sat down again upon the sofa,
                  and busied himself with it, with the air of a man who felt that for the moment he
                  was very much in the way, with a very dull prospect of escape.</p>
               <p>"Put that in your pocket," said the merchant, handing Dora a very small package,
                  when they were at the window and out of ear-shot of the millionaire. "Of course
                  you do not want to have <emph>him</emph> see you receive it?"</p>
               <p>"No! no!" answered the young lady, in a low voice that had in it something
                  approaching shame and agony.</p>
               <p>"I thought not!" said the merchant, <emph>his</emph> tone something that might,
                  under other circumstances, have seemed a sneer. "What the deuce is that
                  noise?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," answered Miss Dora, "only Myra and Mildred, squabbling, as usual, in the
                  room above. They think they are obliged to go to bed too early, and they are
                  almost unmanageable, altogether."</p>
               <p>"Singular!" said Holt, in a tone that conveyed his impression of the fact not
                  being singular at all.</p>
               <p>"They will make less noise in a day or two, or they will probably get killed,"
                  replied the affectionate sister. "We have just been employing a new governess,
                  somebody named Haviland, from the country; and we hired her because she had been a
                  country school-mistress, used to flogging children. When she comes, if she
                     <emph>doesn't</emph> keep those young wretches in order, out she goes, and that
                  in a week."</p>
               <p>"Right," said the merchant, playing with the tassel of the window-curtain. "Make
                  everybody obey, around you, or out with them! Haviland, eh? Oddly enough, I have a
                  clerk with the same not-very-common name, or had one, for he is going to
                  volunteer, and ha! ha!—do you remember what your mother started to say a moment
                  ago about 'the man who would help to raise one of them'?—I have promised to pay
                  him his salary while he is gone, and take care of his family."</p>
               <p>"You?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>I!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"How much of a family has he? and how old is he?"</p>
               <p>"What business is that of yours?" asked the merchant, not over politely. Then he
                  smoothed his tone, half laughed, and answered:</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is young—twenty-eight or thirty; and his family, he says, consists of a
                  wife and one child. Any thing else you want to know?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—one thing more. Have you ever seen his wife?"</p>
               <p>"Humph—yes—perhaps so!" was the answer, and at the moment the eyes of the two met;
                  and Ned Minthorne, had<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7282-00000034"/> he been near
                  enough to the merchant and his sister-in-law to see the intelligence conveyed in
                  either glance, and keen enough to read it, would have found something much more
                  worthy of his attention than the dull book with the half-cut leaves, over which he
                  was whiling away time on the sofa.</p>
               <p>"Dare you!" was the brief sentence that came from the lips of the young lady,
                  hissing through them with something that sounded like the venom of the serpent
                  when grasped and powerless.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! do you not think it may <emph>pay?</emph>" was the answer, in a low,
                  chuckling tone, such as one uses who is thoroughly satisfied with himself and the
                  world. And here the conversation ended, and the interlocutors, with an apology to
                  Minthorne from Holt, returned to the centre of the room. Mrs. Fullerton joined the
                  circle in a few moments, and the conversation fell upon other and less exciting
                  subjects than national affairs—those trifling topics in which the mother and
                  daughter seemed to be perfect—the merchant no novice—and Ned Minthorne,
                  millionaire and fashionable ninny, more at home than he could possibly be in any
                  other line of conversation. Half an hour later the merchant rose to leave,
                  Minthorne followed him, and the silence and quiet of repose soon afterwards fell
                  upon the handsome brown-stone house in East Twenty-third street, however far from
                  quiet, during all that long night, were some other sections of the great city,
                  seething, bubbling and fermenting beneath the yet only half-digested news from
                  Charleston harbor, and the added excitement of the patriotic but intemperate
                  comments made upon it in the daily and Sunday papers.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>We have seen Charles Holt and Burtnett Haviland, the merchant and his clerk,
                  leaving the store of the former on Saturday evening, not together by any means,
                  nor with the same means of conveyance in view, but each having the same apparent
                  object—to go home. It will now be necessary to roll back the tide of time for one
                  day and return to that evening, in order that more may be known of both men and
                  their domestic relations as well as their patriotic emotions, and in order that at
                  least a glance may be caught at the temple in which the household gods of each
                  were treasured. Not only in right of his years but his position, the merchant is
                  entitled to the first place and must be accorded it.</p>
               <p>Charles Holt, when he had reached Broadway, did not at once enter an omnibus of
                  the Fifth Avenue line, as he had at first intended. There was yet light enough
                  remaining to make a stroll up Broadway pleasant; and he had either not been so
                  stunned by the news of the national shame and his own prospective pecuniary Joss,
                  as to be discouraged and down-hearted, or something else had occurred calculated
                  to overbalance such sad feelings. He looked pleasantly, even smilingly; and as he
                  emerged a few moments after from the bar-room at Delmonico's with a fresh Havana
                  between his lips, no one would have believed him to be a man of position and
                  responsibility, living under the shadow of a crushing national shame and so fully
                  impressed with his own duty to<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7282-00000035"/> the
                  country as to be willing to make heavy pecuniary sacrifices to meet its needs. The
                  smoke from his cigar curled pleasantly upward, his foot rung clearly on the
                  pavement as he lounged slowly on, read the signs once more that he had before read
                  ten thousand times, and looked in at the windows to see the porters lighting the
                  gas-burners for the display of articles of use or luxury that no one was very
                  likely to purchase on that particular evening. Occasionally he would meet an
                  acquaintance not too much absorbed in the sensation of the hour to speak to him,
                  and then he would exchange salutations and pass with the most courtly ease. Men
                  who had chanced to know him in youth, but who had not risen so fast in the world
                  as he had done, would turn their heads after he had gone by, and think what a
                  fortunate as well as eminently respectable man was the head of the great firm of
                  Charles Holt and Andrews; and handsome women, of whom the street was not yet
                  entirely thinned, would glance from their carriages or throw a pleased look after
                  him as they saw him on the side-walk, thinking that he was (as indeed he was) a
                  fine-looking man, and that it could be no undesirable thing to hold the position
                  of head of his household. Once he met a little boy with Union rosettes, that had
                  been gradually creeping out for some days, in response and defiance to the
                  secession cockades known to be flaunted at Baltimore, Washington and all over the
                  South, and that this evening seemed to have sprung up in a crop of red, white and
                  blue flowers that no man could number. He bought one, paid his silver quarter for
                  it, accepted the offered pin from the boy, pinned it to the left lappel of his
                  coat, and passed on—having performed one more duty to his country, at least—that
                  of putting on the national colors and taking part in the patriotic madness of the
                  hour.</p>
               <p>Opposite St. Thomas' Church the dusk began to gather, his cigar was smoked out,
                  and he fancied that he had threaded the jostling crowd sufficiently and taken
                  quite exercise enough. He hailed one of the Fifth Avenue line of stages, and
                  stepped in. Thenceforward, for half an hour, he was absorbed and melted away into
                  that great car-and-omnibus-riding crowd which forms so large a part of New York
                  society every morning ing and evening; and it would have been difficult to display
                  or even to preserve any decided individuality. With his thoughts we have nothing
                  to do, as they must show themselves in action; and even his sensations on being
                  crushed between a fat old lady who sat on him and a thin young lady who looked so
                  pale and fragile that he dared not make room for himself by sitting on
                     <emph>her,</emph> must be passed over as matters of no moment. At the end of
                  the half hour he emerged from the eclipse of the stage, and walked quietly up the
                  steps of his own handsome house on Fifth Avenue, so near to Dr. Spring's Church
                  that the spire of that building, had it chosen to topple over, might have done
                  serious damage to his roof and the elaborate ornamention of his brown-stone
                  cornices.</p>
               <p>One of those thin pass-keys of the Butler pattern, that seem so slight and yet
                  tumble locks of such formidable strength, admitted him, and he passed into the
                  hall, where the lamp was already lighted. The house was a double one, of immense
                  size, and within as well as without it told of great wealth as well as of a taste
                  managing that wealth somewhat more understandingly than is usual in
                  aristocratically-republican New York. No bare floor or stairway, here. The walls
                  of the hall were handsomely frescoed, Venus Aphrodite and the Triumph of Galatea
                  being the subjects filling the centre on either side and bordered with heavy
                  scrolls of fruit and flowers with their extreme edges just touched with gold. All
                  the finishing of the hall and stairway, with the doors opening on either side, was
                  in oak—no imitation in grainers'-paint, but a fine dark, solid wood that looked
                  English. The floor was covered with costly Indian matting that gave back no sound
                  of the foot and had not the cold look of oilcloth; and the same warm taste was
                  visible in the carpeting of the stairs, in the heavy velvet of which showed red
                  and gold-color in profusion. The hall lamp was held by a handsome bronze knight in
                  armor, Who stood at the foot of the stair; and in the niche of the landing, half
                  way up, was a rich gold-bronze reduction of Kiss' famous Amazon, its flash in the
                  gas-light coming distinctly even to the door.</p>
               <p>So much could be seen, of the luxury which surrounded the merchant, by merely
                  entering the hall. The visitor who<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7282-00000036"/> set
                  his foot within the door which opened to the right as he entered, would have found
                  a drawing-room fitted with every elegance known to the age—rosewood; crimson
                  velvet; heavy English tapestries; pictures by well-known modern artists, European
                  and American, with no lack of the warmer subjects of personal delineation, and yet
                  nothing to which the most fastidious prudery could object; a heavy clock of <hi
                     rend="i"/>ormolu; a piano of the best German manufacture; costly bronzes on the
                  mantels, representing various progressions of dress and arms in English history;
                  books in superb bindings, scattered on tables covered with heavy velvets, and
                  interspersed with statuettes in ivory and Parian, of different celebrities in the
                  musical world—all that wealth of costly adornment with which so many American
                  mansions have within the past ten years become overloaded, to the serious
                  depletion of the purses of those who indulge in them,—and which are almost as
                  impertinent as tedious in the recital.</p>
               <p>But if the visitor supposed that the proprietor of this establishment had followed
                  a very common national custom, and heaped up luxuries in his hall and parlors as
                  show-rooms, to the beggaring of the other details of his house, that visitor was
                  very likely to be undeceived when admitted within additional portions of the
                  penetralia. Especially would he have become aware that Mr. Charles Holt, in
                  fitting up his superb mansion, had not neglected <emph>himself.</emph> For no
                  thicker was the velvet carpeting of the room to the right, than was that of the
                  corresponding apartment to the left, which the merchant entered the moment after
                  he had closed the outer door. No thicker in texture, but much larger in figure;
                  for that of this room, which seemed to belong exclusively to the proprietor, was
                  of grass-green, cut into small diamonds by bars of gold-color; while the windows
                  had close inner-blinds, only thinly veiled by curtains of festooned lace. The
                  furniture was in oak, like the furnishing of the hall, and among it could be
                  detected an escritoire or secretary standing near one of the windows; a large
                  book-case with the books hidden away by curtains of crimson silk; a lounging-chair
                  of the Chinese pattern—capable of being converted into any thing, from a mere
                  stool to a bed; and a large iron safe, so ingeniously disguised in manufacture and
                  grained to the appearance of the universal oak, that it seemed to be nothing more
                  than a beaufet to sustain a silver water-pitcher, a liquor call with bottles, and
                  half a dozen silver goblets and Bohemian glasses. The master of all these
                  conveniences had evidently been expected; for a gas lamp with a snake attachment
                  connected with the chandelier, was lighted and stood on a small table very near
                  the escritoire and beside the easy-chair. The master, too, of all these
                  conveniences, should have been the happiest of men, so far as outward
                  circumstances could affect him, and always provided, of course, that his domestic
                  surroundings were equally perfect and congenial. How nearly they were so, will be
                  gradually but very satisfactorily ascertained.</p>
               <p>The merchant had evidently not quite done with the thoughts possessing him while
                  crowded in the stage, for he threw himself into the easy-chair the moment he had
                  entered the room, pressed it back until it became half chair and half lounge, and
                  mused for several minutes with his eyes shut and in silence. Then he threw back
                  the chair to be a chair alone, drew it to the escritoire, opened that convenience,
                  drew out paper and rapidly indited a letter. Taking the privilege of the literary
                  Asmodeus to look over his shoulder, we may say that this letter was addressed to
                  his junior partner, Mr. Beverly Andrews, then in Europe on purchasing-business for
                  the firm, and that one portion of it ran as follows: <q>
                     <p>"Taking all that has happened into consideration, there is no question
                        whatever that the country must now fight or go to pieces. The South is weak,
                        but ready; we are strong, but unprepared. This will make the struggle a
                        longer one, when it comes, than most people suppose; and those who are
                        prepared, can make more money out of it than could be made in ten times the
                        same period of peace. We shall lose heavily by our Southern customers, and
                        Northern ones must repay the loss—that is all. We must have a large body of
                        soldiers, and those soldiers must be clothed, All parties will at first be
                        frightened at incurring enormous expense, and they will be clothed meanly.
                        Buy up all that you can of very common army cloths; light and dark-blue, as
                        of course they will retain the colors of the regular service. Double our
                        intended investment, also, in cotton goods, as cotton <emph>must</emph> rise
                        under the new aspect of affairs. You can draw on Peabody for $——, in
                        addition to avails now in his hands, for which I will provide by the current
                        steamer."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So it will be seen that Mr. Charles Holt had a shrewd eye to business, even if he
                  felt the national affliction to some extent<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7282-00000037"
                  /> tent, and that he did not intend to permit losses by Southern customers
                  seriously to impair the fortunes of the firm. Some of his calculations were rather
                  shrewd—were they not? as, for instance, that in first plunging into a war,
                  everybody would be frightened at the coming expense, and try to proceed as cheaply
                  as possible; while after a time, and when once fairly involved in it, a hundred
                  millions would seem no more than ten had seemed at the beginning. Perhaps he had
                  gambled a little, some time in his life, and seen how carefully the player risked
                  his first small stakes, to become utterly reckless, after a while, of risks that
                  seemed to afford the only prospect of winning back what had been already lost. If
                  so, did be not develop some of the qualities of a safe even if a bold player?</p>
               <p>Not many minutes served to conclude the letter, which he put into an inner pocket,
                  unsealed, in view of the possibility that he might need to add or change something
                  before the sailing of the steamer on Monday. Then he shut the escritoire, locked
                  it, replaced the key in his pocket, threw the easy-chair back into precisely the
                  same position that it had before assumed, and ruminated for at least five minutes
                  more.</p>
               <p>It is not to be supposed that he had not heard, at any time within the past
                  fifteen minutes, sounds proceeding from the room immediatly above his own. Those
                  sounds had been faint, and somewhat muffled by the thick floor and ceiling, but
                  still easily distinguishable as the tinkling of glasses, loud laughter, and
                  occasional pounding on the floor. Strange sounds to come from an upper room of a
                  gentleman's house, one would have said, and especially strange when himself had
                  been for the whole day absent and had brought no company whatever home with him.
                  Yet the merchant had not seemed to heed them, though he certainly heard them, and
                  once or twice made an impatient dash of the pen, as if the noise merely interfered
                  with his directions to his partner. They had not ceased when he finished the
                  letter and took his second rumination.</p>
               <p>After sitting in this manner for the few minutes named, Mr. Holt leaned back and
                  twice jerked the silver bell-pull immediately behind him. The summons was very
                  quickly answered by a man-servant, to whom the master addressed one word:</p>
               <p>"Dinner?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, ready whenever you wish, sir!" was the reply, and the servant opened a
                  door leading from the rear of the apartment through a small dark room, threw open
                  a second door, and ushered the merchant into a handsome dining-room, where a table
                  was set sufficient in size for the accommodation of at least a dozen, and
                  profusely covered with plate, china and glass, but with only one chair set before
                  it and with only the dishes which one person would use. That single chair the
                  merchant occupied, and two minutes sufficed for a quick-moving and pretty female
                  servant to set before him a dinner worthy of some modern Lucullus. No costly
                  luxury of the market, whether of fish, flesh, fowl, or fruit, failed to be there
                  represented; arid the neat-handed servant-girl, who had evidently been subjected
                  to some pretty severe training before she acquired that perfection, understood him
                  and his wishes so well that he merely needed to make a sign, without uttering a
                  word, and the demand was fulfilled—even to the pouring out of one or another of
                  the different kinds of wine with which the solitary banquet was graced. Solitary,
                  for not one word was spoken during the fifteen or twenty minutes—perhaps half an
                  hour—that the merchant consumed in discussing it. A banquet, because food enough
                  was set before him, and consequently prepared for waste in the servants' hall, to
                  have satisfied the hunger of twenty men. Some pitier of poverty, conversant with
                  the want and wretchedness of a great city, and the thousands who drag around their
                  weary limbs and nightly crawl away to miserable beds, without having had their
                  hunger even once partially appeased,—some man like this, who should have stood
                  beside Mr. Charles Holt, on that occasion, might temporarily have had the
                  heart-ache, spite of the fact that the wealth which supplied the banquet was truly
                  enough the merchant's own, and that he had an undoubted right, humanly speaking,
                  to dispose of his own as he liked. The merchant himself, it is highly probable,
                  thought of that luxurious dinner and of others which preceded and followed it, one
                  day when the table at which he ate was<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7282-00000038"/>
                  not quite so plentifully spread and the food not quite so savory.</p>
               <p>All things have an end, and the quickest of all things to end is an American
                  dinner—except when Smith, who fares meanly at home and never dines at any place
                  more luxurious than a shilling restaurant, finds himself transiently sitting at
                  one of the bountiful repasts spread for him by Beach at the Cattskill
                  Mountain-House, or Anderson on the good Champlain steamer "United States,"
                  determines that he will have a full meal for once in his life (seeing that the
                  cost is all the same), and valiantly goes through with fish, flesh and fowl,
                  entrees and entremets, pies, puddings, custards, jellies, ice-creams, melons and
                  peaches, down to the cheese, nuts and raisins, in spite of the fact that all the
                  other guests have long before left the table, and that the waiters are looking
                  three-pronged forks at him because they have set him down as "no gentleman," and
                  because they are waiting to set the table for another relay of hungry people. All
                  other American dinners but this of Smith, and that of Brown when he gives a
                  hundred-dollar "blow-out" to four friends at the Maison Dorée, whereat all parties
                  eat themselves sick and drink themselves blind and stupid,—have an end. And all
                  this has nothing to do with Mr. Charles Holt, who was a quick diner, and who, if
                  he wasted food by having an unreasonable quantity and variety prepared for him,
                  did not gormandize it.</p>
               <p>His dinner ended, the merchant tossed off yet another glass of wine after he had
                  risen, drew his hand across his brow as if he was wiping away any fume it might
                  have left in his brain, lit a cigar that he took from a side-pocket, and went back
                  to his own apartment. The merriment from the room above seemed yet to be sounding;
                  and immediately on entering the room he gave the bell the same double pull as
                  before. The same man-servant entered at once, and stood mutely within the door.
                  Evidently, if he had nothing more (and had he not much more?) this man kept order
                  among his servants, whenever they came into personal relation with himself.</p>
               <p>"Go up to your mistress, and say that I wish to see her, here," was the order, no
                  sooner given than obeyed in the disappearance appearance of the servant. Perhaps
                  five minutes elapsed, while the merchant again sat in his easy chair, but in a
                  much more erect position than before, and puffed silently on his cigar that was
                  gradually filling the room with the subtle fragrance of its Cuban birth. Then the
                  door leading into the hall opened, a little suddenly and as if the band that
                  impelled it was trembling with temper, and a lady stepped into the room and closed
                  it behind her. It was worthy of notice that the door closed less violently than it
                  opened, and that the step which carried the lady within the room from the
                  threshold was slower than that with which she had approached it, and seemed like
                  the pulling up of a fast horse that had been under very rapid way. It might have
                  appeared as if the atmosphere into which she came, so to speak, was heavier and
                  more dense than that from which she had emerged, and that she could not move quite
                  so rapidly through it.</p>
               <p>The words uttered to the servant have indicated that this lady was the wife of
                  Charles Holt, and such was the fact. Bearing this important relation to the
                  merchant, and also to two others who have before been sketched in this narration,
                  a word of description of her is unavoidable.</p>
               <p>She might have been twenty-eight years of age, to judge by the Whole contour of
                  face, figure and carriage, though there were various points in her appearance,
                  each of which would have varied the estimate if taken by itself. Her figure was
                  tall, exquisitely rounded, and even the least in the world inclining to <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">embonpoint,</foreign> though it had lost nothing of its
                  erectness and gave a very fine impression of the voluptuous pride of Juno. The
                  short sleeves of her evening dress of dark shot silk, left the arm revealed, and
                  gave even more opportunity, by its perfect and yet substantial mould, to judge of
                  the outline of the remainder of the figure, than might otherwise have been
                  enjoyed. Her face was something fuller than that of her sister Dora, as became her
                  fuller figure, though there were many of the same characteristics in both. The
                  same petulance on the lip, and the same diminutiveness of the lower part of the
                  face, though the forehead was not so full, and the coldly intellectual seemed less
                  fully developed. The complexion was (or had been) nearly the<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000039"/> same, and there was the same dark eye, nearly
                  passing for black, without quite the same natural scorn flashing out from it. The
                  hair was perceptibly darker, though still rather light than dark, and just enough
                  waved to add to the charm of its wonderful luxuriance. Handsomer than Dora, a
                  little darker and fuller in the general effect, and yet—</p>
               <p>The fact is, that we must have been describing this woman more as we know her to
                     <emph>have been,</emph> than as she was at this juncture. Such variations from
                  strict fidelity have occurred and will occur again. The past shines through the
                  present, in face and form as well as in any other particular that can be grasped
                  by the human mind. The poor lost courtezan met yesterday in a bye-street, did not
                  look so wholly beyond sympathy as she would have done, with her bleared eyes and
                  bloated face, and wrapped in her dirty and faded finery, had we not remembered her
                  under other auspices, many a long year ago. It is doubtful whether the mother ever
                  quite loses the impression that her son is still her "baby boy," with sunny curls
                  on his brow and the glow of early youth on his cheek, though that son has really
                  grown gray-haired and broken, with crows-feet under the eyes and all the charms of
                  youth passed away, as seen by the eyes of others. And it is certain that the
                  auld-wife, looking into the face of John Anderson her Jo, and crooning that
                  sweetest of all ballads of a love beyond time or change, did not quite see him as
                  he stood beside her then, with his hair thin and white and his limbs tottering
                  downward to their final rest, but as she had seen him in the early days, when his
                  hair, was brown and curly and he leapt the style with a boyish delight to come to
                  her at the milking.</p>
               <p>Thank God that this is so, for it may save us loves that might otherwise pass away
                  before we were quite ready to lose them!</p>
               <p>Olympia Holt, (for she bore the Christian name of her mother,) with all the charm
                  of face and form that has been indicated, bore yet something in both that made the
                  heart first sad, then almost filled it with horror. There was an unsteadiness and
                  want of assertion in step and position, contrasted with an evident temper inclined
                  to be even too self-reliant, that created the most painful suggestions. She could
                  not be what she was, if all was right—she should have been more or less. Then her
                  hair gave the impression of being a little dishevelled and a good deal uncared
                  for; and nothing so far takes from the perfection and dignity of a womanly
                  presence. The lip, too, was trembling and unsteady, not softened from its
                  sullenness, but quivering as if with perpetual conflict of what would be said and
                  dared not. Last of all, and yet most significant of all, the eye was wavering and
                  furtive, continually attempting to flash a defiance that faded away in cringing
                  submission, and with a redness in the lids that might have been caused by long
                  weeping and might have been produced by other causes quite as sorrowful.</p>
               <p>And now let it be seen what were the relations existing between husband and wife,
                  after eight years had elapsed since the marriage of Charles Holt and Olympia
                  Fullerton; and perhaps some light, though not all that must come in the future,
                  may be thrown on the mysterious eclipse of this woman. Her husband's first word
                  may do something to hasten the explanation.</p>
               <p>"Drunk?" Not in such a tone as might have been used if the fact had been thought
                  pitiable, but as if the inquiry had been a mere matter of business, preparatory to
                  another.</p>
               <p>"No I sober enough!—soberer than I wish I was!" came the reply, jerked out from
                  between lips and teeth only by a violent effort. "But what is that to you?"</p>
               <p>"A great deal," answered the merchant—he still sitting, she still standing, with
                  no invitation to do otherwise. It was evident that she had not sat down with that
                  man, in a long period. "A great deal, because one needs to talk differently with a
                  drunken woman, and with one reasonably sober."</p>
               <p>"I am sober enough for <emph>you,</emph> then, Charles Holt!" was the reply, with
                  defiance, and yet defiance subdued and kept under, in the tone. "Speak on, and get
                  done with it, if you have any thing to say!"</p>
               <p>"In <emph>my</emph> time, not yours," said the merchant. "By the way, I do not see
                  how you <emph>could</emph> very well be sober, by the jingling of glasses and the
                  pounding of feet, besides the<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7282-00000040"/> drunken
                  shouting, that have been going on up-stairs during the half hour I have been in
                  the house."</p>
               <p>"That was <emph>my</emph> room, I suppose you know it, and you have nothing to do
                  with what goes on inside of it!" was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Except," said the merchant—"except when you make so much noise there that you
                  disturb me in <emph>my</emph> room, which is very inconvenient, and cannot be
                  allowed; and except—" and here he paused, as if he wished to think twice before he
                  spoke, or perhaps for the very purpose of exciting her curiosity.</p>
               <p>"And what is the other '<emph>except'?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Except when there is company in that room, whom I do not choose you shall
                  entertain."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" was the coldly-insulting reply of the wife.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed!" said the husband, echoing her word, with a corresponding emphasis.
                  "Who are those, up-stairs?" and his finger pointed towards the ceiling that again
                  the moment before had been echoing with the muffled trample of feet.</p>
               <p>"None of your business, I tell you!" came the reply; but even in the act of saying
                  the words the slavish submission came on the heels of the defiance, and she began
                  to recount the names of half a dozen wealthy but characterless young men about
                  town—such miserable and injurious wine-bibbing drones of society as those who
                  figure, at short intervals, in the disreputable trials that shame our large
                  cities.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" said the husband, "I do not care for their names, except <emph>one.</emph>
                  What I want to know, and what I <emph>will</emph> know, is—is —— —— there?" and he
                  mentioned the name of a well-known man about town, whose handsome face, courtly
                  manners and libertinism have of late years been about equally acknowledged.</p>
               <p>"And again I say that it is none of your business!" repeated the wife.</p>
               <p>"Woman!" said the merchant, threatening in his tone, now, whatever there might
                  have been before. "I thought you had got over defying <emph>me!</emph> It is time
                  you had done so, and the quicker the better!"</p>
               <p>"What is it to <emph>you</emph> whether he is there, more than any other?" was the
                  question in reply, but with the defiance changed to sullen submission once more.
                  "Do you think that <emph>he</emph> can disgrace your house, or
                  <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No!" answered the merchant. "I have no fear on the subject. But I will not permit
                  him within this house, and you know it. Have your drunken orgies, according to
                  custom and <emph>arrangement,</emph>" with a terribly significant emphasis on the
                  latter word; "but if I catch him here he will go out of the window, and there will
                  be an expose, I am afraid—that is all!"</p>
               <p>"Man!" cried the evidently agonized woman. "I will tell you the truth as to his
                  being here, if you will tell me why you will not permit him to come with the
                  other—wretches."</p>
               <p>"I will do it," said the merchant. "As well now as ever. Speak on."</p>
               <p>"He is not in this house, and has not been here this week, upon my honor," said
                  the wife.</p>
               <p>"Very well," was the answer. "Now I will keep <emph>my</emph> promise. The reason
                  why I will permit those other people whom you very properly call 'wretches,' to
                  come to this house and enjoy your pleasant society, and why I will not allow you
                  to receive <emph>him,</emph>—is, that <emph>you love him.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well—if I did? if I <emph>do?</emph>" cried the wife, bitterly. "What then? You
                  have just said that you have no fear of his disgracing <emph>me</emph> or the
                  house: what harm, then, can he do?"</p>
               <p>"No fear in the world of his disgracing you or the house—that I repeat," said the
                  merchant. "But there are two luxuries, wine and love, and I can only allow you one
                  of them. I buy you the best wines—drink deeply as you please, but you cannot have
                  the other at the same time. That is mine! So keep that man out of the house—you
                  understand!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I understand! Devil!" said the woman, between her clenched teeth.</p>
               <p>"Possibly!" was the cool reply. "But don't call names: it does not pay, with
                     <emph>me.</emph> Now go up-stairs to your guests, and have it through! I am
                  going out."</p>
               <p>Olympia Holt turned away. What her eyes expressed it is not very easy to say—rage,
                  fear, misery, all so blended that no human analyst could separate them. What was
                     in<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7282-00000041"/> her heart, none but the All-seeing
                  Eye could pretend to judge. She laid her hand on the door.</p>
               <p>"Stop," said the merchant, as he lit another cigar and turned down the light to go
                  out. "You were round in Twenty-third Street yesterday, I understood. Do they want
                     <emph>me,</emph> there?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—that is—I believe so," answered the wife, her tone changed entirely, and her
                  whole expression seeming like that of abject humiliation.</p>
               <p>"Very well—I will see them to-morrow, then. That will do—you may go. No—I forgot
                  to tell you, though perhaps some of your friends have already brought you the
                  intelligence, that your other friends clown in South Carolina have been attacking
                  Fort Sumter and raising the deuce generally. Good-night."</p>
               <p>Before the last words were fairly spoken, the degraded wife had left the room,
                  and, by the time she had rejoined her friends in the room above, the dignified
                  husband had passed out again into the street, where there is no occasion at
                  present to follow him. As we have already seen, on the evening following, that of
                  Sunday, he kept his promise to visit the Fullertons, and his conversation with
                  Dora at the window seemed to have been the legitimate consequence of these closing
                  words.</p>
               <p>The home of the merchant has been explored, and the joy and comfort of the
                  domestic relations existing in the midst of so much splendor faithfully depicted:
                  it is time, now, to join the merchant's clerk as he, too, takes his course up
                  Broadway, towards another home and scene, presenting a marked contrast.</p>
               <p>Some indication has been given in a previous chapter, of the feelings of Burtnett
                  Haviland on that Saturday evening, not only when the intelligence of the fall of
                  Sumter was brought to him in the store, but after he had left it on his way
                  up-town. But something more may be said on the subject, for he is not only a very
                  prominent character in this narration, but he presents a type of popular feeling
                  at that juncture, not the less worth study because the number of persons sharing
                  in it may have been comparatively few. He was very sensitive on national
                  subjects—over-sensitive, as those who knew him best sometimes alleged, and as he
                  himself believed in his calmer moments. The country was to him a mother, quite as
                  dear as any human mother could have been; and he could not think of any shame or
                  dishonor coming to her, without an indignant grief at the heart, any more than he
                  could have done of the foulest wrong or dishonor falling upon her who had given
                  him birth. Those bitter tears he had shed in the store, had not been by any means
                  the first escaping from his eyes for the same cause; for during the previous few
                  months he had seen the ruin coming—had seen the rebellion gathering head,
                  unchecked—had seen the power of the nation lying dead or dormant—had feared the
                  worst, and doubted whether the end would not be the destruction of the last
                  republic ever inaugurated on earth. More than once his wife had said to him,
                  partially in jest and yet with a good deal of earnestness in her manner, that "she
                  believed that he thought more of the country than he did of her and Pet"; and
                  while he had gathered both within his arms at that word, he had at the same time
                  answered that "he did not know but he <emph>did!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Walking up Broadway that evening, a little in advance of the merchant, he did not
                  lounge like him. He Was not walking, like him, so much for exercise (for he had
                  quite exercise enough in his business hours) or to kill time (for he had no time
                  hanging so heavily on his hands that he needed to perform such a murderous
                  operation upon it) as because the motion of his limbs was a relief, just then when
                  his brain was so full of heavy and anxious thought. He, too, saw the articles of
                  show in the windows as he passed, and thought how miserably vain and trifling was
                  humanity, "pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw," at the very moment when
                  the thunders of God's judgment were breaking in the heavens. He wondered how long
                  it might be before national ruin closed those showy windows, or riotous violence
                  laid the fairest monuments of New York's commercial prosperity level with the
                  street. He, too, met a small boy (as did every one who walked Broadway that
                  evening), and bought a red, white and blue rosette, with a silver star in the
                  centre, which<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7282-00000042"/> he pinned to the lappel of
                  his vest; but he pressed the national colors reverently to his lips as he did
                  so.</p>
               <p>Near Canal Street an elderly merchant of his acquaintance, coming down-town on his
                  way to one of the Brooklyn ferries, met and accosted him. He had been heavily in
                  the Southern grocery trade, and during the preceding few weeks passers-by had seen
                  a palmetto-tree standing in his front office, as one more "concession to the
                  South," and a rank insult to every loyal man who passed. His position, therefore,
                  on the national question, was fairly understood.</p>
               <p>"Well, Sumter has gone, at last," he said, as he shook hands with the young
                  clerk.</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered the latter. "I fancy that they have about filled the cup of their
                  outrages, now."</p>
               <p>"Which?" asked the merchant. Then he added: "But I need not ask. I suppose I know
                     <emph>you</emph>—you are about as mad as the rest of them."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so," said Haviland. "Perhaps we <emph>are</emph> all mad; but if I do not
                  miss a figure, you will see such a spectacle of national indignation in these
                  streets, before many days are over, or even before many hours, as history never
                  recorded."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other, his manner expressing any thing but
                  satisfaction at the thought.</p>
               <p>"Mean? Why, mean that the people will rise, if the government does not call them
                  up!" replied the clerk. (It must be remembered that the proclamation was not
                  published until the next morning.)</p>
               <p>"Rise in arms, and to put down the South, here?" asked the merchant, a very
                  perceptible sneer in his tone.</p>
               <p>"Rise in arms, here, not to put down the South, as you call it, but to put down
                  the Southern traitors!" was the reply. "And if they do not, the city of New York
                  deserves to be sunk with Sodom and Gomorrah!"</p>
               <p>"Bah! Mark my words, young man," said the merchant, starting on, "if there is any
                  rising here, and any troops leave this city, four times as many will go to help
                  the South as to fight against it. If you were not very young in comparison with
                  myself, you would know that the interest of the Southern States is the interest of
                  New York, as opposed to that of the manufacturing abolition East, and that when
                  the Southern trade all went permanently away, we might as well shut up our doors
                  at once. A rising against the South? Bah! But you will think better of it
                  to-morrow morning! Good night!" and he passed on, downward, while Haviland pursued
                  his course up Broadway.</p>
               <p>Here was more food for sad and serious thought. Was it indeed true, that the great
                  commercial city was rotten with such sentiments as these? Were there many
                  merchants, near enough to fools, and inclined enough to be traitors, not to know
                  and assert that the interest of New York lay with the Union and not with any
                  miserable section, however large? Was this leaven really spread very widely? Was
                  there to be a "conflict at the North," when every man needed to hold the one
                  great, true, overwhelming patriotic feeling? If so, God help the country, indeed!
                  But he could not—would not believe it; and the near sequel showed how much more
                  the gray-haired merchant knew of the temper even of the mercantile community, than
                  the clerk who had not counted more than half his number of years!</p>
               <p>Haviland saw the bill-boards of the theatres as he went by,<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                   and read the announcements on them, very much as one studies the
                  architectural details of the inside of a church when attending the funeral of a
                  dear friend within it. He knew that an hour later, when the doors should open and
                  the lights and the music beckon, hundreds would flock in, and mimic love and
                  agony—perhaps mimic <emph>war,</emph> be represented, the latter by mighty armies
                  of four or six, while such a struggle as the world never saw was gathering over
                  the land. He would himself just as soon have gone out from the

                  stepped into theatre or ball-room, as to have done so on that evening; and had he
                  been able to judge the future and read the hearts of others, he would have known
                  that many thought like himself, and that the box-books of the theatres then and
                  for many a long day after would show the effects of the national

               <p>At Astor Place the young man crossed to Third Avenue and took a car upward.
                  Thereafter, for half an hour or less, he too was eclipsed and crushed in the
                  stifled atmosphere of a car, and smothered beneath dresses and bundles, as his
                  employer was in the Fifth Avenue stage at about the same period. The eclipse came
                  to a conclusion, however, as in the other case, and the young clerk emerged from
                  the obscurity to the light of his home on East Forty-eighth Street, between the
                  Second and Third Avenues.</p>
               <p>A neat little brown-stone house it was that he approached, a link between the
                  palatial residences of the same material on the more fashionable streets and
                  avenues, and the humbler houses of brick in which men of moderate salaries and
                  small expectations are generally content to find a home. A neat little brown-stone
                  house—and yet more costly than the clerk could have afforded to occupy, had he and
                  his peaceable little family not been willing to submit to that "dividing" of a
                  house which is especially anathematized with a very different meaning to the word,
                  in Scripture. In other phrase, Burtnett Haviland only rented <emph>half a
                     house</emph>—a most humiliating admission to make in his behalf, and one that
                  is accordingly made with the due proportion of fear and trembling. There have been
                  romances written, setting forth almost every other description of living, than
                  this; but this is unquestionably a novel feature, to be admitted when all the rest
                  of the book is proved to have been stolen from Alexandre Dumas, Dickens, Balzac,
                  Bulwer, Fennimore Cooper, Simmis, and even perhaps Cobb and Ned Buntline.
                  Particular shaped houses have been made the habitations of heroes and heroines,
                  from Hawthorne's "House of the Seven Gables" to the "Semi-Detached House" of some
                  English noodle who thought that the success of the former lay in the architecture
                  of the building ing instead of the brains of the writer; and there is no knowing
                  whether some second-hand imitator did not go still further down and write of the
                  "House with the Mahogany Balusters" or the "Castle with the Big Crack over the
                  Door." Then we have had plenty of stories located in houses where families lived
                  alone, and not a few in tenement-houses where the floors numbered seven, with six
                  families of nine children each on every floor. But we have had none showing the
                  abodes of the really "middle classes," who hover between wealth, and
                  poverty—between partial want and comparative luxury; and so let this story be
                  known, if no better distinguishing title can be found for it, by the name of the
                  "Story of a Man Who Only Occupied Half A House."</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland had been married four whole years, and yet his wife had never
                  quite forgotten the days gone by, when he came to visit her in her mother's little
                  cottage in the country, and when she used to watch for him from the door and meet
                  him at the gate. There were no roses or climbing honey-suckles in the scant front
                  yard of the little house on East Forty-eighth Street, and so some of the
                  conditions of romance were wanting; but the heart could supply, it appeared, all
                  that nature denied, and the young wife had the unfashionable habit, when she knew
                  the time at which she might expect her husband's return, if her domestic
                  avocations allowed, of stepping down to the door and waiting to give him welcome,
                  albeit the important mistress of the family, who occupied the lower half of the
                  house,(alas!—another confession must be made, and the Haviland family only
                  occupied the upper, and cheaper!)—albeit that important lady had more than once
                  suggested that the front stoop belonged exclusively to the lower occupants, and
                  that people who lived above had no business upon it any longer than might be
                  necessary to pass in and out! Spite of all this, Mary Haviland had a habit of
                  coming down to meet her husband when she could guess at the time of his return;
                  and though it was a little late on this evening, the dusk fairly fallen and the
                  gas lighted in the street, she stood on the upper step of the stoop, the full
                  glare of one of the street lamps falling upon<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000044"/> her pleasant face and neat figure, and showing that
                  gladness in her eyes at the husband's approach, which can neither be disguised nor
                  simulated.</p>
               <p>A pleasant picture indeed was Mary Haviland, with her blonde hair swept plainly
                  back from her Madonna forehead; her brown eyes radiant with the pure love-light
                  which belongs especially to the mistress of a happy home when standing on her own
                  door-stone; her well-cut and almost purely Grecian features, with the lips
                  budding, the cheeks a little flushed and the chin dotted with a cunning little
                  dimple; and her cheap but neat wrapper of dark small figured delaine revealing a
                  figure a little below the middle height and yet erect, full moulded, and giving
                  evidence of the most robust health. A close view, it may be thought, to be caught
                  beneath the doubtful lamp-light from the street; and if so, let it be supposed
                  that a part of it was caught a few moments after, in the broader light which fell
                  on the supper-table.</p>
               <p>A clasping of the hand, a kiss and a gentle word of greeting, then a reminder from
                  the wife that supper had been some time waiting; and the married pair, a pair
                  indeed, entered the hall, closed the door and passed up the stairway to the floor
                  above. With the exception of two sleeping-apartments on the third floor, the whole
                  space occupied by the Havilands was upon that they had just reached; and through
                  the open door leading into the rear apartment showed a neat little supper-table
                  with their single female servant sitting beside it, and a plated tea-pot pouring
                  out fragrant steam from the top of a small range set in front of the closed grate.
                  The door of the front apartment was also open, as if every thing had been thrown
                  wide to admit the coming husband; and a diminutive chandelier of only two
                  branches, dependent from the ceiling, threw a pleasant light from a single burner,
                  on a carpet of that peculiar wood color known as "English oak"; tables, a mirror
                  and a small sofa in walnut; a few framed engravings of excellent quality on the
                  satin-papered walls (no less than two Washingtons among them—one a copy of the
                  great head by Stuart and the other a proof of Darley's fine equestrian figure); a
                  small book case, with a fair representation of current literature; small
                  photographs of husband and wife, and a larger one of "Pet," over the mantel; and a
                  cylinder stove standing brightly polished but guiltless of fire, under it. Opening
                  out of this room, and also into the hall, was the small bed-room which formed the
                  inner penetralia of the happy household, where the little girl of three years
                  already lay in childish sleep, in her diminutive crib, where husband and wife
                  would erewhile repose—for, alas!—how long?</p>
               <p>The eyes of love are very keen—too keen, as we sometimes think when there is a
                  momentary grief to be hidden or a less creditable cause of embarrassment to be
                  dissembled. There had been no want of warmth or gladness on the part of her
                  husband as he met her at the door and accompanied her up to the little parlor; yet
                  Mary Haviland saw, intuitively, that his mind was not quite at ease, that his hand
                  trembled a little with nervousness, and that his eye was sad and troubled. The
                  fact was, it may be supposed, that to the man who felt himself self-doomed to
                  temporary if not eternal earthly separation from those whom he loved so dearly,
                  the very sight of wife and home had brought a more marked agitation—no faltering
                  in purpose, but a still more bitter consciousness of what the resolution
                  involved.</p>
               <p>"And what is it, Burtey?" at length asked the wife, as the domestic was placing
                  the tea-service on the table, in the other room. She used the diminutive as a term
                  of endearment—a very common and very effective practice with those little
                  women,—and assuming the existence of trouble without even asking the preliminary
                  question. She locked her hand in his arm at the same moment, and looked up into
                  his face with such trust and confidence as should have made him, and no doubt did
                  make him for the one instant during which he forgot the coming weight of his
                  cross, the happiest fellow in the world.</p>
               <p>"What is what, little one?" he answered, with an evasion seldom practised by
                  either member of that domestic partnership.</p>
               <p>Your trouble—you have one—don't tease me, or I shall pinch you!" and she laid her
                  fingers on his coat sleeve as if she really intended to carry out the dangerous
                  threat.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7282-00000045"/>
               <p>"Don't pinch, or I shall have you taken up for assault and battery! Trouble? No, I
                  think not! Shall we go to supper?" So answered the husband. (It will be noticed
                  that the merchant <emph>dined</emph> and his clerk <emph>supped,</emph> at about
                  the same hour—strange difference in the habits of two men in the same line of
                  employment, and two men whose digestive organs may be supposed to have been very
                  nearly similar!)</p>
               <p>"Not a step until you have told me what is the matter," said the wife. "There
                     <emph>is</emph> trouble, I know it! You are not sick?—no, I know that. Have you
                  lost something—been worried? insulted? Has any thing happened in your
                  business?"</p>
               <p>"Torment! I meant at least to have my supper in peace, but I suppose that I
                  cannot!" said the husband, in a tone that he endeavored to make as cheerful as
                  possible, but that somehow had earnest and deep feeling in it. "Yes, we have all
                  been insulted—we have all lost something! Come to the table, and I will tell
                  you."</p>
               <p>They passed together through the narrow passage, flanked with a clothes-closet on
                  the one hand and a range of standing drawers and shelves reaching to the ceiling
                  on the other, that led to the other room; and while the servant-girl handed the
                  crisp brown toast and Mary Haviland poured out the aromatic tea, the husband told
                  in a few words the story of Sumter, which seems destined never to come to an end
                  with the allusions made to it in these pages.</p>
               <p>"Can this be possible? oh, dear! oh, dear!" said the little woman, who, herself
                  naturally proud and patriotic to some extent, had been influenced by the
                  conversation and manner of her husband during the preceding months of trouble and
                  anxiety, until she had become nearly as great an enthusiast as he in all matters
                  that touched the honor and welfare of the nation.</p>
               <p>"This is all possible—this has all happened!" answered the husband, (though it
                  must be unromantically confessed that his mouth was partially full of toast at the
                  moment, his utterance not being improved thereby).</p>
               <p>"And what is to be the end of it all?" asked the wife, who naturally felt that the
                  national troubles could neither end nor stand still, just here.</p>
               <p>"War—long, bloody and desolating war!" said the husband, no toast in his mouth
                  now, his voice sinking very low, and his eyes looking out from beneath his bent
                  brows at the little woman seated on the other side of the table.</p>
               <p>If there was earnestness and anxiety in that glance, the same qualities were shown
                  in that which was returned, for Mary Haviland nearly dropped the tea-cup which she
                  was about to re-fill, her face perceptibly paled for the moment and her whole
                  manner seemed agitated. The wife understood all that must come upon herself, in
                  that single short sentence. She knew her husband to be brave, physically as well
                  as morally. She knew him to have a high sense of personal duty in all relations.
                  She knew how he despised the <emph>sender</emph> who should have been the
                     <emph>goer,</emph> in any line of action. She knew how deep and abiding was the
                  anxiety for the nation which lay upon his heart—an anxiety which had not alone
                  manifested itself in their hours of conversation by day, but sometimes broken out
                  from his lips in the words of troubled dreams when he lay beside her at night. He
                  had said, with that peculiar glance, that there must be bloody and desolating war,
                  and he had said <emph>in</emph> that glance and in the tone of his utterance, that
                  he must form a part of that bloody pageant whenever it should be arrayed. She
                  believed him, as she might have done one of the archangels of heaven; and from
                  that moment she knew that the unbroken companionship of the last four years was
                  soon to be no more for a time and might be no more forever!</p>
               <p>And yet no shrinking—no! Sadness and sorrow, deep in the heart, but no shrinking;
                  and even the sorrow so shut down that it should not have power to issue from the
                  lips. Some of those little women have a power of being heroines without fuss,
                  lamentably denied to us of the sterner and stormier sex; and Mary Haviland, who
                  had been fluttered and nervous the moment before, now that she knew the worst,
                  shook off the agitation and looked her own calm self again, almost smiling, as she
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I understand you, Burtey! You know best! What a<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000046"/> terrible tea-drinker you are, when you finish two
                  cups and ask for the third before I have finished even one!"</p>
               <p>Little Pet, who had heard Papa's voice even in her first nap, rushed out in her
                  night-clothes at this juncture, her brown eyes half shut and blinded by the light,
                  and her curly hair all damp and tumbled. Then she had to be taken up and kissed,
                  and before <emph>her</emph> presence even the omens of war and domestic separation
                  faded away, to come back again when the house grew still and Burtnett Haviland,
                  encircled by the fond arms that might soon be exchanged for a more bony pressure,
                  "talked in his sleep."</p>

                  <p>A SHORT CHAPTER AND A DULL ONE—ALL HISTORY AND NO ROMANCE—THE RISING OF THE

               </argument>
               <p>THEN came the rising of the people.</p>
               <p>History has no more glorious spectacle than that which followed the fall of Sumter
                  and the issue of the President's Proclamation calling for troops to assert the
                  honor and dignity of the nation. No such rebellion had ever been known, in the
                  magnitude of its preparations or the guilt of its object; and no such rising had
                  ever been seen, in the number of men involved in it or the sacredness of the cause
                  for which they were preparing to combat. The sight may have been a glorious and a
                  stirring one, when the New York Liberty Boy ran out of his workshop, with his
                  grimed hands and sooty face, to take part against the murderous action of the
                  British soldiery at Golden Hill,—or when the Massachusetts farmer left his plough
                  standing in the furrow and the oxen to be unyoked by other hands, as he rushed
                  home to grasp the musket and make himself a deadly thorn in the side of the
                  redcoats who had massacred his brothers at Lexington. But the men of the
                  Revolution were the men of rougher and hardier times, scarcely emerged, yet, from
                  the perils of the old French war, and surrounded still by savages for whom the
                  fire-lock was kept ever loaded in the house and the hand ever trained to wield the
                  weapon. The men called to combat this rebellion were the men of peace—the men of
                  work and of trade, bred in an age when luxury had surrounded them with an
                  imperceptible but all-powerful net to fetter their limbs,—unaccustomed to war,
                  incredulous that such a calamity could fall upon them, and as unprepared as men
                  could be, in every regard, for the summons to such a trial.</p>
               <p>It may be said again—history has no more glorious spectacle than this rising.
                  Southern traitors had considered such a thing a sheer impossibility, and made the
                  want of warlike spirit in the North one of the bases of their evil calculations,
                  even if they did not expect active aid in their own behalf. Quasi-traitors at the
                  North (like him of the palmetto-tree and the well-bred sneer of age and
                  experience, noticed in the last chapter) had formed the same opinion, extending
                  even to the supposition of New York casting in her lot with South Carolina, as
                  opposed to Pennsylvania and the Eastern States. The truest lovers of their country
                  had held little or no hope of such a demonstration as would dishearten rebellion
                  and teach the world a needed lesson. William Howard Russell, L. L. D., new in his
                  appointment as American special correspondent of the <title>London Times,</title>
                  had passed through New York and written to his journal that the whole nation was
                  lying in apathy from which it could not be aroused, caring for nothing but eating
                  and drinking, rioting and making love—an essentially unmilitary nation, from which
                  nothing energetic could be hoped or expected. Such had been the omens and the
                  expectations: what was the glorious reality!</p>
               <p>Saturday evening and night, as has been seen, were a period of wild anger and
                  sorrow—indignation and determination as yet blind and unshapen. Sunday was a
                     day<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7282-00000047"/> of flag-raising, to an extent
                  unparalleled in the history of that sacred day. The glorious omen of the
                  apotheosis of the flag has before been mentioned, but something more may be said
                  of its generality, as part of the history of the time. Monday, with the coming of
                  the President's proclamation calling for seventy-five thousand troops, brought a
                  marked increase in the number of flags floating from every mast and steeple,
                  draped over every door and drooping from every roof and cornice. The costliest
                  residences on the avenues vied with the places of trade and the public buildings
                  in throwing out the national banner. The stocks of manufactured flags in the
                  stores soon began to be exhausted, and the prices doubled and trebled without any
                  abatement in the demand. Soon the stock of silks, buntings and other ordinary flag
                  materials began to run low: then flannels and muslins of the proper colors came
                  into requisition. Every liberty-pole flaunted its flag, and hundreds of poles were
                  raised, both in city and country, where they had never stood before, even in the
                  hottest political contests. The public building that had been inadvertently left
                  without a flag-staff when erected, suddenly found such an appendage not only
                  proper but indispensable. The man who could manage to procure a flag and did not
                  do it, stood in danger of insult at least. The proprietor of any public place who
                  neglected to throw out the ensign, was looked upon with distrust: if he refused,
                  he was indebted to public forbearance and not to public respect, for freedom from
                  serious injury—a freedom which he did not always preserve until the close of the
                  excitement. In some instances, where buildings were occupied by people of opposite
                  sentiments, the openly loyal took the precaution to hang out the flag with letters
                  appended announcing which of the varying interests made that concession to
                  individual feeling or the public voice.<ref rend="super" target="#note_003"
                     xml:id="return_003">*</ref>
                   At one time the leading streets of New York City were so festooned with
                  flags as scarcely to leave the mercantile signs visible; and the flap of bunting
                  was so general as to keep the eyes of the passer-by in a continual quiver of
                  movement. A careful statician, whose fancy for numbers would probably have led him
                  to count the number of heart-beats consumed in the duration of its dearest joy,
                  made the estimate, from personal observation, that the number of flags of all
                  descriptions visible on Broadway, from the Battery to Union Square, on one of the
                  hottest days of the excitement, was not less than six thousand, and that from ten
                  to fifteen thousand were at the same time waving, flapping and hanging in all the
                  other different streets and avenues of the city.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_003">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_003">*</ref>A notable of this was shown at one of the public buildings New York City.
                     One of the daily newspapers, which occupied the lower part of the building,
                     and the loyalty of which was very seriously doubted, refused to throw out
                     the flag; and one of the departments of the City Government, occupying the
                     upper stories, took care that the flag <emph>they</emph> flung out should
                     designate where it belonged.</p>
               </note>
               <p>Another display in which the public feeling broke out, was in Union rosettes,
                  stars, breast-pins, and other trifles of personal adornment. The rosette-fever,
                  particularly, began early and spread beyond computation. Commencing with the very
                  evening of Sumter (as we have seen) the wearing of those emblems of fealty to the
                  Union grew more general day by day, until within a week after the fall of that
                  fort, the man who did not display something of the kind on his breast or at his
                  lappel, was very likely to have his loyalty seriously suspected. Ladies, too,
                  assumed those emblems, quite as eagerly, though not with the same generality, as
                  their husbands, brothers, and lovers; and among the most grateful services that
                  could be rendered by fair hands was the weaving of one of those "favors," to be
                  worn not in honor of herself, but her country. (What would not some of us be
                  willing to pay, now, had we preserved some of those stars, rosettes, and other
                  emblems of universal loyalty, then so common as to appear unworthy of hoarding,
                  but long since passed into the hands of the children as playthings, and already so
                  generally lost that scarcely one can be found even in a museum or a private
                  collection!).</p>
               <p>Another phase of loyalty (the reserved force of which a dry joker might have
                  designated as the <emph>re-publican)</emph> was shown in the signs of the public
                  houses, especially those of moderate class and character. Here and there, in city
                  and country, there had been a "Union Hotel," as there had been a "United States"
                  or a "Washington." But within a day<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7282-00000048"/> or
                  two after Sumter the number began to increase to an unheard-of extent; and in the
                  cities, especially, scarcely a block existed without at least one place of public
                  resort designated as the "Union." Clothing, shoe, hardware, and even
                  thread-and-needle stores followed; and the same careful numerist to whom allusion
                  has before been made, computed that within a week after the great outrage, no less
                  than twelve hundred stores, saloons, and other places depending upon the public
                  patronage, could have been found, in the city of New York alone, bearing that word
                  which had suddenly become so endeared. A trifling circumstance, as some may hold,
                  and one not worth recording; but it may not be considered a trifle, as indicating
                  the general feeling, when it is remembered that each of those assuming it was
                  acting to secure additional popularity, and that each, consequently, was
                  fulfilling what he held to be the <emph>public requirement.</emph> It may have
                  been even a more trifling thing, when the cartman, not satisfied with the rosette
                  on his breast and the flags he had stuck into the bridle of his horse, came
                  down-town one morning with the same magic word, "Union," scrawled in hasty paint
                  on the front-board of his cart,—and when another, the proprietor of a new spring
                  cart with permanent sides, displayed it to astonished Broad Street with the whole
                  vehicle striped red, white and blue, from shaft to end-board; but these, like the
                  others, were glorious "straws," showing the blowing and direction of the national
                  "wind," and in the days to come they may become part of the history of this
                  sensation period.</p>
               <p>The whole country was rising, as the people of no land ever rose before; and the
                  flags and emblems that have here been recounted were but the surface indications
                  of the sterling ore of patriotism that lay beneath. And for what was the rising?
                  For a political polity or a party platform? No! Let not this fact go down to
                  history distorted, many as have already been the attempts to falsify it. Nor was
                  the rising even for revenge upon the traitors of the rebel States, bitterly as
                  burned the sense of degradation in the breasts of loyal men, at the outrage which
                  had been committed on the American Flag. It was not even for this that such men as
                  Burtnett Haviland groaned most deeply in the night hours, when the horror and
                  misery of a coming war loomed up to them; and it was not even for this that they
                  were so willing to risk all that they had before held most dear, in the camp and
                  in the field. It was for the <emph>Union</emph>—the very word blazoned on the
                  front of the drayman's cart. They believed their government to be the freest and
                  best on earth—they believed that it had done nothing to forfeit their respect or
                  their allegiance—they saw it in danger and knew that it must fall, unless their
                  hands supported it. For this they raised flags and wore the national colors—for
                  this they rose, held public meetings, denounced treason, prepared to fight. For
                  this—nothing less and nothing more,—they have fought throughout the war,—except a
                  fanatic few, on either extreme, a mere fragment, incapable of making one hair
                  white or black on the national head, but for their fatal power to hinder and
                  embarrass others. The day was when that fanatic few scoffed every man who dared be
                  a conservative lover of his country, with the slighting and sneering epithet of
                  "doughface," or the still more contemptible cry of "Union saver;" but it remains
                  to be seen whether the great lesson has not already been laid to heart even by
                     <emph>them,</emph> and the tried, steadfast, devoted lovers of <emph>the Union,
                     first, last and all the time,</emph> begun to be reckoned at their true worth
                  in the national exchange!</p>
               <p>History, not this romance, must deal with the particulars of the great national
                  events and developments which followed Sumter closely. The President's call for
                  seventy-five thousand troops, on Monday, the 15th of April; the certainty that
                  loyalty could not recede, that treason would not, and that war was actually
                  inaugurated; the coming home of Anderson and his brave men from Sumter; the sad
                  knowledge that to carry on the great struggle by sea, the nation had only
                  twenty-four antiquated vessels, carrying three hundred and eighty guns, and by
                  land the skeleton of an army of less than ten thousand men; the popular gatherings
                  which raised and voted moneys so liberally for the public defence, and which,
                  approaching even the mob spirit, compelled the throwing out of reluctant flags and
                  the sudden somersaults of men and newspapers before considered disloyal; the
                  issuing by Fernando<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7282-00000049"/> nando Wood, Mayor
                  of New York, of a proclamation calling upon all good citizens to "stand by the
                  Union and the Constitution," written perhaps with the same pen with which he had
                  only a few days before assured the Governor of Georgia that he was in favor of the
                  continued shipment of arms to the seceded States; the peril that was known to be
                  gathering around Baltimore and Washington—around Harper's Ferry Armory and the
                  Norfolk Navy Yard;—these and a hundred other details, otherwise of interest, can
                  only be indicated—not related. Enough to say, once more, that the country was
                  alive—awake—earnest—determined; springing boldly forward to the contest, however
                  the image of a big man being stealthily robbed of his weapons and having his hands
                  tied, from behind, at the same moment that a smaller but full-armed antagonist was
                  approaching him in front, would intrude itself upon minds fond of drawing singular
                  comparisons.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps best for us, often, that we do not realize the whole truth of any
                  situation at once, but come to the understanding by degrees. There have been many
                  lamentations vented, first and last, over the want of conception of the magnitude
                  of the great contest, at first so conspicuously displayed, and the prophecies of
                  the rebellion being "ended in three months," that fell from prominent lips. This
                  may have been all providential: the country was enough alarmed with what it saw,
                  to be aroused and inspirited; had it seen all, it might have grown terrified and
                  faltered at the very moment when hesitation would have been absolute ruin. One
                  moment of vacillation, and no future time could have regained the ground thus
                  surrendered to rebellion and anarchy. Enough to say, once more, that what it saw
                  it sprung to meet, as no nation ever before rose—as no nation will probably ever
                  find at once necessity and spirit to rise again—young and old, rich and poor, male
                  and female, giving heart, voice, action, wealth, to the national cause.</p>
               <p>Nor was the essential military point, that of the enlistment of soldiers
                  themselves, without which all the other preparations could only have been a
                  melancholy pretence,—at all wanting at this juncture; and to that point a few more
                  words must be devoted. State militia and citizens who had never worn a sword or
                  carried a gun, competed with each other in the readiness with which existing
                  organizations were prepared for temporary service and new ones formed for "two
                  years or the war"—the two years being then the longest supposable limit for which
                  the struggle could continue. All the loyal States responded nobly to the call of
                  the President, and readily as nobly. Some of the Pennsylvania troops, ordered to
                  rendezvous at Harrisburgh, reached that city even in advance of the order coming
                  to them, affording to Pennsylvania the honor of furnishing the first soldiers
                  (several companies of the Twenty-fifth) who entered the national Capital for its
                  defence. Four Massachusetts regiments, ordered on the afternoon of Monday to
                  report at Boston, began arriving there on Tuesday before nine o'clock in the
                  morning, and more than fifteen hundred men were at the rendezvous before noon—an
                  instance of celerity in gathering for warlike purposes, not often paralleled and
                  never surpassed.</p>
               <p>New York, the conservative and commercial city, upon the friendship or supineness
                  of which the Southern leaders had largely calculated for the early success of the
                  rebellion,—nobly gave the lie to all the base hopes which had been formed of it,
                  as did the State of which it formed so important a part. It seemed to grow into a
                  great military recruiting centre and place of warlike preparation, as it had been
                  only the week before the great centre of commercial enterprize and all the arts of
                  peace. Not many hours elapsed after the President's call, before the hindrances in
                  the way of enlisting melted away and the difficulty seemed to rest with those who
                  prepared to stay at home. It is of course impossible, at this distance of time, to
                  specify the order in which the different regiments of the New York State militia,
                  located in and near the great city, made their tenders of service to the
                  Government. Enough that all, not hopelessly out of service on account of defective
                  drill and thinned ranks, sprang forward with the same alacrity. The tender of the
                  Seventh, Col. Lefferts, the pet regiment, will always be peculiarly remarked,
                  because they offered themselves with full ranks and in readiness to march within
                  twenty-four hours, (though only for the limited period of thirty days), while
                  others of the regiments, equally<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7282-00000050"/>
                  patriotic and equally anxious, needed at least a little time for preparation for
                  longer service. Close upon the heels of the Seventh came the Seventy-first, Col.
                  Vosburgh; the Seventy-ninth, Col. McLeay; the Sixth, Col. Pinckney; the
                  Fifty-fifth, Col. Le Gal; the Sixty-ninth, Col. Corcoran; the Twelfth, Col.
                  Butterfield; the Eighth, Col. Lyons; the Second, Col. Tompkins; the Fifth, Col.
                  Schwarzwaelder; the Thirteenth, Seventeenth, and Fourteenth, of Brooklyn, Cols.
                  Abel Smith, Graham and Wood, and perhaps others that escape hasty recollection. Of
                  these the Fourteenth and Seventy-ninth took two-years service, the others
                  enlisting for the three months of the existing crisis.</p>
               <p>Volunteer organizations for the war sprung up with incredible rapidity, and their
                  ranks filled with astonishing speed. The appellations of almost all those
                  organizations are now historic, as some of their brave men have fallen upon almost
                  every battle-field of the great struggle; and the names of Duryea's Fifth Zouaves,
                  or "Advance Guard,"—of Hawkins' Ninth Zouaves, of McChesney's (afterwards
                  Bendix's) Tenth, or "National Zouaves,"—of Col. Stiles' Ninth N. Y. S. M., that
                  afterwards enlisted for the full term of service,—and of fifty or an hundred
                  regiments out of the nearly two hundred that have first or last borne the honor of
                  the Empire State in their keeping,—are too familiar in the memories of readers of
                  the current history of the war, to make their recapitulation necessary in a
                  relation of this character. Some of these have long since come home with thinned
                  ranks, torn banners and heads wreathed with the very halo of glory; others have
                  fallen under misfortune or been sacrificed by incapacity, and are known no more in
                  the army they once adorned; still others are yet fighting the great battle,<ref

                   under different command from that in which they first breasted the iron
                  storm, and with different comrades at their sides, but with the same old purpose
                  animating their hearts. It is only with men and events embraced in the
                  three-months' service, and with one corps that should have had a longer existence
                  than envious fortune vouchsafed it,—that we are obliged more peculiarly to
                  deal.</p>

               <p>That single corps, enlisted for a much longer period than it remained in
                  existence, and embracing material which should have made it a splendid success
                  instead of a signal failure, was the First Regiment New York Fire Zouaves,
                  organized by an officer whose abilities seemed to be entirely wasted upon it, and
                  whose fate was even sadder than its own. And the tie which binds this narration
                  more closely to Ellsworth's Zouaves than to any other corps that took part in the
                  early movements of the war, is the fact that one of the most important characters
                  embodied in it, cast his lot with that regiment of citizen soldiers, for reasons
                  and under circumstances which will be soon hereafter explained.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THAT was a strange, sad Sunday which dawned upon the little household of Burtnett
                  Haviland in East Forty-eighth Street, albeit the sun shone brightly, and all the
                  appearances of nature were in harmony with the advancing season. Poor Mary
                  Haviland, standing on the verge of her first great sorrow, had borne as heavy a
                  weight on her heart through the night, as the husband whose coming absence she
                  mourned; and if no moan arose from her lips during that troubled slumber which
                  preceded the dawn, while the hardier and stronger man was wrestling with fate in
                  his sleep, it was bodily habit and not absence of tortured feeling which gave the
                  restraint. Half asleep and half awake, as the morning<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000051"/> broke, she dreamed that her husband was gone—that a
                  huge black figure, whose features she could not see for a dense, dark veil, but
                  which seemed to have a hand nearly as large as a human body, had snatched him away
                  from her, in spite of her outstretched arms and her piteous entreaties, and dashed
                  him down a precipice that she could not even fathom with her eyes. She rushed
                  towards the verge to follow him—then shuddered and drew back in mortal fear—then
                  awoke with a sharp scream, which broke other slumbers than her own. Little Pet
                  (who was seldom designated by any other appellation, though she bore the sweet
                  name of Louise) had been fighting sleep with her tiny fists and rounded arms for
                  at least half an hour, trying unavailingly to open her eyes, and bruising her
                  diminutive nose in her pugilistic operations, when the waking cry of her mother
                  completed the exorcism of the spirit of slumber. One bound out of her little crib,
                  and a pair of chubby legs were flying over the side of the bed, with the white
                  clothing wofully deranged, and the two parents nearly pulling her apart in a
                  playful squabble for the first kiss of the little brown-curled darling.</p>
               <p>"I fight 'oo!" said the spoiled little beauty, doing honor to the bad instructions
                  of Sarah, (the servant-girl,) or some of their visitors, taking the part of her
                  mother in the contest, doubling her ponderous fists and squaring away at her
                  father from the pillow.</p>
               <p>The father laughed, as we almost always laugh at <emph>a certain proportion</emph>
                  of the Amazon in the softer sex, whether they be three years old or several times
                  that age. But Mary Haviland did not laugh. Something in the child's words had
                  jarred her already over-wrought feelings. Though uttered in play and in perfect
                  unconsciousness, why must that word "fight" have come between herself and her
                  husband, at that moment of all the moments in their lives? The husband saw the
                  shadow on her face, and understood it but too well.</p>
               <p>"There, Pet, take this bunch of keys," reaching over to his pocket and getting
                  them at the same time, "get into your little bed again and play with them until
                  mamma gets up." Then to his wife, as the little one slid away and tumbled again
                  into the crib to enjoy her new possession of jingling iron and brass: "What is it,
                  little woman? And what did you scream about, a little while ago?"</p>
               <p>"You know, Burtey!" answered the wife, nestling close to him and laying her head
                  on his breast. "You know, for I heard you talking in your sleep more than twenty
                  times during the night. You have been thinking that we were to be separated, and
                  so have I. But, oh, Burtey, I hope you have not been dreaming as I have done! Did
                  I wake up with a scream? Well, it is no wonder, for I dreamed that I saw a great
                  black hand catch you—that I screamed and tried to hold you back—but that it dashed
                  you over a deep, dark gulf; and I was thinking of throwing myself over after you,
                  and yet afraid to do it, when I woke—screaming, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Poor little wife! Rough dreams indeed!" said the husband. "But you see no black
                  hand has thrown me over the precipice, in reality. So your dream is false and
                  there is nothing to scream about."</p>
               <p>"Nothing <emph>yet!</emph>" answered the wife. "But the future, Burtey—the dark,
                  sad future!"</p>
               <p>"Mary," said the husband, very gravely and yet very tenderly, caressing the head
                  that nestled near him the while. "You understood me last night, I know. I saw that
                  you did, and tried not to spoil your night's rest by saying more. There will
                  be—there must be—a call for troops. I do not know when it may come, but it should
                  come at once. That call must be met, and met the very moment that it is given. The
                  response must come from <emph>the people.</emph> If the land is to be saved, it
                  must be saved by those who have hearts to know and feel its peril, and who have
                  joys and comforts that they can resign in its behalf. Nothing less than such a
                  sacrifice can be accepted by the God of Nations. I know and feel it. The rich who
                  can buy commissions and <emph>play</emph> soldier—the very poor who have nothing
                  to leave and are bettered rather than worsted by going into a soldier's
                  life—neither of these have any thing to sacrifice; and they will be Cains, not
                  Abels, in the dark day. It is such as myself, who have every thing to lose and
                  nothing to gain by fighting for the country, who must save the land or it will
                  perish."</p>
               <p>The beautiful eyes of his young wife looked up at him as<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000052"/> he lay. There were tears in them, but there was no
                  dissent from the words he was saying, and the head even sadly nodded its
                  acquiescence.</p>
               <p>"Stop," said the husband. "Little woman, you always <emph>will</emph> insist upon
                  lying in the front of the bed, out of some nonsensical excuse about 'seeing to
                  Pet.' Now pay for it. Get up, that is a good soul, and bring me that red-covered
                  History of the Revolution from the top-shelf of the book-case in the other
                  room."</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland had never yet learned the peculiar horror which belongs to the
                  nineteenth century, against that phrase in the marriage-service which speaks of a
                  wife "obeying" her husband. She rather enjoyed, than otherwise, a requirement from
                  his lips which she could properly fulfil, with the pleasant feeling it brought
                  that she was adding a little to the <emph>obligation</emph> under which he rested
                  to treat her kindly and love her dearly. She was not strong-minded, and the
                  necessity of apologizing for her in this place is submitted to as well as
                  acknowledged. The conversation of a few friends of the proper cerulean hue, or a
                  little experience at those notable conventions in which it is demonstrated that
                  maternity ha? somehow been transferred to the opposite sex from that for which it
                  was originally intended,—might have made her wiser, given her a proper idea of her
                  own dignity as a wife—enabled her to accept all the kind offices which her husband
                  chose to tender her, without doing any in return—and kept her from the gross
                  impropriety which she committed on this occasion. Not knowing any better, Mary
                  Haviland actually obeyed her husband when he asked her for the book! Her little
                  bare white feet went patting on the carpet, and her white night deshabille
                  fluttered lovingly round the dainty limbs that it somewhat saucily exposed, as she
                  ran out into the parlor, procured the red-covered volume that he desired, and
                  tripped back again into the bed-room. There she flung the book at him, with a
                  ferocity which might have damaged some unfortunate fly happening between it and
                  her husband's body; crept back into bed (it was Sunday morning, early, and no time
                  at which either needed to use remarkable diligence); nestled a little closer than
                  before, beside him, on account of the chill of her short excursion; and prepared
                  pared to listen to what the red-covered book might have to say on the duties which
                  men owed to their country in all ages, and those which they paid without a murmur
                  in those <emph>first</emph> times of the free Land of the West which "tried men's
                  souls."</p>
               <p>It was only a picture to which he was about to call her attention—only a picture
                  at which she glanced as the rising sunshine peeped in at the blinds. Only a
                  picture, and yet it told more than volumes of words could have done, of the
                  patriot duty of that time, seen in the light of days gone by. The scene was
                  evidently Valley Forge in that terrible winter of 1178, which has since made so
                  many hearts bleed even as the feet of the poor soldiers of liberty were then
                  bleeding. A winter of deep snows and piercing winds, with the American army
                  well-nigh discouraged, sore present privations added to past defeat, and only the
                  presence of the master mind and the master hand sufficient to prevent total
                  despondency. A miserable hut stood in the foreground, its roof half dismantled,
                  its clapboards broken, its chimney gone, and a wreath of thin smoke creeping out
                  from between the shivered shingles of the roof, to denote that some poor apology
                  for a fire was burning within. Night was coming, as denoted by the sun setting
                  behind masses of cold, heavy clouds. The snow lay thick upon the ground, showing
                  tracks of men and horses hither and thither,—almost covering a fence to the right,
                  to show the depth to which it had fallen. Behind lay the dark, sombre woods, the
                  position of the branches of the nearest trees indicating that they were writhing
                  and groaning in a fierce winter wind. By the door of the hut stood the Father of
                  his Country, pale, sorrowful but determined, and his hat removed in evident
                  deference to the condition of those before him. Two soldiers were just shouldering
                  their muskets to go upon guard, as could be seen by the gesture of the General,
                  pointing up a bleak hill to the left. And oh, what figures for a guard, on a sharp
                  winter night! One had the cocked hat of the continental service, with the side
                  broken and the hair coming out at the crown; the other wore what remained of an
                  officer's chapeau, all bruised and battered and the ends drawn to the head with
                  loops of twine: Both were in tatters, at elbows, knees, and the bottoms of their
                  frayed and worn<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7282-00000053"/> trousers—a very mockery
                  of clothing, for the bitter weather that surrounded them. One wore two boots, the
                  one nearly perfect but the other with the end entirely gone and the bared toes
                  kissing the snow. The second, one shoe, dilapidated and lashed at the ancle with
                  thick strings, and the other foot only covered with a coarse cloth that seemed to
                  have been tied around it in the same manner. Behind the two was an orderly,
                  apparently in attendance on the General—but little better clothed than his
                  companions, and his thin face and sunken eyes showing the sad effects of cold and
                  privation, while his attitude was so palpably shivering that the gazer could not
                  well look upon it Without experiencing a similar feeling. A most cheerless and
                  melancholy picture, and yet one that had been executed by a powerful hand, and
                  bearing the very impress of the time treated of. It must have been a cold and
                  unpatriotic eye that could look upon the scene unmoved, and no such eye was gazing
                  upon it on that Sunday morning. The husband, who had studied it often and never
                  without a painful swelling in the throat, turned his gaze upon his wife when she
                  had been regarding it for several minutes in silence, and saw that there were
                  tears trembling on her eye-lids. Far down through the years, more than three
                  quarters of a century after the suffering of Valley Forge had been endured, one of
                  the patriotic women of America was paying a weeping tribute to the bravery and
                  devotion of her forefathers; and the husband was sadly content with what he
                  saw.</p>
               <p>"This," he said, "is what the men of the Revolution endured. I have looked at this
                  picture often during the past year, when men have been loud in their professions
                  of devotion to the country, and I have wondered how many could have endured Valley
                  Forge. I wonder, now, how many can go through one tithe of the same suffering. But
                  thousands must do so, or we have no country. There must be lonely homes, widowed
                  wives, orphaned children, or we must sink down to be a scoff and a bye-word among
                  nations. I ask you, Mary, if I have a right to hold my home, my comfort and even
                  my life, so dear as to shrink back from the trial?"</p>
               <p>For a moment Mary Haviland did not answer. Her heart was quite as full as her
                  eyes; for the picture, while speaking of duty, had at the same time spoken of the
                  inevitable hardships of the soldier's life, and it was something terrible to feel
                  that her arms were to be exchanged for the cold bed of the bivouac and perhaps for
                  the still colder embrace of death. For the instant her husband believed that she
                  faltered; and his voice was low and broken with deep feeling as he partially
                  repeated his last words:</p>
               <p>"Mary, my own wife, I ask you if I have a right to hold you, my home, my life,
                  dearer than my duty to my country?"</p>
               <p>"No!" said the wife determinedly rising from the pillow and looking him steadily
                  in the face—that morning pillow on which a great many conversations take place, in
                  different regions of this round world, while very few find a chronicler. "No! go
                  and do your duty!" and there was not the suspicion of a tear in the wife's eyes,
                  now, and not a tremor in her voice. With one more struggle, just past, she had
                  determined to give her husband up to his country, as her part of the great
                  sacrifice; and she rightly believed that if she did so at all, she should do so
                  with cheerfulness and even with pride, cheering him for his duty instead of
                  weakening him by tears and womanly wailings over their separation. Thenceforth,
                  the little woman said to herself—(and she had a habit, weak and gentle woman that
                  she was, when fully aroused to her duty, of doing the thing upon which she had
                  resolved)—if she could avoid such an exhibition by any effort of the will, he
                  should not see another tear trickling down her cheeks or even standing in her
                  eyes. She would be content, happy, even merry, in his presence, helping him away,
                  when the time should come, as if he was only going on some pleasure-party that
                  would keep him a while from her society; and if the tears <emph>would</emph> come
                  sometimes, to take their revenge in floods, and if the overwhelming feeling
                     <emph>would</emph> break out sometimes in sobs and wailings over her great
                  sorrow, she would see to it that no such manifestation was made in his presence,
                  to give him a sadder image of her, which he must carry in the faithful mirror of
                  his heart while in the tedious camp, or to unnerve his hand in the day when all
                  his manhood might be required of him in battle.</p>
               <p>These women of America—these wives, and mothers, and<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000054"/> sisters, and sweethearts,—have had much to do with
                  the varying tide of fortune in the War for the Union. They scarcely know the fact
                  themselves, but they have held in their hands the balance of our success or
                  failure, as woman has done, in every civilized age and country, when motives were
                  to be sought as a means of strength. If from the fields of the rebel South have
                  sprung forth so many men to be their defenders that they have seemed to embrace
                  more than the entire population, the secret of the Cadmus crops of armed men has
                  been found more in the fierce rebellious patriotism of the women of their
                  households, than even in the public need and the forced conscriptions. The women
                  of the rebel States espoused the war from the beginning—made it theirs, gave their
                  personal services (honorably and dishonorably), and literally drove into the ranks
                  thousands upon thousands who might otherwise have yielded to supineness, luxury or
                  cowardice. "No bridal ring for <emph>me,</emph> until we have succeeded!" has been
                  the cry of the expectant bride; "No stay-at-home lounger or coward for
                     <emph>my</emph> son!" has been the echoing cry of the mother; while the wife
                  has severed the yet dearer tie with the words "No rest in <emph>my</emph> arms for
                  the man who will not help to drive back the Yankee invader!" Female circles, in
                  the leading cities of the Confederacy, have made solemn leagues, and kept them, to
                  countenance no able-bodied man who remained at home when what they called the
                  "country" demanded his service; sneers, threats and implorings have joined in
                  making a force of compelling power well nigh resistless; sisters have morally as
                  well as literally buckled on the swords and strapped the knapsacks of their
                  brothers, and urged them off to the field; and, these things done, the women of
                  the rebel South have gone one step further and become spies, decoys and daring
                  midnight riders, to entrap unwary Union officers or bring destruction on
                  bewildered Union forces fighting their way through darkness and treacherous swamps
                  and unknown roads. Evil energy, no doubt, and energy expended in a bad cause. The
                  editorial copperhead may find but few sympathizers in his wailings over the
                  treatment of Belle Boyd, of Martinsburg, in the Old Capitol Prison, while she was
                  hissing out "My Maryland," with the very venom of the secession serpent; and the
                  women of the North may well draw back with a shudder from the emulation of such
                  females as those who held Stoughton's head in their laps while their messengers
                  were spurring in hot haste for troops to effect his capture. But even the last was
                  no worse a breach of hospitality than the driving of the nail into the head of
                  Sisera by the Scriptural Jael; and there comes up to mind, whenever real or
                  apparent degradation is submitted to by woman for the sake of what she holds to be
                  patriotism, the dark and fearful image of Judith, warm from the caresses of
                  Holofernes, sitting on the side of his couch, with her night-robes dishevelled,
                  her white arms gleaming ghastly in the light of the cresset from the recess, and
                  her wild eyes glittering with baleful fires, as she waroly draws from its scabbard
                  at the side of the sleeping man the steel which is in another moment to make but a
                  headless trunk of the warrior flushed as much with his victory over her as over
                  the land he had been conquering. And as we think with shuddering admiration of the
                  woman of old, there is at least a shadow of excuse, if no admiration, for the
                  subtle, active, dangerous female fiend of the secession.</p>
               <p>The very opposite has been the action of the women of the North. Partially,
                  perhaps, because the foot of the invader has not been treading at their
                  doors—because the mission on which their husbands, brothers and lovers went forth
                  seemed rather to attack than to defend (while in truth the whole duty of the Union
                  army has been to defend, not a mere section of country, but a whole broad land, a
                  Union and a Constitution),—partially from this seeming, no doubt, but much more
                  from the peculiarities of their lives and education, they have taken no such stand
                  as their whilome sisters of the rebel South. Except in the gentle and womanly task
                  of ministering to sickness and relieving suffering, they have seemed to take no
                  part whatever in the struggle. They have leagued together, at times, for the most
                  meritorious purposes, but it was to prepare lint and bandages for the wounded, or
                  delicacies to send to those hospitals where our disabled soldiers were lying. And
                  it is not certain that their ghastly preparations for the surgeon's aid, exhibited
                  in crowded cities and trumpeted<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7282-00000055"/> eted
                  through the newspapers, have not sometimes cost us more in the way of frightening
                  away enlistments, than they have saved us in lives and convalescence. A few of
                  them (to whom be all honor and praise!) have left happy homes to become
                  ministering angels after the battle-field and in the sick hospital; and here and
                  there one has been possessed of the spirit of Joan of Arc, the Maid of Saragossa
                  or Moll Pitcher, changed sex for the time and carried the sword or the musket. And
                  a few have done like Mary Haviland—buried deep in their hearts whatever of sorrow
                  they felt at giving up those they loved to absence, hardship and probable-death,
                  and speeded them away with cheerful words and smiling faces. But beyond this they
                  have never gone. No circle of society has been closed against the man who had
                  youth, health, competence for his family, physical endurance, and every obligation
                  as well as inducement for becoming a patriot soldier, and yet who ignobly remained
                  at home when the existence of the republic seemed hanging upon his action. They
                  have had no public word of reprobation for the mock soldier who assumed the
                  uniform of his country's service and then basely absented himself from the field.
                  They have had no frowns, they have not even withdrawn their smiles, for those who
                  every day proved themselves to be drones or cowards. They have paid that homage
                  which woman all the world over pays to the epauletted shoulder, without stopping
                  to inquire whether that shoulder bore any of the weight of the country's destiny.
                  The women of the loyal North, in a word, have with but few exceptions failed to
                  make the War for the Union a personal interest, and left it to be the war of the
                  men alone; and the result has been seen in a supineness and an eventual fading out
                  of the war-spirit, which is inevitable when woman fails to throw her love, her
                  scorn and all her influence, into the scale of patriotism.</p>
               <p>It has been said that Mary Haviland, though she had no more idea of playing the
                  heroine than had her husband of becoming a hero—though she was only moved, like
                  him, by a sense of <emph>duty,</emph>—resolved that she, for one, would play the
                  Spartan part and send away the pride and hope of her life with a smile. What it
                  cost her to make and keep this resolution lution, is among the secrets not yet to
                  be made known. And certain it is, that had she known what that very appearance of
                  calm resignation was eventually to cost her, she would have been far from making
                  the effort. But this, again, anticipates what only the future should reveal.
                  Enough to say that half an hour after the close of the conversation we have
                  recorded, the young wife was moving about her household avocations, while Sarah
                  was making a tremendous clatter with the breakfast dishes, and Haviland sat with
                  little Louise on his lap, frolicking with her after the manner of a great
                  school-boy, and giving no more indication than his wife that he did not expect to
                  remain quietly at home for the next decade.</p>
               <p>But here it becomes necessary to say a word of the "neat-handed Phyllis" who
                  prepared the breakfast for the Havilands, and who may be found to have more
                  connection with this series of actual events than her two dollars per week seemed
                  to warrant. Sarah was not in the desolate condition of poor Tim, as to patronymic.
                  She had a second name, and that name, alliteratively enough, was Sanderson. Nor
                  was she one of those waifs who float into service anywhere and everywhere, unknown
                  and uncared for. When Mary Howland, now Mary Haviland, had been a young girl in
                  the little village of Duffsboro, and when Burtnett Haviland, himself a native and
                  resident of the same rural paradise, had been commencing his mercantile career as
                  a clerk in the leading "store" of that village—Sarah Sanderson, the pretty
                  daughter of a poor and proud widow, had also been living in a small house in the
                  neighborhood, not too well educated or too useful, but with ideas above her
                  station and some danger of falling into the temptations so plentifully spread
                  about her by the unscrupulous. Two years after Mary Haviland's marriage, and when
                  with her husband she had become a resident of the great city, after losing every
                  one of her blood-relatives by death or removal to the Pacific shore,—on one of her
                  visits to her old home she had found the widow Sanderson dead, Sarah penniless,
                  helpless and without a home, and the perils of her situation inevitably
                  thickening. She had taken compassion upon her, at the same time that she had been
                  glad of the opportunity<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7282-00000056"/> nity of
                  securing "help" in her little house without introducing a stranger,—had induced
                  Sarah to accompany her to the city, taught her what she lacked in the knowledge of
                  house-keeping, and though employing her as a servant, treated her much more as a
                  member of her own family than as one holding that relation.</p>
               <p>Not much to the young wife's surprise, she had found the girl captious, proud and
                  difficult to manage—at least for a time. Her propensity for the street had been
                  among the most difficult things to conquer, and left to herself the young girl
                  would assuredly have gone to ruin within a twelve-month. Gradually she had
                  improved in conduct as in capacity, as she could not well fail to do under the
                  kind treatment received from both husband and wife; and though still at times
                  unaccountably captious and sullen, and with an occasional propensity for handling
                  the table service as if it had been some living thing and she hated it, Mary
                  Haviland had grown to consider her honest, reliable and valuable. That very
                  morning the young wife had been thinking, while musing upon the probable coming
                  absence of her husband, that she would not even then be entirely alone, without
                  any one near who knew him and understood her—that Sarah would be with her still,
                  and that Sarah, then, would be almost like a near relative, in the place she would
                  fill in the household.</p>
               <p>It was not the privilege of the young wife to look quite so clearly into the
                  hearts of those surrounding her, as may be done here, under the Asmodean power of
                  the romancer. Had she been able to do so, she might have formed a somewhat novel
                  and startling opinion of the character of her "help," and of the companion upon
                  whom she would be obliged to depend so much during the absence of her husband. For
                  the better understanding of what is soon to follow, it is necessary that no
                  mystery shall here remain as to the character of the almost flaxen-haired,
                  gray-eyed, handsome, childish-faced and petite figured girl of twenty-two or
                  thereabouts, who was on that Sunday morning making so terrible a clatter among the
                  breakfast dishes.</p>
               <p>As before indicated, Haviland had been a country shop clerk before coming to the
                  great city. How much of acquaintance quaintance and even of familiarity with all
                  classes such a situation involves, is well known to all who have had the
                  opportunity for observation. Business is not transacted impersonally, there, as on
                  Broadway or Chestnut Street. The shop-keeper knows nearly every one who sets foot
                  within his building, and nearly every one correspondingly well knows the
                  shop-keeper and especially the shop-keeper's clerk. With the latter, particularly,
                  customers who come very often, become pleasantly familiar. If the clerk is
                  reasonably good-looking (courteous he <emph>must</emph> be), the younger female
                  portion of his regular visitors get to know him very well indeed, the more
                  certainly because his stock is very miscellaneous, and there are sometimes little
                  jars of toothsome bon-bons on one side of the shop, while occasionally a remnant
                  of ribbon, too short to sell to advantage, may chance to be given away on the
                  other.</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland had never been a "scamp," as the phrase is. Had he been, he
                  would never have made the loving and excellent husband who has been in the
                  mind's-eye of the writer all this while; for "reformed rakes" do <emph>not</emph>
                  "make the best husbands," and every vice of youth scars the moral nature as sadly
                  as an ugly wound disfigures the physical. Yet the good-looking clerk had chucked
                  girls under the chin, occasionally, when filling that chrysalis position in
                  mercantile life—had even, beyond doubt, occasionally stolen half a dozen kisses
                  from a peachy cheek, in forced or permitted exchange for a handful of bon-bons. He
                  had done so, perhaps more than once, with the pretty and spoiled little daughter
                  of widow Sanderson. There had been the beginning and end of his imprudence in that
                  regard; and of late years marriage, removal, and the whirl of city life and
                  business, had so filled his mind with other things that it is doubtful whether he
                  even remembered, when the little girl came to fill a place in his house as a
                  servant, that such an event had ever occurred. Something else, too, he had
                  probably forgotten, which she had not permitted to pass away so easily. One night,
                  at the same period of his life, the young girl had been caught at the store in a
                  heavy thunder-storm, no one being present in the building but themselves. She had
                  been terribly frightened and<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7282-00000057"/> disposed
                  to scream, and he had very innocently put his arm around her, and held the little
                  fluttering heart near his own—a most dangerous and improper position, by the way,
                  even in thunder-storms, unless they are very heavy, and the people as near
                  relatives as brother and sister. After the thunder-storm, in that instance, it
                  being night, and his employer coming in, the clerk had accompanied his protegé
                  home and left her at her mother's door.</p>
               <p>These little incidents may have been known to Mary Haviland, or they may have
                  escaped her knowledge altogether. Her husband, who believed that the marriage tie
                  should be a real one, with thorough confidence, would at all events have told them
                  to her at any moment, if he had happened to think of them as worth telling. They
                  were nothings to him, and would be the merest trifles to her. But not so to the
                  young girl, whose whole existence seemed to have been affected by them. Though not
                  a living person upon earth, besides herself, had ever dreamed of the fact, she had
                  loved Burtnett Haviland with the best love of her warped, perverted nature, from
                  the days when he gave her bon-bons and stole a kiss from her cheek in the
                  country-store. From the night when he held her in his arms and seemed to shelter
                  her from the thunder, that love had become mad and ungovernable within, however it
                  had left no mark without. From the hour when he accompanied her home, she had
                  entertained a sort of dim impression that he was her "beau"—a country phrase
                  almost ignored in the city, which may mean every thing or nothing. She had
                  considered herself, ignorant and uncultivated as she was, quite the equal of the
                  young clerk, and believed that some day, away off in the future, when he married,
                  he would marry <emph>her.</emph> When she heard of his marriage engagement, she
                  had sulked. When he married, after passing away from her sight for many months,
                  and really quite forgetting that there was such a person as the little
                  flaxen-haired girl in existence,—she had sulked still more, and the wicked devil
                  in her heart had risen up to hate Mary Haviland, his wife—to wish her all ill—to
                  wish that she was dead!</p>
               <p>Then had come the death of her mother—the period of her own helpless
                  dependence—and the offer of Mary Haviland to take her into her own house as
                  companion more than servant. And this was the person to whom the young wife, in
                  the innocent goodness of her own heart, had made the offer! She would have refused
                  it instantly, preferring liberty with the chance of any vice or crime that it
                  might bring, but that it offered her the chance of being near the man whom she yet
                  considered as her "beau." She had accepted it with that end in view, neither
                  knowing or caring (though old enough, at twenty, to realize all the danger to
                  which she might be subjecting herself), what might be the event of her living in
                  the same house with him, without one religious or moral principle to be her
                  safeguard.</p>
               <p>Two years had gone by. Burtnett Haviland, absorbed in his devoted affection for
                  his wife, and realizing that when Heaven gave such a woman to any man, it gave him
                  enough,—had never dreamed of the temptation that lay in his path. It is to be
                  hoped and believed that had he known it, he would have removed it out of the way,
                  not fallen into it. But human nature is weak and unreliable—perhaps blindness was
                  the only safety. Almost any man had better pray to be delivered from any similar
                  temptation than hope to escape it if it once comes to him. Haviland, however those
                  chances might have balanced, had been blind indeed—seeing the girl daily, and yet
                  never reading the feeling that spoke in lip and eye, and that sometimes even
                  trembled in the voice. During those two years her love for him had grown more
                  absorbing, more calculating, more wicked—a love that did not deify the object, and
                  that merely seemed to exist because the feeling ministered to selfishness. She had
                  felt, ever since his marriage, that <emph>she</emph> should have been his wife.
                  She had felt, when first she saw his child, that that child should have been hers.
                  What she saw of the mother in little Louise, she hated with a deadly intensity:
                  what she saw of the father she could love and caress. Sometimes she would snatch
                  up the child suddenly, seeing one of these natures, and caress it: then she would
                  descry the other, and almost dash it down, to the terror of Pet, who feared her
                  almost as much as she childishly loved her,—and to the surprise, at first, of both
                  parents, who eventually set down all her actions to oddity and the whims of an<pb
                     n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7282-00000058"/> ill-balanced nature. Of course her
                  hatred to the wife had strengthened as her love for the husband increased; and
                  there was quite enough of evil thought in her heart to have budded out in murder,
                  but—and the cause which restrained her hand from injury to either Mary Haviland,
                  who, as she actually believed, stood in her way, or to the poor little child, who
                  should have had the same father but another mother, not even the wild, untrained,
                  perverted heart could well have explained to itself.</p>
               <p>This was the member of Burtnett Haviland's household, upon whom both himself and
                  his wife blindly depended for companionship to the latter in the event of his long
                  absence!</p>
               <p>There was another dependence, but that was entirely of a secondary character.
                  Haviland knew that his cousin Kate, a handsome rattle-pate and the torment of
                  every circle into which she was introduced, had grown tired of school-teaching in
                  the country and taken an engagement to come to the city and teach fewer children
                  for the same amount of money; balancing the account of service rendered by
                  receiving more undervaluing looks and more insulting words, in one day, in her new
                  employment, than she could have seen and heard in a twelvemonth, in her old
                  profession. He could only suppose, however, that she would find very little time
                  to spend away from her new responsibilities and under his roof; and he did not
                  know that the family into which she was about to enter had any connection whatever
                  with that of the merchant his employer.</p>
               <p>It is just possible that with a clearer knowledge than that existing, of the
                  influences upon his own and Mary Haviland's welfare, which both the females just
                  named were eventually to exert, the husband might have made some difference in his
                  arrangements for absence. But the fates have their will, generally.</p>
               <p>Something more of that April Sunday, and a word of its politico-religious aspects.
                  The young clerk had not yet enough shaken off the Puritan habits acquired during
                  his country life, to be in the practice of absenting himself entirely from the
                  House of God on the Sabbath; and he rightly calculated, in the present instance,
                  that the discourse to which he would listen, attend whatever church he might, must
                  have some bearing on the great national question which absorbed his own mind. And
                  he might indeed have taken his chance at a venture, among all the houses of
                  worship in the city, without fear of missing the necessary mental pabulum. For the
                  patriotic fever had invaded the pulpit quite as much as it had done the
                  counting-house and the street, and perhaps with more reason than either. In the
                  quiet little church which he attended on that day with his wife, the unpretentious
                  minister, who had usually been in the habit of avoiding politics and preaching the
                  religion of his Master,—perhaps because he felt that he could wash his hands of
                  any agency in bringing about the distracted condition of the country, indulged in
                  no boisterous declamation, but told the story of Sumter as directly and as plainly
                  as he had erewhile told that of Calvary, lamented that the days should have come
                  when brother must lift up his hand against brother, and yet concluded his
                  temperate discourse with the declaration that rebellion against the best of
                  governments was the blackest of sins; that the constituted authority of the nation
                  must be maintained at all hazards; and that the duty of every true man who could
                  bear a weapon, was to spring forward at the earliest call and aid in restoring the
                  ascendency of the flag over every foot of soil it had once shadowed.</p>
               <p>The preacher of a larger and more prosperous church, whose diatribes against
                  slavery and denunciations of every one holding even tacit fellowship with that
                  institution, had done so much to weaken the fraternal bond and bring about the
                  contest just inaugurated, raved, denounced and vilified as of old, but seemed to
                  believe that raving and denunciation would win the battles of the Union, as he
                  neither urged the formation of an army nor prayed for its success when it should
                  be formed. Here one preached to a congregation so wealthy, indolent and exacting,
                  that all agitation was forbidden, and he could only allude to the crisis in the
                  mildest and tenderest of terms. And there another had a large proportion of the
                  Southern interest among his auditors, and dared only to mince his words and call
                  rebellion "unfortunate disagreement" and the outrage upon the flag "a<pb
                     n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7282-00000059"/> movement to be regretted." But all, or
                  nearly all, had their shy at the event; until the volume of oratorical thunder
                  poured out in the one city, could it have been gathered and let off in concert,
                  would quite have equalled that of the bombardment of Sumter itself.</p>
               <p>We have seen how the clerk attended church, and what he heard. Is it to be
                  supposed that the merehant was more of a heathen than he? Certainly not! At the
                  orthodox hour, one of Brewster's handsomest landeaux rolled up to the sidewalk in
                  front of his house on Fifth Avenue; he entered the carriage, faultlessly arrayed
                  and immaculately gloved, and was whirled three whole squares to the place of
                  worship. There he reclined at ease in his luxuriously cushioned pew, only secured
                  in that eligible location by the annual payment of one thousand dollars, and
                  almost sobbed with emotion when the preacher intimated that the great calamity of
                  war had fallen upon the country solely on account of the personal sins and
                  extravagances of its people—that each should practice a return to early simplicity
                  and economy in life, justice towards others, and the cleansing of his walk and
                  conversation from all that could injure mankind or offend the Divine Being. He
                  almost sobbed—not quite: perhaps he would have sobbed outright but for the scene
                  of Saturday evening with his wife, just past, and that of Sunday evening with that
                  pleasant family the Fullertons, yet to come,—between which the church-going was
                  sandwiched.</p>
               <p>Besides he was thinking (and this makes a further excuse for his failing to derive
                  full spiritual benefit from that able discourse) whether S. &amp; Co., of Boston,
                  were likely to have yet on hand any considerable proportion of the damaged
                  satinets of which they had bought so many and sold so few during the preceding
                  winter—whether there were many blue ones among them—how satinets would serve for
                  United States uniforms, instead of cloth—how cheaply he could buy them before S.
                  &amp; Co. thought of the new use to which they could be turned—and whether it
                  would pay him to take the five o'clock train that very evening and go eastward to
                  satisfy himself as to the feasibility of the speculation. He did not go East by
                  the five o'clock train, as has been demonstrated strated by his presence that
                  evening in the city; but there is reason to fear that he must have taken that
                  route the next morning, or sent forward a confidential agent; for the damaged
                  satinets ——. But of them, like Felix's repentance and Mr. Charles Holt's

               </argument>
               <p>FRIDAY the nineteenth of April brought a pageant to the city of New York, novel
                  then, but since become lamentably common—the going away of a regiment to the war.
                  The great city had known citizen soldiery for a long period—had seen them on
                  parade and when they departed on excursions—had boasted that no finer body of men,
                  taken suddenly from the counter and the workshop, existed upon earth—had heard
                  their steady tramp and seen their perfect array, on Fourths of July and parade
                  days—had seen the Prince of Wales and his staff of soldiers reviewing them, and
                  heard those representatives of English pride wonder whether fighting men could
                  really be made in that manner. It had seen those troops in the street, more than
                  once, when possible mob-danger threatened and their muskets seemed necessary to
                  prevent domestic violence. It had watched them when they went away on such great
                  occasions as the trip to Richmond for the obsequies of Monroe, and the visit to
                  Boston to honor the inauguration of the statue of Warren on Bunker Hill. It had
                  seen the citizen soldiery on holidays and when acting as<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000060"/> merely an armed police; but it had never before
                  sent any of them away to <emph>fight.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Monday had brought the President's proclamation and removed from the minds of men
                  like Burtnett Haviland any doubt whether they would at once be called upon to do
                  battle for the country. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday had brought intelligence
                  of still more threatening belligerent movements in the seceded States and on the
                  borders—the call of the Confederates for troops; the refusal of three of the
                  governors to furnish one soldier for the Union cause; the burning of the bridges
                  between Washington and Baltimore, as if to isolate the doomed cities of the
                  border; the planting of rebel batteries on the heights opposite Washington; the
                  danger every day growing more imminent, and every day making manifest by more
                  agonizing appeals, that the Capital of the nation, with the public archives and
                  all the machinery of the government, might at any hour fall into the rebel hands.
                  Anderson had come home; the Massachusetts Sixth had gone down; troops from New
                  York had been called for—actually implored: troops, without one more hour of
                  dangerous delay.</p>
               <p>The Seventh had sprung up to meet the call. Fullest in ranks and most perfect in
                  drill, it was believed that it would have more weight and influence in
                  discouraging the rebels in the neighborhood of Washington, than four times the
                  number of men otherwise organized, because it had been, as a body, at Richmond,
                  had been seen and appreciated by the Virginians, and had been reckoned
                  "conservative" (i. e. not "abolition") to such an extent that many of the
                  Southerners had declared: "There is one regiment of soldiers we are sure of—the
                  Seventh will not fight against <emph>us.</emph>" To show that the Seventh
                     <emph>would</emph> fight against them or against any other enemies of the
                  country, was rightly held as likely to have a depressing influence on that portion
                  of the secessionists who had calculated upon <emph>sympathy at the North.</emph>
                  There is no doubt that, for the moment, the influence of the movement was indeed
                  depressing—that the advance of the Seventh to Washington did more than the
                  presence of ten times the number of other troops might have done, to prevent an
                  immediate attack upon the Capital. Their drill and numbers were feared —their
                  wealth, respectability and moral influence were held even more in dread.</p>
               <p>It has been the fashion, since that time, to decry the Seventh Regiment, before so
                  fêted and honored. The fashion began on the day when they marched back up Broadway
                  from that thirty days' campaign, their uniforms soiled and dusty, but their
                  weapons bloodless, their banners unrent, and their ranks all full except in the
                  absence of one gallant young member<ref rend="super" target="#note_005"
                     xml:id="return_005">*</ref>
                   who already lay in his grave in Greenwood, and a few who had remained to
                  take part in the longer service of other regiments. But if they came back from a
                  bloodless campaign, let it be said that they <emph>went away to a bloody
                     one,</emph> not only in their own belief but in the opinion of all the
                  thousands who gathered to witness their departure. Not one of those who on that
                  eventful Friday saw them leave their armory, the first of the New York soldiery to
                  peril their lives for the Union—not one of the business men who crowded out from
                  their stores to witness a movement which carried away so many of their own class,
                  to meet all the uncertainties of war—not one of the idlers who looked at them as
                  they marched down Broadway, and lazily respected a patriotic vigor and promptitude
                  which they could not emulate—not one of the women who waved handkerchiefs to them
                  from the windows and the sidewalks, as swept by the long steady lines of shapely
                  men in sober gray picked out with black, with faces calmly grave and many of them
                  seeming too young and too tenderly reared for soldiers, with blankets rolled,
                  knapsacks strapped, and the two gleaming brass howitzers wheeling before,—not one
                  of all these believed that they would even pass through Baltimore without a deadly
                  struggle, or without leaving some of their number dead to seal the curse of that
                  city then so deeply execrated in the loyal North. They believed themselves, they
                  were believed by others, to be marching to conflict and death; what more of
                  self-sacrificing bravery could they have shown, had the event justified the worst
                  apprehensions? They were marching, too, in reality, to that which tries the mettle
                  of the soldier quite as much as the exposure of the battle-field—wearying

                  except as gymnasts they had been little used. If the Seventh in that campaign had
                  no occasion to fight the rebel enemy, they found occasion that tried the stoutest
                  spirit, to fight the demons of sloth and indulgence, when they threw by their
                  white gloves, assumed the axe, the spade and the rope, dragged cannon and rebuilt
                  burnt bridges, beneath a Maryland sun, on their toilsome way from the seaboard to
                  Annapolis Junction. All this is little, now, it is true, compared to what trained
                  soldiers have since endured; but it was much then and for them. And more as they
                  showed what they could do and were willing to do if need came, than for what they
                  were really called to do, the Seventh have ever since deserved honor instead of

               <p>In a certain sense, too, they were really marching to death—the death of their

                  thousands gathered in the New Jersey Railroad Depot at Jersey City,—the Seventh,
                  as it before existed, has been known no more. One by one the members of this
                  "show-regiment which has done no service" have dropped away and entered other
                  organizations engaged in the War for the Union, until nearly four hundred of the
                  original number have been fighting for the cause—most of them promoted to the rank
                  of officers out of the respect paid their character and discipline, and scattered
                  through every grade from Lieutenant up to General. Others have filled their
                  places, the name and strength of the corps have been maintained; but the Seventh
                  as it was—the Seventh that Winthrop chronicled—is a thing of history.</p>
               <p>And in that name which has crept unawares into the last sentence, there was
                  another interest involved in the departure of the "pet regiment." Marching close
                  beside the howitzers as they passed down Broadway on that eventful Friday when the
                  Massachusetts Sixth were struggling with the crowd in the streets of Baltimore,
                  was a young man, known on the roll as "Theodore Winthrop," who had only joined the
                  regiment when it was ordered to active service. Agile-framed, light-haired haired
                  and blue eyed, with something of arrogance in the curl of the light-moustached lip
                  and the full swell of the nostril—he would have been a man of mark, the cap
                  removed from his broad brow, in any drawing-room. But he was unnoticed there and
                  then, and among men who had been heard of while he had <emph>not.</emph> He
                  believed that he had brain, and some of those who knew him best had a
                  corresponding impression. Traveller, philosopher, nature-lover, Sybarite, he had
                  seen and felt more than most men of twice his age; and yet he was a nobody. His
                  opportunity had not come—it was only to come when his head should be low in the
                  dust. He had volume upon volume of manuscript, novels and essays finished and
                  unfinished, lying in the compartments of the escritoire in his little room on the
                  slopes of Staten Island; but they were of no use—merely mediocre, the publishers
                  said. He had essayed the publishing experiment: Grub Street had decided against
                  him, while it sent out inane trash by the million, and pirated alike brains and
                  balderdash from abroad. He was quiet, if not content: he was going to save the
                  country now, and write more and better romances afterward. He did not know or
                  dream it, but he was carving out his literary name with the very weapon he
                  carried. He was to become the chronicler of the "March of the Seventh;"—that was
                  to make him a pet with the publishers and readers of the <title>Atlantic
                     Monthly</title> (a placer of fame for any man who has the fortune to fall into
                  its good graces); a few weeks later, when the Seventh had passed up Broadway
                  again, done with labor and returned home, he was to die a soldier's death at Big
                  Bethel; and then was to come immortality—regard in the hearts of his countrymen
                  for what he had been and what he might have been, and literary appreciation, for
                  which he would have given an eye or an arm when alive, to the extent of twenty or
                  thirty editions when he had passed into that happy state of existence which we
                  have no warrant for believing that there has ever entered a mere author, a critic
                  or a publisher.</p>
               <p>But all the while that this, which may or may not be called the "Apology for the
                  Seventh," has been coming from the pen of a writer who has never had any
                  connection, honorary<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7282-00000062"/> or otherwise, with
                  that regiment,—the course of this narration has been brought to a provoking
                  stand-still—very much as a line of street cars might be by the laying of the hose
                  across the track, at a fire. Quite as provoking to the conductor as the
                  passengers; and at the very earliest moment when the hose can be removed with
                  safety to the public interests, let it be so removed and the blocked cars pass
                  on.</p>
               <p>Young Foster, junior clerk in the house of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews, had found a
                  vent for his juvenile enthusiasm in joining the Seventh, and he was among the
                  twelve hundred who passed down Broadway on that eventful Friday. Foster was not
                  only very sanguine, as such young people are apt to be, but very sanguinary, as
                  the young are not apt to be, any more than their elders. He not only believed that
                  he should save the country in some notable manner, and come home with the single
                  star of a brigadier-general at least,—but he was "down on" Baltimore, remembered
                  his academic classics, thought of delendo-ing Carthage, believed that Baltimore
                  ought to be "wiped out," and that he was one of the destroying angels commissioned
                  to perform that sublime operation. He had accordingly taken a hint from the talk
                  about Billy Wilson's Zouaves, then already in course of organization, and provided
                  himself with a concealed revolver, which was a little against the rules, for
                  privates, but not entirely unallowable,—and a hermetically-hidden bowie-knife,
                  which was indefensible and atrocious. At least ten of the rebels were expected (by
                  himself and his mother) to fall in any attempt made on the life of young Foster;
                  and rebeldom generally acted with great wisdom in keeping out of his way, albeit
                  he lost his revolver at Philadelphia and did not find himself in the proper funds
                  to buy another, and albeit the bowie-knife found its best office, very soon after,
                  in opening oysters down at Annapolis.</p>
               <p>Foster had invited all his friends in the store to come out and "see him off."
                  Haviland, who had been so pulled about by half a dozen friends anxious to have him
                  join one and another regiment then in course of formation, that he had as yet
                  enrolled his name in neither,—with others accepted the invitation as well as the
                  chance to see the first corps going away to the war, and came out to Broadway just
                  as the regiment began to pass. He had many friends in the organization, and might
                  perhaps have joined it but that he believed his duty as a soldier would lie beyond
                  thirty days. He met many nods and many waves of the hand in recognition, as the
                  good-looking fellows went by; and at last he caught not only a wave of the hand
                  but almost a bow from Foster, who was resplendent and gorgeous in his new uniform
                  and appropriating to himself nearly every flutter of a female handkerchief along
                  the whole line. Then the files passed on, the crowd closed in behind them, the
                  flags fluttered, music sounded and the cheers replied, farther down the street;
                  and the Seventh was to be seen no more.</p>
               <p>Just at that moment and when the crowd was closing in behind the line of soldiers,
                  Haviland felt a hearty slap upon the shoulder and heard himself addressed by name.
                  He turned, to see a fine-looking man of thirty-five to thirty-eight; five feet ten
                  or eleven in height; handsome in face, though the cheeks were a little bronzed by
                  exposure and touched with the faintest suspicion of late hours and current
                  dissipation; dark haired, but with a tinge of red in the brown; heavy dark
                  whiskers with a still more decided dash of red, worn all around the face, but the
                  upper lip clean shaven. A man of mark, beyond a question, with a merry smile on
                  his well-formed mouth and a quizzical glance out of the corner of his eye, while
                  the mouth could at times assume an expression strangely sad and the eye could be
                  indignant and even wicked-looking. The sort of man to be fallen in love with by
                  women not above a certain scale of intellectual and moral requirement, very
                  readily—the sort of man to win warm friendships—and yet the sort of man who could
                  lose both the prizes named, occasionally, by a mis-step in which carelessness was
                  more of a component part than wrong-headedness or want of good feeling. A man
                  capable of bearing warm regard to others, at least for a certain period; and then
                  somewhat addicted to nursing the most deadly hatred, that years and opportunity
                  for revenge could scarcely satisfy. A newspaper writer of experience, a wit, an
                  incarnate fireman, and an old member of the Seventh. A<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000063"/> man who looked every inch the soldier, with his
                  erect figure and in his well-fitting military blue, with the designating mark of a
                  Captain on the shoulder and the light-infantry bugle on the front of his
                  foraging-cap. Such was "Captain Jack" (as he need only be known), on the day when
                  he touched Burtnett Haviland on the shoulder and by that simple act decided the
                  whole future course of his destiny.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Jack, is that you? I did not see you!" said the clerk, as he recognized the
                  man who had accosted him.</p>
               <p>"I saw you some minutes ago," said Captain Jack. "Got lots of friends in the
                  regiment, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"A good many," answered Haviland. "One of our clerks among the number. Hallo! I
                  did not notice—you are in uniform! Are you going?"</p>
               <p>"I should think so!" said the Captain. "Don't you see, I have got things on my
                  shoulders, and am going to carry a toasting-fork instead of a shooting-iron."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see," laughed Haviland. Then in a different tone he added. "Well, I am
                  going myself, but I have not decided where I shall enrol my name."</p>
               <p>"Going, and have not yet enrolled your name!" exclaimed the Captain. "Now then,
                  Burt, I <emph>am</emph> in luck. The very man I wanted!"</p>
               <p>"In what?" asked Haviland. "What is your number?"</p>
               <p>"Haven't the least idea what is to be our number," replied Captain Jack. "All our
                     <emph>fellows,</emph> though, are to be Number One. But see here," and he
                  pointed to an object at a very little distance—"that will show you all about
                  it."</p>
               <p>A new store was in process of erection very near the corner of the street by which
                  they were standing, and the inevitable pile of bricks had gathered in front of the
                  rising structure, to the disfigurement of the street, the vexation of passers-by,
                  and the gratis instruction of the whole population in that branch of the military
                  art which consists in the passage of any formidable obstruction thrown up by an
                  enemy. On the side-walk face of the brick fortification, rendered safe from the
                  appropriative fingers of old-paper gatherers by the planked moat which surrounded
                  it, flaunted a showy hand-bill, of which the following is a true copy, size and

               <p>"That is the idea!" said Captain Jack, when his companion had taken sufficient
                  time for the reading of the poster. "Going to have the finest body of fellows that
                  ever shouldered a musket. Been used to rows, all their lives, you know," he
                  continued, with a proper appreciation of one of the peculiar missions of the
                  Department. "And won't they fight, I should like to know?"</p>
               <p>"I should think they would," answered Haviland.</p>
               <p>"You can bet your life they will!" said the Captain, mimicking the tone and manner
                  of some of the Moseys and Sikeseys who had not then (and have not yet) quite all
                  gone out of the organization.</p>
               <p>The whole history of that ill-starred regiment is a commentary on that remark of
                  Captain Jack. It sprung into existence from a corresponding idea, and was
                  organized by a man who had peculiar facilities for managing and yet mismanaging
                  it.</p>
               <p>Some two years before, in the "weak, piping times of peace," when soldiering was a
                  holiday and display all that<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7282-00000064"/> was
                  thought of in that connection, an association of young men had been formed in
                  Chicago, with Elma (or Elmer) E. Ellsworth as their Captain, under the name of the
                  United States Zouave Cadets. Ellsworth, an enthusiastic young lawyer with much
                  versatility and little practice, had been an enthusiastic admirer of the exploits
                  of that terrible branch of the French service, the Zouaves, and their competitors,
                  the Turcos, both largely dependent for their efficiency upon their gymnastic
                  powers and their proficiency in a peculiar description of drill. He had fancied
                  that this drill could be introduced with advantage in the United States service,
                  and the Zouave Cadets formed the first embodiment of the idea. They were
                  principally composed of young business men, clerks and others, respectable in
                  character, and able to command enough of both time and money for the purposes
                  contemplated. They were subjected to almost as rigid bodily discipline as so many
                  prize-fighters preparing for the ring, liquor in any shape being forbidden, and
                  all other enervating indulgences put under ban. They commenced the practice of the
                  Zouave drill, amended and improved by Ellsworth, and after a few months became as
                  perfect in it as useless (from exhaustion and over-use of the system) for almost
                  any other occupation in life. At about the time they had thoroughly mastered the
                  drill and become the admiration of gaping thousands who flocked to their
                  exhibitions—while they could handle the rifle like a mere wand and contort
                  themselves into every impossible and unnecessary shape, they probably would not
                  have been able to stand, in actual combat, before the same number of any ordinary
                  militia in the country. But they made a splendid show, and that seemed to be all
                  that was required. At the national exhibition held at Springfield, Illinois, in
                  the summer of 1860, the Zouave Cadets took, without any pretence at successful
                  rivalry, the prize of a magnificent stand of colors offered to the corps showing
                  the greatest perfection in drill; and then their great end was achieved. They
                  became the theme of popular admiration—the very ideal of soldiers. A few months
                  later they came to the City of New York, by invitation, received the courtesies of
                  some of the State militia organizations tions, and gave some exhibitions which
                  confused the spectators as to the object of many of the peculiarities of drill,
                  quite as much as they delighted by their brilliancy of execution. Half a dozen
                  corps were at once talked of among the New York gymnasts, in emulation of the
                  Chicago success, but (fortunately or unfortunately as the case may be) none of
                  them were formed.</p>
               <p>Among the admiring spectators of the drill of the Zouave Cadets, at Springfield
                  and Chicago, in 1860, was that remarkable person who was elected to the Presidency
                  at the close of that year. He admired the drill, proportionately as he understood
                  little or nothing of it. (There had been no Zouave drill, whatever, in his Indian
                  war experience, though had he been on the opposite side in the fight, he might
                  have found something very like it.) He admired the young Captain of the Zouaves,
                  and came to the sage conclusion that the man who could do that, could do almost
                  any thing—almost "make an almanac." Accordingly, when the progress from
                  Spring-field to Washington, by way of New York, commenced (to suffer such a sudden
                  interruption at Harrisburgh), young Ellsworth, abandoning his new position of
                  Quartermaster of Northern Illinois and Paymaster of the State, was a member of his
                  suite, going proudly to make his debut on that broad stage of the whole nation,
                  which he believed so much fuller of promise than his one State. Arrived at
                  Washington, the President seemed a little puzzled to know what to do with his
                  protegé; and the wavering of intention in his mind is said to have run for a time
                  between making him Chief Clerk of the War Department, or Second Lieutenant in the
                  regular army (two posts not entirely similar), the latter being finally decided
                  upon.</p>
               <p>At this opportune moment, for Ellsworth, came the breaking out of the rebellion.
                  He had probably no ambition whatever to be a subordinate in a service in which any
                  one of a thousand other men could be as valuable as himself, while he felt that he
                  had capacities for another and widely-different command. He had courage, energy
                  and patriotism, and he believed that he could be useful in a higher charge and
                  with a corps organized and drilled after his own system. He at<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000065"/> once applied for permission to recruit a regiment
                  for active service, the Colonelcy to be conferred upon him when he succeeded in
                  that object. This permission was granted, all the loyal States lying before him,
                  "where to choose." And now came that choice which proved at once his appreciation
                  of the possession of certain qualities and his want of perception of the absence
                  of others.</p>
               <p>Col. Ellsworth did not choose New York as the place in which to raise his Zouave
                  regiment, without excellent reasons for that selection. A regiment, to be fully
                  effective, should be recruited and organized in one locality. Next, Chicago would
                  not be likely to furnish enough athletic and willing men to form a regiment with
                  the original Zouaves, even if all the latter should be as willing to fight as they
                  had once been to drill. Then, the Colonel had made many valuable acquaintances in
                  New York, during the visit of the Zouaves, and he had witnessed the bravery,
                  agility and rattling character of the New York firemen. He naturally believed that
                  the man who could walk the slippery gutter of a six-story house undaunted at
                  midnight, amid flame and smoke, with that gutter a glare of ice and the heavy pipe
                  of the engine in his hand, after dragging that engine five miles at a run,—would
                  not be likely to flinch before a battery or to break down under the fatigues of
                  the most arduous campaign. The New York firemen were the men for his purpose,
                  beyond a question. And to a certain extent he was right, for they had (as they
                  have) the twin qualities of bravery and endurance. But there were two points upon
                  which he had made no calculation or erred in his estimate—their readiness to fall
                  quickly under strict discipline, and his own fitness as the man to command and
                  develop them. These two points were to present themselves, and to be solved, in
                  the future. Just then he was high in hope and energetic in action, raising the
                  regiment which was to be the pride of the service, and upon the fighting qualities
                  of which, as we have seen, Captain Jack, not altogether in jest, was disposed to
                  "bet his life."</p>
               <p>"And you think that <emph>I</emph> am one of the men who ought to be in a fighting
                  regiment?" asked Haviland, when much less time had elapsed after Captain Jack's
                  remark than has been consumed in this episode of the Ellsworth history.</p>
               <p>"You come from a fighting State," said the Captain, who knew something of the
                  early history of the clerk. "And you have always looked to me like a man who would
                  be pleasanter as a friend than an enemy."</p>
               <p>"Thank you for your good opinion," said Haviland. "I hope and believe that I am no
                  coward. But we are all yet to be tried."</p>
               <p>"There are other qualities than mere courage that are to be tried," answered the
                  Captain. "It is the awfullest bosh in the world about people being afraid when
                  going into battle. The most nervous man in the service is likely to be the worst
                  dare-devil, after the first fire, for he gets angry soonest, at seeing the brains
                  of some one he knows, scattered all over him; and when he is once fairly mad he
                  wants holding back instead of pushing ahead."</p>
               <p>"You talk as if you had seen service," suggested the clerk. "Have you?"</p>
               <p>"Never on the land, but a little at sea," replied the Captain. "I had the honor of
                  wearing Uncle Sam's blue a little while on board the old ——, and if a man can be
                  scared anywhere under fire he can on shipboard, where he cannot run away even if
                  he has ever such a fancy for it, but must stay and take what comes. And yet I
                  never saw more than one man who showed the white feather when shot were flying,
                  and he had been made a wreck beforehand by the scurvy."</p>
               <p>"But suppose that I should wish to join the Zouaves," said Haviland, returning to
                  the subject as if his fancy had really been taken with the idea,—"would Ellsworth
                  have me? I am not a fireman."</p>
               <p>"Have you never been?" asked the Captain.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," answered the clerk, "I joined old Thirty-eight two or three years ago,
                  did a little duty with her down-town, and then backed out because I was too lazy
                  or because it kept me too much from home—I do not know which!"</p>
               <p>"Either one will do—good excuses both," said the Captain. "Meanwhile you have been
                  quite fireman enough to come<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7282-00000066"/> under the
                  rule. And now say the word, for I must get up to the Carriage-house. But stop—what
                  do you want?"</p>
               <p>"A rifle, I suppose!" said the prospective recruit, very innocently.</p>
               <p>"What!" cried the Captain. "I mean what rank will you expect? We can make you a
                  sergeant—I don't know but we can find you a Second Lieutenancy, if—"</p>
               <p>"If I wanted any such position," answered Haviland, calmly. "I do not know—I may
                  not be fit for a private, and I certainly am not fit for an officer; and whether I
                  go with this regiment or some other, I expect no position but one in the
                  ranks."</p>
               <p>Captain Jack turned short around and took such a look at the speaker as a
                  naturalist bestows upon a very rare curiosity suddenly brought to view. Then he
                  caught Haviland by the arm, whirled him round to the sun, and made a steady survey
                  of his face. At last with a prolonged "Phew!" and a "By Moses, I believe the man
                  is in earnest!" he released him.</p>
               <p>"In earnest? Certainly! Why not?" said Haviland.</p>
               <p>"Well, you are just the first man I ever saw, who did not want an office, civil or
                  military!" broke out the Captain. "Any more like you down at the store? If there
                  are, fetch them up, and I will have a regiment of my own—all privates. The worst
                  trouble we have is, that every one wants something on his shoulder, or two or
                  three stripes on his arm, and nobody is willing to go into the ranks. They remind
                  me a little, sometimes, of the Yankee militia company, in which every one wanted
                  to command and none to serve, and they had to compromise the matter by appointing
                  them all Brigadier-Generals and letting them take command week about!"</p>
               <p>Had the Captain been speaking a few weeks later, he might have quoted a still more
                  notable instance in the British Union Regiment, so auspiciously commenced and so
                  ingloriously abandoned, and of which the newspaper wits reported that there were
                  something over two hundred officers, and <emph>one private,</emph> until they
                  broke him down by over-fatiguing him at drill, and the poor fellow finally
                  perished in the cruel attempt to form him into a hollow square!</p>
               <p>But being reduced to the single jocular illustration, the Captain concluded with
                  it, and with the repeated question:</p>
               <p>"And you really are willing to go into the service as a private?"</p>
               <p>"Not only willing, but determined to do so," answered Haviland.</p>
               <p>"Will you go with <emph>me?</emph>" asked the Captain, in a tone that had lost all
                  its levity.</p>
               <p>"I will," answered the singular recruit; and that word passed, the deed was done.
                  Burtnett Haviland was not the man to give his word lightly, or to falsify it when
                  it was once given. Captain Jack, much as he might wonder at the singular fancy
                  which preferred the ranks to the place of a non-commissioned officer, or even a
                  commission,—understood the speaker well enough to be sure of his adherence to any
                  line of duty he had marked out for himself; and he merely said, as he shook him
                  warmly by the hand:</p>
               <p>"Will you come up to the Carriage-house to-night?"</p>
               <p>"No—to-morrow," answered Haviland. The Captain was gone; the singular interview
                  was terminated; and Burtnett Haviland was a Fire Zouave.</p>
               <p>It is not worth while to speculate on the reasons which really moved him to this
                  singular resolution. Enough that this is only the romance of history, and that the
                  choice was actually made under the circumstances related, though some of the
                  doubters may whistle incredulously, as did Captain Jack in the first moment of his
                  surprise. Perhaps the clerk had no other motive than the one alleged—his desire
                  not to enter upon any responsibility for which he was not thoroughly fitted.
                  Perhaps he had another and rarer feeling—an after-thought of that which he had
                  uttered to his wife in their bed-chamber,—that his sacrifice for the honor of his
                  native land would not be all that was demanded of him, if he allowed himself to
                  accept command over others and become any thing more than a mere soldier. Perhaps
                  he had a more selfish motive—a belief that the true spirit and romance of war were
                  to be found by the camp-fire and in the rough comradery of the common soldier,
                  instead of in the tent of the officer,—and that he connected himself with the Fire
                  Zouave regiment<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7282-00000067"/> ment, when the
                  suggestion was made to him, because he believed that the most splendid dash of the
                  service would be found in their midst. All these are hypotheses. He did not select
                  the place of a private, because it involved less <emph>danger</emph> than the
                  position of an officer: had that feeling possessed him, he would not have enlisted
                  at all. So much is certain—no more.</p>
               <p>At all events, it is sure that had some hundreds of others in the Union service
                  rated their own capabilities no higher than did the New York dry-goods clerk, and
                  not pressed themselves forward to Colonelcies and Brigadier-Generalships until
                  they knew at least enough of the art of war to make them respectable Sergeants or
                  Second Licutenants,—we should have wasted fewer lives, spent less hard-won wealth,
                  and been nearer to the end in view, than can now be said of the great national
                  struggle.</p>

                     LETTER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT becomes necessary at this juncture, to pay another visit to the residence of
                  the Fullertons, on East Twenty-third Street, into which an additional element of
                  interest had entered since the Sunday evening when Charles Holt paid it that
                  singular visit. That new element of interest was Kate Haviland. Saturday of the
                  following week had come, and on the evening before the young girl had reached the
                  city, two or three days behind her appointed time, on account of the death and
                  burial of poor old Amos Haviland, who now slept peacefully under the shadow of
                  that very spire whence the flag had been waving that Sunday morning. She had made
                  only a flying call of half an hour at the house of her cousin, where she romped
                  with little Pet—set Mary first to looking glum once more over the idea of her
                  husband going away at all, and then to laughing over the figure which she was sure
                  he would cut in the short jacket and baggy trousers of the Zouave—and put Sarah
                  Sanderson into an ill humor for a week by caricaturing some of the peculiar
                  friends whom that young lady had left behind her at Duffsboro. That done, she had
                  "reported for duty," as she militarily expressed it, at Mrs. Fullerton's, and
                  spent the evening in such an examination at the hands (or more properly tongues)
                  of that estimable lady and her accomplished daughter, as would have put most girls
                  of her age out of countenance as well as out of temper,—but which said
                  examination, with the arrogant instructions accompanying it, had produced
                  precisely the same injurious effect on the temper and spirits of Kate Haviland,
                  that would be achieved against the physical integrity of one of the new iron-clads
                  by bombarding it with putty pellets from a pop-gun.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fullerton, accompanied by Dora, had taken her up into the nursery and
                  school-room, thirty minutes after her arrival and before she had found time to
                  more than half swallow her light supper,—and subjected her to a series of
                  questions in grammar and geography which showed that the mother must lately have
                  been "reading up" in the children's books, and yet that she did not quite know the
                  difference between a noun and a participle, or have any very definite impression
                  whether the Cape of Good Hope did or did not project into the Bay of Fundy. This
                  duty done and the answers of the catechumen being received as satisfactory (we
                  regret to say that they were considerably more quizzical than correct, in several
                  instances)—both mother and daughter had taken a hand at catechizing her as to her
                  political sentiments, and impressing upon her the enormity of holding any belief
                  at variance with the divine right of a Virginian or a South Carolinian to ride
                  booted and spurred over the universe, and the superior sacredness of black slavery
                  over Christianity<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7282-00000068"/> as a heaven-appointed
                  institution. Mischievous and politic Kate, who really did not care one snap of her
                  nimble white finger for the whole question at issue between the abolitionists and
                  the pro-slavery zealots, however well she understood the peril of the country and
                  reprobated the wicked madness of secession,—mischievous Kate had at once realized
                  into what a nest of ignorant Southern prejudice (perhaps of secession treason) she
                  had dropped—thought for one moment of abandoning a place so uncongenial, then
                  concluded that the situation would be rather funny than otherwise, at least for a
                  time—taken her cue and made her responses accordingly.</p>
               <p>When asked by Mrs. Fullerton whether she had ever been in the South and seen any
                  of the dear happy negroes in loving attendance on the proprietors who took such
                  tender care of them—she had replied at once that she was born among slaves, in one
                  of the Middle States that had not yet quite abolished the institution; and she had
                  improvised for the occasion a dear old black nurse who had carried her in her arms
                  and held a good deal more of her love than her own father and mother. When
                  interrogated by the same lady as to what she knew of Hinton Rowan Helper's
                  "Impending Crisis," that book falser than Munchausen and more injurious than the
                  "Age of Reason" (such were the lady's words)—she had replied with an inquiry
                  whether it was a novel or a recipe-book—a query quite re-assuring to the
                  catechist. When Dora put in a question as to her reading of the
                     <title>Tribune,</title> she had had no scruples of conscience whatever against
                  saying that she never opened that sheet, unless she wanted wrapping-paper or
                  something to light a fire. And when the same energetic young lady inquired of her
                  whether she had ever read "Uncle Tom's Cabin" which she further characterized,
                  parenthetically, as "a mess of ridiculous stuff, proving that the writer had never
                  been in the South for a single day,"—the reply of Kate (who had really wasted two
                  days and nights in reading and crying over that most effective piece of
                  unscrupulous imagination set down for reality), had been that she once found the
                  book lying on the window-sill, read two pages of it and then threw both volumes
                  into the mud-gutter. It remains to be seen what entry the recording angel had made
                  against the late country school-mistress for these atrocious departures from
                  veracity: she had not herself felt any the worse after them, and they had answered
                  the purpose of putting two very anxious ladies into such beatific satisfaction
                  that they would sleep like humming-tops.</p>
               <p>This catechism concluded and all the replies found eminently satisfactory, the
                  dignified lady had condescended to explain to her new dependant the reasons why
                  she was so searching in her inquiries. She wished it to be understood, she said,
                  that her family were none of the miserable <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >canaille</foreign> (she did not use that word, but another much rougher and
                  signifying very nearly the same thing) of the North, and she could not under any
                  circumstances permit the tender minds of her young children to be tainted with
                  disgraceful principles that might afterwards need to be eradicated at the cost of
                  severe suffering. Her family was wealthy, as every one understood, and she was
                  willing to pay the governess liberally for any services rendered; but she must be
                  allowed to designate precisely what those services should be, and she must insist
                  upon unquestioning obedience to her requirements. To which she added that the poor
                  dear children were not cart-horses, and must not be overworked or ill-treated, but
                  dealt with as became their birth and station. To which Dora added,
                  parenthetically, that if those children were not kept in better order than they
                  had been by the former governess, and made to pay more attention to their lessons,
                  there would be occasion for a very hasty settlement some morning, which she hoped
                  that Miss Haviland (toss of the head accompanying the polite prefix) would wish to
                  avoid.</p>
               <p>Did there exist any one else in the world, we wonder, of the age and tastes of
                  Kate Haviland, who, seeing and hearing all this and learning what was the
                  atmosphere of the household she had entered, would not have fled from it as from a
                  pestilence—even kilted her skirts and rushed away through the dusk, before
                  sleeping one night in an air so uncongenial and threatening? Perhaps not; but as
                  for Kate Haviland, her only comment on the increasingly-pleasant<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000069"/> developments of character had been a mental one,
                  shaped into words something like the following:</p>
               <p>"A nice, pleasant family, I fancy! And won't I have a nice time among you! But
                  won't there be fun, one of these days, and won't you have a nice time of it with
                     <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Her reply to the injunctions of the respectable and dignified matron and her
                  daughter had not been by any means a lengthy or circumlocutious one, but one which
                  some of us have erewhile known to throw a gabbling termagant into worse rage than
                  could have been induced by applying to her half the hard words in the language.
                  Sweeping all the injunctions and all the insinuations up into one imposing heap,
                  Kate had recognized, accepted and crowned the grand total by the utterance of the
                  comprehensive assent:</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am!"</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. Fullerton and her daughter, informing her that she would not be required
                  to assume any charge over her pupils until the following day, that they had
                  already retired and could not be seen that night, and that by following the
                  servant she would find her sleeping-room,—had swept away. Kate had heeded the
                  injunction, found a neat-enough little room on the third floor fitted up for her
                  reception, and found—not the repose of the innocent, for had she not been telling
                  terrible fibs?—but the rest of a young girl remarkably easy in her own conscience,
                  remarkably careless of some things that would have been great vexations to others,
                  and altogether bored, bothered and sleepy.</p>
               <p>The morning had introduced her to her charges, Myra and Mildred, and opened to her
                  one more new chapter in experience. She had found Myra a tall, awkward girl of
                  eleven, with Dora's light hair and dark eyes, and the promise of being very like
                  her, both in good looks and arrogance, when she grew older. Mildred she had found
                  a plumper and browner child of nine, with hair darker and a little more decided in
                  its wave, less arrogance, more affection, more pertness and mischief, and every
                  indication of being quite as much trouble to manage, as the other. She had found
                  both hopelessly and wretchedly ignorant, whether from the incapacity of the person
                  who preceded her (the children had been too precious, all the while, and their
                  blood too much distinguished above that of ordinary mortals, to go either to a
                  public or even a private school)—or the fact that the family arrangements made
                  teaching them impossible. The mother had been too busy with her own plans and
                  projects, and Dora too much removed from sympathy with them by difference of age
                  (the children were, in point of fact, a sort of unexpected second crop on the
                  Fullerton clover-field)—that neither had paid them any attention except to
                  "humor," scold and slap—three very necessary operations, no doubt, in family
                  management, but scarcely enough without other accompaniments. They had been
                  smattered with (no other word than this new one will express the fact) in the
                  primary branches, in grammar, geography, history, philosophy, and even in French,
                  without acquiring enough solid knowledge to be able to write one line intelligibly
                  or add three figures correctly. Kate Haviland, bringing them with her into the
                  little school-room in the morning (a back apartment on the third floor, plainly
                  carpeted, with walnut furniture, two writing desks, a small case for school-books
                  and a map of the United States on the wall)—had seated the little people in the
                  best manner that a total unwillingness to obey permitted, attempted to put them
                  through their educational paces, found the state of affairs as before indicated,
                  and discovered, within fifteen minutes, that any further attempt at enlightening
                  their minds would be labor worse than wasted, until she could succeed in acquiring
                  some kind of personal influence, whether of love, respect or fear, over them.</p>
               <p>To this end, dropping the grammar with which she had been muddling their
                  unregulated brains while vexing her own, just at the moment when we have occasion
                  again to enter unbidden into the Fullerton abode, she dropped suddenly from her
                  chair into a sitting position on the carpet, drew one of the children down on each
                  side of her, and commenced to teach a primary school in <emph>her</emph>
                  manner.</p>
               <p>"Shall I tell you a story, girls, instead of bothering with those dreadful old
                  books?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes, tell us a story?" shouted little Mildred, enough of the child, as
                  yet, to be fond of hearing personal<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7282-00000070"/>
                  narrations, though old enough to have a shrewd suspicion, all the while, that most
                  of them were unadulterated fibs. "Yes, tell us a story!"</p>
               <p>"Once upon a time, then," began the model school-mistress, her wealth of chestnut
                  hair half down about her ears, her handsome face all aglow with mingled mischief
                  and the desire of pleasing and winning the children, each arm around the waist of
                  a pupil, and her body rocking them and herself backward and forward after a
                  fashion that no natural school-girl will need to have explained—"once upon a time
                  there was a man who had two children. They were both girls, very pretty, and about
                  the age of little Myra and Mildred—"</p>
               <p>"That's <emph>us!</emph>" put in Mildred, displaying her early grammar in what Sam
                  Weller would have called the "obserwation."</p>
               <p>"—They were about the age of little Myra and Mildred," the teacher went on, "and I
                  don't know but they may have looked a little like two girls who have those very
                  pretty names. Well, one day there came a nice-looking lady into the garden where
                  they were playing, and showed them a box full of gold and jewels, that she would
                  give them if they would take a number of pretty books that she had in a little
                  satchel, and learn them all by heart."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jeminy!" cried little Mildred, again. "Wouldn't <emph>I</emph> have read the
                  books, though, if I could get lots of gold and di'mond jewels by doin' it!
                  Wouldn't you, Myra?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," answered that very upright young lady of eleven, who had not, so
                  far, been at all captivated. "Never mind <emph>her</emph>—go on, if you are going
                  to tell the story!" This to Kate, and with an air of command which would not badly
                  have become the dignified head of the establishment. The subject of the peremptory
                  order took a glance at her, smiled without being observed by either of the
                  children, and went on:</p>
               <p>"—If they studied the books and learned all their lessons, they were not only to
                  have the gold and jewels, but be allowed to put them on and go out into a
                  beautiful grove where there were brooks of clear water, and the birds singing ing,
                  and the sunshine on the grass, and the trees waving, and every thing that was
                  pleasant and beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jeminy!" again cried Mildred, who seemed to have adopted that as her standard
                  adjuration. "Wouldn't <emph>that</emph> have been nice! Now I know that I should
                  have read the books—or made believe I had read them!" and here the nature so early
                  warped peeped out in the most melancholy manner possible to conceive. Deception in
                  people of older years is terrible, and falsehood indefensible except under
                  circumstances that change the very nature of the act. But in the young it is
                  simply heart-sickening—the most un-natural thing in all nature. Innate depravity
                  is an injurious humbug: the little ones come to us from the hand of God, with the
                  gloss of the early leaves and the fragrance of the blossoms—so nearly pure that of
                  themselves they will never develop serious evil or wanton falsehood. They have the
                     <emph>latent capabilities</emph> for evil; and these, which could no more
                  spring up and grow and bear fruit than the seed in the ground could do, without
                  air and sunshine—these we of older years develop in them. Every broken promise
                  made by a mother to her child—every punishment threatened, or reward offered, by a
                  father, and never fulfilled—is something to develop this most forward of the evil
                  germs, falsehood. Think of it, fathers and mothers, when you make promises to your
                  children that you never intend to fulfil, or utter in their presence what they
                  must know to be falsehoods!—think of it; and if the day should come when the
                  daughter of your love refuses to bestow her confidence upon you, deceives you, and
                  starts upon some dangerous course with your hand made powerless to restrain
                  her,—or if the son of your pride makes his life, his hopes and his troubles a
                  secret from you, so that you can hold no steadying hand over the first tottering
                  steps of his career in the world,—know that you are reaping what you have sown in
                  the promises broken and the shallow deceptions practised towards imitative
                  childhood!</p>
               <p>All this because little Mildred indicated that she might possibly have deceived
                  the pretty lady as to her learning the lessons set her! Yes, all this, and yet not
                  too much upon a subject which concerns every father and mother in the universe<pb

               <p>However this discovery of the Fullerton code of morals may have shocked Kate
                  Haviland and given her an additional insight into the labor which would be
                  required to make those young people any thing more than intellectual savages, it
                  did not seriously interrupt her story. She went on:</p>
               <p>—"If they didn't study their lessons and learn what the pretty lady had told them
                  to learn, they were not to have any of the gold or jewels, or to go out into the
                  beautiful grove at all, and a big black man—oh, so big and black, was to come and
                  carry them away into a great dark pit, and—"</p>
               <p>How this interesting story would eventually have ended, and how the young
                  school-teacher might have gone on to explain, after a while, that the pretty lady
                  was Knowledge, the gold and jewels the blessings of Intelligence, the beautiful
                  grove the World to those capable of enjoying it, the black man Ignorance, and the
                  dark pit the blindness and misery of the untaught,—how all this might, could,
                  would or should have occurred (to borrow a little of the teacher's own phraseology
                  in the study of grammar)—will probably never be known. There <emph>was</emph> an
                  interruption, a little more effectual than that of a moment previous; for at this
                  stage of the proceedings the dignified Myra, who had not indulged in many
                  criticisms on the story, caught the name of the big black man, and fancied that
                  she had made a terrible discovery, which she signified by exclaiming, very loudly
                  and decisively:</p>
               <p>"I don't believe a word of it! It is a nasty, black Abolition lie!"</p>
               <p>There is no intention whatever on the part of the writer, to depict an angelic
                  character in Kate Haviland, a real personage—no saint, certainly, but a very nice
                  little sinner! Had such been the intention, her fibs of the night before would
                  have been carefully kept from view. She was a merry, rattling, wide-awake (to use
                  another slight vulgarism) and whole-hearted girl, capable of a great deal of good
                  and a small proportion of evil, but <emph>very human,</emph> as <emph>Lady Alice
                     Hawthorne</emph> exclaims when the kiss she has been expecting seems to linger
                  on its way. She had temper—plenty of it; and determination—as those may be made
                  aware who do her the justice to follow out her career. The only difference between
                  this young lady and many others who seem to be half the time angry and the other
                  half unhappy, while she enjoyed life with the same zest which is supposed to
                  tingle through a harp-string,—is that she kept her temper for great occasions and
                  was sunny and full of enjoyment the rest of the time, while they fritter away
                  their angry force in continued little driblets of ill-nature. On the present
                  occasion, one drop too much of the Fullerton gall had been suddenly poured into
                  her cup.</p>
               <p>"Do you say that to <emph>me,</emph> you minx!" were all the words uttered; but
                  her two hands, small enough but by no means powerless, caught the offending hoyden
                  by the two shoulders, and in the space of twenty seconds she received such a
                  shaking as set her teeth chattering, her breath coming short, her eyes full of
                  angry tears, and herself very nearly tumbling out of her clothes! It is just
                  possible that the young teacher, who seldom applied either hand or rod in the way
                  of correction, had before practised the same punishment on some refractory boy at
                  her little school in the country, and found it very effectual; for she seemed to
                  shake with a will. The child thought so, and under the impression that she might
                  possibly be shaken to death before the operation closed, concluded to submit (at
                  least for the time), and whimpered out, as well as the shaking would allow:—</p>
               <p>"Please—don't—shake me—so—and—I won't—say—so-o-o—again!"</p>
               <p>But little Mildred, who was generally in a fight or a quarrel with her sister, did
                  not wish to see her harshly treated by any one else, and blurted out:—</p>
               <p>"You nasty thing! I'll tell my mother!"</p>
               <p>There might have been a corresponding shaking in store for Miss Mildred, for the
                  governess was not at all likely to<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7282-00000072"/>
                  mince matters when she had commenced; but at that moment another interruption in
                  the programme occurred.</p>
               <p>About an hour previous to the time of this occurrence, Mr. Ned Minthorne,
                  millionaire and noodle, walking his morning rounds of inanity, called at the
                  Fullertons' as he seldom failed to do during some hour of the twenty-four, every
                  day when he was in town. He found Mrs. Fullerton just sealing in a large envelope
                  a letter which had an inner directed envelope around it. Mrs. Fullerton seemed to
                  color, became flustered a little, then accepted the situation and threw off all
                  embarrassment. Why should she be embarrassed, in fact, before a person so low in
                  mental calibre as Ned Minthorne, and one who lay so completely under the thumbs of
                  herself and daughter? At last her daughter and herself held a moment of whispered
                  conversation (excellent treatment of the morning visitor!) and then the mother
                  somewhat hesitatingly opened a conversation which may be stated as follows:—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Minthorne, my daughter and myself have concluded to make a confidant of
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Very much obliged, madam, I am sure," answered Minthorne, in his own feeble way,
                  apparently very little enlightened and not much enraptured by this striking proof
                  of personal esteem.</p>
               <p>"Pray be seated," said Mrs. Fullerton, indicating a chair. The visitor took one,
                  and the lady another, while Miss Dora, who affected soft seats, dropped upon the
                  sofa as usual.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps <emph>you</emph> had rather speak to Mr. Minthorne, my dear?" said the
                  mother, inquiringly, when this arrangement for personal comfort was concluded.</p>
               <p>"No—speak to him yourself," answered the daughter, not too respectfully, and as if
                  the whole thing bored her a little.</p>
               <p>"Very well, my dear," said the mother. "Mr. Minthorne, you have now been for so
                  long a time a frequent visitor at this house, that you cannot be ignorant of our
                  position or sentiments."</p>
               <p>Mr. Ned Minthorne would have done no violence to the truth by saying that if he
                  did not know the sentiments of that particular family, on almost every subject,
                  the ignorance must be his own fault, as he had had all the possible variations
                  tions scolded, whined or wept into him, first and last. He said nothing of this
                  kind, however (how could he—the gilded calf—the nobody?) and merely replied, in
                  the most natural (fool?) manner in the world, that "he hoped he was not a
                  stranger—that was—to the feelings and sentiments of Mrs. Fullerton and her
                  estimable daughter—she knew."</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to find that you understand us so well," said Mrs. Fullerton, with
                  a permissible bridling at the complimentary word. "That will make every thing
                  easier. Among other things you understand, sir, of course, that my daughter and
                  myself are entirely Southern in feeling?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Minthorne, who might have made the same energetic statement that he did know
                  that interesting fact, merely assented in a manner quite as satisfactorily vacuous
                  as he had shown in his reply to the previous question.</p>
               <p>"We have extensive property in the South," the lady went on to say, "and of course
                  our interests lie there. The abolitionists have brought on a war against South
                  Carolina and the other Southern republics,<ref rend="super" target="#note_007"
                     xml:id="return_007">*</ref>
                   and of course poor weak women like my daughter and myself can do nothing
                  to stop it; but we can feel, sir, <emph>feel!</emph> Men of your family and
                  position feel with us, the disgrace of this abolition outrage;<ref rend="super"

                   and they <emph>ought</emph> to assist us in doing what little we can do to
                  revenge it. I mean," and here the lady flushed a little, again, and corrected
                  herself—"I mean that they should do nothing to help carry out the schemes of the
                  abolitionists. Do you not think so?"</p>

                     often, the fault does not lie with the writer. The ultra pro-slavery South
                     has had no other adjective, except the corresponding one, "incendiary," for
                     many a long year, fit to apply to any man or any measure not especially
                     pledged to keep all the offices in the hands of the fire-eaters. And the

               <p>"Certainly, madam," was the reply of the millionaire, who, if he had not brains
                  enough to understand the whole drift of the "Southern matron's" remarks, could at
                  least take in and answer the last simple question.</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7282-00000073"/>
               <p>"We have property down in Alabama, not far from Montgomery," continued Mrs.
                  Fullerton, "and in order that it may not be confiscated, it is necessary
                  that—that—my lawyer and myself should hold a little intercourse with people in
                  that neighborhood. That is right and natural, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly right and natural," answered the millionaire, almost as sententiously
                  (because the words were already set for him) as if he had been a man of ordinary
                  common sense!</p>
               <p>"They tell me that by the Baboon's proclamation" (this was the name by which the
                  Southern lady dignified the President of the United States)—"it is against the law
                  to hold any communication whatever with those States which belong to the—which
                  have, that is, seceded. Now is not that hard? I ask you, Mr. Minthorne, as a
                  friend of my family," and here she glanced over to the sofa, where the fine form
                  of Dora was artistically displayed, as if she regarded her as the all-sufficient
                  attraction and the millionaire as something more than a mere "friend of the
                  family,"—"I ask you if that is not hard, and wrong?"</p>
               <p>The lady's voice was broken, and if there were no tears in her eyes, there was
                  certainly an appearance that they could be called there with very little effort,
                  when she contemplated the bitter injustice of the government and the peril of her
                  property "near Montgomery"; and it is no marvel that Ned Minthorne, ninny as he
                  was, raised sufficient spunk to say, without half so much drawl as usual in his
                  tone, and even bringing his hand down on his knee with a slap that must have
                  tingled, as he spoke:</p>
               <p>"Madam, the man that would keep you and your daughter from Montgomery—that is—I
                  mean from your property there,—ought to be—I can't say exactly, but—I don't know
                     <emph>what</emph> ought to be done with him!"</p>
               <p>The mother accepted the sympathy, and the daughter, by this time curled up on the
                  sofa in what is sometimes designated as a "kittenish" way (beware of the claws of
                  people, especially female people, who assume the ways of the kitten!)—even she
                  deigned to bestow a look upon her faithful adorer, congratulating herself on the
                  fact that he was not quite an absolute nobody, after all, even if he had been born
                  in the North and born a fool.</p>
               <p>"I see that you fully understand and appreciate our position," said the lady, "and
                  so I can have no delicacy about speaking the rest of my mind to you. Every few
                  days I have papers to send down, from—from my lawyer, to——"</p>
               <p>"Tut, tut! Confound it! I knew who your lawyer was not long ago. Let me see—what
                  is his name?" inquired Minthorne, corrugating his brows in a terrible effort to
                  remember, and yet with something in his tone that the matron did not altogether
                  like. She took one long, keen glance at him from under her brows, but saw nothing
                  to awaken any more unpleasant impression,—before she replied:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. ——," and she mentioned a name that could not have been found in the Legal
                  Directory for 1861, one whit more than it could to-day. But Minthorne, the
                  do-nothing, was not likely to know much about the names of all the lawyers in New
                  York City; and so what was the difference?</p>
               <p>"Ah, oh, yes, I remember," was the satisfactorily stupid reply of the man who had
                  had the wrinkles in his brow.</p>
               <p>"As I was going to say," the lady went on, apparently not over well pleased at the
                  interruption, after all,—"I have some papers to send down every few days, and they
                  are taking so much pains to stop every thing and watch everybody, and there is so
                  much trouble along the railroads" (they had begun to burn bridges at Big
                  Gunpowder) "that really I do not know, sometimes, how I can get any through at
                  all. And this was what I wanted to consult you about. Here is a little package of
                  law papers, that I am <emph>very</emph> anxious to get down at once, and I really
                  do not know how to send them. Would it be putting you to too much trouble, if I
                  should ask you to get some friend of yours who is going to Washington, to take
                  this, and allow no one to see it, and leave it at the address there? It can easily
                  enough get down, I believe, from Washington."</p>
               <p>"Of course not—certainly not—I will see that it is delivered by some one of my
                  friends going down—that is, if I do not go down myself. A fellow wants to see all
                  that is going on, you know and I may go down myself to-morrow," answered<pb
                     n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7282-00000074"/> swered the noodle, taking the large
                  letter and sticking it into his skirt pocket without even troubling himself about
                  the address; and his whole manner falling, in the speech, into such a very near
                  approach to idiocy, that Dora Fullerton looked at him once more from her place on
                  the sofa, and wondered how she could have held a particle of even temporary
                  respect for him a few moments before—he was such an absolute, unmitigated,
                  irredeemable golden calf.</p>
               <p>A few moments later, after saluting the mistress of the establishment with that
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement</foreign> which was so eminently her due,
                  and kissing the hand of Miss Dora, who received the homage with what she regarded
                  as the native dignity of a queen—Ned Minthorne left the house, perhaps to look for
                  the friend who was to carry Mrs. Fullerton's law papers to Washington on their way
                  to Montgomery, perhaps to arrange for going himself, perhaps merely to kill a
                  little more time before strolling homeward to lunch.</p>
               <p>And yet it was Ned Minthorne who tapped a few minutes later at the door of the
                  little school-room, and who opened it the moment after he had done so, just in
                  time to effect a diversion in favor of the offending rebel children, and perhaps
                  to prevent such a family row as might have obliged the young school-teacher to
                  leave her employment and deprived this narration of some of its most instructive
                  incidents.</p>
               <p>The next thing in order is to inquire how he came there, and how he, who had but a
                  little while before left the Fullerton mansion for the day, should now have been
                  tapping at the door of the school-room. Was there an unsuspected acquaintance
                  between the millionaire and the governess, and did the former, when he had
                  concluded his call upon the members of the family proper and pretended to leave
                  the house, really make a mere transfer of himself from the parlor to the
                  school-room? Not yet—that is, certainly not; for the double reason that of course
                  Kate Haviland could not have been brought to consent to any thing so improper and
                  deceptive,—and that (perhaps the latter is the better reason of the two) the
                  millionaire and the young teacher had never seen each other No—the mechanical
                  construction of Mr. Ned Minthorne's clothes was at fault. Pardon the remark, that
                  is so regretfully fully made in the interest of truth and patience, all the
                  extensive manufacturers of that indispensable article known as the
                  sewing-machine,—but we have never understood the full meaning of that gross modern
                  vulgarism "let her rip!" until instructed by this great invention. Many and
                  various of our friends left partially denuded in the street, at times when the
                  highest sartorial perfection was desirable, by the giving away of seams that
                  should have been enduring as those of a seventy-four riding out a hurricane, and
                  others leaving portions of their garments behind them when the whole would
                  naturally have been considered better than a part,—induce this side-reflection,
                  which is not by any means intended to undervalue the little brownie without which
                  the labors of the tailor and the sempstress would no longer be sufficient to
                  clothe an overcrowded world. Ned Minthorne, wearing the best, the newest and the
                  most fashionable garments known to Broadway, was still not removed above the
                  accidents and infirmities inseparable from wearing any clothes whatever. He had
                  his little infirmities, too, one of which was attachment to an occasional coat
                  which fitted him more perfectly than any of the many others in his possession; and
                  in the event of such a treasure being discovered, he sometimes clung to the
                  favorite garment for days in succession without having the tailor look after the
                  seams.</p>
               <p>Such a reckless course could only bring trouble, eventually, as it did on this
                  occasion. On the morning of the interview with Mrs. Fullerton and her daughter,
                  Mr. Minthorne unfortunately wore one of his pet coats, not less than two weeks in
                  wear and unexamined as to the state of its seams from the day when it came from
                  under the ferruginous and calorific "goose." One of his skirt pockets, without his
                  being aware of the fact, had just yielded its flimsy pretence of sewing—<foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Anglice,</foreign> "ripped"; to that pocket he confided the
                  missive entrusted to him by Mrs. Fullerton; and the consequence was that before he
                  had passed ten steps through the hall on his way to the door, the precious missive
                  tumbled out on the floor and all the "law papers" connected with the estimable
                  lady's "property near Montgomery" were placed at the mercy of any unscrupulous
                  person who happened to pass.</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7282-00000075"/>
               <p>The first "unscrupulous person" chanced to be Kate Haviland, who trod upon the
                  packet as she came up from her late breakfast, on her way to the school-room,
                  immediately previous to the occurrences there which have already been detailed.
                  She saw that it was a letter of considerable size, which had evidently been
                  dropped by accident; and she would at once have thrown it in upon the mantel of
                  the parlor near which it lay, but being an unmitigated daughter of Eve she
                  naturally glanced at the direction, and then—why then she paused and thought a
                  little. She had very keen, quick young eyes, the paper of the outer envelope was
                  unfortunately thin, and pressing it close with her finger as she read the
                  direction: "Mr. Lionel Taylor, No. —— F. Street, Washington, D. C."—she saw, or
                  thought she saw, shining through the paper, another direction very like—she could
                  not make out what the name was, though something like "Walker" or "Walters," as it
                  was partially covered by the outer name; but the direction below happened not to
                  be opposite the other lines on the outside, and was certainly like "Montgomery,
                  Alabama, Confederate States of America."</p>
               <p>It has been said that the young girl thought "a little." Perhaps that word does
                  not properly indicate the rapid action of her mind. She thought, as some of the
                  graphic story-tellers used to say of sensations when one of them had been up a
                  tree, the branch breaking and a bear waiting at the bottom,—"a good deal in a
                  little while." Union to the heart's core, she was not by any means ignorant of the
                  national daily movements and the rules set by the Government for those who meant
                  to show themselves good citizens. Here was indeed matter for thought. The people
                  of the house Southern by birth and education, and boasting of sentiments very
                  nearly approaching secession—a letter under cover to some man in Washington, and
                  really intended for Montgomery, the Capital of the Seceded States, in spite of the
                  prohibition against any intercourse—was there not indeed ground for thought and
                  suspicion? Kate Haviland thought so, as she resolved her own course for the
                  present by thrusting the package into the large pocket of her dark delaine, under
                  the coquettish bordered white apron which she was going to wear in the
                  school-room, and muttered, not loud enough for any one to hear except those
                  recording intelligences who had already in all probability set down so heavy an
                  account against her in their inaccessible day-books:—</p>
               <p>"If I do not smell a very large mice here, then I have no nose! And if anybody
                  down at Montgomery, Alabama, gets this letter before I satisfy myself whether it
                  does not contain a lot of treasonable information for the rebels, I hope they will
                  let me know!"</p>
               <p>Whereupon the young lady betook herself to the upper room and her duties as
                  teacher, as we have seen—apparently forgetting that she had made her delaine a
                  temporary post-office, or that there was such a thing in the world as a suspicious
                  letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ned Minthorne, at first blissfully ignorant of the loss of correspondence
                  sustained, did not long remain so. He had not been absent from the house more than
                  ten minutes, when the bouquet of a neglected ash-box saluted his nasal organ,
                  agitating his physical system to a fearful degree and throwing him completely off
                  his mental balance. At once his hand went into his pocket, in search of the
                  perfumed handkerchief which was to enable him to pass the abomination without
                  fainting, and in a moment thereafter he became conscious of the loss which he (or
                  some one else) had sustained. The letter was gone—good gracious! And Mrs.
                  Fullerton's "property near Montgomery"—good gracious again!—what would become of
                  it? The millionaire noodle seemed to have some idea of the reparation of damages,
                  for he commenced retracing his steps, as nearly as he could remember, looking down
                  at the ground all the while, as closely as if he had dropped a cambric needle
                  instead of a package that could be seen for half a block. Judging from the
                  previous intercourse between the lady who intended to be his mother-in-law, and
                  himself, and the mental relation which seemed to have been established—it could
                  only have been the desire to keep on good terms with the lady and her daughter
                  which made Mr. Ned Minthorne so anxious to recover the lost packet; and yet the
                  words which he muttered<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7282-00000076"/> immediately
                  after discovering the loss did not seem to bear out that idea:—</p>
               <p>"Confound this ripped pocket! The old lady will rip quite as badly as the pocket,
                  though, and that is some comfort! What a fool I was—so anxious to get it and get
                  away, that I did not even look at the direction; and now if some fool should have
                  picked it up and carried it off to the Post-office, what a splendid chance is
                  lost!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Ned Minthorne, though treading over every foot of sidewalk with such religious
                  inspection, found nothing of the missing object. He reached the house, ran up the
                  steps and rang the bell again. Possibly he might have dropped it before he had
                  left the house, instead of after. The servant who again admitted him knew him too
                  well to say a word, when not questioned; and as he was confident that if he did
                  not find the packet he should at least find the senders in some one of the rooms,
                  he asked her nothing and she disappeared once more into the subterranean regions.
                  He stepped into the lower parlors—no one was there; the ladies had evidently not
                  yet come down-stairs from the room where he had left them. He ascended the stairs,
                  looking carefully for the letter all the while, and entered the front room before
                  described, and where the interview of that morning had taken place No one there,
                  either: the ladies had flitted again. (The fact was, that they had both left the
                  house, in different directions, within two minutes of his own departure; but this
                  he could not know.) As a very intimate friend of the family, licensed to go
                  anywhere, he had no delicacy about running up and down stairs as much as he
                  pleased; and as he knew that Dora sometimes went up to the rooms on the third
                  floor, when she wished to be peculiarly sulky and exclusive, he proceeded in that
                  direction. As he passed the door of the little school-room, towards one of the
                  other chambers, he heard voices within. There were the ladies, beyond a doubt. So
                  he tapped at the door, then fancied that he might have missed the response made,
                  and opened it, to find the young school-teacher and her pupils in the situation
                  described several pages back.</p>
               <p>In spite of his want of sense, the millionaire must have had some eye for beauty
                  and the picturesque, for he seemed to be enough struck with surprise and interest
                  at the picture of the young girl seated on the floor with her two pupils beside
                  her, to look on them in silence for at least a minute. During that time Miss Myra,
                  who, under a new excitement, instantly recovered from the effects of her shaking,
                  found tongue to say, loud enough for the gentleman to hear if he had been
                  listening very intently:</p>
               <p>"That's Ned Minthorne."</p>
               <p>To which Miss Mildred added, as if aware that such an introduction could not be
                  half compendious enough for a total stranger like their new teacher:</p>
               <p>"Ned Minthorne's courtin' my sister Dora, and is going to marry her."</p>
               <p>Whether Ned Minthorne heard these explanatory remarks, or not, is a matter of no
                  consequence. However questionable their source or the breeding they displayed,
                  they opened quite an interesting new page to Kate Haviland. She liked to know
                  people as quickly as possible, without being half as anxious that they should form
                  the same ready estimate of <emph>her.</emph> The self-sufficient young lady was
                  engaged to be married, then, or something equivalent to engaged, to the rather
                  handsome and aristocratic but <emph>weak</emph> looking person standing in the
                  door. Her surprise, meanwhile, passed away a little sooner than that of the
                  millionaire; and she made no motion to rise, nor gave any indication that she did
                  not consider her position the most dignified possible, as she looked the intruder
                  steadily in the face, and said inquiringly:</p>
               <p>"Well, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I really beg your pardon," answered the intruder, still holding fast of the door.
                  "My name is Minthorne. You do not know me, of course."</p>
               <p>"Yes she does, though!" put in Miss Mildred.</p>
               <p>"I have not previously had that pleasure," replied the young teacher, with much
                  dignity in her words but a mischievous smile on lips the beauty of which Ned
                  Minthorne was not fool enough quite to ignore.</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to intrude," continued the millionaire.</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7282-00000077"/>
               <p>"My name is Minthorne, as I said, and I would not do that sort of thing, you
                  know."</p>
               <p>"What a fool it is!" mentally commented Kate Haviland, struck with the evident
                  weakness of manner.</p>
               <p>"I was looking for Mrs. Fullerton, or Miss Dora, and thought that—that is—perhaps
                  one of them might have been in this room. I heard somebody speaking here."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Fullerton and her daughter have both just left the house, to make some
                  morning calls, I believe," answered the teacher, with a conclusive tone in the
                  remark which indicated: "Be kind enough to follow them, or at least shut the door
                  and go away." Ned Minthorne did not take the hint, if a hint was intended. He
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry. I did not know but one of the ladies, might have —— you have not
                  happened to see such a thing as a letter lying about, this morning—within the last
                  half hour—anywhere—have you? Excuse my asking, but the letter is of some
                  consequence to me, you know."</p>
               <p>"Oho!" said the young girl to herself. "Here is the writer of the letter, then,
                  and the Fullertons may not be concerned, after all!" Then followed the
                  instantaneous reflection: "But the danger of the document may not be the less to
                  the country, and I <emph>won't</emph> give it up until I know more about it—see if
                  I do!" What she said aloud, and in response to the inquiry, was: "No—I have just
                  come to the house, sir, and know nothing whatever about any letters."</p>
               <p>"Yes she does, though! She has got one in her pocket now—a big one! See!" Without
                  Kate being aware of the fact, the letter had worked up in her pocket, as she moved
                  in rocking herself backward and forward; Myra sat on the right side of her and had
                  caught a glimpse of the end beyond the pocket; and before the young teacher could
                  have a thought of what was about to occur, that young female reprobate had made a
                  grasp at it, caught it from the sheltering apron, and waved it in the air, before
                  the astonished eyes of the millionaire, with that triumphant exclamation!</p>
               <p>Here was a situation! To say that Kate Haviland did not flush blood-red at the
                  humiliating position of being caught in a rank falsehood by a stranger, in the
                  presence of her two pupils, and one of them the means of her detection—would be to
                  record an absolute impossibility. Hatred of the young wretch who had betrayed
                  her—shame at the detection—doubt whether she had not indeed done something very
                  wrong and disgraceful, without intending it—all surged through her mind, with that
                  much greater rapidity than any ever achieved by the favorite "lightning"—the speed
                  of <emph>thought.</emph> All the blood in her body seemed concentrated in her face
                  and head; there was fire in her eyes and a singing sensation in her ears. Great
                  heaven!—to what humiliation had she not subjected herself, even on the first day
                  of her residence in that house!—and would not death on the spot be preferable to
                  any other fate which could befall her? And yet through all this there ran a
                  consciousness that she had not intended to commit either a crime or a
                  meanness—that she had acted from what she believed to be the highest and noblest
                  of motives. No!—she would <emph>not</emph> break down beneath the shame of the
                  situation!—she <emph>would</emph> force back that rebellious blood!—she
                     <emph>would</emph> maintain the propriety of what she had done, even though
                  that effort was to be made in the face of an obvious fool, (the very worst sort of
                  person in the world to impress or convince), and though the next minute might
                  necessitate her leaving the house and her employment that very day.</p>
               <p>It has before been intimated that for Kate Haviland to will was to do. When she
                  said that the rebellious blood should flow back, the rebellious blood better knew
                  its fate than some other rebellious forces seem to do, and went back at once. Her
                  face was nearly as white, though not quite so calm, as usual, before Ned Minthorne
                  recovered breath from his surprise, to say, starting forward a little way from the
                  still-open door:</p>
               <p>"Why, that is my letter, now, you know! What does this mean—Miss—Miss—what the
                  deuce <emph>is</emph> your name?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Haviland!" answered the young girl, springing up from the floor, at
                  this juncture, with an alacrity which nearly sent the two children, who had been
                  sitting partially on her skirts; sprawling against the two sides of the little
                  room. There was no shame in her face, now, nor was there<pb n="168-169"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000078"/> any approach to that merriment which usually flowed
                  so easily into her dimpled cheek and cherry lips. Its expression was strong,
                  earnest, womanly determination; and Ned Minthorne saw it, as she advanced to where
                  he was standing, near the door, and asked:—</p>
               <p>"You say this is your letter. Is it indeed yours?"</p>
               <p>"Mine? yes!" answered the millionaire, but there was no great amount of confidence
                  expressed in the tone of his reply. It was surprising with what severity, such as
                  might have belonged to an examining judge on the bench with a shrinking culprit
                  before him, the young girl put her next question. The two children, astonished and
                  a little frightened at what seemed to be going on, and yet prevented from running
                  away out of the room by the presence of the interlocutors near the door, had
                  backed up into the two corners of the rear end of the room, nearly or quite out of
                  ear-shot, and probably heard no intelligible word of what followed.</p>
               <p>"Did you write this letter?" asked the teacher, and her eyes sought those of the
                  millionaire with an expression which the latter, if he had brain enough to
                  understand them, was not likely soon to forget.</p>
               <p>"I?—yes—that is, no," stammered Minthorne. "I did not write the letter, and
                  yet—yet I know—that is I know pretty much, what is in it; and it is mine! And look
                  here!—what kind of a young lady do you call yourself,
                  Miss—Miss—Hadley—Hamilton—"</p>
               <p>"Haviland," corrected the owner of the name.</p>
               <p>"—Miss Haviland, then, to possess yourself of letters belonging to other people,
                  and then deny having them. Do you not know that that is—that it is—something or
                  other, confound the name, that the law does not allow, and that can be
                  punished—"</p>
               <p>"Not quite so severely as <emph>treason</emph>—holding correspondence with the
                  enemy, can it?" asked the young girl, her eyes still upon the millionaire, and her
                  face stern as if it had never flickered off a smile upon the world around her.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" asked Minthorne.</p>
               <p>"This," answered the teacher, coming close to the million aire, holding the letter
                  equally near to his eyes and her own and tracing her finger along it. "If this
                  letter is yours, you know that this outside is only a cover, and that within there
                  is a letter addressed to the rebel capital."</p>
               <p>"And what do you make of that?" asked the young man, apparently with less
                  indecision in tone than he had before manifested.</p>
               <p>"What I have just named—treasonable correspondence with the rebel leaders,"
                  answered the young girl.</p>
               <p>"Will you give me that letter?" asked the millionaire, reaching out his hand for
                  it at the same time.</p>
               <p>"I will <emph>not!</emph>" said Kate Haviland. "You are a man, and I am only a
                  woman, and if you choose to show yourself a brute, perhaps you can take it from
                  me. If you do, I will denounce you for what you are, within an hour, if you are
                  the last man on earth and I starve in the streets. You never send this letter to
                  Montgomery, and it never leaves my hands, until I know that it carries no
                  intelligence that can aid the enemy!"</p>
               <p>Brave Kate! Brave and true! Had there been more like you, women as well as men,
                  the city of New York would not have been made; as indeed it was made, during all
                  the early days of the rebellion, the fountain-head from which the rebel leaders
                  drew all the information they needed, of the plans, purposes and resources of the
                  loyal States. The Underground Mail would not have revenged, as it did, the
                  Underground Railroad,—one injury to the public service and the welfare of the
                  nation, built upon and defended by another the very opposite, which had preceded
                  it. It is not the province of this narration to personate the men known to have
                  been engaged in carrying on treasonable correspondence with the enemy, during all
                  the opening months of the war. Had there been legal proof against them, as there
                  was moral, they would not have remained all this while at liberty: as there is not
                  such legal proof at the command of loyal men, the time has not yet come when their
                  names can even be mentioned with safety in such a connection as this. Some of them
                  at the time held high position, penned their treasonable correspondence in public
                  offices where they had been placed by the deluded people, and forwarded that
                  treasonable correspondence<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7282-00000079"/> respondence
                  at the public expense. Some of them have since lost those high positions; and some
                  have since regained them, or gained others equally Honorable, so far as address is
                  concerned. Some of them will sit in the next Congress<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_009" xml:id="return_009">*</ref>
                   and hold a controlling influence in arranging the future weal or wo of the
                  nation. God help the nation, in such hands! Half the infidels in the loyal States
                  have been converted to a belief in the truths of revealed religion, within the
                  past two or three years, from the impression that there <emph>must</emph> be a Day
                  of Judgment for the purpose of pronouncing doom upon such men, and that there
                     <emph>must</emph> be a place wherein they can expiate those crimes against
                  humanity and liberty for which they seem so unlikely to be punished during this
                  life!</p>

               </note>
               <p>Then happened (that is to say, on the heels of the declaration of Kate Haviland,
                  that she had "put her foot down" against surrendering the letter, to be forwarded
                  to Montgomery)—something that she was very far from expecting, and something that
                  may surprise even the attentive reader of these pages. It may not be possible even
                  to say what did happen, or why it happened. Strong feeling sometimes makes sudden
                  metamorphoses, to which those of Ovid were only slight variations of the same
                  creature. Men who have brains become suddenly devoid of them, under circumstances
                  of great peril; and those who before seemed to have little more than the crude
                  understanding of the idiot, become not only men, but men of brilliant intellect.
                  There may be something in the unparalleled circumstances of this unholy rebellion,
                  producing the same effect, where it would seem to be the most incredible.</p>
               <p>Under the excitement (it must have been) of the moment, and the absolute need that
                  he should regain possession of the letter on <emph>some</emph> terms, Mr. Ned
                  Minthorne seemed to be actually transformed. All his weak, dawdling, listless
                  manner vanished; and Miss Dora Fullerton, with all the flow of Southern blood in
                  her veins, would no more have said an insulting or overbearing word to the man who
                  at that moment stood before Kate Haviland, than she would have thrust her right
                  hand into a grate-full of coal in full blast. There was not one particle of drawl
                  in his speech, though the voice was very low, as he said:</p>
               <p>"There—we have had enough of this!—give me that letter!"</p>
               <p>The young girl's face had been painfully red not long before. Now it grew almost
                  white, in the intensity of her surprise. Was this really the same man with whom
                  she had been conversing? She gazed at him with a strange fascination, in silence
                  and for quite a moment, and then she asked:</p>
               <p>"Who <emph>are</emph> you?"</p>
               <p>"I told you my name, before. Minthorne. Let me have that letter; for I must go,
                  and I need it at once."</p>
               <p>"To send it to Washington?" asked the young girl.</p>
               <p>Minthorne looked into her face one moment. "No," he answered.</p>
               <p>"No?"</p>
               <p>"No—nor to use it in any manner in which the interests of the United States of
                  America will be injured. "Upon my <emph>honor!</emph>" His words were very low, so
                  that the children still standing in the back part of the room could not have
                  understood him if they had been literally "all ears."</p>
               <p>Without another word Kate Haviland handed him the packet: he put it into his
                  pocket (his <emph>other</emph> pocket), said "Good morning; and you had better
                  forget what has been said and done here since I entered this room!" and was gone.
                  A moment afterwards, Ned Minthorne, millionaire and noodle, once more emerged from
                  the house of Mrs. Fullerton, without meeting either that lady or her daughter,
                  went dawdling down the street, and was shortly afterwards engaged in one of the
                  most eclectic games of billiards known to the profession, at one of the most
                  fashionable establishments for that indulgence, in the neighborhood of Union
                  Square. Where he went after his weak nature had fortified itself with the

                  such conscientiousness that she did very little else (mentally) during the

                  moment before been remembering in spite of herself. In order to quiet the
                  apprehensions of some who might fear for the future of Misses Myra and Mildred

                  that during the day she managed to tell the story she had commenced, without being
                  even once insultingly interrupted—that before a week Myra (as much from love as
                  fear, and yet with a due proportion of both in mind) would as soon have jumped out
                  of the third story window as played a trick corresponding to the one in which she
                  had indulged on that eventful morning—and that not many days elapsed before Mrs.
                  Fullerton loftily declared herself pleased with the new governess, and Miss Dora

               <p>IT would be for the honor of human nature, if no necessity existed that the words
                  following, and many others, should ever be read or written. Yet the design has
                  been to furnish a faithful chronicle of the time, one partaking quite as much of
                  the character of history as that of romance; and though it may be allowable for
                  the painter in sunny lands to bring home only pleasant little bits of reminiscence
                  caught from moments when he saw the sun aslant on such a valley or the evening
                  falling on such a glorious combination of rock, and tree and river,—yet the
                  word-painter has not the same liberty of choice; and the faithful chronicler who
                  accompanies this Cole, or Church or Gifford, and who pretends to give an accurate
                  account of the country visited, cannot be allowed only to dwell upon such pleasant
                  scenes and golden moments: he must treat sometimes of all that is hideous,
                  loathsome and disgusting—all that is annoying, dangerous and terrible. Fearful
                  gulfs lie, in reality, among the mountains which the artist makes merely enjoyable
                  adjuncts of his picture; storms burst upon broad-stretching plains; and foul
                  reptiles creep among luxuriant foliage. It is the duty of some to tell the whole
                  truth, while others can be allowed only to exhibit the glorious points which honor
                  nature and deify humanity.</p>
               <p>It is a task of no ordinary repulsiveness, to put upon record, amid the brightest
                  glories that have ever been gathered by the American name, a shame which must
                  endure as long as it has a place in history. Not a shame unparalleled in the
                  career of nations, but one from which we should have kept ourselves free, under
                  the broad light of this epoch and in view of all past experience. That shame is
                  and has been, <emph>trading and thriving upon the suffering and necessity of the
                     republic.</emph>

               <p>It has been the duty of some of the earlier chapters of this work, to descant upon
                  the glories which displayed themselves in the national character and action,
                  immediately after the fall of Sumter—that attachment to the flag, personal courage
                  and devotion, manifested in rushing to the ranks of the army and pouring out
                  wealth for the public service, which can never be forgotten until men cease to be
                  divided into nationalities. Wo to the world that there is another and a darker
                  side to the medal! If the rising was matchless in the sublimity of its numbers,
                  courage and devotion, it was accompanied by another rising, almost if not quite
                  unparalleled in the whole record of baseness. If the true men of the republic rose
                  to be demi-gods, in the sublimity of their sacrifices made and offered, there was
                  a residuum among them—<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7282-00000081"/> an evil spawn of
                  men who at the same time sunk to be the meanest reptiles that ever crawled the
                  earth. If Russell's dictum and the taunt of past years, that we were "nothing but
                  a nation of shopkeepers," were at once disproved,—another and a fouler charge,
                  that we were capable of trading upon any necessity and making the "almighty
                  dollar" out of transactions the most disgraceful, was proved to be true of too
                  many in our midst. It might be established that as a nation we were brave and
                  loyal: God help us!—it has not been proved that as a nation we were
                     <emph>honest!</emph>

                  to make up the application of the name; and it is an eternal disgrace to be
                  obliged to say that in every one of the particulars named, the history of this
                  struggle, and especially of its earlier months, has proved that we can vie with

                     of the English family. "Shoddy," properly speaking, is the short wool carded
                     or worn from the inside of cloth, without fibre or tenacity, and with no
                     capability of wear, and yet easily made into the semblance of more durable
                     goods. The name is now used, however, as applied to cloth, in a more general

               <p>We are not alone in the world, of course, in this disgrace. Rotten ships,
                  foundered horses, arms sold to enrich favorites, trading and trafficking in every
                  thing that should have been held sacred, show on the pages of English history at
                  almost any time during the last three hundred years, and no doubt would show at a
                  still more remote period if the record was not made obscure by distance. Whole
                  pages of Macaulay might have been written of our own time, when they describe the
                  terrible condition in which the entire British governmental polity lay for some
                  time after the accession of William the Third,<ref rend="super" target="#note_011"

                   And that the same mighty England, accustomed to great wars, has not yet
                  learned perfect wisdom in some of these particulars, is known by all who remember
                  the gross mismanagement of the British commissariat during the first months of the
                  war in the Crimea. As if to prove that man in all ages and in all countries is a
                  thief when his own country is to be damaged and his own countrymen robbed,
                  Xenophon preserves us in his "Anabasis" the shameful fact that the Greek troops of

                  "blood-money" of an army. And some of the heaviest thunder of denunciation poured
                  by Demosthenes into the ears of the Athenians, sounded against those public
                  plunderers who enriched themselves, wore costly robes and built luxurious palaces,
                  while the State and the army were being beggared to supply them with that added
                  wealth. But what is all this to us?—and what satisfaction is there in
                  contemplating it, except such a grim and horrible triumph as Lucifer might have
                  felt, plunging down from the radiant battlements of heaven to the gloom and
                  despair of the lower pit, at the knowledge that he was not the first of the

                  nationality, to be marred and belittled by a rising equally general for theft and
                  plunder.</p>
               <p>There seems to have been a general declaration, in acts if not in words, at the
                  moment when the dangers and necessities of the government began to be manifest, to
                  this effect: "The country is falling into trouble—it will be frightened and
                  distracted—it must have materials for carrying on a war, suddenly—it must take
                  such things as are offered, and there will be neither time nor heart to examine—we
                  can make what profit we please—and it is no crime to cheat the government." There
                  was a time when some mercantile reputations in the country stood not only above
                  any positive charge of dishonest dealing, but even above suspicion. Not all those
                  mercantile reputations have been discovered to be bubbles, during this struggle,
                  but it has certainly been proved that none were too <emph>high</emph> to come
                  under absolute proof of dishonesty. Government officials have been themselves
                  fearfully weak if not actually sharing dishonest profits with contractors; and
                  contractors have so habitually outraged all decency by their swindles, that the
                  very name of "contractor" has long been a scoff in the streets and the word upon
                  which any performer in the theatre could bring down rounds of reprobatory applause
                  plause. These frauds began with the beginning, and it is evident that they will
                  not end until the close. The leech has fastened upon the blood of the nation, and
                  it will not let go its hold until the victim has the last drop of its blood sucked
                  away, or finds strength, in recovered health, to dash the reptiles from its
                  bleeding sides. It was not only yesterday that the army was clothed in rags when
                  unimpeachable clothing was bargained for: to some extent the same wretched
                  condition of affairs exists to-day.<ref rend="super" target="#note_013"

                  ate mouldy biscuit and gangrened beef: fare very little better supplies them
                  today, though the exposure has ceased to be a popular one in the newspapers, and
                  the soldiers themselves have grown so used to the wrong treatment, or so hopeless
                  of amelioration, that they cease to utter loud complaints in letters addressed to
                  the public journals. Vessels are in the employment of the government, to-day, at
                  scandalous prices, and used for dangerous service, when they are neither
                  sea-worthy nor in repair, just as they were two years ago when there was some
                  shadow of excuse for their selection, in the existing haste and necessity; and if
                  the old Governor and the still older Niagara went the way of all rotten boats some
                  time ago, it is not long since two old Staten Island ferry-boats, the Clifton and
                  the Sachem, were sent upon service at Sabine Pass, for which they were no more
                  fitted than the same number of mud-scows would have been,—and happily lost to the
                  rebels. If the windows of men's souls and the secrets of government contracts
                  could both be laid open to the public view, to-day, the discovery would be made
                  that quite one-half the national expenditures during the two and a half years of
                  the war for the suppression of the rebellion, have been lavished upon unworthy
                  favorites or picked away piece-meal by gross deceptions

                     continued and unendurable swindles which have created a false impression in the
                     public mind that the war itself is only kept up to give still farther
                     opportunities for plundering.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The city of New York, head of the commercial operations of a whole continent, has
                  of course been the place of purchase of most of the supplies necessary for the
                  government service, and equally of course the theatre of most of the disreputable
                  transactions alluded to. Many of the unreliable goods furnished have been
                  manufactured at the East; and some of the principal "shoddy mills," where a
                  substance known to be totally unfit for human wear is every day made into an
                  apology for cloth, to weaken, to sicken and freeze the defenders of the country,
                  are located in Connecticut. No doubt Boston and Philadelphia have quite
                  contributed their share to the national disgrace. But the city of New York must
                  stand pre-eminent in this, as in every thing honorable or disgraceful; and it is
                  almost entirely with transactions connected with the great commercial metropolis,
                  that this humiliating record has to do. Nor is there occasion of entering into
                  many particulars of the frauds connected with the city of New York: the public
                  recollection is smarting under them; the names of the guilty parties are well
                  known to the great body of readers; and such personation as could bring an
                  additional blush (can they indeed blush?) to the cheeks of the most noted of the
                  robbers of their mother land, would be beyond the scope of a work of this
                  character. Let a few type instances suffice to recall public recollection
                  sufficiently for the purposes of this chronicle.</p>
               <p>There is a story upon record, of a droll character who went one day into a livery
                  stable (proverbially a place for cheap dealing and acute conscience) and inquired
                  the price that would be charged him for a horse and carriage to go a few miles
                  into the country. The livery-keeper replied with his price—a modest one, beyond
                  peradventure,—whereupon the droll very woolly remarked: "Oh, you are mistaken! I
                  did not ask you how much you would <emph>sell</emph> the establishment for, but
                  how much you would <emph>hire</emph> it to me for, for a couple of hours!" The
                  local legend does not record what was the eventual issue of this transaction; but
                  something of the same kind might with propriety have been said, by the government
                  officials, of charters of boats proposed in their behalf, where the price charged
                  for a month's hire was afterwards proved to have been very nearly or quite the
                  whole value of the vessel, the government taking the risk of loss and obligation
                  to pay the whole value set by the owners in that event, in addition! Dozens and
                  scores of vessels were hired, in the harbor of New York and no doubt in other
                  harbors as well, of which the owners afterwards made their boasts, when they had
                  been retained in the government employ for two, three or at the most six months,
                  that they had received the full value of their vessels and had them back again as
                  sound as ever. There was not even shame enough, on the part of those unscrupulous
                  persons, to conceal the fact that they had attempted and succeeded in perpetrating
                  a great fraud on the government, as there might have been if they had been
                  speaking of transactions with private individuals: on the contrary they chuckled
                  publicly over that "smartness" for which some discriminating fiend, specially
                  commissioned for the purpose, will yet treat them to an extra roasting in
                  perdition, above that received by ordinary scoundrels.</p>
               <p>It has often been said that "society" is an excellent institution, not only from
                  the legal protection which its rules and observances afford to those who would
                  otherwise be too weak or too modest to take care of themselves, but because to
                  some extent it enforces the concealment of the worst points in the characters of
                  each, and prevents sensitive people going mad at the great aggregated spectacle of
                  human depravity. This phase of the questionable and yet necessary protection which
                  it affords to doubtful characters, has probably never been more strikingly
                  illustrated than it bids fair to be to-day and<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000084"/> in connection with the very outrages upon which we
                  have been commenting.</p>
               <p>If only one man had been engaged in filling his purse at the public expense, no
                  matter how rich and powerful he had grown, it is just possible that there might be
                  enough of determined virtue and righteous indignation in the community, to "taboo"
                  him in the street and on 'Change, to make his seat an unenviable one at church and
                  plant a few thorns and pinpoints of shame in his nightly pillow. But it
                  unfortunately happens that the number of the impeccable is very limited as
                  compared with those to be assailed, and that consequently there is a sort of
                  "Mutual Defence Association" existing just now in almost every large community in
                  America, whose great end and object is to stifle outcry on this very subject.
                  "Help me keep my skirts clear, and I will assist in holding you harmless," is the
                  motto of this extensive organization of notables; and surrounded by such
                  phalanxes, who have first helped themselves to nearly all that was worth
                  appropriating and then banded together to prevent detection or even
                  accusation,—what chance would there really be for the lonely prophet of just wrath
                  who dared to raise his voice in personal denunciation? A penny whistle in a
                  hurricane, would be that weak, small voice raised amid the universal clamor.</p>
               <p>Besides, there is naturally some objection, on the part of the most scrupulously
                  honest of men, to being on bad terms with <emph>all</emph> his neighbors! And as
                  the wrong has been so broadly disseminated over the land, and as it has permeated
                  every class of society, from the occupant of the policy-shop to that of the
                  pulpit, one is really cautious how he fires into a crowd, lest the shot intended
                  to cripple a contractor a hundred leagues away, may have the unexpected effect of
                  "winging" an intimate acquaintance—perhaps even a kinsman! There have been so many
                  vessels to be supplied—so many suits of clothing to be furnished—so many thousands
                  of arms to be procured—so many regiments to be fed, going to or from the seat of
                  war (no allusion is here made, be it understood, to the Philadelphia Volunteer
                  Refreshment Saloons, among the true and far-seeing benevolences of the time)—so
                  many victorious officers to be banqueted at the public expense—so many fallen to
                  be buried, with long arrays of carriages, and gloves and music <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">ad infinitum</foreign>—so many different sorts of "relief" to be
                  furnished to the wives and children of absent soldiers—so many trips of official
                  personages to Washington, or the different State capitals, or the various
                  battle-fields, to arrange for something that never needed to be done and is
                  consequently and very properly <emph>not</emph> done—so many "little jobs," in
                  short, to supply opportunities missed in the more extensive ones,—that the
                  brother, if disposed to be <emph>too</emph> particular, might think twice before
                  he took the hand of his twin, and the wife hesitate at putting on the new bracelet
                  brought her by her husband, until she had full assurance that it had not been
                  forged out of the melting down of the national wealth.</p>
               <p>As a consequence of all this, society will not be at present seriously disrupted
                  on account of the new element which has crept into it, and men who should carry a
                  scarlet letter "S" upon the forehead, much more prominent than the "A" on the
                  breast of poor Hester Prynne, will be allowed to wear their own unblushing fronts.
                  Denunciators, when they do spring up, will generalize instead of particularizing.
                  Preachers, in their pulpits, when they feel the necessity of hurling a bolt of
                  wrath, will be careful not to look, at that awkward moment, at the pew where my
                  Lord Baron de Shoddy, just inducted into his splendid new villa of Shoddyhurst,
                  sits proudly in his shining raiment and forms the cynosure of admiring eyes.
                  Political speakers, though they may thunder, will thunder innocuously at some
                  supposed speculator who lives, not in New York, Boston or Philadelphia, but in a
                  very distant "Borribhoola Gha" across some wide imaginary ocean. Poets will jingle
                  abuse, but they will disguise the shining arrows of wit so cleverly that not even
                  the object aimed at will be aware that he is touched. And novelists—well,
                  novelists will be found human like their fellows; and even <emph>they</emph> will
                  present, on this subject, innumerable bushels of imaginative and deprecatory
                  chaff, to a ridiculously small measure of personal wheat.</p>
               <p>At which stage of the argument the writer hereof becomes<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000085"/> aware that he is giving forcible proof of his own
                  prophecy, and that if he would not lose the opportunity entirely, in the present
                  connection, and present the most melancholy instance on record of a "Hamlet"
                  without ever a Prince, at least a brief glance must be taken of a few of the
                  frauds and blunders which, coming together, and each seeming to be especially
                  arranged for the aid of the other, disgraced the opening days of the war in
                  certain prominent localities. And not the old clo' dealer of Chatham Street, who,
                  about that time, advertised that he would pay the very highest price for cast-off
                  clothing, as he had "extensive orders from the government,"—nor yet the boatman on
                  a certain shore-section not far from the same city, who was seen digging off a
                  schooner that had been lying ashore, bilged and abandoned, for five years, "to
                  carry troops down South with," as he said,—neither of these is to be the type.
                  Prominent men, more or less clearly indicated, gleam through the whole lamentable
                  series of operations, the record of which has lain entirely beyond the scope of
                  the eleven hundred pages of Van Wyck, and even over-labored the Albany printers,
                  so that though it has been loud enough in the public voice, it has not reached the
                  public eye in the report of the Legislative Committee appointed to investigate the
                  mingled dishonesties and incapacities.</p>
               <p>The crowning feature of that immediate time was of course to be found in the great
                  clothing contracts for thirty thousand troops, in which popular clothing firms
                  were engaged—affairs probably no worse than others which accompanied and
                  immediately followed them, but thrown into peculiar prominence by their extent and
                  their being the first to come under exposure—affairs which at once marked the
                  names of those concerned in them as proper subjects to bear the prefix of "Shoddy"
                  itself, for jokes in the street and "gags" at the theatres, without which town
                  wits, writers and actors might all have been deprived of some of their very best
                  opportunities.</p>
               <p>It is equally obvious that most of the frauds upon the government then and
                  immediately after perpetrated, could not have met with the same evil success, had
                  there not been either collusion on the part of the authorities, or equally
                  lamentable though not equally culpable confusion and mismanagement. He would be a
                  bold man, to charge that nearly every person at that time in public office was a
                  shameless swindler, and the alternative is to believe that frightened haste and
                  incapacity were the true explanations of the conduct exhibited. The otherwise high
                  character of most of the officials involved, gives at least some ground for belief
                  that this charitable explanation is the true one, and that instead of their being
                  conspirators leaguing with private villains to defraud the government, they were
                  merely well-meaning incapables, frightened out of their propriety, and running
                  around with that admirable want of knowledge where they were going or what they
                  were doing, graphically illustrated by some of the country people in comparing
                  them to the evolutions of "a hen with her head off!"</p>
               <p>The New York Legislature was in session when the news of the fall of Sumter burst
                  upon the country. That body naturally shared in the general alarm and indignation,
                  and as the elected exponent of the popular feeling in the State, at once assumed
                  the duty of providing for the emergency. A law was passed, on the Tuesday
                  following the announcement of that astounding news and that of the President's
                  Proclamation, appropriating three millions of dollars for the public defence, and
                  empowering the Board of State Officers<ref rend="super" target="#note_014"
                     xml:id="return_014">*</ref>
                   to expend that sum in raising, organizing and equipping thirty thousand
                  men, also authorized by that act. Really, this Board had little to do in the way
                  of raising troops, for men were rushing to arms in uncounted thousands: their
                  principal duty lay in overseeing the organization into regiments, looking after
                  the legality and propriety of the elections of officers which were to be made by
                  the regiments themselves, providing for their proper arming and equipment, and
                  getting them ready for the
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_014">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_014">*</ref>The names of the gentlemen composing this Board, for the additional reminder
                        of the time which they convey, may also be mentioned here. They were: Edwin

                  speedily as possible. Nor is there the slightest doubt, it is only justice to say,
                  that the Governor, at least <emph>most</emph> of the other members of the Board,
                  and the officers of his Staff as Commander-in-Chief of the State, who filled
                  especially arduous positions in the equipment and fitting-out of the troops,
                  intended to do the very best that lay in their power, to gather those troops
                  readily, equip and send them off most efficiently. And it is only justice to say,
                  again, that they would have presented a much better record than they did in
                  reality, had not that unholy conflict between City, State and Nation early begun
                  to manifest itself, which in a wider sphere had done so much to give birth to the
                  rebellion, and which will be found, unless yet undeveloped wisdom arises to bar
                  the door of divided feeling which admits the evil, the controlling cause of our
                  national undoing.</p>
               <p>The National Government had at that moment neither arms nor money; and it needed
                  the one and the expenditure of the other without a moment's delay. It was very
                  willing to have the States raise the troops demanded, in their own way, furnish
                  the money necessary to equip and send them off, and look to it (the General
                  Government) for eventual repayment. But it could not quite "keep still" all the
                  while. It felt the necessity of making occasional embarrassing suggestions as to
                  authority which the State Government (clearly in the right, so far) was not slow
                  to meet with equal tenacity. Here and there an officer (as in the case of Colonel
                  Ellsworth, before noticed) was sent on from Washington with "authority" to raise a
                  regiment; while the fact was, if there was any State authority at all, that the
                  President could have given nothing more than a recommendation that he or any other
                  in the same relative position should be commissioned by the Governor. This muddle
                  of "authority," in the case of Colonel Ellsworth and his Zouaves, grew into a
                  serious difficulty with reference to their "ordering off"—a sad earnest of the
                  reverses they were afterwards to suffer. Then the authorities at Washington had no
                  idea whatever, how many troops they really wanted, and scarcely how many they had
                  ordered; and here grew up another matter of embarrassment, eminently worthy of the
                  time when nearly all that was not dishonesty seemed to be inefficiency. By the
                  Proclamation calling for seventy-five thousand troops, the quota of the State of
                  New York would have been seventeen regiments, numbering thirteen thousand, two
                  hundred and eighty men.<ref rend="super" target="#note_015" xml:id="return_015"
                     >*</ref>
                   The defection of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and
                  Arkansas, seriously affected the calculation, and made the quota of New York, if
                  the whole seventy-five thousand men were to be raised, nearly twenty thousand. The
                  legislature had believed, from the first, that troops might be more easily raised
                  then than at a later period, and that they might be found "handy to have in the"
                  national "house"; and their authorization had been, as we have seen, thirty
                  thousand. It will scarcely be believed that such stupid blindness as to the future
                  can have existed at Washington, but such is the fact: the very moment it was known
                  that thirty thousand New York troops were being raised, there were rumors that a
                  large part of them would be rejected; and it needed the visits of two different
                  Committees to the National Capital, before the government could be induced to
                  receive and recognize the whole thirty thousand. (As an indication of the
                  war-spirit of the State of New York, it may be said, here, that the whole thirty
                  thousand, in thirty-eight regiments, were organized, officered and equipped, and
                  left the State for the seat of war, within ninety days from the date of the
                  original call.) After Bull Run, and when the power and extent of the rebellion
                  began to appear in their full proportions, the government at Washington began to
                  sigh over lost opportunities, and to be willing to accept <emph>more</emph> men,
                  instead of <emph>less,</emph> than the State of New York was willing to furnish.
                  It is anticipating events to refer to it in this connection, but no other
                  opportunity can occur, and there

                  really an appropriateness in saying that it was at this time (to wit, immediately
                  after Bull Run,) that the conflict between the National and State authorities, in
                  the raising of troops, again and yet more injuriously manifested itself. Men,
                  calling themselves military men, who lacked character to inspire confidence at
                  home, and who could not have procured authority within the city of New York, where
                  they were known, to organize a gang of street-sweepers,—applied to the War
                  Department for authority to raise regiments within the State of New York, without
                  consultation with the State government, and were listened to. It is alleged that
                  some of them offered baits for command, in tendering corps of peculiar name and
                  organization; and however that may have been, certain it is that some of the
                  active men who at that time managed affairs in the War Department, found
                  capabilities in most of these men, which those who knew them best would never have
                  suspected; and such authorizations were given—not less than fifty in two months, a
                  part of them to drunken vagabonds and even convicts! And from those authorizations
                  sprung most of the disgrace which has since been reflected on the service, from
                  the State. The regiments originally raised, under State authorization, took away
                  such men as Duryea, Davis, Slocum, Peck and others who have since reflected honor
                  upon high command; and Hawkins, Bendix and many others who deserved higher command
                  than they ever attained. It was under the new system of outside meddling that the
                  disgraceful scenes of Staten Island, East New York and the Red House were
                  inaugurated, with habitual drunkards and even convicts pretending to command
                  American citizens, with fudged muster-rolls and forged orders, the whole
                  culminating in the lasting disgrace to the service, of D'Utassy immured at Sing
                  Sing.</p>
               <p>Such was the inequality of the action at Washington, with which the State
                  authorities were obliged to contend,—one day unwilling to receive the troops
                  raised at their order, and the next willing to overstep their own authority to
                  raise more than the State would furnish under its recognized system. This was very
                  early in the war; and the country might have been better served could we say that
                  nothing like the same vacillation has been shown at a later period. But the nation
                  will not soon forget the events which followed the disastrous (though able)
                  retreat of Banks from the Shenandoah Valley, early in 1862, the agonized appeals
                  made to the leading loyal States for militia to "save Washington" once more, and
                  the repudiation of those very calls which followed when the folly of the "big
                  scare" (as it was then well termed) had been discovered. Governor Andrews, of
                  Massachusetts, took the alarm communicated by the official telegraphic despatches,
                  in such earnest that he called out all the troops in and near Boston, on the
                  Common; and Washington came very near to being invaded on the opposite hand, by
                  the force of that State, at once. The Seventy-first Regiment of New York National
                  Guards hurried down, believing that they would almost or quite find Washington
                  captured, to be coolly received in that city with a denial that they were wanted
                  or that he had called for any three months militiamen, and that if they were
                  "business men," as they alleged, and not willing to enlist for the war—they could
                  go home! They had no authority to <emph>go</emph> home, meanwhile; they had not
                  been mustered into the service of the United States, and consequently not even the
                  officers could get legal leave to absent themselves from the camp for an hour, so
                  that they were about half the time under arrest by the Provost Marshal and in the
                  lock-up; and they were finally mustered in just one week before they were mustered
                  out and sent home. So much for the change in management, in <emph>this</emph>
                  particular at least; and so much for the hindrances and misunderstandings which
                  did at least something to relieve the State officers from the blame of all the
                  blunders, hindrances, robberies and malfeasances which have occurred.</p>
               <p>This somewhat long explanation of the embarrassments which arose at that time and
                  have since continued through the conflict of State and National authorities, might
                  be carried even further and pointed with a still more terrible moral, in view of
                  the later experiment in which the General Government has attempted to ignore the
                  States altogether, while the States have been quite as tenacious as ever of their
                  authority—to wit, the <emph>great national conscription.</emph> But<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000088"/> there are blunders so palpable and failures so
                  admitted that reprobation is literally wasted upon them; and the men of this

                   have probably seen the last instance that will ever be exhibited while we
                  remain a nation, of a popular government throwing off all confidence in the
                  patriotism of the people, and hoping to make profitable substitution of the
                  principle of <emph>Federal force in loyal States.</emph> The present generation
                  may not live to see the evil impetus thus given to the injurious doctrines of
                  ultra State-rights, entirely checked; but let us hope that it has seen the worst
                  of the conflict, which has power, if directed long enough by the hands of
                  unscrupulous men, to wreck us at the very moment when we may have trimuphed over
                  both domestic rebellion and foreign enmity.</p>

               <p>As if to prove that all the evils of divided interest could not be found in one
                  direction, the city of New York felt moved (from patriotic motives, of course) to
                  take its little shy at proving that nothing could be done without it. Immediately
                  after Sumter a National Defence Committee was formed, most of the members severely
                  respectable, though some who figured most prominently in it had not always been
                  inactive men in matters in which their own interest and that of the public
                  happened to be blended. It is said by an old dramatist that while the evil
                  perpetrated by men is very likely to exist after they are dead, the good is
                  generally buried in the same grave as themselves ("or words to that effect"); and
                  this may perhaps be the cause of there being very little remembered to-day with
                  reference to that highly respectable Committee, except that they were a little in
                  the way, and that they, with the aid of Col. Ellsworth, who was crazy after
                     <emph>rifles</emph> when none worth the name could be furnished, supplied the
                  Fire Zouaves with no less than seven different calibres and thirteen descriptions
                  of weapon, to one regiment—an advantage in fighting which the dullest student of
                  military science cannot fail to perceive. They also aided the magnificent Fernando
                  to make five thousand dollars more out of the celebrated Mozart regiment than he
                  might otherwise have been able to do, by giving him a "haul" at each of the
                  overcoats furnished to that body; and this benevolence, like the military wisdom
                  just mentioned, should not be ignored. That Committee has long since passed away,
                  and its place has been supplied by the Joint Committee on National Affairs, of the
                  Common Council—a stupendous body, principally composed of gentlemen of classical
                  education and refinement, who have been all the while immaculate in gloves; ready
                  to go to Washington or Albany, at any time, to consult with the President or the
                  Governor on—no one has an exact idea what; indispensable at banquets and balls
                  supplied to the whole "tag, rag and bob-tail" of politics by the public money; and
                  at times profusely immense in their telegraphic despatches, especially when New
                  York was about being bombarded by the rebel iron-clads and new fortifications were
                  necessary to be built the same night. Something may have been forgotten, of the
                  distinguished services of both these Committees, but human memory is fallible, and
                  at the present moment the impression exists that neither was ever much else than a
                  shallow and somewhat expensive humbug.</p>
               <p>But all this while the "thirty thousand" clothing contract has been waiting for
                  its ventilation. Let it wait no longer. Clothing was wanted, and wanted as quickly
                  as possible, for the thirty thousand troops being raised by the State of New York.
                  That it should be respectable and comfortable, such as would befit citizen
                  soldiery going forth to the defence of their country, was a natural understanding
                  that needed no words of contract to enforce it. Without such an understanding in
                  his own mind, no soldier, however patriotic, would have enlisted. That the State
                  and the country should be fairly dealt by in furnishing it, was as much
                  understood, in the mind of every honorable man, as it would have been had the
                  purchaser been a private individual and a personal friend. The State Board of
                  Officers entrusted their Treasurer with the duty of making the contract for such
                  clothing, though into whatever blunders or errors he and the whole State Board
                  fell, the report of the committee of the New York legislature on these operations
                  makes it evident that they had the company of some very high-sounding patriotic
                  names that have since then been continually recurring in the<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000089"/> newspapers as the strongest and loudest friends of
                  the Union and the instructors of government in the whole national policy. The
                  Treasurer found respectable and reliable persons in the city of New York, doing
                  extensive business, and entered into a contract with them to supply several
                  thousand suits, at such prices as should have procured plain but strong and
                  durable clothing for the service. The manufacture of the clothing went on, and the
                  soldiers waited for it. Suddenly, and without any one being aware whence the
                  whisper proceeded, there grew a rumor that these persons were not making the
                  clothing of such goods as would quite fulfil the needs of the soldiers or the
                  expectations of the State officers. This could not be permitted, by any means:
                  this must be made straight, at any hazard. Gov. Morgan held a consultation with
                  the new Quartermaster-General of the State,<ref rend="super" target="#note_017"
                     xml:id="return_017">*</ref>
                   and both the officials decided that the plan of the Treasurer, to have one
                  of his own employees inspect the clothing, must be modified, materially. At the
                  suggestion of the Governor, and from a list furnished by him, the Quartermaster
                  selected four men whose standing in society and advantages in intimate
                  acquaintance with the qualities of goods, would insure at once that no bribery
                  could be practiced upon them and that they could not well be deceived as to the
                  worth of the garments they should inspect. Now would every opportunity for
                  dissatisfaction and faultfinding be most certainly removed. Now every thing was
                  sure to be correct and satisfactory. Seemingly no more effectual precaution could
                  have been taken by the Governor and Quartermaster-General, who were both
                  undoubtedly beyond reproach in the matter, and thoroughly in earnest; but the same
                  evil fate and worse management which had at first taken the task of procuring
                  clothing out of the hands of the Quartermaster and put it into those of the State
                  Board, seemed disposed to follow to the end. The manufacture went on, and the
                  requisite number of suits were finished, inspected, declared satisfactory, and
                  delivered. When delivered, and when inspected by the practical eyes of men who
                  were to wear them, a certain proportion were respectable and almost up to the
                  standard required by the contract, and the rest the veriest insult to the men for
                  the clothing of whose backs and limbs they were intended, that ever emanated from
                  the most disreputable slop-shop in the universe. It would seem that the shelves of
                  all the cloth-houses on the continent must have been ransacked for the oldest,
                  thinnest, most rotten and moth-eaten specimens of satinet,<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_018" xml:id="return_018">*</ref>
                   that had been accumulating as refuse stock for the previous twenty years.
                  Straws could have been shot through some of the garments, they were so thin, open,
                  coarse and "sleezy" (for the meaning of which latter term, reference may be made
                  to the first tailor of the reader's acquaintance); in others whole generations of
                  greedy moths seemed to have been running riot; and still others were so rotten
                  from long lying and dampness on the shelves, that there was no difficulty whatever
                  in holding up the material and thrusting the finger through it as it might have
                  been thrust through soaked blotting-paper.</p>

                  to the citizen—that of battling for the liberty and honor of his country! This was
                  the mode in which certain American citizens testified to their devoted patriotism,
                  their commercial integrity and their appreciation of the needs of the soldier.

                  quite as inefficiently inspected, and all parties remained the purest patriots in
                  public estimation—stars in society, paragons in politics, patterns in benevolence,
                  admired in spirit-stirring oratory, and, perhaps, saints in the calendar.</p>
               <p>In another respect, too, the scape-goat comparison holds good, as none better know
                  than those who have escaped public attention while it so seriously damaged others.
                  The cloth dealers are entitled to their full share of the odium, in this and other
                  instances of the manufacture of worthless clothing. That they sold to the clothing
                  contractors material even more worthless than the latter knew, is beyond doubt. It
                  has been seen what Charles Holt, a type man of this class, directed his partner to
                  purchase in Europe, in view to meet a large demand for soldiers' clothing
                  material—the cheapest and poorest cloths that could be found of any approach to
                  the required color; and the very day on which his name appeared in the daily
                  papers appended to a subscription of one thousand dollars to the Union cause, at
                  one of the great merchants' meetings of that week,—case after case of the most
                  worthless satinets that the Eastern markets could furnish, was being carted up to
                  the store of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews, from one of the Boston lines of steamers.
                  Where a part of the bad materials of the "respectable firm" came from, he knew, if
                  we do not; and other dealers of the same pure, high-toned and patriotic impulses,
                  could have explained the place and mode of procurement of most of the others.
                     <emph>They</emph> kept out of the public view, however: the
                     <emph>clothing-manufacturers</emph> loaded themselves with an odium which will
                  never leave them while a man of this generation remains alive, while their equally
                  culpable coadjutors, the <emph>cloth-dealers,</emph> almost totally escaped and
                  have done so while furnishing worthless materials throughout the entire war.</p>
               <p>Does it seem that something too much has been said of these frauds against the
                  government, practised at the opening of the war, and that somewhat too intense
                  reprobation has been bestowed upon them? They err who think so, or who believe
                  that even half enough has yet been said and done to stamp the human vipers with
                  infamy. It is not only that they were, to the extent of their action, committing
                  matricide by crippling, paralyzing and rendering helpless so that others could
                  murder her, the country that was their mother: nearly every swindling contract,
                  then and throughout the war, has done something more and worse than this. Every
                  rotten old boat sent to sea with Union soldiers on board, likely to sink at any
                  moment and bury them at one fatal plunge, has been a bid for the wholesale murder
                  of brothers, such as the very fiends in hell must have contemplated with infernal
                  admiration. Every shoddy suit, every defective blanket, and every pair of shoes
                  with the soles pasted to the uppers (no fancy, this latter, but something that has
                  been seen by too many who were brought into contact with quartermasters'
                  operations) has been the means of making a Union soldier suffer what he need not
                  have suffered in the chances of war, and at last brought him to crippled limbs or
                  consumption. Every mouldy biscuit or pound of gangrened beef has been a bid for
                  sickness in the field, or fever, delirium and death in the hospital. Every
                  defective arm, every sawdust shell and every worthless horse, has left him at the
                  mercy of a fierce and unscrupulous enemy. Every dollar swindled away from the
                  public purse has been so much subtracted from the very life-blood of the nation.
                  Every public theft has been an effort for the public downfall. Every swindling
                  shoddy contractor, so far as his abilities went, has been a national murderer.
                  Every person, of whatever name or employment, buying for the government what was
                  worthless or injurious—whether guns known to be worthless (whether with or without
                  touch-holes—a mooted point); ships fitted for any other service than the one
                  intended; broken-kneed stage-horses, passed for the consideration of two dollars
                  per head by the inspector; every one of this class of operators, of whom the list
                  might be extended indefinitely, with or without his own intention has been an
                  accessary to what may eventually be the national death. And if there is a special
                  providence at once watching over nations and individuals, the day of doom that may
                  be coming to the nation and its domestic foes—will be a day to be remembered.</p>
               <p>Say not, oh historian of the coming time, that too much<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000091"/> stress has been laid upon these terrible
                  dishonesties, here or elsewhere, and that the true lover of his country will do
                  something to conceal the sins and follies of that country, instead of bringing
                  them with still more painful prominence before the eyes of the world. Every
                  withering utterance may be a pang to the speaker; but the uninspired prophet of
                  to-day must feel as his inspired prototype of the early ages may have done—that wo
                  is him if he speaks not the truth of the people of his own blood, even as he might
                  of those removed from him by race and distance. To "foul his own nest" by decrying
                  it, was thought to be a detestable feature in the conduct of the bird of the
                  fable; but men cannot always be subjected to the same rules. Not the nest, which
                  he must ever love, but the unclean birds that make their home within it, must be
                  the theme of denunciation; and the Brutus of to-day must reverse history and sit
                  in judgment upon his father, or even his <emph>mother,</emph> if need be! If not,
                  and if reprobation is to be withheld because it might strike those bound to us by
                  the ties of kindred and country, all future time must change its estimation of
                  some of the brightest examples of old heroism, and Demosthenes and Cicero must be
                  hurled down from the high places which they won by denouncing, not the countries
                  that gave them birth, but the vipers of disloyalty and pitiable meanness who but
                  for them would have crawled in continued security until they had given the last
                  sting to national existence.</p>
               <p>Write not, oh historian of the coming time, words that shall excuse or even
                  undervalue such disloyalty, until this generation has passed away and there are no
                  longer those remaining whose cheeks have burned and whose hearts have bled at the
                  alternate shame and sorrow forced upon them. Wait, at least, until the carriages
                  cease to splash us with their mud, as they roll by with plumed and diamonded
                  dames—the carriages, the plumes, the diamonds, and even the
                     <emph>respectability,</emph> all achieved by trading upon the necessities of
                  the nation. Wait until Mayors of Cities, Honorable Members of Congress, Senators,
                  Governors, and those who rule cities and fill high places in every relation of
                  civil life, cease to offend our moral noses in the street by the aroma of
                  corruption ruption which they carry about with them, shaming us in our poverty if
                  we wear a thread-bare coat or fall into the misfortune of a note sent to protest,
                  while the sleek raiment they wear has been in too many instances purchased by
                  sending to protest every feeling of patriotism and every dictate of honesty! Wait
                  until the shadow of death passes away from homes to which the cries of suffering
                  soldiers who went out from them have come up too late, asking for aid from private
                  hands to replace the ragged clothes in which they were shivering, to supply shoes
                  to their naked feet, and to give them blankets that would afford them shelter from
                  the damp ground on which they were sucking up pestilence at every pore of their
                  bodies. Wait until the poor mother has at least partially forgotten her darling
                  boy, murdered in this manner, long before the bullet of an enemy had the
                  opportunity of reaching him: wait until the country has to some extent ceased
                  groaning over the thousands upon thousands of lives and the millions of wealth
                  wasted in the blunders and inefficiencies of management—every single life and
                  every single dollar thus wasted, being something to be deplored ten times more
                  than ten times their number sacrificed with Reason supplying the altar and Honesty
                  holding the sacrificial knife!</p>
               <p>For blood, the life of the individual, and wealth, the life-blood of the nation,
                  are so intimately blended together that no power can dissever them in the estimate
                  of loss. And in the same wrong which wastes either or both, national success is
                  made impossible and national disaster inevitable. "Like master, like man!" is a
                  motto holding quite as good, to-day and in speaking of the operations of a great
                  war, as it was yesterday and when the varying characters of farmers and their
                  hired laborers were to be considered. When inefficiency and dishonesty equip a
                  regiment and select its officers, it need be no wonder to find the regiment unled
                  in the hour of conflict, the officers skulking, the men disorganized, the weapons
                  uncared for and misused, companies formed in line by backing them up against the
                  nearest fence, and the sharp, ringing words of the command to mount, in the
                  cavalry arm, changed to that somewhat ambiguous double order which has<pb
                     n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7282-00000092"/> for months past been supplying
                  merriment to the newspapers: "Prepare to git upon your critters!—Git!" And under
                  officers so appointed, and who have seen such examples among the highest of those
                  from whom they have themselves derived authority, wilful waste of the public
                  property is no wonder, but a natural result. No wonder when we find hundreds of
                  tons of quartermasters' stores and army supplies recklessly burned the moment
                  there is any possibility of an attack upon them, by officers too ignorant, too
                  indolent or too cowardly to defend them or superintend their removal to a place of
                  safety; no wonder that muskets have remained piled by the thousand, out-of-doors
                  and exposed to rain and rust—that weapons have been flung away on march or
                  retreat, as if they had cost no more than so many straws or corn-stalks gleaned
                  from a stubble-field in autumn—that hay has been left rotting by the ton on the
                  levee at Cairo, while the cavalry-horses within a hundred miles were literally
                  starving for the want of it—that even on Capitol Hill at Washington, the dragoon
                  quartered there has habitually flung down the hay of his horse into the mud, to be
                  trampled into manure, and his corn in the midst of it, to be trampled and wasted
                  in the same manner, or to be appropriated by bands of predatory hogs that better
                  understood its value and its use!</p>
               <p>All these details and suggestions are heart-sickening—let there be no more of
                  them. The whole melancholy story is told in two brief words—dishonesty and
                  incapacity. And yet <emph>one</emph> brief word will sum up the whole still more
                  concisely and more appropriately for this connection—"shoddy."</p>
               <p>That "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people," is a
                  dictum long ago set down by an authority that not many men are rash enough to
                  question. It remains to be seen whether we have shown vice and dishonesty enough
                  to be doomed beyond hope, or whether there has yet been shown enough of virtue,
                  bravery, patriotism and self-sacrificing devotion, to redeem in the eyes of the
                  God of Nations the wide-spread Sodom of dishonesty and unfaithfulness, and leave
                  us yet worthy to be a people in His sight.</p>
               <p>And here, passing again from the general subject of the blunders and dishonesties
                  which came in with the commencement ment of the war and have to some degree cursed
                  the struggling nation up to the present moment,—the careers of particular persons
                  named in this narration must be rapidly followed; and happy indeed will humanity
                  be if the discovery is not made that there are deeper and deadlier crimes against
                  patriotism, than even those which have been so plainly characterized in this most

               <p>THE First Regiment of Fire Zouaves left the city of New York for the seat of war,
                  on Monday, the Twenty-ninth of April, 1861. To the brave fellows who composed it
                  and to the ardent young Colonel in command, the day of departure seemed to be an
                  age after the call of the President for troops had been made, though really only
                  two weeks had elapsed since the Proclamation. They had intended to get off
                  earlier, and would have done so but for some of the difficulties in organization
                  inseparable from the formation of any peculiar body of soldiery, and some of the
                  blunders in management, on the part of well-meaning outsiders, to which reference
                  has before been made. Every nerve had been strained by the Chief Engineer of the

                  to enable the regiment to move early and to make it as practically efficient as
                  possible. Every Engine, Carriage and Truck-house in the city had been made
                  practically a recruiting office, the interests of the fire-service for the time
                  almost forgotten in the new and absorbing work of patriotism; and the number of
                  active firemen going away seemed so great (nearly one-quarter of the whole
                  enrolled force in the city) that some of the careful and not-over-sanguine
                  property-owners believed that their houses, in the event of a fire, would be left
                  to burn at leisure. Flags had waved and music sounded, universally, among the men
                  so long known as the defenders of life and property against the devouring element;
                  but for a sterner and nobler purpose than when they had merely waved and sounded
                  for an Annual Parade or the torch-light reception of a favorite company coming
                  home from a visit or a tournament. But they had not been necessary to induce the
                  enlistment of enough men to form the regiment—far from it. More than another
                  regiment of men, in numbers, had made application for places in the corps, and
                  been denied from some defect in health or some known obliquity of moral character.
                  The Fire Zouaves, both in the intention of Col. Ellsworth and the leading spirits
                  of the Department, were to be <emph>picked men,</emph> ready for any service and
                  capable of reflecting honor on the city that sent them forth; and all fondly
                  believed that the selection had been made successfully. If ever a regiment was
                  sent out with full confidence and bright prospects, this had that distinction.
                  Others, composed of miscellaneous material and of men whose courage and endurance
                  had never been proved, might cover themselves with glory or fall into comparative
                  disgrace: the Fire Zouaves, with Ellsworth at their head and otherwise

               <p>It has been no unusual circumstance for the head of a family to make certain
                  calculations of the future of its members. Of half a dozen sons and as many
                  daughters, the career of each has been foreshadowed to the quick eye of the
                  parent. In John, Peter, Thomas, William and Timothy, there was something for which
                  to fear. John was laborious and obedient, but dull-witted; Peter keen-witted and
                  lively, but unmanageable; Thomas, a good boy in other respects, lacked health and
                  stamina; William had no mental fault, but was really so insignificant-looking that
                  nothing brilliant could be predicted of him; and Timothy had never been any thing
                  more than a "runt," looked down upon and despised by all the other members of the
                  family. It has not been very easy for the parent to decide upon the future of
                  either of them, each having some drawback or foible making thorough success in
                  life unlikely. But Walter—ah, there at last has been a fixed and well-grounded
                  hope! Walter was so handsome, so intelligent, so brave, so forward in his
                  learning, so ready at every thing to which he turned his hand, so much a favorite
                  with all who met him—that there could be no failure in <emph>his</emph> life and
                  no question of the brilliant celebrity at which <emph>he</emph> would arrive. So

                  Esther had each some fault or weakness which threatened their future, Clara, the
                  beauty and the favorite, could be nothing less than the wife of a noble and
                  honored man, and herself one of the queens of the society surrounding her. The
                  parent has sometimes been called to bitter reflections on past calculations and
                  the uncertainty of all human hopes, when John and Peter and Thomas and William and
                  Timothy, all humdrum but very respectable heads of growing families, with broad
                  acres calling them master and money in bank, have gathered home to the funeral of
                  Walter, brilliant genius who could do nothing practical, who tried every thing and
                  partially succeeded in every thing but fully succeeded in nothing, and died at
                  last penniless and unhonored, of a broken heart and a ruined constitution. Or when
                  the brothers and Jane and Susan and Mary and Martha and little Esther, all plain
                  and unassuming but respectable heads of families,<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000094"/> have been obliged to read through blinding tears
                  the shame of beautiful and gifted Clara, wandered away alike from her old home and
                  the teachings of those who loved her, and lost thenceforth to them and to
                  herself.</p>
               <p>Which train of reflection may or may not be thought to have legitimate connection
                  with the expectations formed of the Fire Zouaves when they went away, in
                  comparison with other regiments, and the result realized from those expectations,
                  under the same comparison,—according as the reader possesses or lacks the faculty
                  of making apposite comparisions out of things in themselves very different—seeing
                  in a sheep sometimes a reminder of a saw-mill, or in a pennywhistle a suggestion
                  of the Parthenon.</p>
               <p>It was a brilliant spectacle presented in the streets of New York on that day when
                  this oddly-favorite regiment marched. Perhaps not so many saw the departure, as
                  had attended the going away of the Seventh and of the Sixty-ninth; but no others
                  had been so honored in a general ovation. And this turn-out was a cheerful one, as
                  the first-named had been sad. A few days had materially changed the popular
                  feeling. Washington, which had been threatened, was already pronounced "safe" in
                  the hands of thousands of soldiers who had gathered from every loyal State and
                  made a promising lodgment on the opposite side of the Potomac. And that few days
                  had already inured the people to the sights and sounds of warlike preparation, so
                  that the files of soldiers passing down the street on their way to the scene of
                  conflict, no longer seemed to be going martyr-like into the jaws of some great
                  dark monster, from which not one in ten could ever emerge alive. Men had already
                  ceased to be oppressed by nightmare dreams of the great horror which lay beyond
                  the Potomac; and women no longer threw their arms around their children when alone
                  with them, under the impression that to-morrow they must be fatherless, even if
                  the loyal States should not be overrun by red-handed rebels and themselves
                  murdered on their own hearth-stones. Even the theatres had ceased to be a mockery,
                  and habitues had returned to the practice of their nightly visits; while the
                  crowds on Broadway looked again into the decorated windows dows and the ladies
                  recommenced their purchases of finery: so rapidly do we accommodate ourselves to
                  any novelty or any necessity.</p>
               <p>Thousand upon thousand of spectators gathered at Broadway and Canal Street, to see
                  the manly fellows in their natty grey Zouave suits picked out with red, and with
                  red shirts and the red chasseur cap, come out from their head-quarters and form
                  ranks for the reception of colors and the subsequent march to the place of
                  embarkation. Still other thousands lined Broadway from Canal Street to the Astor
                  House, down which the pageant was to pass. The air seemed literally thick with
                  waving flags and answering handkerchiefs, while every word was one of confidence
                  and joy and every shout one of unalloyed hope for the country under such
                  manifestations. Twelve hundred firemen were in the ranks, ready to meet a
                  different foe but scarcely a more dangerous one than that they had so long
                  battled,—when a little after noon the last preliminary arrangement was completed,
                  the ladies, the officers of the regiment, and the Committee of the Fire Department
                  had assumed their places, and a deafening cheer rent the air as the tall form and
                  high Norman face of Wickham<ref rend="super" target="#note_022"

                  <emph>were</emph> seen as he stepped forward to entrust to the Zouaves the special
                  banner prepared for them by the Department. And something of what the loyal
                  citizens of New York expected of the regiment was embodied in the words of this
                  man who had once faced death in a more terrible form than it wears upon any
                     battle-field,<ref rend="super" target="#note_023" xml:id="return_023">†</ref>
                   as he said: "People have high hope in you. You have established a
                  character for noble daring which has secured the admiration and the tribute of
                  all. When the fire-bell rings in the night the citizens rest <emph>secure,</emph>
                  for they know that the New York firemen are omnipotent to arrest the progress of
                  destruction. * * * You are called to quench the flames of rebellion, and we know

                  and that this banner will ever wave in triumph, though it wave in the midst of
                  ruins." Then, amid cheers yet more deafening, followed the response of Col.
                  Ellsworth, his sad, pale face, still vigorously earnest, at once foreshadowing his
                  reckless bravery and his doom,—promising that if ever the regiment came back, it
                  would bring those colors unspotted as then, and pledging his own life and the
                  lives of all his command to that sacred vow. There might have been a tremor in the
                  voice, though there would not have been a colder pallor on his young cheek, had he
                  known how soon his own share in that vow would be fulfilled, and what was to be
                  the fate of those colors, left uncared for, soiled and ragged in the lumber-room
                  of an old warehouse at Alexandria, while the regiment went to meet its ruin, and
                  only rescued long after, to hang ingloriously among the trophies of the
                  Department.</p>
               <p>Then followed, amid demonstrations not less enlivening, another presentation which
                  showed the respect and confidence borne in time of need by the millionaires of the
                  great commercial city, towards those whom they were in the habit of holding as
                  nobodies in the social scale under other circumstances, and passing without more
                  recognition than would be bestowed upon the most abject inferiors. The wife of one
                  of the quintuple millionaires of New York<ref rend="super" target="#note_024"
                     xml:id="return_024">*</ref>
                   had prepared with her own hands and purchased with an atom of her wealth,
                  another stand of colors to be borne by the Zouaves; and these were presented
                  through that officer who has now won the right to be considered one of the
                  guardians of the flag, from his noble command for the instant death of the wretch
                  daring to profane by lowering it.<ref rend="super" target="#note_025"
                     xml:id="return_025">†</ref>
                   This done, and the second presentation answered by the young Zouave
                  Colonel, the regiment moved away, under flaunting flags and waving handkerchiefs,
                  amid shouts and cheers and the sounding of martial music, and escorted by the
                  flower of the whole Fire Department, down Broadway to the Park and the Astor
                  House, where still another stand of colors were to be presented to this corps of
                  men who had all their lives been accustomed to few fabrics softer in texture than
                  the red flannel of their fire-shirts, but who seemed now destined to be smothered
                  under costly silks that the fairest hands had embroidered.</p>

               <p>It was nearly evening when, the presentation at the Astor House accomplished and
                  their steps on Broadway retraced, the regiment filed down the long pier at the
                  foot of Canal Street, to their embarkation on board the old Baltic, once so
                  proudly bearing her share of the honors of that Collins Line which disputed the
                  empire of the sea with the Cunarders, but ever since lying, except at long
                  intervals, in sullen and motionless discontent at the ruin of so brave a promise.
                  Was it an omen that Ellsworth and his Zouaves were to take their first steps
                  towards the armed service of their country, on board a vessel of that line so
                  sacrificed to national meanness and personal accident? Who shall say!</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland, from whose fortunes the course of this narration has seemed to
                  be too long separated, shared, as a private in the ranks of Company —— in all the
                  fatigues and all the honors of that parting ovation. The die once cast in his
                  choice of the regiment, there had been no falling back from his promise. He had
                  enrolled his name at the Carriage-house of Hose No.—the day following the
                  conversation before recorded between himself and Captain Jack, on Broadway, at the
                  time of the departure of the Seventh. He had announced the new course of his
                  destiny to his wife, the same evening on which the resolution was formed, and
                  thenceforth devoted himself to such preparations as seemed to be necessary for his
                  own welfare as a soldier and the comfort of his wife and family during his coming
                  absence.</p>
               <p>In another particular, too, he had been steadfast, prone as we all are to
                  vacillation when home or comfort beckons to a change of purpose, and few antitypes
                  as there may be at the present day of that La Tour d'Auvergne who preferred the
                  title of "First Grenadier of France" to any epauletted command that could be
                  tendered. Captain Jack, proud of his recruit, and a little astonished at his
                  stubbornness in such a rare direction, had mentioned him to Col. Ellsworth, and at
                  once received in his behalf an offer of a Second Lieutenancy. This Haviland had
                  declined, as he had before done the three<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7282-00000096"
                  /> stripes of the Sergeant; and this had ended the matter in that particular
                  direction. But he had been obliged to resist another temptation of the same
                  character, coming to him from a source altogether unexpected; and here he had
                  found an enemy more difficult to conquer—the evident wish and anxiety of his wife
                  that he should be "something more than a common soldier."</p>
               <p>The offer of Mr. Charles Holt, merchant, to continue the salary of his clerk while
                  in service in the army, and to look after the welfare of his family, has not been
                  forgotten by the reader, nor was it likely that it should be forgotten by either
                  of the parties interested. Though with a little delicacy involved in the action,
                  on the very day when he signed the enrolment, the clerk informed his employer of
                  the carrying out of his intention to enlist; and he remarked with pleasure, that
                  the merchant seemed to have no objection to re-affirm in cool blood a promise that
                  he might have made under the influence of sudden excitement, and that he seemed
                  rather pleased than otherwise to have the opportunity of proving his good faith.
                  So cordial seemed the great man towards a subordinate with whom his acquaintance
                  had before been only the formal intercourse of employer and employee, that he had
                  even offered, unasked, to "drop in and spend an hour at his house before he went
                  away." The force of the courtesy of wealth towards humble worth could not well
                  have gone further; and the clerk felt the obligation with a strength proportioned
                  to the straight-forward honesty of his own nature.</p>
               <p>Three days before the marching of the Fire Zouaves, the merchant, in the
                  fulfilment of this promise, for the first time set foot within the little home of
                  the clerk in East Forty-eighth Street. He was by no means a stranger to Mary
                  Haviland, as she had many times, during her husband's employment by Holt &amp;
                  Andrews, had occasion to call for him at the store, at the close of business
                  hours, and when some arrangement had been made for an evening down-town in each
                  other's company. An introduction between the merchant and the wife of his clerk
                  had followed as a matter of course, one evening when the former happened to put
                  himself self in the way of receiving (not to say forcing) such an indorsement of
                  the character of the lady who visited his clerk at the store. Not much
                  conversation had followed, then or afterwards. But the merchant, if he had not
                  conversed to any great extent with her, had at least <emph>looked</emph> at the
                  handsome wife of his good-looking clerk (<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Vide</foreign>
                  the past observations of Tim the errand-boy, on that subject.)</p>
               <p>Three days before the marching of the Zouaves, as has been said, the merchant paid
                  the promised visit to the house and family of the clerk. He found the wife sewing,
                  the husband reading aloud to her, little Pet playing sleepily on the floor, in sad
                  need of being put to bed, and Sarah too busy about the crockery-renovating
                  operations which follow supper (he caught the usual clatter of dishes from that
                  young lady, through the half-opened door between the two rooms) to attend to the
                  wants of the drowsy child. He found a very happy home, with nothing of the shadow
                  of coming disruption seeming to loom over it. If he experienced at that moment any
                  of the sensations which Apollyon Beelzebub, Esq., gentleman-at-leisure, is
                  supposed to have experienced on the first day when he paid a visit to Mrs. Eve
                  Adam at her neat little country residence on the Euphrates, there is no warrant
                  for recording the fact in this connection. He was cordially received, though with
                  a very little of that <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement</foreign> which the
                  proudest of us little people cannot avoid showing in the presence of the great.
                  But, a thorough gentleman (at least in the outward manner and when he chose), the
                  merchant did not seem to need five minutes to put both host and hostess at their
                  ease; find he had not been ten minutes in the room when Mary Haviland caught
                  herself saying (of course not aloud, for that would have been neither
                  complimentary to her husband nor his guest):</p>
               <p>"What a very pleasant man he is! So different from what he appeared to be, down at
                  his place of business! I declare that I really like him!"</p>
               <p>If the little woman did not say so much in words, her eyes showed the fact that
                  she was pleased, to those of both husband and guest, and both were pleased in
                  return. The merchant for reasons best known to himself, and Burtnett<pb
                     n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7282-00000097"/> Haviland because he felt how good and
                  kind a protector heaven might really have raised up for his wife and child, in the
                  event that his parting with them, so soon to come, should be the last.</p>
               <p>But if the pretty face of Mary Haviland smiled with pleasure when the merchant had
                  for a few minutes exerted his undeniable powers of fascination, it broke into a
                  broad glow of delight when he drew from his side-pocket and threw down on the
                  table before her husband, a Lieutenant's commission in the very regiment in which
                  she knew him to stand enrolled as a private! People have no right to be
                  enthusiastic and demonstrative, but some of them are so, and there is no power on
                  earth that can change their natures in that regard. Mary Haviland was as proud of
                  her husband as any woman can be of the one dearest to her heart without breaking
                  the command of God and worshipping the creature instead of the Creator. She knew
                  him to be good, she believed him to be able, and she thought it his right to be
                     <emph>great.</emph> She would not have doubted his capacity to fill any office
                  to which the will of the people might have elected him, even to the Chief
                  Magistracy of the republic. Could her own hand have lifted him to the highest
                  position, the task would have been performed as the mere according to him of a
                  right, and with no belief that he could fail to fill such a place with full honor
                  and high public approbation. She had infinitely more pride in him than he had in
                  himself, and was always disposed to think of him as scarcely having his place,
                  when she saw him filling any subordinate position. All this without thinking for a
                  moment that he had not risen fast enough, that any fault would attach to him if he
                  held a much humbler position than that he really occupied, or that he would not be
                  quite her equal if several degrees lower in the scale of respectability and
                  influence. Yet his being higher would have suited her better, not for her sake but
                  his own. She had bowed, as we have seen, to patriotic necessity and duty, crushed
                  down every repining, and determined to send him forth to battle with the
                  remembrance of a face that shed sunshine instead of weeping tears upon his
                  departure. And yet she had not by any means crushed down an idea which had crept
                  into her dear little head, and which she had not communicated to him simply
                  because she considered its fultilment impossible and its expression likely to
                  worry him—that he ought to go as an <emph>officer</emph> instead of a
                     <emph>private.</emph> He must go—yes—that was duty—the country needed him; but
                  could he not do as good and even better duty to the country, in command instead of
                  in the ranks with the common people? (Mary Haviland's husband was not one of the
                  "common people"—to her: Fiddler Joe, the darkey who plays for half the ambiguous
                  dances in Water Street, has a poor apology for a wife if she does not rate him as
                  a little superior to the average of his color—something more than a "common
                  nigger.") But Mary Haviland had not expressed this one idea of her mind, simply
                  because she would have thought it worrying for no purpose. Meanwhile, as the best
                  of husbands do not tell their wives every thought that creeps into their minds, or
                  the history of every adventure they encounter, Burtnett Haviland had said nothing
                  to his wife of the flattering offers made him. He had not done this, because he
                  intended to carry out the resolution he had formed—because he knew the pride held
                  in him by his wife, which would lead her to think that he should have accepted one
                  of the offers—and because he knew how much more difficult it would be, then, to
                  adhere to his determination.</p>
               <p>Such was the position of affairs when Charles Holt, merchant, laid down the
                  Lieutenant's commission on the little table, somewhat to the annoyance of
                  Haviland, who saw another struggle before him,—but, oh, how much to the delight of
                  the proud wife! We have already recorded the proper condemnation against people
                  being enthusiastic; but Mary Haviland, who has been (so far) the type of a devoted
                  and good little wife, could no more have resisted the impulse which led her, her
                  face all aglow, to rush up and grasp the hand of the benefactor with a "Ah, how
                  good you are, Mr. Holt! How very much we thank you!" than she could have resisted
                  any thing else that seemed to be unobjectionably correct and remarkably
                  pleasant.</p>
               <p>To the intense surprise of the wife, a shadow of vexation (one of very few that
                  she had ever seen there during four<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7282-00000098"/>
                  years of marriage) crept over the face of the husband, and he did not take up the
                  paper that she had supposed would so delight him, as he said:</p>
               <p>"I thank you very much, Mr. Holt, I am sure, for this great kindness, but I cannot
                  accept it. I have already refused a similar offer from the Colonel, and I am
                  going, in the ranks."</p>
               <p>"Phew!" almost though not quite whistled the merchant, in spite of the obligations
                  of good breeding.</p>
               <p>"What!" quite said Mary Haviland, without any propensity to whistle, but with
                  something nearer to a pout on her ripe and rosy lips than was in the habit of
                  finding a lodgment in that pleasant locality.</p>
               <p>"Just what I said, my dear," spoke the husband, in a tone which if not vexed was
                  more than usually decided. "I did not tell you that my Captain and Col. Ellsworth
                  offered me a Lieutenant's commission, but they did so, and I refused it."</p>
               <p>"And why did you do so, Burtey?" asked the wife, more in curiosity than in
                  vexation, now, and throwing in the affectionate diminutive without thought of the
                  presence of a stranger.</p>
               <p>"I had my own reasons for it, Mary," said the husband. "Please believe that they
                  were satisfactory, and do not ask me any further."</p>
               <p>The wife obeyed. Her vexation went away almost as rapidly as it had come, even if
                  her wonder remained; and she said no more. One of the little hopes of her life,
                  however, born but the instant before, had already been extinguished. That was not
                  much matter—let it pass!</p>
               <p>"And am I to understand that you mean to adhere to your determination, and to go
                  in the ranks when a commission is offered you without cost to yourself, Mr.
                  Haviland?" asked the merchant.</p>
               <p>"Unalterably, unless——" and here he paused.</p>
               <p>"Unless what—may I ask?" inquired the merchant, after the pause of an instant.</p>
               <p>"Unless—no—I will not ask the question." Had he done so, the inquiry would have
                  been whether the merchant considered the acceptance of the commission a matter of
                  pecuniary niary duty, as it would remove something of his own cost of paying a
                  salary during his absence.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you do not, for I think that I understand you," said the merchant. "I
                  do not like to be misunderstood." The tone, now, the least trifle lofty. "But once
                  more—will you not accept this commission?"</p>
               <p>"No," answered the clerk. "With a thousand thanks for the trouble you have taken,
                  and for all your kindness—no!"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry!" said the merchant. To do him justice, he <emph>looked</emph> sorry.
                  To do him still further justice, he <emph>was</emph> sorry. He was pleased that
                  Burtnett Haviland was going away to the war: he would have been infinitely better
                  pleased had he gone away as an officer. Why? Was this man so sympathetic that the
                  position of his clerk could interest him in that manner? Scarcely—in fact, not at
                  all. After what has been seen of Charles Holt in his domestic relations, it would
                  be idle to attempt further mystification, if any has indeed been carried on, as to
                  his plans and purposes. He was <emph>sending Burtnett Haviland away,</emph> so far
                  as his own action could influence that of the clerk, because he wished a clear
                  field for the attempted dishonor of his handsome wife. There!—the word is out,—a
                  plain, bold, bad, ugly word, but one that will not be recalled. Charles Holt's
                  "shoddy" propensity ran somewhat more deeply than the same vein in many others,
                  but not deeper, as there is painful reason to know, than in at least
                     <emph>some</emph> others of his near neighbors at that period. With the event
                  of his experiment, so far eminently successful, we have at present nothing to do.
                  The same pen which informed us how often the "best laid schemes o' mice and men
                  gang agley," also advised us of "the rough wind blawin' the heather bloom," and
                  the certainty that, once swept away, there was no power on earth to restore it.
                  The combat between vice and virtue is as old as the history of man; and if the one
                  has conquered at times, to the joy of the angels, has not the other quite as
                  often, making harsh laughter in those sombre realms where the lost welcome each
                  other? No one has a right to despair under temptation; but who shall presume upon
                  it, any more than upon human life, the continuance of reason or of happiness? Vice
                  is determined—virtue<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7282-00000099"/> is weak—God help
                  the best of us when under strong and overweening temptation, and recover us, if He
                  will, even when we have fallen!</p>
               <p>But even if this motive be ascribed to the merchant, why should he have exhibited
                  any anxiety to raise the husband from the ranks to the post of an officer? Why
                  benefit a man whom he was planning to injure in the most deadly manner? Why make a
                  man who was possibly to become, for the very best of reasons, his mortal enemy,
                  more powerful than he would be of his own choice? Strange and yet natural
                  questions, that cannot be left without answer. Kings used sometimes to ennoble (in
                  title) the husbands of wives whom they dishonored, or those wives themselves, in
                  order to make the game nobler for the royal chase; and contemporary records make
                  it almost certain that Alfieri, the Italian poet, and the Countess of Albany—wife
                  of one of the last of the Stuarts, and so by claim "Queen of England,"—would have
                  married instead of living illicitly together after the death of the Count of
                  Albany, but that the Countess thought it nobler to have the first poet of the time
                  at her beck and call as a lover, than bound to her as a husband, and Alfieri
                  himself found corresponding pride in being able to think that he had a Queen for a
                  mistress! But Charles Holt was not likely to be so daintily exclusive that he
                  could not approach the wife of a "common soldier," and must, therefore, make him
                  an officer; and the solution of his anxiety must be found in the added
                  probabilities he could supply, for <emph>keeping him out of the way.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It is just possible that the merchant, quick at figures and not yet entirely
                  oblivious of the "calculus of probabilities" mastered through such tribulation in
                  educational days, had been studying over army reports in the histories of great
                  wars, and making the discovery that of a given number of persons who go into
                  battle, ten or perhaps twenty common soldiers come out unharmed, to one wearing
                  the dangerous distinctions of the commissioned officer. It is just possible that
                  he had some premonition how assiduously those wild South-western marksmen would
                  devote themselves to the shooting of Union officers, as they certainly have done
                  in every contest from Bull Run to Gettysburg; and that he had heard something of
                  that "setting in the fore-front of the battle" which, for more than twenty-five
                  hundred years, has been considered an effectual way of disposing of a "troublesome
                  customer." We say these things are just possible; and if it should happen that
                  they were really taken into serious consideration, why might not Mr. Charles
                  Holt's investment, in trouble and perhaps in money, to procure Burtnett Haviland a
                  commission, have been found quite as profitable as any of his transactions in
                  rotten satinets, if he could only have conquered that stubborn will of his clerk
                  and decorated him with a gilt wreath on his cap, and a pair of
                  shoulder-straps?</p>
               <p>Half an hour after this peremptory refusal of the commission on the part of
                  Haviland, the merchant left the little house on East Forty-eighth Street, his
                  pulses more inflamed than they had before been by the beauty of Mary Haviland, his
                  ideas of the wisdom of her husband not materially enhanced, and one part of his
                  musings taking shape in the following muttered words (which neither the writer nor
                  the reader is expected to understand):</p>
               <p>"Two families in that house! Confound it! I wish people would live in houses by
                  themselves, and not huddle up in this kind of second-hand gentility."</p>
               <p>He had not left the house five minutes when the shadow passed away from the faces
                  of both husband and wife and the usual sunshine returned. The unfortunate
                  commission had gone away again in the pocket of the merchant, the die was cast
                  that it was not to be accepted, and neither Mary Haviland nor her husband spoke
                  further on the subject, except that the wife, summing up her impressions gathered
                  of the merchant during the whole visit, and speaking with that sweet frankness
                  which formed a part of her character, said:</p>
               <p>"I do believe that Mr. Holt is an excellent man, and I am sure that I like him
                  very much—very much indeed!"</p>
               <p>The days intervening between that time and the departure of the husband changed to
                  hours, and even those hours became few The parting was near at hand. Burtnett
                  Haviland knew, then, as he had never known before, what it was to exile himself
                  from all that had so long been the blessing<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000100"/> of his life. He did not often shed tears, though it
                  was not seldom that he <emph>felt</emph> them; and on that Monday morning when the
                  last pang was to be endured and he knew that the next sun would rise upon a wide
                  separation, it is no reproach to his manliness to say that he choked a little as
                  he attempted to swallow the dainty breakfast that Mary had provided with her own
                  hands as the <emph>last.</emph> Partings are hard, and cruel, and difficult,
                  precisely in proportion as the hearts that are to be severed have been closely
                  woven together and the companionship has been long and uninterrupted. And soldiers
                  who have spirit to dare, have yet hearts to suffer. Legendary history tells us
                  much of how Cincinnatus left his plough still standing in the furrow, with the
                  oxen yoked to it, and hurried away to use sword instead of ploughshare, when Rome
                  called him once more to defend her against the victorious slaughterers of
                  Minucius. But it tells us nothing of the hasty call he may have made at his little
                  homestead at Janiculum, beyond the Tiber, that lay directly on his road to the
                  scene of the great conflict, and told Racilia to send a slave and have the oxen
                  unyoked, and held her for one moment to his heart, her dark locks blended with his
                  own long fair hair, and patted the heads of his younger children, and almost
                  forgotten Rome and her needs as he wondered whether he should fall, this time,
                  beneath the swords of the Volscians, or gain such power and glory in victory as
                  would enable him to fulfil the one long wish of his heart and bring back to Rome
                  the banished Kæso. If he had no thought for this, he may have been an abler
                  general, but he must have been a worse husband and father, than we are prone to
                  believe him.</p>
               <p>Then came the parting itself. No pressure so sadly sacred, of the husband's arms
                  around the pliant form of the wife, had ever before taken place, even in the
                  little room so consecrafed to their married joys and confidences, as that which
                  encircled it for the last time that Monday morning. Never, he thought, had the
                  rounded arms of the wife been so clingingly fond in their pressure—a bond of the
                  rarest and tenderest human flesh, that a rude grasp could almost sever like a wisp
                  of straw, and yet a bond more difficult to break than any that ever encircled a
                  living form, whether for good or evil. Never, he thought, had she been so truly
                  the perfect woman, in the warmth of her caresses, the love-light in her eyes, the
                  glow on cheek and lip, as then, when he was to lose her for so long—perhaps
                  forever! Had all the powers that preside over destiny conspired to place within
                  his grasp, at that moment, all that the heart could desire, with the very object
                  of making the loneliness that should follow more intense and agonizing, they could
                  not have inspired a manner at parting, more maddeningly conducive to that end.
                  Perfection itself—no! not perfection. What, then, was wanting?</p>
               <p>We have seen, long since, the martyr resolution that Mary Haviland made, that she
                  would crush down within her soul the sorrow sure to come to her in the last days
                  of their union and so likely to be overmastering at the moment of separation—that
                  she would speak no more sad or foreboding words—that neither before nor when the
                  moment for parting came, should there be a tear on her cheek or a sob in her
                  breath—that she would not dishearten but inspirit "her soldier," and send him
                  forth with his last glimpse of her haloed with a smile which should be an omen for
                  his future. When he was gone—then—what the lonely walls of her room, her pillow
                  and the crib of her child might know—that was something which could not affect
                     <emph>him,</emph> and it lay between God and her own soul. Such had been her
                  resolution, from the morning when she knew that the die was cast, when the sad
                  picture of Valley Forge came up to the patriot as pictures of Gethsemane and
                  Calvary sometimes come up to inspirit the shrinking Christian with the memory of
                  how much worse trials and struggles than his own were once endured by the Man of
                  Sorrows. Such had been her resolution. What it had cost her to keep it, heaven
                  only knew, but she had kept it indeed. Not one tear or sign of hopeless regret—not
                  one word to indicate that she would have been happier had he remained. Not one
                  tear or one word of regret, amid all the expressions and the proofs of fondness,
                  on that morning of parting. And will it be believed that Burtnett Haviland, who
                  had so labored to impress upon her the duty which she owed to the country to give
                  him up without a murmur, even as he owed<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7282-00000101"
                  /> a corresponding duty to meet all its requirements with manly readiness—that
                  Burtnett Haviland, now and in the unwhispered thoughts of his own heart, would
                  have preferred to hear some word of imploration to stay, that he must entirely
                  disregard, and to see some tear of regret which he must leave undried upon the
                  cheek!</p>
               <p>These men are so unreasonable—the best and most thoughtful of them! "Do not weep
                  for me!" says the dying husband. "I will not shed a tear for you!" is the response
                  of the afflicted wife, who in the reply is only showing her implicit obedience,
                  and yet the dying husband grows almost angry enough at it to forsake his intention
                  of dying, altogether. "Console yourself, my dear! Though <emph>I</emph> shall be
                  gone, the world need not be a blank to you. Find some other who will love and
                  treasure you, and be happy!" says another in similar circumstances, with much kind
                  earnest in his voice. "I <emph>have</emph> been thinking that I need not live
                  alone, and I shall look for some one to fill your place, as soon as possible after
                  you are gone!' replies <emph>this</emph> obedient wife, and though she, too, is
                  only expressing her intention to obey what has been given as a solemn injunction,
                  the shock to the husband's <foreign xml:lang="LAT">amor propre</foreign> is so
                  great that he flounces out of the dying bed, upsets the stand with all its
                  doctor's phials, raves round the room, and recovers in spite of fate on purpose to
                  disappoint the jade who dared to take him at his word. No doubt Collatinus, when
                  he left Lucrece to join the camp of the King, said to her: "Make yourself
                  comfortable, my dear! Don't work too hard! Laugh, sing and be as happy as possible
                  while I am away." And yet the boast of Collatinus to the sons of Tarquin was, that
                  while others might probably be gadding about and making themselves merry,
                     <emph>his</emph> wife would be found eschewing all merriment during his absence
                  and soberly intent on her domestic duties! Very unreasonable, of course, and yet
                  very like what human nature has been doing every day since the flood. It is not
                  best even to accept any man's spoken estimate of himself, in the ordinary
                  relations of life. When he says: "Oh, I am a poor miserable devil!" it is not
                  prudent to address him as such in the next conversation; and when a lady murmurs
                  confidentially: "How I have faded! My eyes have lost all <emph>their</emph>
                  sparkle, and—only think of it!—I have no complexion left at all!"—it is an enemy
                  for life that he bargains for who accepts the conclusion or even does not flatly
                  contradict it.</p>
               <p>Had Mary Haviland been wise, as she was good, loving and patriotic, she would at
                  least have "turned on the water" (to use another gross but very expressive modern
                  vulgarism) and uttered some word of wild regret, at the last moment. She was
                     <emph>not</emph> wise—she was only brave and determined; and the result was to
                  some extent disastrous—more disastrous, afterwards, than the most lugubrious
                  prophet could then have imagined.</p>
               <p>But so they parted, with one convulsive clasp of Pet and one long embrace of the
                  wife, on the part of the husband, on the little stoop—with Sarah Sanderson, one of
                  the breakfast-dishes in hand, looking curiously down the stairs on the group at
                  the door—with the husband's "God bless you, little woman!" and the wife's "Do take
                  care of yourself, Burtey!" Then, as she stood on the stoop, with Pet clinging at
                  her side, and Sarah, dish still in hand, come down to the door and framed in it,
                  she saw his erect figure, in its neat gray Zouave uniform, pass out to the Avenue
                  and disappear into a down-town car. He was gone: she was alone. Through what was
                  each to pass, and how changed was life to be for both, long before the eyes of
                  each that looked their last should fall again upon the other!</p>
               <p>Only the recording angels and the heart of man that had been tried in the same
                  furnace of loneliness and suffering could see what occurred but a few moments
                  after, when the wife, lying on her bed in an agony of tears, with poor little Pet
                  weeping too and childishly trying to comfort her, buried her flushed face in the
                  pillow and sobbed out: "Oh, Burtey! Burtey! How <emph>could</emph> I let you go?
                  When shall I see you again? Oh, Burtey! Burtey!" And when Sarah Sanderson, hearing
                  the sobs and broken words that came from the little chamber, stood outside with
                  her own eyes full of tears but her pretty lips compressed and her face the very
                  embodiment of wronged and vindictive feeling, and shook her small<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000102"/> clenched fist at something that seemed to be within
                  the same chamber as the wife and mother.</p>
               <p>These latter had been the events of the morning. All the parade, the presentations
                  and the glorifications had since occurred; and late in the afternoon Haviland, a
                  private in the ranks of Company —— of the Fire Zouaves, marched down Canal Street
                  with the rest of his regiment, towards the Baltic, as was more or less clearly
                  said before this recapitulation of previous events.</p>
               <p>The scene was a magnificent one, and one long to be remembered. April was changing
                  into May, and every breath seemed such perfection that merely to live was a
                  luxury. No brighter or more glorious sun ever shone, than that which had all day
                  kissed the uniforms and flashed upon the arms and banners of the Zouaves. Nature,
                  at least, was offering them to unfavorable omens. And the spectacle at the foot of
                  Canal Street was if possible finer and more imposing than any thing which had
                  preceded it in the pageantry of the day. The noble steamer lay moored at her wharf
                  trembling with the internal fires that were in a few moments to be her
                  irresistible motive power. Flags floated from her mast heads, and from bow and
                  stern and the bridge between her wheel houses. Around her, stretching away as far
                  as the eye could reach, were vessels of every class and character, all radiant
                  with bunting of such glaring colors that a rainbow seemed to have fallen and
                  scattered itself in a thousand pieces on every where prominent, as is an undertone
                  sometimes in music when the variations flutter hither and thither and obscure but
                  never hide the theme. Out in the river beyond a hundred steamboats were gliding,
                  all radiant, too, with colors, and among them darted skiffs and wherries, seeming
                  like greater and less attendant spirits on the great event of the day. But the
                  splendid spectacle of even all these inanimate objects was dwarfed by the mass of
                  humanity grouped in the neighborhood and affording constant change in motion and
                  position. The decks, masts and shrouds of every vessel commanding a view of the
                  embarkation, the roofs and windows of every house supplying a glimpse of the
                  arrival of the regiment ment, were filled so densely with human beings, of both
                  sexes and all ages, that it seemed impossible to escape the crushing down of some
                  building, or the slipping off of some clinging mass of humanity into the river.
                  The space on the wharves reserved by the police for the soldiers, was kept with
                  the usual difficulty; and all was life, bustle, pleasant confusion and happy
                  expectation. Inconveniences there were, of course, and they were materially added
                  to by the presence at the wharf of a large amount of quartermasters' and
                  commissaries' stores awaiting transportation—barrels, bales and heavy boxes,
                  filling half the space within the enclosure, and seriously narrowing the room
                  allotted to the soldiers. But if the latter saw them, they thought, no doubt, more
                  of the certainty of food and other necessaries which those packages promised, than
                  of the temporary inconvenience caused by their presence.</p>
               <p>Some delay had occurred in the preparations for immediately embarking the
                  regiment, (did any man ever hear of a regiment that embarked at the time first
                  specified, any more than of a procession that moved until all the spectators along
                  the line had been wearied out by waiting?) and the Zouaves stood at ease and
                  partially broke ranks for a time, half an hour after they had reached the wharf.
                  Some of the soldiers took the opportunity of exchanging yet a few more "last
                  words" with wives or sweet-hearts who had followed them through the crowd (as the
                  wife of Burtnett Haviland, with better judgment, had not; for of all places for a
                  last parting, in the midst of a mixed and miscellaneous crowd is the least
                  dignified); and still others leaned on their rifles and chatted with friends who
                  pressed up to urge or promise the sending of letters during absence.</p>
               <p>A part of the first files of Company —— stood at that moment close beside one of
                  the piles of quartermasters' stores before noticed. Among those packages of goods
                  were some heavy boxes, one piled on the top of another to the height, possibly, of
                  a man's head. Immediately beside the spot where Haviland was standing, in
                  conversation with some of his old acquaintances come down to "see him off," one
                  heavy case of goods lay on the top of another, a little carelessly placed and
                  overhanging the lower one, so that no great effort<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000103"/> would be necessary to topple it over on the feet
                  and lower limbs of a person standing in front. Suddenly, while in the midst of his
                  conversation, but standing nearer to the boxes than any of the others and almost
                  alone, the upper box, evidently propelled by a sudden force from behind, toppled
                  over and made a rapid descent for Haviland's feet. Had it struck him fairly, as
                  there seemed a probability of its doing, the career of the young soldier would
                  have been ended, in that capacity, before begun, for the box had weight enough to
                  have broken a leg or crushed a foot to jelly. Haviland saw the fall just in time
                  to spring back and escape the worst, and some of the others partially caught the
                  box as it descended, so that the only effect was that it struck him somewhat
                  severely on one of the legs, crippling him a little and promising a stiff limb for
                  days.</p>
               <p>It is a very natural impulse, when something inanimate tumbles down upon any of
                  us, to endeavor to discover what has been the moving power; and Haviland, even in
                  the midst of his internal execrations and outward rubbings, looked hastily over
                  the fallen box to see what lay behind it. A policeman, who had happened to be very
                  near and see the operation, had his hand upon the collar of a nondescript object
                  in that direction; and one of the Zouaves, with both his hands on the other side
                  of the collar, seemed about to inflict summary vengeance upon it. Haviland was
                  obliged to look twice before he recognized little Tim, the errand-boy, squinting
                  if possible more terribly than ever, half crying, and disfigured by such a tall,
                  shiny second-hand hat, evidently just out of one of the slop-shops of Chatham
                  Street, and newly assumed in honor of the great occasion, that a want of
                  recognition was easily excusable. The policeman was about dragging him off: the
                  Zouave felt that he should be first kicked and cuffed.</p>
               <p>"Come along! I know you of old!" said the policeman, who probably had never before
                  set eyes on him since the day when he was himself first elevated to the dignity of
                  blue cloth and locust.</p>
               <p>"Let <emph>me</emph> have him! I'll 'tend to him!" said the Zouave, who had
                  belonged to a fire company very much in the habit of settling their own little
                  disputes without appealing to tedious and expensive legal proceedings.</p>
               <p>"I haint been a-doin' nothin'!" said poor Tim, thus held between the two
                  grips.</p>
               <p>"Didn't you push over that box, say?" said the Zouave. "Look-a-here, you can't lie
                  out of that, you know! I seen ye!"</p>
               <p>"So did I," said the policeman. "Let him go—I'll attend to him."</p>
               <p>"Stop!" said Burtnet Haviland, recognizing the errand-boy, and wondering what
                  could have induced such an attempt at injuring him by one whom he had before
                  thought warmly attached to him. "Is that you, Tim? You didn't throw that box over
                  on me, did you?"</p>
               <p>"May be I shoved it over, leanin' agin it," answered the boy, after the pause of a
                  moment. There was something in the pause, and in the whole manner of the boy,
                  which satisfied Haviland that he had indeed pushed over the box, and done it
                  intentionally. But why? That was the mystery, and one that there was not time just
                  then to inquire into. At all events, he did not wish to have poor Tim go to the
                  station-house, when he could not be near to keep him out of serious trouble; and
                  he said to the officer and to his own demonstrative comrade:</p>
               <p>"Let the boy go. I know him: he belongs in our store, and there must be some
                  mistake about it. He would not try to hurt me!"</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Hevlin, I wouldn't! Boo! hoo! hoo!" cried poor Tim, now fairly broken
                  down between thanks for the kindness and fear lest he might be lugged off after
                  all.</p>
               <p>The Zouave had by this time released his hold; the policeman, who did not wish to
                  lose his sight of the embarkation by going away to the station-house, also
                  released him, with the injunction:</p>
               <p>"Now get out of this, you young scamp, and home with you as fast as your legs can
                  carry you! If I catch you here again, I'll put you where the dogs won't bite
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Mr. Hevlin!" cried the boy, his knuckles in his eyes, and preparing to
                  heed the admonition</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7282-00000104"/>
               <p>"Good-bye, Tim! Go home, before you get into any more trouble!" answered Haviland,
                  and the boy scudded away, looking back at him, when at some distance, with a
                  concentrated squint which seemed to comprehend all things on earth and in the air,
                  and then disappearing in the crowd. Haviland rubbed his damaged leg a little more,
                  wondered a little more whether all parties had been mistaken or whether the boy
                  had gone crazy, and then dismissed the matter in the excitement of the
                  embarkation. A few moments after, the ranks were formed, the Zouaves marched on
                  board the Baltic, and yet another speech was administered to them by that Kentucky
                  statesman with the Roman name who had not yet become a Major General without
                  command and a foreign minister needing appointment to the same post twice within a
                  year. The Zouaves were by that time so weary of marching and speech-making, that
                  they cared very little whether they were being addressed by that speaker, who knew
                  nothing whatever about them, their natures or wishes, or by "Brother Corbitt,"<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_026" xml:id="return_026">*</ref>
                   who knew them from fire-cap to boot-sole. Not long after, they were
                  passing down the Bay and out to sea, on their way to Annapolis, and the pageant of
                  the departure of the First Fire Zouaves had faded from the eyes if not from the
                  memory of New Yorkers.</p>

               <p>Burtnett Haviland had of course left the address at which letters would be
                  expected to reach him most readily, at the store, for the benefit of any of his
                  brother-clerks who might wish to keep up the old friendship by "dropping him a
                  line." This had been posted on a slip of paper beside the stairway, where all
                  could see it—even those whose eyes had some obliquity in their direction. Mr.
                  West, who posted it, had little thought who would be the first to profit by that
                  little but necessary item of information. Late into the night which followed the
                  departure of the Zouaves, hour after hour over a greasy pine table in the garret
                  of a miserable old house on the East side of the town, with a sputtering candle so
                  near his nose that there was constant danger of burning that useful ful member of
                  the face or setting fire to the red scrubbing-brush above it,—with his eyes
                  rolling horribly, his tongue stuck out of his mouth to the full extent of that
                  appendage, and all the indications of the severest and most earnest labor,—sat
                  Tim, the errand-boy, with a stubby and spattering pen, thick ink and a
                  villainously greasy whole sheet of foolscap—writing a letter. Poor Tim!—it was
                  undoubtedly the first letter, worthy of the full magnificence of that name, that
                  he had ever written; and though the Thirteenth Labor of Hercules may have taxed
                  the full powers of that mythical hero, the effort was a feeble one compared to the
                  struggles of the errand-boy, trying to enrol himself in the list of "war
                  correspondents," to justify himself in the eyes of his friend, and to subserve the
                  cause of virtue generally. Those over-watching intelligences to whom we have more
                  than once before had occasion to refer, if they were keeping a sharp look-out for
                  the good of mankind on the East side, on that eventful night, may have been
                  peeping over poor Tim's shoulder and reading the odd scrawl which follows, barring
                  the actual chirography, in which capital and small letters, writing and printing,
                  were ludicrously mixed and jumbled, so that mere type would fail in any attempt at
                  imitation:—</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>HOW KATE HAVILAND, THE TEACHER, WAS CALLED TO THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT, AND HOW SHE
                     CONDUCTED HERSELF THERE—HUMILITY AND ARROGANCE—A TRAP, AND WHO FELL INTO
                     IT—WHAT KATE HAVILAND OVERHEARD BEHIND THE CURTAIN—MARY HAVILAND'S PICTURE—A
                     WHOLE HASH OF REVELATIONS—A LETTER, AND SOME ANXIETY ABOUT ANOTHER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF Kate Haviland believed, when she had succeeded in impressing the two spoiled
                  Fullerton children with some sense of her authority and winning commendation from
                  their mother and elder sister, that her troubles were over, or that her path of
                  learning (to others) was to be thenceforth one of flowers,—she was not quite the
                  wise and wide-awake girl that certain previous movements would indicate. The
                  ignorant, narrow-minded and purse-proud are proverbially brief in their fits of
                  satisfaction, and liable to go off at any moment into paroxysms of the opposite
                  feeling, for which they have not much more care than capacity to give an account.
                  They are cats: smooth the for the right way all the while, and nothing can be
                  pleasanter than their purring, even towards a dependant; but woe to the rash hand,
                  especially one beneath them in position, that happens to rub it the backward way
                  and evoke those electric sparkles which are so sure to be followed by an angry
                  yell and the tearing of the claws! From such people, for every kind word that has
                  before fallen, there are sure to be scores of sharp epithets and cutting
                  allusions, cancelling, ten times over, all the good impressions they may before
                  have made by their transient exhibition of winning qualities. Happy they who,
                  placed in dependence upon such people for the very bread that is to be eaten day
                  by day, have before entering into any relation with them, learned the difficult
                  art of bearing with patience, or that still more useful though less amiable art of
                  putting on the defensive armor furnished to order by contempt, and ignoring the
                  insults and undervaluations altogether! Which of the two philosophies was most
                  nearly in the possession of the young governess, or whether she could lay claim to
                  either, will be better understood when she has been exhibited in other phases of
                  her employment.</p>
               <p>She had been nearly a month in her charge at the Fuller-tons', and it was
                  approaching the middle of May, when the back of the employing cat received its
                  first stroke in the reverse direction. On the afternoon previous to the morning to
                  which attention is specially called, there had been what may be designated as a
                  "row" in the little school-room. Both Myra and Mildred, after a day or two of such
                  extraordinary obedience and goodness that the young teacher believed the
                  treacherous calm could not last, had solaced themselves by breaking out into
                  sullenness and rebellion. Myra had refused to pay any attention whatever to her
                  lesson in geography (in which study, by the way, she had since Kate's coming
                  managed to learn the difference between a cape and a continent), and when
                  reprimanded and made to stand on the floor for half an hour until she committed it
                  to memory, called the teacher by that forcible but inelegant epithet "a nasty,
                  ugly beast." This had led to the ears of that young lady being soundly boxed (a
                  mode of punishment for which we have no defence to offer, but one quite as
                  effectual as improper, sometimes). Thereupon Mildred, singularly reticent up to
                  that period, had communicated the startling intelligence that "her mother said she
                  [to wit, Kate] was a big black nigger and wanted whipping herself." In support of
                  which theory Mildred had "pitched into" the teacher and done her small devoir at
                  kicking her on a portion of the anatomy not commonly mentioned in connection with
                  a lady—namely, the <emph>shins!</emph> And this had led to the latter young lady
                  being placed in a horizontal position and soundly—to use another word which we
                  believe does not often enter into the material of modern
                     romance—<emph>spanked!</emph> Under this vigorous action the rebellion had been
                  brought to an early conclusion; but, as some other rebellions may do when they
                  come to their inevitable end or defeat, it had left evil consequences<pb
                     n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7282-00000106"/> quences behind it in its effect upon
                  society. Not that either of the children would have told of this little escapade,
                  any more than of some of corresponding character which had preceded it. Miserably
                  educated and half spoiled, with nearly all the vices which could well be attached
                  to the dispositions of such people, Myra and Mildred had yet shown that one
                  virtue—indisposition to tell out of the school-room what had occurred within
                  it,—on which Kate believed that something better and nobler might one day be built
                  up. They had <emph>not</emph> run away and detailed to mother or sister how they
                  had been beaten, bruised and mangled by the female Ogre of the Tree of Knowledge.
                  But unfortunately, in this instance, Mrs. Fullerton had happened to be within
                  ear-shot of the scream which little Mildred vented when subjected to that
                  peculiarly unpleasant "laying on of hands," and the result had been the calling of
                  both children into her presence, the same evening, and the extracting from them,
                  by threats of flogging them soundly herself, of such <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ex
                     parte</foreign> testimony as would convict Kate Haviland, in the same court, of
                  a most gross and unprovoked outrage against the quiet of the Fullerton family and
                  the peace and dignity of the same.</p>
               <p>While taking her late breakfast the next morning, Kate had been informed by the
                  dignified matron, with a chilling tone in her voice, calculated to freeze the
                  marrow of dependent people,—and with a frown on her brow, as Jovian as the
                  different sexes permitted, that she, the matron,. "wished to see her [the teacher]
                  in the front room, immediately after breakfast." After which the matron had swept
                  away, and Kate, who saw the storm gathering, had prepared for the ordeal with such
                  putting on of fear and trembling as her own slightly-jolly disposition rendered
                  possible. This was the situation of affairs when bonny Kate entered the room into
                  which we have been more than once before introduced, on the morning in
                  question.</p>
               <p>Cortesi made a terrible <title>Medea:</title> who does not remember her, in that
                  character and during the short opera season at Niblo's in 1858-9? When that proud,
                  massive, statuesque woman, with her eyes fire, her brow corrugated into whipcords,
                  and passionate love and hate shaking every nerve in her system until some awful
                  convulsion seemed inevitable—when she stood with a child in either hand, awaiting
                  the coming of their faithless father,—the impression on the mind of the auditor
                  was that in real life a woman possessed of the same nature and similarly
                  circumstanced, would not be a pleasant person to come home to! Mrs Fullerton may
                  or may not have seen Cortesi in that rendering: certain it is that on the morning
                  in question she looked only less terrible than the Mexican <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                     >prima donna,</foreign> and seemed to have taken a hint from her in position,
                  as she awaited the culprit, sitting in a high-backed chair in regal state, her
                  foot on an ottoman, and one of the outraged darlings on either side of her.</p>
               <p>It would be pleasant to say that Kate Haviland, on this occasion, maintained the
                  dignity of the family and was not seriously impressed by the aspect of the stately
                  matron. She did not maintain that dignity at all, and was evidently very much
                  impressed. She approached the seat of judgment with the true air of a juvenile
                  culprit—eyes cast down, a sort of shuffling hesitation in her gait, and only
                  needing the little finger stuck into the corner of her mouth, to be the very ideal
                  of the school-girl of twelve coming to be feruled. She approached the awful
                  tribunal, and there her eyes sought the floor yet more humbly and her hands
                  crossed before her very much as the paws of Van Amburgh's lion do when the courage
                  of the beast is becoming conquered by the mastering spirit of the man and he
                  wishes the gesture to say: "There—please don't use that rawhide any more on my
                  delicate cuticle, and I'll never do so again—never, never!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fullerton, who had been preparing a volley of vituperation to pour out on the
                  head of a self-willed and arrogant girl who had outraged the dignity of her
                  family, saw the humble aspect that approached her, and she was just a little
                  nonplussed by the difference from what she had expected. If the girl had been
                  defiant—why then she would have known precisely what to say to make her shrink
                  within her number-three gaiters; but what could she say to a dependant who was so
                  manifestly frightened at what she had done and so full of deprecation of the wrath
                  awaiting her? Paixhans, Dahlgrens and Parrotts may be all well enough, and
                     indeed<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7282-00000107"/> indispensable, when a stone
                  fort or a stout war-vessel is to be bombarded; but who would think of employing
                  one of those mighty modern engines of war against a tea-chest or one of the
                  kindling-wood cob-houses built by idle children? Jove might have no objection to
                  heating one of his best thunderbolts and hurling it at a refractory Titan; but
                  would not even Jove be a little ashamed to throw away such a ponderous bolt on
                  Commodore Nutt? Yet what was to be done? Allow pity to stand in the way of
                  justice, and thus encourage further departures from the path of duty? Never!—the
                  dignified matron declared to herself, emphatically—never! At least
                     <emph>some</emph> punishment must be awarded—at least <emph>some</emph> example
                  must be made of the offender. Ahem!</p>
               <p>"So, miss!" began the indignant mother, while Myra and Mildred, one on either
                  hand, leaned across the back of their progenitor's chair and exchanged the words
                  of felicitation following:—</p>
               <p>"I say, Mil! she looks as if she was going to be licked herself!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, don't she, though! And oh Jeminy, won't she catch it!"</p>
               <p>Both of which observations Miss Kate Haviland heard, and put them away in her
                  mental pocket-book for future reference.</p>
               <p>"So, miss!" repeated the matron, not having received any response from the palsied
                  tongue of the culprit.</p>
               <p>"Well, ma'am?" answered the teacher, humbly and inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"So, you have already been disregarding my positive instructions, it seems!"
                  pursued the maternal mentor.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, ma'am, I'm sure I don't!" half sobbed the culprit, who was either
                  dreadfully affected or a most consummate actress.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>do</emph> know!" answered the matron, the instinct of overbearing
                  demeanor rising within her as her dependant seemed to sink lower in humility. "You
                     <emph>do</emph> know! These dear children tell me that you have actually laid
                  your hands upon them in violence."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, ma'am, they couldn't tell you so!" replied the culprit. "Such dear little
                  things, that I love so much——"</p>
               <p>"Restrain any allusion to your <emph>feelings,</emph> Miss Haviland!" said the
                  dignified woman. "It is a matter of very little consequence whether you
                     <emph>love</emph> my daughters or not: you are to <emph>teach</emph> them, and
                  to treat them with proper consideration—that is all!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," answered the disgraced teacher—the same words, but uttered much more
                  humbly, that she had used on her original examination.</p>
               <p>"My daughters tell me," pursued the outraged mother, "that you last night
                  administered severe punishment to both of them."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, ma'am," again replied the teacher, "I couldn't—"</p>
               <p>"She did!—she knows she did!" broke out Miss Myra, associate justice at her
                  mother's right hand. "She slapped my ears, so," suiting the action to the word,
                  "just as if I was a cat!"</p>
               <p>"And she slapped <emph>me,</emph> too—hard—hard as ever she could!" followed Miss
                  Mildred, junior associate at her mother's left. "Myra seen her—there, now!"</p>
               <p>"And what were you doing, to make Miss Haviland punish you in that manner?" asked
                  the mother, with that knowing expression of the face which a counsel uses when
                  questioning his own witness on a point which he has before fully investigated in
                  private and is now bringing out in public.</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all, Ma!" answered Miss Myra, with such a look of injured innocence as
                  might belong to a Peri on trial for highway robbery.</p>
               <p>"Nor I neither, Ma!" chimed in Miss Mildred. "She just went and—and—and—spanked
                  me, for nothing at all."</p>
               <p>"Children, don't talk so fast!" said the mother, in a tone of reproof—very gentle
                  reproof; which conveyed: "Naughty darlings! How proud mother is of you!"</p>
               <p>Let it be said, here, that of all occasions for administering reproof on account
                  of treatment of children, the most appropriate is to be found in the presence of
                  the children themselves. If Mr. Smith has occasion to reprove his governess for
                  excessive harshness, he should always have the children<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000108"/> present when he does so, as it adds so materially
                  to the respect borne by them to the governess and puts all parties on such a
                  satisfactory footing. And when Mr. Jones finds it necessary to have a little plain
                  talk with his wife, or Mrs. Jones with her husband, about something in the
                  management of their darlings, and when a pleasant little domestic tiff, not to say
                  a quarrel, is morally certain to arise between the two—by all means the little
                  ones themselves should be witnesses of the whole affair, because they will
                  thereafter so much better understand the anxiety felt for their welfare by both
                  father and mother! The effect is still better if Mr. Smith breaks in upon the
                  governess with his reproof, at the very moment when she has just succeeded after a
                  long fight with a stubborn will and an ugly temper; and if Mr. or Mrs. Jones takes
                  the opportunity of administering reproof to the marital partner the moment after
                  punishment has been awarded to the child. In either case, a pleasant state of
                  affairs may be calculated upon at some future day; and nature is so just in its
                  compensations, that in such instances, at least, those who sow are very likely to
                  have the privilege of reaping the profitable crop.</p>
               <p>"You see, Miss Haviland," said the mother, loftily, "both my children agree as to
                  your action. I heard their screams myself, and there cannot be any doubt in the
                  world that you beat them both—beat them, I <emph>say</emph>—<emph>my
                     children.</emph> Now what have you to say for yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, ma'am!" answered the school-teacher, still in the same tone of
                  submission.</p>
               <p>"Nothing? I should think not!" said the mother. "It is well that you have that
                  sense of propriety, Miss, at least! I think you understood, when you first came
                  into this house, that your business was to teach these dear girls, and not to
                  impose upon them. Am I to understand that you <emph>now</emph> realize your
                  position better, and that if I overlook this misconduct I may expect better
                  attention to my orders for the future?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, ma'am!" answered Kate. "The dear little things, lovely and innocent as
                  they are, shall not be hurt on any consideration. But I don't think I could
                  possibly have touched one of them, for I never correct children under my care,
                  when they are behaving properly. I suppose, ma'am, that if either of the dear
                  little girls <emph>did</emph> misbehave themselves, you would wish them taught to
                  do better?"</p>
               <p>"Of course," said Mrs. Fullerton, with that sublime confidence that her children
                  could not misconduct themselves under any circumstances, which made the
                  authorization of no effect whatever. "But I do not believe, Miss Haviland, that my
                  children ever conduct themselves in such a way as to require what you are pleased
                  to call correction."</p>
               <p>"No, Ma! nary time!" asserted Myra, with a proof of the classic severity of her
                  education, broadly conveyed in the elegance of her English.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, Ma! We're always as good as—as—as—" and finally little Mildred thought of
                  the necessary comparison, more or less appropriate—"as rats!"</p>
               <p>"Now I couldn't have laid my hand angrily upon one of these little ladies, because
                  they are <emph>so good,</emph>" said the teacher, with something in her voice that
                  a little belied the downcast humility of her previous demeanor, and that made the
                  matron glance at her for the moment uneasily. "I don't think I have punished any
                  little girl in the last year, except two. One of them called me a 'nasty, ugly
                  beast,' and I boxed her ears; and the other one designated me as a 'big black
                  nigger,' and kicked me, and I am afraid that I took her across my knee. I think I
                  should do it again, with almost any lady's children."</p>
               <p>"Why that was <emph>us!</emph>" broke out little Mildred, fairly caught in the
                  toils. "That was what Myra said before she slapped her, and that was what I done
                  before she spanked <emph>me!</emph> See what a story-teller she is!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you <emph>did</emph> do something, then, my little dears, before you were
                  punished, did you?" asked the teacher, humble and downcast-looking no longer, but
                  erect and radiant. "Now, madam, you have at last got the truth, and perhaps you
                  like it! Have you any further directions to give me, how I am to manage these
                  children who <emph>never misbehave themselves?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Miss Haviland, you may take these children away to the nursery, and don't let me
                  hear any thing more about them for the next month!" was the reply of the dignified
                  mother, who was not too great a fool, even with all her pride, to realize<pb
                     n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7282-00000109"/> how completely she had herself been
                  victimized, and how the young girl, with her studied humility, had entrapped the
                  two ill-tempered and ungovernable children into betraying their own misconduct and
                  vindicating <emph>her.</emph> It is just possible that she mustered common-sense
                  and good feeling enough, for the moment, to be aware that the children were in
                  very good hands, and that the less intermeddling indulged in as to their
                  management, the more hope that they might not become altogether ungovernable even
                  by herself.</p>
               <p>But Madam was not yet to escape the trouble of her attempted oversight of the
                  education of her children, as it appeared. Myra had shown a cramp in her
                  hand-writing, giving reason to fear that she might be afflicted with some chronic
                  disease in her hand; and the teacher had been anxious to consult the mother on the
                  subject, without caring to break through her habitual reserve. And now a proper
                  opportunity seemed to offer. In a few words she expressed her fears and inquired
                  whether her employer would come to the school-room to examine the
                  writing-book.</p>
               <p>"No," said the mother, who had a not unnatural horror of places where children are
                  being taught—"bring the writing-book here, in a few minutes, after you have set
                  the girls their lessons, and we will see what is the matter."</p>
               <p>A very little affair, apparently, to decide whether she should step to the
                  school-room to make the necessary examination, or whether the teacher should come
                  to her in that room; and yet more actually hung upon that decision than any finite
                  mind could calculate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fullerton left the room, immediately after the conversation recorded; and at
                  the same time Kate Haviland, accompanied by the two slightly crest-fallen
                  children, took her way to the school-room. Some fifteen minutes afterwards, her
                  pupils set down to certain lessons to which they would be likely to attend during
                  her absence, very much as children in larger schools do when all oversight is
                  temporarily withdrawn from them,—the young girl, writing-book in hand, returned to
                  the room in which she was once more to have audience of her "patroness."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fullerton had not yet returned, and when she entered the room the teacher for
                  the moment believed that it was unoccupied. She stepped within, and had advanced
                  half way up the room when she became aware that there were persons within it, and
                  yet concealed, in conversation. It may be remembered that the windows of this room
                  were so deep as literally to form alcoves, and that they were shaded by heavy
                  rose-colored worsted curtains, besides those of lace which showed from the
                  street—so that persons sitting or standing within would be entirely sheltered from
                  observation by others within the room, and the tone of their conversation
                  considerably muffled. It is not for this chronicle to say that Miss Dora Fullerton
                  had arranged the upholstery of these windows with especial reference to their
                  convenience for flirtation, but recesses of this same character have been known to
                  be devoted to purposes very similar, and some Puritan fathers and prudish mothers
                  have also been known to object to their construction, on grounds displaying not
                  too much confidence in the propriety of male and female humanity. As a
                  lounging-place, Miss Dora somewhat affected it, whether alone or with company; and
                  that pleasant May morning, with air that even the million breaths of the city
                  could not make other than delicious, floating in through the half opened window,
                  it was certainly a most rational spot for a quiet hour of reading or conversation.
                  The latter was the purpose to which it was devoted in the present instance, as
                  Kate Haviland discovered when she had half-way crossed the room. One of the voices
                  she at once recognized as that of Dora Fullerton: the other left her in doubt for
                  an instant but not longer—it belonged to Mr. Ned Minthorne. There was, or should
                  have been, no reason for the sudden flush which came into the face of bonny Kate
                  on making the latter discovery; but perhaps it was only a secondary and remote
                  effect of the intense red which had burned over brow, cheek and bosom, nearly a
                  month before, at the moment of that unfortunate detection in the school-room; and
                  perhaps something mysterious and unexplainable which had occurred just before the
                  departure of the millionaire, that morning, had a little to do with this temporary
                  emotion. Temporary it was; and the young girl was about to leave the room, or at
                     least<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7282-00000110"/> to go out of possible
                  ear-shot, when one word not only prevented her pursuing that laudable intention,
                  but actually drew her nearer to the concealing curtain. That word—she could not be
                  mistaken—came from the lips of the millionaire, and it was "Haviland."</p>
               <p>"Eh?" thought the young girl—"something about <emph>me?</emph> What right have
                  these people to be making me a subject of conversation, I should like to know! Of
                  course I have no right to listen, but I must hear <emph>just one word.</emph>"</p>
               <p>And she did listen, and heard many more words than one. There is no intention of
                  defending this conduct on the part of the teacher, who, especially in virtue of
                  her profession, should have been fully up in all the proprieties of society and
                  indignantly incapable of listening to a single sentence not intended for her ears.
                  But it has been more than once before intimated that the scope of this narration
                  includes the representation of persons as they are and not as they should be; and
                  it is just possible that ninety-nine hundredths of the good people who at this
                  juncture feel ready to say: "What a perverted state of society that writer must
                  have habitually seen, or what a disingenuous mind he must possess—always to be
                  exhibiting his ideal women as peeping at doors, listening at curtains or
                  appropriating letters that do not belong to them!"—it is just possible, we say,
                  that ninety-nine hundredths of those very good people, under the proper
                  temptation, would do quite the same thing, or worse. And besides, good sir, or
                  madame, these are not "ideal women," at all, but real personages—poor fallible
                  flesh and blood, with all the hopes, fears, ordinary virtues and extraordinary
                  weaknesses, of humanity. They could quite as easily be depicted as immaculate;
                  just as a certain eminent photographer not long ago informed me of his
                  dissatisfied lady sitter that he really could not make the picture any handsomer
                  and yet have it resemble <emph>her,</emph> but that if she preferred it he had no
                  objection to making her a copy of the handsomest portrait in the gallery and
                  letting her carry it home as her own! Women, in romances, could easily be drawn,
                  of unfaltering propriety as well as unimpeachable morality: the great trouble
                  might be that they would not at all resemble ble the people of real flesh and
                  blood whom we met to-day in the street and will meet again to-night at the opera
                  or in society.</p>
               <p>Kate Haviland listened, and heard more than one word. Before she heard many, not
                  even the fear of Mrs. Fullerton coming in and catching her in that undignified
                  position could have drawn her away until she had heard at least a certain number
                  more. It <emph>was</emph> the name of Haviland that she had heard, and she heard
                  that name repeated. Evidently it had before been spoken by Dora.</p>
               <p>"Haviland? Haviland? A nice ambrotype and a deuced pretty face, you know!" said
                  the millionaire, inquiringly. "Haven't you got some person of the same name in the
                  house?"</p>
               <p>"Why how do <emph>you</emph> know?" asked Dora, in a quick, jerky voice.</p>
               <p>"I?" said the noodle. "Oh, I met a young lady—that is—a girl, I should say, the
                  other day on the stairs, and I heard one of the little girls call her by some name
                  like 'Miss Haviland.'"</p>
               <p>"Oh," replied the young lady. "Yes, we have a <emph>person</emph> of that name,
                  here—a teacher, from Rhode Island, or New Jersey, or some other outlandish place;
                  a coarse thing—"</p>
               <p>"I owe you one more for that, Miss Dora Fullerton!" said the listener, between her
                  teeth and so low that there was no danger of being overheard. "A 'coarse thing,'
                  am I? See if I do not make a settlement with you, before I am done, quite as
                  effectual as any that I have made with either of your spoiled sisters!"</p>
               <p>"No, if she is coarse, it could not have been the same person that I met," said
                  Minthorne. "She was rather pretty, I thought—that is—I mean that she was not—that
                  is, I have seen homelier people."</p>
               <p>"You have, have you?" spoke Miss Dora Fullerton, in a voice the very reverse of
                  pleasant. "I am really much obliged to you, Mr. Minthorne, that you don't think
                  her the handsomest person in the house, I am sure!"</p>
               <p>"Now really, Miss Fullerton—" began the millionaire.</p>
               <p>"Don't talk to <emph>me,</emph> sir!" said the young lady. "Come<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000111"/> into this house and fall in love with the
                  school-teachers, and the chambermaids, and even the cook, if you like, but I had a
                  little rather that you would not go to praising them to my face!"</p>
               <p>"How <emph>can</emph> you be so cruel," replied the millionaire to this very
                  sensible speech, "when you know—"</p>
               <p>"Know what, sir?" broke in the young lady.</p>
               <p>"—That there is only <emph>one</emph> face in the house worth any money—that
                  is—worth thinking about—you know what I mean, I am sure!" and the listener fancied
                  that about that time a hand was taken, or some other personal advance made towards
                  a reconciliation; for the lady's next words were in a very different tone:</p>
               <p>"Well, there! Don't say any thing more about it, and I won't scold you any more,
                  if you really like me so much. But don't look at that school-teacher again, or I
                  shall hate you!"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not—that is—if I meet her again I shall shut up both eyes and look the
                  other way," said the noodle, who certainly seemed disposed to adopt the most
                  effectual precautions against any further temptation. "But this picture—you know!
                  The name on the back of it is certainly 'Haviland,' and yet it is not a bit like
                     <emph>her!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No," answered the lady. "Not a bit like <emph>her</emph>—a great deal handsomer.
                  I do not suppose that the owner of this picture is any relative of the person who
                  teaches our children."</p>
               <p>"And if you do not know—of course it is none of my business—but a fellow likes to
                  be posted about all these things," said the millionaire, deprecatingly, "how did
                  you come by it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, funnily enough! ha! ha!" said the young girl, the laugh sounding strangely
                  discordant to the listener. "I do not know that I ought to tell you, but I suppose
                  I must! My brother-in-law, Mr. Holt, was here last night, and I found it beside
                  the chair in which he was sitting, only a few moments after he left. I suppose
                  that he must have dropped it out of his pocket, by accident."</p>
               <p>"But why he?" asked the millionaire noodle, who in spite of his known weakness of
                  mind, seemed sometimes to have powers of ratiocination and habits of sticking to a
                  subject, surprising even if they were not troublesome. "Why should <emph>he</emph>
                  be carrying around good-looking Haviland women in his pocket, you know?"</p>
               <p>"Bah! you don't know him!" said the lady, and the listener could recognize that
                  her tone had changed from the careless discordance of a moment before, not to
                  petulance like that which it had exhibited in the preceding customary quarrel with
                  her lover, but to low and concentrated bitterness like that of violent but
                  suppressed anger. "He may ruin us—destroy us all, if he likes, and if he ever
                  hears what I say; but Charles Holt is a scoundrel, and no woman is safe in his
                  hands. That picture is the portrait of the wife of one of his clerks. How he got
                  possession of it, I do not know, though I would almost give my life to know. What
                  I <emph>do</emph> know is that he has sent the husband away to the war, and
                  that—there!—what have I been saying? It is all nonsense, of course: don't ask me
                  any thing more about it! Don't!" And the listener knew that without any of the
                  petulant affectation which she had exhibited when speaking of <emph>her</emph> not
                  long before, she was choking down tears and sobs of anger, if she had not indeed
                  burst into unrestrained indulgence of the passion.</p>
               <p>And what was the effect of all this upon Kate Haviland? Precisely what might have
                  been expected, and very nearly what she deserved! People have no right to listen
                  to what is not intended for their ears, as has already been insinuated in this
                  connection; and those who outrage the rule must submit to the punishment. The
                  young girl, brave, self-reliant and not a little jolly, had within five minutes
                  been placed in possession of a mass of information that was scarcely better than
                  ignorance, while it had the power of making her exceedingly uncomfortable, and
                  perhaps imposed upon her onerous and painful duties without giving her the means
                  of fulfilling them. Something wierd and strange seemed whirling and dancing in her
                  head; her feet, as she turned to leave the room (for she had forgotten all about
                  the writing-book, now, and thought only of escaping from possible detection)
                  seemed to be numb and treading upon air; and it was really<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000112"/> with quite an effort that she succeeded in
                  ascending the stairs and gaining the privacy of her own little bed-room. There she
                  tried to think more calmly, and partially succeeded; though what would she not
                  have given, at that moment, to lay her dizzy head upon the bosom of Aunt Bessy,
                  and consult her as to the true meaning of all that she had heard! Poor child!—the
                  wisdom of the simple country woman would have been of no possible use to her: she
                  had gone beyond her aunt's atmosphere as well as her knowledge, and that which
                  required to be done required to be done by herself alone.</p>
               <p>And what was it that she had discovered, even partially, from the conversation
                  just overheard? <emph>First:</emph> that Dora Fullerton hated as well as looked
                  down upon her, and that any visitor at the house who even recognized her as of the
                  same flesh and blood with the family, was to be tabooed. That was no great wonder,
                  and for that she had been partially prepared from the first hour of her
                  acquaintance with the Fullertons. <emph>Second:</emph> that Mr. Ned Minthorne was
                  the strangest mixture possible to imagine—apparently part fool, for no man not a
                  fool, and possessing his wealth, would permit himself to be overborne by such
                  arrogant stupidity as that of Dora. And yet not altogether fool; for she could not
                  forget that one moment in her own school-room, weeks before, when he had seemed to
                  be a self-possessed, clear-headed, even commanding man—one to be respected as well
                  as obeyed. And not by any means at all simple or transparent; for evidently he had
                  not told Dora Fullerton, to whom he was engaged (so at least the children averred,
                  and she had no reason to doubt the statement), one word of his adventure with her
                  in the school-room; and she had just heard him give a false explanation of his
                  having seen her at all, something in his speech all the while indicating that he
                  was endeavoring to make sly discoveries with reference to her and to Dora's
                  feelings towards her. An odd problem, certainly, for clearer heads than the
                  puzzled little noddle of the school-teacher! <emph>Third:</emph> a corroboration
                  of previous suspicions that something was wrong in the relation sustained by Mr.
                  Charles Holt towards his mother-in-law. Once during the fortnight she had happened
                  to be present for a few moments when the merchant was in the room with both mother
                  and daughter, and she had seen that both bowed to him with a cringing and yet
                  defiant subserviency, totally different from their conduct to any other visitor.
                  And what, coupled with this, did Dora's exclamation mean: "He may ruin us—destroy
                  us all, if be likes, and if he ever hears what I say"? Some mystery of misfortune,
                  if not of crime, was certainly involved, and the whole family had a share in it.
                  What could it be, and how far would its existence imperil the comfort or the peace
                  of a resident in the household? Kate Haviland might even have been a witness of
                  the interview between the merchant and his wife, in his own house, and though she
                  would have been still more impressed with the existence of some terrible mystery,
                  and seen the degradation that had fallen upon Olympia Holt, another member of the
                  same family, yet she would have been quite as unable as at this moment to decipher
                  the strange hieroglyphics with which fate sets down the first records of all that
                  is occult and dangerous. <emph>Fourth</emph>—and the thing of most immediate and
                  pressing moment: a picture of her cousin Burtnett's wife was in the possession of
                  the Fullerton family, fallen from the pocket of Charles Holt, his old employer;
                  and it was a matter of remark in mouths not likely to jest upon such a subject,
                  that the merchant had sent away his clerk that he might the more easily accomplish
                  his dishonor! What perils were these indeed surrounding Mary Haviland? An hour
                  before, she would have staked her life on the young wife's fidelity and the
                  impossibility of her being placed in such circumstances as even to put her good
                  name at hazard: now, there were the words of Dora and the fact that the portrait
                  had been in the possession of the merchant, to make her at least pause and
                  consider. And yet what to do, granting that any such peril really existed?
                  Destiny, in permitting her to overhear that conversation, seemed to have set her a
                  task: what was it, and how was it to be accomplished? Speak to Mary Haviland on
                  the subject?—if innocent of imprudence, (and that she could not be guilty of more,
                  the young girl knew), and if the picture<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7282-00000113"
                  /> ture had merely come into the merchant's hands by some mere accident,—the
                  question might offend the wife, and at the same time establish for herself the
                  most detestable of all reputations, that of the spy and the meddler. Write to
                  Burtnett Haviland and tell him what she had heard?—that might establish the same
                  reputation in his regard, besides paining and worrying him, without accomplishing
                  any good. Was ever the brain of a poor little woman more puzzled, than Kate
                  Haviland's in that half hour in her chamber, before she had sufficiently composed
                  herself to descend to the schoolroom and attend once more to the interests of her
                  pupils?</p>
               <p>At length she did descend, however—found their tasks neglected and Myra engaged in
                  tying Mildred up to a desk with one of her garters, with the declared intention of
                  flogging her soundly with the ruler when she had got her into proper
                  position—re-established order in that troublesome community of two—and then, while
                  they at least for the moment pursued their studies, sat down to write—what?—a
                  letter to Burtnett Haviland, exhibiting at least part of the resolutions which she
                  had finally formed.</p>
               <p>Her cousin and herself had been very dear friends since childhood, though he was
                  some years the elder. She had been his "little wife" at school, under the roof of
                  the red schoolhouse at the foot of the hill and beside the alder pond half a mile
                  from Duffsboro; and when separated they had ever since been occasional
                  correspondents. Perhaps no one understood the odd, merry girl better than her
                  cousin; and when she met him they had always been in the habit of exchanging sly
                  hints and making odd comparisons, a little unintelligible and very nonsensical,
                  sometimes, to those who did not understand the peculiarities which seemed—so to
                  speak—to run in the Haviland stock. As a consequence, though Kate was in the
                  present instance writing with a purpose and a very serious one, she either thought
                  it best to spice the letter with her old manner, so as to avoid alarming her
                  cousin too much with her own apparent seriousness,—or found it impossible to avoid
                  the peculiarity. The odd mixture read partially as follows:—</p>

                           <p>Did I promise to write to you, before you went away? If so, here is
                              the fulfilment of the promise. If not, you are getting more than you
                              deserved or expected, and ought to be duly grateful to the overruling
                              providences for this little dash in upon the (supposed) tedium of your
                              soldier life. I do not know but I should have written you before, if I
                              had not been very busy. Apart from my duty of keeping these two
                              charming Fullerton children from unlearning any thing of the little
                              they know, (they have never learned any thing but that splendid
                              science—mischief!) I have been studying some abstruse problems in
                              scriptural antiquity. I have been very desirous to know what was the
                              precise market value of Cain's best brindle heifer; whether they
                              really were potatoes or only Jerusalem artichokes that Shem's pig
                              rooted up in Japhet's garden; who was the ship-builder that put a new
                              bowsprit into the Ark, and whether it was oak or chestnut; where Jubal
                              bought his fiddle-strings; whether Miriam's timbrel was a bass-drum or
                              only a darkey tamborine; with several other problems of great interest
                              to humanity. I have a big pile of books all around me, in seventeen
                              different languages and well thumbed, and when I solve any of the
                              questions I will let you know by telegraph. And now for yourself.
                              Don't get shot, and don't contract the bad habit, while you are lying
                              idle in camp, of playing division-loo for buttons. Especially don't
                              cut off the buttons from your coat to play with. Wash your face at
                              least once a week: you will find that healthier than doing it once a
                              month. Do you dreadful Fire Zouaves really set fire to one of your
                              tents every night, for the sake of putting it out with a cannon, or is
                              that only a story they tell? Let me know when you answer this, if you
                              ever do answer it. I wish you could pick me up a nice little nigger
                              somewere down there—a dwarf if you can find one. I want him for a
                              page, some day when I get to be Queen of the Cannibal Islands. If you
                              can't find me a dwarf, send me one of the ordinary style, not too
                              large, and I will put a stone on his head and keep him down. I suppose
                              that you hear from Mary every day, so that I need not tell you any
                              thing about her. She was well when I ran up the other day, and so was
                              Pet—well and kicking. (She kicked me.) By the way, an odd genius that
                              old employer of yours, Mr. Holt, must be. He must take a very warm
                              interest in you, for he had a picture of your wife in his pocket when
                              he was here yesterday, and dropped it out so that the family got hold
                              of it (I did not see it) and were admiring her and saying what a lucky
                              fellow you were. But now you have had enough of my gossip. Scribble me
                              something, some day when you have time, with a stubby pencil on a
                              piece of greasy paper (isn't that the way you soldiers do?) on the
                              head of a drum or the seat of one of your camp-stools.</p>

               <p>There were a few words of the conversation between Dora Fullerton and Ned
                  Minthorne, that Kate Haviland, running away when satisfied that there was to be
                  nothing more concerning herself or her family, did not catch. They were of<pb
                     n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7282-00000114"/> public if not of private interest, and
                  may be very briefly detailed as a pendant to this chapter.</p>
               <p>"Ma's letter, that was to go down to Montgomery?" asked the young lady, when the
                  excitement of the conversation before detailed had passed over. "I do not know
                  whether she has asked you about it, or not—I have never thought of it. Did you
                  send it?"</p>
               <p>"No!" said the millionaire.</p>
               <p>"What!" almost shouted the young girl, half springing to her feet, her face ashy
                  white with something like fear, and then instantly red with anger. "You did not
                  send it? You dared—"</p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Fullerton," said the noodle, who had been looking at her very calmly
                  and with that in his eyes which would have been close observation by any man not a
                  fool—"don't be alarmed! If there was any thing of consequence in it—"</p>
               <p>"You're a fool!—a miserable fool!" almost hissed the young lady. "There was life,
                  death, ruin, every thing in that package!"</p>
               <p>"Good gracious!" said the noodle—"so <emph>much</emph> property near Montgomery! I
                  had no idea, you know."</p>
               <p>"Bah!" said the young girl, speaking <emph>at</emph> the millionaire but really to
                  herself. "If Ma thought you were to be trusted at all, why did she not trust you
                  altogether? There was important information there, from the Men of the True South,
                  in this city, for President Davis. If that is lost, or if it has got into the
                  wrong hands, some of our necks will be cheap! Where <emph>is</emph> the letter? Do
                  you know <emph>that?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," said the noodle. "That is, I know where it <emph>was.</emph> Your
                  mother said that it was of a good deal of consequence, though I thought, you know,
                  that it was all about property—property is the main thing, after all—and as I
                  hadn't much to do—I never <emph>do</emph> have much to do, in the spring, before a
                  fellow can get away to some of the wateringplaces—why, I just ran down to
                  Washington and delivered it myself, you know."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! then the letter is delivered, after all!" said the young lady. "And what
                  was the use of frightening me in that manner?"</p>
               <p>"Why, <emph>I</emph> didn't say any thing to frighten you, I am sure!" said the
                  millionaire. "You asked me if I <emph>sent</emph> it; I said no. You hadn't asked
                  me yet if I had <emph>taken</emph> it, don't you see?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see!" answered Miss Dora. "But I wish, Ned Minthorne, that you would be
                  more like other people."</p>
               <p>"Which of them?" asked the subject of this complimentary wish.</p>
               <p>"Any of them that have <emph>brains!</emph>" was what the lady thought; but what
                  she said was: "Oh, anybody, everybody! never mind! Come—let us go down to lunch."
                  And to lunch they went down accordingly.</p>

               <p>IT will again be necessary to go back a little, in the order of time, that the
                  reader, who of course must not on an account be left mystified with what so
                  puzzles all the characters in the life-drama, may understand precisely what had
                  really occurred to affect the fortunes and the reputation of Mary Haviland.</p>
               <p>Up to Monday the 29th of April, when the Zouaves left New York—though a part of
                  the time absent from the store of his employers, Burtnett Haviland had drawn his
                  salary and applied it to the use of his family. After his departure, the
                  arrangement made by the <emph>liberality</emph> of Mr. Charles Holt, was that the
                  salary should still be paid weekly, as it had<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000115"/> been when the clerk was at home; and as Mr. Holt
                  could always command an errand-boy if no higher medium of communication, and as it
                  would be not only a slight inconvenience for Mrs. Haviland to go or send for the
                  weekly amount, but also a little sacrifice of independence to ask for what was
                  really not earned and only supplied by the kindness and public spirit of an
                  employer,—it had also been arranged that the money should be sent up at the close
                  of every week, the wife receipting for it in each instance or monthly, so as to
                  supply the proper vouchers for the accounts kept between the partners. These
                  suggestions had all been made by the merchant himself, and accepted by the clerk
                  with the thanks which seemed to be due to the nobility of mind which dictated
                  them. Though he could not, with any delicacy, propose such arrangements himself,
                  there had not been any sense of humiliation on the part of Burtnett Haviland or
                  his wife in falling into them, as public spirit for the military service of the
                  country just at that time ran so high that scores and perhaps even hundreds of
                  merchants felt that they were doing nothing more than their duty in continuing the
                  salaries of their clerks while absent, they being themselves incapacitated by age
                  or prevented by business from joining the ranks of the national defenders. It was
                  felt, and very properly, that while the clerk underwent the fatigue and bodily
                  exposure of the service, his employer was very lightly sharing in the onerous
                  burthen by paying him his salary as a sort of substitute. The merchants of New
                  York, and of other leading cities, reflected honor on themselves by pursuing this
                  course; and the manly liberality of those who made such arrangements and adhered
                  to them even when the first heat of the war-fever was over, cannot be affected by
                  the miserable "shoddy" meanness of many others who stipulated to make such
                  payments to the families of their absent clerks, repudiated the arrangement when
                  they were in the service and had lost the power to return, and literally left
                  their wives and families to starve except as relieved by the narrow public
                     bounty.<ref rend="super" target="#note_027" xml:id="return_027">*</ref>

                  <p><ref target="#return_027">*</ref>This was another phase of the "shoddy" which should be unshrinkingly
                     exposed, and would be so in this connection but for the impossibility of
                     gathering up the names now forgotten. Obligations to employers living or
                     dead were repudiated, in hundreds of cases, and many of those cases crept
                     into the law courts, from which the great-grand-children of the claimants
                     may possibly recover something. In many cases this most execrable meanness
                     was successful, the oath of the employer that he "never promised any thing
                     of the kind" being conclusive against the claim when the claimant was dead
                     or absent and there was no "black and white" to support it.</p>
               </note>
               <p>There was another side to this story, of course—a side with which private
                  employers had nothing to do and the swindling propensity developed itself among
                  those who pretended to be serving the country. When the regiments were hurriedly
                  organizing and it seemed to be the duty as well as the wish of every able-bodied
                  man to join them in some capacity, the public councils and heads of departments of
                  many of the cities (New York especially, again) announced that any of their
                  subordinate officers who wished to enter the service, would have their places kept
                  and their salaries continued during absence. Some of these, good fellows, took the
                  offer in the same spirit in which it was made, and went into the army to fight and
                  to return when the fight was over. Too many others saw a fresh opportunity for
                  money-making, and embraced it. They went into the army, it is true, but as
                  ornamental officers who could not and would not have any thing laborious or
                  dangerous to do, drawing large salaries in such situations and yet retaining their
                  well-paid positions at home, double duty to be meanwhile discharged by the
                  under-paid subordinates remaining at their posts. Or they took the still more
                  profitable positions of commissaries and army contractors, absenting themselves at
                  Washington or with the army in such very speculative "service," and yet drawing
                  their official salaries and having the name of being "patriots" who had "sprung up
                  at the call of duty" and "left every thing for the sake of their country!" Has
                  even the "shoddy" record any thing more contemptible?</p>
               <p>It is already reasonably well understood that Burtnett Haviland had no selfish or
                  money-making intentions when he accepted his employer's offer and enrolled his
                  name among the First Fire Zouaves. Let it be equally well understood that Charles
                  Holt had no intention of repudiating his promise to pay his salary and to "provide
                  for his family" during his absence<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7282-00000116"/>
                  sence. If there was any danger whatever, it was that he might "provide" for them
                  too well! Punctuality was among the merchant's leading virtues. The regiment had
                  gone away on Monday, and a week's salary was due on the Monday following. That
                  very evening he presented himself at the house on East Forty-eighth Street, to
                  perform the noble duty of Lord Almoner in person instead of entrusting it to a
                  mere subordinate. Of course this was delicacy—pure delicacy. Who could say that
                  the mere subordinate might not rush roughly in, throw down the stipend with a
                  coarse: "Here's your money, Ma'am!' as if she had been a pauper on the town, and
                  rush out again as roughly?—while <emph>he</emph> could hand over that money with
                  the delicacy of a true gentleman and such courtesy with the delicacy of a true
                  gentleman and such courtesy that the taking of it might seem to be a favor
                  conferred upon him instead of the opposite. Pure delicacy—we say again.
                  By-and-bye, when the situation had grown to be a more accustomed one and less
                  danger of lacerated feeling would be involved the subordinate, even the
                  errand-boy, might be trusted: not now. So the merchant made the personal visit
                  indicated.</p>
               <p>There are few prettier human pictures to be found in a long search, than Mary
                  Haviland presented as she herself answered the bell at the summons of the
                  merchant, and stood in the doorway inviting him to enter. It was past dusk, and
                  the light of the lamp in the lower hall shone like a glory full upon her blonde
                  hair and threw her neat and compact figure into the most admirable and rounded
                  relief. Then the hand that she extended in welcome when she recognized her
                  husband's kind friend and employer, was so creamy white and so taper, and it was
                  given with such evident warmth and good feeling, that had the merchant not been
                  beyond a new incitement in that direction, one might easily have been created by
                  the proximity.</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Holt. How kind you are to come!" said the
                  guileless wife, merely thinking of the call as one of personal friendship. But in
                  an instant she remembered that the call might have a pecuniary motive, and that
                  her words of gladness might be supposed to refer to that. Whereupon she wished,
                  for a moment, that there was no such thing as money in the world, or that her own
                  tongue was better regulated, and blushed a dear little faint roseate blush that
                  just tinted her forehead and cheeks and made her ten times handsomer than ever.
                  But the tongue had other offices, it fulfilled them, and by the time the little
                  blush had fairly died away, the merchant had accepted her invitation and followed
                  her up the stair to the little front parlor. In another moment the chandelier was
                  lighted, and the two were seated in conversation, with the apparent freedom from
                  restraint of very old friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Charles Holt, merchant, was an incarnate man of the world, all the keenest and
                  worst senses of that phrase being embodied in his description. Not a
                     <emph>wise</emph> man, for no scoundrel is truly wise, even the wisdom of this
                  world being alone taken into the calculation,—but a <emph>keen</emph> and
                     <emph>subtle</emph> one, those qualities sometimes supplying the place of the
                  nobler with very good effect. He had been educated in nearly every school, from
                  the college to the casino, from the banking-house to the bagnio. He had as many
                  faces as any Hindu god in the whole Brahminical calendar—each one as sharp and
                  clear cut as one of the facets of a diamond. Unfortunately, in this relation, we
                  have seldom occasion to see more than two facets, the defiant and the villainous.
                  Meeting three different strangers within a given ten minutes, the chances were
                  that he would find occasion to present a different face to each, and that the
                  impressions formed of him by each would be so different that a fight could easily
                  be engineered on the principle of the gold and silver sides of the same shield.
                  Perhaps he cared as little for literature, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per
                     se,</foreign> as any man of the age; and yet he could read Byron with force and
                  propriety, and make any new acquaintance believe, within five minutes, that he was
                  a devoted lover of the poetical and the tender, without one grain of the hard or
                  the practical in his disposition. He was not scrupulously moral (this may have
                  been indicated before), and yet he could and would preach such a Puritanical
                  sermon when occasion required, that old Plymouth Rock would almost have tingled
                  with delight to hear him. His attachment to the marriage bond was not such as to
                  make him lose his nightly rest in grieving over the numerous infractions<pb
                     n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7282-00000117"/> of that sacred tie constantly supposed
                  to be occurring (this, too, may have been before indicated); and yet he could so
                  inveigh against Free Love and Mormonism that neither Stephen Pearl Andrews nor
                  Orson Hyde would have allowed him within ten miles of their
                  supposed-to-be-different-but-really-similar conventicles. Given five minutes for a
                  change of auditors and motive, and he could and would take the very reverse on any
                  one of these subjects or any one of an hundred others. He was, in short, "all
                  things to all men"—a man of great versatility and power, with strong enterprise
                  and wonderful ability of acquiring, retaining and managing wealth, with insatiable
                  and most unscrupulous appetites—a bold, bad, dangerous man, and yet with something
                  shining through all, which indicated that he had at some time in life received
                  some hard blow from the world and was taking a Luciferian delight in achieving
                  those revenges which are all that remain to the lost spirit.</p>
               <p>If there was any one science that Charles Holt had thoroughly mastered, it was
                  that of <emph>approach,</emph> just as the French Emperor has made it his
                  speciality to <emph>learn to wait.</emph> He never approached people in that way
                  so graphically described by some of the rough-talkers—"wrong end foremost." He was
                  generally unerring in his judgment of time and place, and would no more have
                  thought of approaching a widow at the grave-yard, before she had returned from the
                  funeral of her husband, than a bride only two days after marriage or an outraged
                  wife at the moment when she was smarting under fierce jealousy of her husband.<ref

                   He would no more have dreamed of hinting at improper personal regard for
                  Mary Haviland, before creeping into her confidence by initial steps, than he would
                  of sawing off his own head, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la</foreign> "Richard No. 3"
                  of the old Mitchell's Olympic days. He had one unfailing mode of approach, and he
                  knew it and intended to practice it. A part from any personal experience in that
                  direction, he had read "Never Too Late to Mend," and knew why Susan Merton
                  tolerated Meadows' company when poor George Fielding was away in Australia. His
                  first approach was <emph>to speak to her of her husband.</emph>

               </note>
               <p>This he did, on the evening in question, with the apparent warmth of a true friend
                  and the admiration of a brother patriot. He spoke of his business talents, the
                  loss to the force at the store which he was found to be, the pity that he should
                  be called away, his noble spirit in espousing his country's cause, and the
                  loneliness which the wife must feel during his absence. In ten minutes he had won
                  poor little Mary Haviland's heart even more than before (won it, of course, in
                  that inoffensive sense which allowed no thought of coldness or disloyalty to her
                  husband); and when, half an hour later and after picking up a book from the table
                  and reading two or three of Whittier's poems with excellent intonation and
                  feeling, and after performing the pecuniary portion of his errand with such tact
                  that it merely seemed to be one of the highbred courtesies of a society something
                  above her own—when all this had been done and the merchant rose to go away, it was
                  no marvel whatever that the young wife accompanied him to the door with
                  undisguised pleasure at the visit beaming upon her face,—and that when he took her
                  soft little hand in his own daintily-gloved palm at parting, and held it for the
                  just one instant longer than strict propriety would have allowed, she neither
                  frowned, uttered any petulant remark, nor jerked it away.</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland returned up-stairs less lonely than she had been since the departure
                  of her husband, and very much pleased—very much indeed—with her late visitor and
                  the chance which had thrown around her, to some extent, the protecting care of so
                  noble a man and so true a friend of Burtnett Haviland as his employer!</p>
               <p>Charles Holt, merchant, stepped briskly towards the Third Avenue and across to the
                  Fifth before taking his course downtown, rubbing his hands meanwhile and more than
                  once clapping them together as if patting applause to some capital actor who had
                  just made an excellent point. He <emph>was</emph> applauding a capital
                  actor—himself; and he believed that he had made an excellent point in the
                  impression created by his personal manners on the wife of his clerk, and the
                     assurance<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7282-00000118"/> he had given her that he
                  was the true and warm friend of her husband! So far, so good; indeed, very good:
                  the rest would come in due time.</p>
               <p>Yet what would he not have given, he thought, to be able to follow up that
                  impression before it had time to cool! This could not be, for under no
                  circumstances could he find an excuse for visiting the little house on East
                  Forty-eighth Street before the next Monday, and meanwhile he must fret—yes, fret
                  and burn, under the consciousness of <emph>time wasted.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>But there are unquestionably ministering spirits watching over the evil as well as
                  the good, and affording opportunities to the one as well as the other. Less than
                  forty hours after, and when this thought was yet fresh in his mind, he had
                  occasion to pull open a drawer in the counting-room to which any of the senior
                  clerks had access; and he chanced upon a perfect placer of valuables—for
                     <emph>him.</emph> Nothing that would have brought fifty cents if offered at
                  auction, and yet at the moment of the discovery the merchant felt that they
                  enriched him more than a contract to supply rotten satinet or sleezy cloth for
                  clothing for ten regiments, could have done. A little memorandum-book, bearing the
                  name of Burtnett Haviland and partially filled with private notes in pencil; a
                  white silk handkerchief marked with his initials; a volume of Gerald Massey, with
                  his name on the fly leaf; and last of all but more than all, an old but excellent
                  little ambrotype of Mary Haviland, in a morocco case stamped with her name. Here
                  was a placer, indeed—and all his own. The ambrotype was a charming one, the soft
                  rounded features and blonde hair having taken well in it, as they oftener do in
                  that description of picture than any other, and the dust upon the case indicating
                  that it must have lain in the drawer for a considerable period and been forgotten.
                  That he would keep, at all hazards, and feed the fire in his blood by gazing upon
                  the sweet face at his leisure. As for the memorandum-book, the handkerchief and
                  the volume of poems—they would furnish him the very excuse that he coveted, for
                  "dropping in" again at the house of the original, at once, and with the
                  opportunity of creating a deeper impression of his care and anxiety for her
                  welfare, instead of any danger of awakening suspicion.</p>
               <p>This programme was strictly carried out. The evening of that day saw the merchant
                  again at the house on East Forty-eighth Street, and once more in the presence of
                  its young mistress. He found the gratitude he had expected, for the restoration of
                  the handkerchief and the memorandum-book, which however seemed to be valued only
                  (he was obliged to note) because they furnished additional reminders of the absent
                  husband; and if he had a momentary pang at seeing the young wife furtively convey
                  to her lips the book that contained his hand-writing, he was consoled by the fact
                  that she did not ask after the ambrotype and evidently did not know or had
                  forgotten its having been in her husband's possession. With reference to the
                  kissing of the book, it is only justice to Charles Holt to say that he was rather
                  prepared for than surprised at that manifestation. If husbands cannot prevent
                  little infringements on their marital rights by wide-awake and unscrupulous men of
                  the world, those men of the world, constituting themselves lovers, are sometimes
                  obliged to witness very painful indications of attachment in the wives towards
                  their husbands, by which they, the lovers, are defrauded, but to which they have
                  never yet been able to establish a formula of objection. This Charles Holt knew by
                  sad experience, and being prepared to make due allowance he did not suffer so much
                  from the yet existing attachment of Mary Haviland to her husband, shown by the
                  pressure of her lips to the memorandum-book, as he might have done had he never
                  before seen such a proof of weakness.</p>
               <p>This time, as the visit was somewhat early and the spirit of sleep had not yet
                  sealed up the eyes of that young person, Pet came into the arena and furnished the
                  merchant with another instrumentality for ingratiating himself into the good
                  graces of the mother. He took the sweet little child upon his knee, talked
                  baby-talk to her that seemed to come with a strange grace from lips that could be
                  so severe, ran his fingers through her clustering curls and remarked (with a long
                  look of admiration at the latter which he would not have cared to hazard without
                  that excuse) that her hair was a shade darker than her mother's, but would
                  scarcely be so silkily beautiful<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7282-00000119"/> as
                  hers when she grew up; then kissed her with much fatherly kindness and a
                  side-glance which might have said to a wiser than Mary Haviland that he would have
                  preferred to kiss older and riper lips instead, and finally yielded her to Sarah
                  Sanderson and Morpheus with a tenderness which conveyed to the flattered mother:
                  "How blessed should I be if <emph>I</emph> had such a child!"</p>
               <p>Then his powers of reading came again into play—not as if he had any intention of
                  "showing them off," but as if he read in the same unstudied way as the birds sing.
                  Haviland, a lover of the wierdly beautiful, had Praed in his little bookcase, and
                  his unsuspected guest read the "Bridal of Belmont" and the "Legend of the Haunted
                  Tree" so pleasantly and naturally that the young hostess, as she pursued with her
                  fingers the sawing which she could not quite forego even for so honored a visitor,
                  found herself borne insensibly back to the times when belted knights and noble
                  ladies rode through the English greenwood, and when there was yet life and revelry
                  in the grim old castles that now frown down on the Rhine tourist.</p>
               <p>And when he laid by the book with an audible sigh, glanced at his watch and arose
                  to go, with a look which said: "I have been so many minutes in Paradise: now for
                  so many hours of banishment!" was there not an answering sigh in the breast of the
                  young wife, and did she not feel that by some pleasant chance a member of society
                  higher than her own, of experience wider and views of the world more
                  comprehensive, had suddenly been thrown into the current of her life, at the
                  moment when she would otherwise have been so lonely without that accident,—and
                  that she was very happy in his society? It is almost certain that this question
                  must be answered in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>And had the young wife, only a few days parted from her husband, already forgotten
                  him or learned to undervalue him? And was there an answering throb in her heart to
                  the evil passions surging up within the breast of the libertine merchant? No!—a
                  thousand times No! to each of these questions. Not one clinging tendril of her
                  love had fallen away from her husband: not one impure thought had crossed her mind
                  or could cross her mind without being shuddered at and started from like a horrid
                  reptile meeting her in some summer path. Her tempter had yet to learn, perchance,
                  the wide difference between merely dazzling the fancy of a true woman, and
                  touching her heart or poisoning the fountain of her truth. Perchance, we say: let
                  the result be duly waited for. And meanwhile let all remember that these
                  distinctions, though positive, are narrow, and that there <emph>is</emph> a road
                  to the heart and the life, through the fancy, which sometimes betrays and often
                  endangers.</p>
               <p>When Charles Holt, again ushered to the door by the young hostess, and again
                  holding that soft little hand in his own for a single instant as he took it, left
                  the house on that second evening, the insatiate devil within him raged fiercely
                  and triumphantly. His keen eyes saw how the glamour had fallen over the eyes of
                  the wife, while they could <emph>not</emph> see the purity and truth that lay as a
                  reserved force at the bottom of her character. He should triumph—he knew that he
                  should triumph—much more quickly than he had ever believed; and then—the future
                  must take care of itself, and he had wealth, power and will to mould even human
                  hates and revenges to his own purpose.</p>
               <p>When Charles Holt left the house that evening, the young wife, except that she
                  felt herself even more than before pleased with his company and conversation, did
                  not realize that any change had taken place in her own position towards her
                  husband or the world. And yet a marked change <emph>had</emph> taken place, the
                  after results of which were to be of the most painful and almost irretrievable
                  character. Mary Haviland might have realized the fact, had she known the real
                  composition of her own household; but of this, as we have before seen, she could
                  have no idea. Sarah Sanderson was to her a mere humble companion and "help": she
                  was very nearly or quite to be her <emph>fate.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Like attracts like with wonderful certainty and celerity—the remark is a truism.
                  Evil is especially cognizant of evil. What the pure eyes of the young wife could
                  not see, the jealous and jaundiced orbs of Sarah Sanderson saw without an effort.
                  A strange mixture of weakness and wickedness,<pb n="252-253"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000120"/> with only possibilities of goodness,—she had yet
                  strength in her passions and in the powers of observation which they engendered.
                  She had seen, even through the narrow doorway, on the first evening, how the face
                  of the merchant was all smooth and gentlemanly decorum without, all fierce and
                  reckless passion below the surface. She had seen, too, how the young wife received
                  his attentions with more sincere pleasure than she had ever before shown in the
                  presence of any one except her husband. Then had occurred the second meeting, and
                  on one pretext and another the young girl had passed in and out, overheard
                  snatches of the conversation, and seen how the eyes of the wife showed even more
                  pleasure than before and how the face of the visitor shone with yet more terribly
                  concentrated passion through his mask. And then had arisen the thought—it was her
                  time!—the opportunity of her life had come!</p>
               <p>It is no secret, with what an unreasonable and hopeless affection the young girl
                  had for years regarded Burtnett Haviland, nor how, living in the same house with
                  himself and his wife, she had weakly and without purpose hated the latter. Here
                  came the purpose with the opportunity, full-born from her brain at once, albeit
                  probably she had never heard of Minerva or the Jovian plan of reproduction. Here
                  was a proud and powerful man, who would become the lover of the wife if possible.
                  If he could do so, then would she be lost to the husband forever; for Haviland was
                  not the man, as she well knew, to brook infidelity of the heart more than that of
                  the body. Then would he be free, or at least there would stand no one between him
                  and herself. But suppose the wife should resist—what then? Then all would remain
                  as before, and she would be still an outcast. No—here came another thought into
                  the warped and perverted mind—why should she be? Suppose that the wife should
                  remain pure and loyal, would it not serve every purpose if the husband could be
                  brought to <emph>believe</emph> her false and so induced to cast her off forever?
                  The ground for suspicion once given in the visits of the merchant, it would be
                  strange if she could not play into his hands to effect the absolute ruin of the
                  woman she hated, or at least manage to destroy her by weaving around her the
                  appearances of guilt. From that moment the latent malice became the active and the
                  practical; and in that change what a perilous net became woven around the feet of
                  Mary Haviland!</p>
               <p>The Monday evening following, when the next week's salary was due the family of
                  the absent soldier, brought the third visit of the merchant, who, if he held out
                  as he began, was not at all likely to need the aid of any errand-boy in
                  transacting his business in that particular section of the town. This time the
                  fates favored him in another special regard. When he reached the house he was
                  admitted by Sarah instead of the hostess, and he found the latter absent and not
                  yet to return for half an hour. Through the door between the two rooms he saw that
                  the supper table was in readiness and little Pet playing on the floor with a pussy
                  nearly as large as herself. He took his seat in the front room, the girl lighted
                  the gas and when she had done so went back to her employment in the dining-room.
                  The merchant trifled with a book, called the child, who did not seem disposed to
                  desert the cat for his company, and eventually called the girl herself, who obeyed
                  the summons with great alacrity. He had just thought of something that might be of
                  importance, and the absence of Mrs. Haviland afforded him an excellent opportunity
                  to put his thought into practice. Who could tell that he might not need the
                  co-operation of the servant, who was, as his eyes had told him the first time he
                  looked at her attentively, pretty, vain and not too scrupulous? An ally is a good
                  thing to have in any house where an important operation is to be performed; and
                  people whose God is Success instead of Right do not always keep close hold of that
                  rule which forbids to "speak of things in the Kitchen that are forbidden in the
                  parlor." So the merchant called Mary Haviland's "help," and she came at once.</p>
               <p>"Your name is Sarah, is it not?" asked the merchant.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," answered the girl, with a not ungraceful attempt at a courtesy—"Sarah
                  Sanderson."</p>
               <p>"A pretty name enough," said Charles Holt, who really thought it a most detestable
                  alliterative combination. "And you are a pretty girl, Sarah! Do you know it?"</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7282-00000121"/>
               <p>The young girl might have answered with all propriety that she <emph>did</emph>
                  know the fact, quite as well as any person could inform her; but she merely
                  blushed a very little, and replied: "You are very good, sir, to say so."</p>
               <p>"Yes, very pretty indeed, Sarah," continued the tempter, who saw that his
                  compliments were by no means displeasing, and realized better than before that the
                  girl was as proud as Lucifer. "You ought to be <emph>mistress</emph> of a nice
                  little house, instead of working in one! Don't you think so?"</p>
               <p>She <emph>had</emph> thought so, many a time, and in fact <emph>all</emph> the
                  time when she thought on the subject at all; but this was putting the matter a
                  little bluntly, and she merely replied, in a tone which showed that she was really
                  not very doubtful about the matter:</p>
               <p>"I don't know, sir, I am sure."</p>
               <p>Flattery, the first of evil agencies, having now done its work, the man of the
                  world considered it time that he should employ the second—bribery. He put his hand
                  into his pocket, and carelessly drew out a well-filled purse.</p>
               <p>"They don't pay you very well here, do they, Sarah?"</p>
               <p>"Not very well, sir—only two dollars a week," said the girl, who had always
                  managed to spend all her wages in cheap finery, and who had consequently always
                  been a little dissatisfied with the amount of her earnings.</p>
               <p>"A mere trifle—nothing for <emph>you!</emph>" said the merchant. "Why, it cannot
                  even keep you in clothes. You seem to me to be a very good girl, Sarah, and I like
                  you. Perhaps I may have it in my power, one day, to do something for you—get you a
                  nice beau, or something else you will like as well. Meanwhile, you may want a new
                  dress. You have had the trouble of opening the door for me to-night, and you may
                  need to do so at other times. Here is a trifle for you—put it into your pocket,
                  and you need not mention it to your mistress. If you are a <emph>very good
                     girl,</emph> I shall have another to spare for you one of these days."</p>
               <p>A trifle? It was a bright double-eagle that he put into Sarah Sanderson's palm,
                  and that she, after a single instant of wondering hesitation, dropped into her
                  pocket. How big and bright it looked to her eyes, and how big and bright, too, to
                  the eyes of Pet Louise, who had followed the truant cat into the room and was very
                  near when that unexpected <foreign xml:lang="FRA">douceur</foreign> astonished and
                  delighted the receiver.</p>
               <p>How many thanks, and of what description, the young girl night have repaid the
                  merchant for his gift, is among the mysteries foredoomed to meet no solution. If
                  there had been any part of Sarah Sanderson before left in the service of the
                  Havilands, there was nothing left after the flight of the double-eagle from the
                  purse of the tempter to her pocket. It bought her, body and soul. She understood,
                  intuitively, that some service would be required of her, which would have been
                  differently bargained for if entirely correct; but whatever it might be, she was
                  quite ready to render it.</p>
               <p>It was the coming home of Mary Haviland, which prevented any further conference
                  between the pair of oddly-matched conspirators and left the reply of the "help" in
                  doubt. She came in with her own pass-key, very quietly; and had she arrived but
                  the moment before, she might have happened upon the very instructive spectacle of
                  her accommodating paymaster chatting with and bribing her servant. As it was, she
                  saw nothing and suspected nothing. The merchant met her with great <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">empressement</foreign> as well as great respect, and with a
                  repetition of that manner which said that he was again temporarily coming into a
                  paradise of happiness, just as he had before made signal his sense of departure
                  from it. The young wife was again pleased to see him, warmly took the hand he
                  extended, and made no secret that she was flattered by this third visit within
                  eight days. Supper was waiting her—an humble supper, but such as their
                  circumstances permitted: would he join her? He did join her, after she had for
                  just one moment bustled about as all housewives will do when they have unexpected
                  company at a meal; and he seemed to drink the tea she poured him, with a relish,
                  and to eat with the appreciation of a true gourmand the flaky tea-biscuit that she
                  had moulded with her own fair hands and set into the oven of the little range
                  before going out. Here was another quiet and delicate compliment paid her; and
                  when Charles Holt said with an air of very grave truth and feeling,<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000122"/> that "he had not so enjoyed any meal in a
                  twelve-month," she believed him and appreciated his taste.</p>
               <p>There was one momentary awkardness during the meal, which might have grown into a
                  still greater one but for skill and readiness in averting the danger. Little Pet,
                  not yet being asleep, was taken up by the mother after the tea had been poured,
                  and passed the balance of the meal on her lap, adding materially to the charm of
                  the picture at which the merchant gazed from the other side of the little table.
                  Suddenly, in a moment of silence between the elder people, that very young person
                  remembered a historical incident of her long experience, and felt disposed to
                  communicate it.</p>
               <p>"Big man gived Sary big purty yellow money!"—such was her version of the event
                  which had occurred in the other room while she was experimenting upon the cat, and
                  which neither of the operators had thought it necessary to conceal from her. The
                  effect of the remark was for the moment very like that supposed to be produced by
                  one of Gilmore's "Swamp-Angels" when it first dropped a four-mile shell into the
                  cradle of the rebellion. Though very feebly propelled, it was a shell of no
                  ordinary danger. The merchant had his second cup of hot tea at his lips, and came
                  near dropping it. He did not drop it, however, and if he colored the gas-light was
                  not favorable for the exhibition. Miss Sarah Sanderson, who stood in waiting by
                  the mantel, was fortunately behind her mistress, and her momentary flush of shame,
                  succeeded by a deadly pallor of fright, could not be seen by the person most
                  interested. Had the eyes of the hostess rested upon <emph>her,</emph> instead of
                  upon the trained features of the merchant, the confusion would certainly have been
                  observed and the endangered bird had some warning before the snare closed about
                  her. All this was the work of an instant, however. The merchant came to the relief
                  of the new "firm," the moment he could set down his cup, with:</p>
               <p>"You shouldn't tell tales out of school, little dear! Who would believe it, Mrs.
                  Haviland?—I dropped a quarter into your girl's hand for taking the trouble to
                  admit me, and the little darling appears to have noticed even that!"</p>
               <p>"'Es! Sary, et itty Pet see purty yellow money."</p>
               <p>Here might have been another awkwardness for Miss sarah unquestionably had the
                  contraband gold still in her pocket, and quite as unquestionably had no quarter of
                  a dollar to substitute for it, even if she had sufficient readiness. But the
                  merchant was by that time fully on his guard, and collected enough to have played
                  for his life, much more for his success against the unfortunate tongue of a
                  "three-year-old."</p>
               <p>"No, little Pet, see here!—here is something prettier than any thing that Sarah
                  has got!" His hand went into his pocket, there was the jingling of coin, and it
                  came out again, the instant after, with a half-eagle in the fingers.</p>
               <p>"Pray do not, Mr. Holt!" said the mother, deprecatingly, seeing at least a part of
                  the intention.</p>
               <p>"Oh, pray let me have my own way, madam, with the little folks!" said the
                  merchant. "Here, Miss Sarah, if that is your name," (the "Miss" and the "if that
                  is your name" were well put, in that connection)—"be good enough to hand me a pair
                  of stout scissors and to give me a piece of ribbon or tape."</p>
               <p>The mother said no more; both requests were complied with by Sarah; and in a
                  moment or two the merchant had artistically drilled a hole through one edge of the
                  gold piece with the sharp point of the scissors, inserted the narrow blue ribbon
                  given him, handed it over to be hung around Pet's neck, and the little child was
                  admiring the brightness of the yellow coin and had forgotten that any one else in
                  the world had "purty money." The danger was arrested.</p>
               <p>"Rather a neat operation, that!" said Charles Holt to himself, as he buttered
                  another biscuit after the affair was over. "I have not only managed to get Sarah
                  and myself out of a scrape that might have been devilish awkward, but found one
                  more way to please the blonde beauty and place her under obligation!"</p>
               <p>Reading was dispensed with for that evening, the supper and the episode of the
                  child's memory having occupied all the time that the merchant felt it prudent to
                  spend in the house on that occasion. In order to avoid jarring what was<pb
                     n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7282-00000123"/> otherwise so pleasant and so
                  prosperous, by introducing anything sordidly pecuniary, the arch-schemer allowed
                  the wife to see him drop a little envelope on the mantel of the front room, and
                  knew that she understood it to be the weekly salary of her husband. Then he
                  stepped across to the door, as if to take his leave. The wife, still conscious of
                  the honor done her by his repeated calls, prepared to accompany him once more to
                  the door.</p>
               <p>"By the way," he said, stopping at the threshold, and as if something before
                  forgotten had just occurred to him, "before your husband went away, he and I were
                  speaking of your probably being a little lonely sometimes, and he did me the honor
                  to accept, in your behalf, my promise that I would drive ground some evening and
                  ask you for your company to one of the theatres. May I hope that you will fulfil
                  your husband's wish and gratify me so much?"</p>
               <p>"If it was his wish—certainly!" said the young wife, without one suspicion of the
                  truth of the allegation or one doubt that the conversation had really occurred.
                  Her husband and herself had both been very fond of theatrical performances and
                  spent many leisure evenings in that equally abused and lauded mode of beguiling
                  the present in the past or the possible. What more natural, even if he had
                  forgotten to speak to her on the subject, in the many pre-occupations and emotions
                  of his departure,—than that he should have been willing to provide her with this
                  pleasure, especially in company so unexceptionable that he had to some extent
                  confided her to it? She had not one instant's thought of wrong or impropriety
                  connected with the invitation or its acceptance, and if she hesitated at all, did
                  so under doubt whether she should allow their kind friend to take so much trouble
                  on her behalf. All this passed in an instant; any doubt of the policy of such a
                  course vanished as quickly; and she concluded the sentence which had been begun
                  conditionally, without any condition whatever:—</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Holt, if you will take so much trouble, I will go with you, some
                  evening, with great pleasure."</p>
               <p>For the instant Charles Holt was confounded (it could not have been that he was
                  shamed) by the unsuspecting innocence cence of this woman. He had expected doubts
                  and hesitations, and he did not know Mary Haviland well enough to be aware that if
                  she had doubted the propriety of the course, she would at once have said "No!" She
                  had answered altogether too easily and too quickly for his calculation. But men of
                  the world must be prepared for unexpected successes as well as unexpected rebuffs,
                  and there was nothing of the triumph which he really felt, in his voice, as he
                  said, pressing his advantage:—</p>
               <p>"You delight me, my dear madam, by assenting so readily to your husband's wish.
                  Let me see—this is Monday. May I drive round, then, on Wednesday evening, and
                  expect the pleasure of your company to see Joe Jefferson's burlesque
                     <title>Mazeppa</title> at the Winter Garden?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know any thing to the contrary," said the wife. "Yes, I shall be pleased
                  to go there if you will be kind enough to come for me."</p>
               <p>And so, with the same respectful intimacy which had marked their two previous
                  partings, but perhaps the hand of the unsuspecting wife held yet a little longer
                  in the palm of the tempter,—they separated at the door, and Mary Haviland went
                  again up-stairs, to seek her nightly rest, and to dream—of Charles Holt?—no, of
                  her absent husband and the love with which, if God spared and shielded him amid
                  the dangers of battle, he would yet surround her!</p>
               <p>"Easier than I thought!" said the merchant, as he crossed to a car. (He had not
                  thought it advisable, on ordinary occasions, to come to Forty-eighth Street in his
                  carriage, for reasons that prudent people will very readily understand.) "Easier
                  than I thought! I was afraid there might be a check here, but no! Once at the
                  theatre, and publicly talked about as going out with some other person than her
                  husband, alone,—I do not think she can very well retreat afterwards."</p>
               <p>Wednesday evening brought the merchant and his carriage—not the handsome landau in
                  which he sometimes rode in the Central Park and made his calls upon his recognized
                  fashionable acquaintances,—with a liveried coachman on the box, and his arms (on a
                  field vert a griffin rampant argent, holding a key or in the dexter claw and in
                  the sinister gripping<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7282-00000124"/> a human heart
                  gules, with the motto: "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">L'un ou l'autre,</foreign>" of
                  which "Your money or your life!" might perhaps be a somewhat free rendering) on
                  the dark panels,—but a plain close carriage, with a handsome span before it and a
                  driver out of livery. This man understood, be it remembered, all the policies as
                  well as all the proprieties, and knew a thousand times better than to startle the
                  young wife of his poor clerk by the reminder that livery might give her of the new
                  world into which she was so imprudently allowing herself to be carried by the
                  irresistible Maelstrom of wealth and passion; and the plain close carriage was the
                  result.</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland would have been something more or less than woman, if she had felt
                  no sensation of pride and gratification when the merchant handed her into the
                  carriage (she so seldom rode in one!—people of her position seldom do, and seldom
                  will until some benevolent pestilence sweeps over all the Northern cities and
                  carries off the whole race of livery-keepers and hack-swindlers, who make less
                  than half the money they would do by liberal dealing, and yet manage to make many
                  a tired limb walk when it would ride if the purse was heavier or imposition less
                  abhorrent)—she would have been more or less than woman, we say, if she had felt no
                  sensation of pride when the merchant, faultlessly dressed and fine-looking, handed
                  her into the carriage and took his seat by her side, falling himself and leading
                  her into pleasant chat, as readily as he brushed a fleck of dust from his Saxony
                  coat with his snowy cambric. And when she floated into the theatre on his arm, and
                  took her seat in the private box by his side (another so-called luxury—that
                  private box—to which she had never before dreamed of aspiring), and when lorgnette
                  after lorgnette was levelled at her in that place (as they would probably not have
                  been, had she occupied a less conspicuous position) with undisguised admiration of
                  the beauty and simple grace of "the pretty blonde with the rich husband,"—she
                  might have been easily pardonable if even slightly intoxicated by the aroma to
                  which she was so little accustomed, and touchingly grateful to the proud man who
                  had for the moment stooped down from his height to give her a new and innocent
                  pleasure.</p>
               <p>Perhaps she <emph>was</emph> a little intoxicated, both by her surroundings and
                  the conversation of that man who chatted so easily of all the dramatic and musical
                  celebrities whom <emph>she</emph> had never known, from the stars of the early
                  days of the Old Park on this side of the Atlantic, to Malibran and Taglioni
                  gleaming like meteors from the other. To her, so lately a country-girl and even
                  now but a novice in all the prides and luxuries of the great city, to some extent
                  a new world seemed opening; and it was not strange if more than once while Joe
                  Jefferson was making Byron ridiculous and giving a new beauty to Tartar history by
                  his rendering of Mazeppa the Second, her thoughts wandered away from the play, to
                  the luxury of wealth, the pity that all could not share in its advantages, the
                  kindness of those who even for one moment gave the humble and lowly a glimpse into
                  the glories ordinarily denied them.</p>
               <p>And did her thoughts wander nowhere else? If not—then the innocent taste was
                  really becoming perverted with melancholy rapidity, and the merchant was winning
                  even more rapidly than he knew. Nowhere else?—yes, the little wife had an
                  occasional thought that would have been a terrible Mordecai in the gate of Haman
                  Holt if he could but have fathomed it—how much pleasanter, after all, the play
                  would be, even in the commonest seat of the parquette or galley, if "Burtey" could
                  only sit beside her and enjoy it with her, instead of being far from her, away out
                  in the lonely night, leading the desolate life of a soldier.</p>
               <p>It so happened that on that very evening, at about eight o'clock (only one day, by
                  the way, after the occurrences last detailed at the Fullerton mansion), Kate
                  Haviland, who had not before been able to leave the house long enough for that
                  purpose, ran out Twenty-third Street to the Third Avenue, seized a car (that word
                  exactly expresses the air with which she took possession of one side of the
                  vehicle, spread her reasonably voluminous skirts over one-half the length of the
                  cushion on that side, and patronized the conductor with five cents), and just
                  fifteen minutes thereafter was making a call, as she supposed, on her female
                  cousin-in-law.</p>
               <p>Sarah Sanderson admitted her. Mary Haviland was absent<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000125"/> sent. Where? Gone to the theatre, the girl said,
                  with an unpleasant expression of satisfaction on her elfish little face—, with Mr.
                  Holt, the merchant, who had just driven round and taken her away in his
                  carriage.</p>
               <p>"Phew!" said Kate Haviland to herself, something coming up in her throat and
                  something else seeming to settle down dark over her eyes. "Her husband two weeks
                  gone, and she riding about in carriages and going to theatres with his wealthy
                  employer! Phew! Stop—it may be only once, and in that event not entirely beyond
                  pardon. Sarah, has Mrs. Haviland been out with Mr. Holt, before?"</p>
               <p>The double-eagle had sharpened the young girl's eyes, keen enough before. She saw
                  that there was worry in the face of the teacher, and instinctively felt that she
                  could not do Mrs. Haviland more harm than by placing her in as bad a position as
                  possible before her relative. "Yes, ma'am," she answered—"several times—that is,
                  about twice or three times, I guess."</p>
               <p>"Ph—h—h—ew!" again said Kate Haviland to herself, but this time with the whistle,
                  to which she had a little unfeminine proclivity, very much prolonged. "Been out
                  with him twice or three times before! The habit is a regular one, then, it seems!
                  And he the man he is represented to be by members of his own family! I am afraid
                  that the possession of the portrait is no mystery. And yet who could have believed
                  it, when she seemed to love Burtey so truly and to be such a dear devoted little
                  wife!"</p>
               <p>All this to herself, of course; but Sarah Sanderson, who was busied in getting
                  little Pet ready for bed, had leisure to look into the eyes of the teacher and see
                  how the trouble was gathering deeper there. She was pleased by the observation.
                  She was <emph>not</emph> a poor insignificant little thing—a nobody, to be put
                  about and made nothing of! She <emph>could</emph> make herself of some
                  consequence. She <emph>could</emph> wound Mary Haviland, the usurper, who stood in
                     <emph>her</emph> place! She <emph>would</emph> do so, deeper and deeper, now
                  that the thought had come to her and the opportunity offered itself.</p>
               <p>The portrait—perhaps something could be learned about that—thought the teacher,
                  and she felt no delicacy in making the attempt, now that the most painful
                  suspicions of the weakness (not the guilt, be it remembered) of the young wife had
                  begun to be entertained. She went to the mantel of the front room and began
                  turning over the few articles it contained. She knew nothing of the portrait said
                  to be in the hands of the Fullertons, as of course she had not seen it; but there
                  were two clues to its identity—its being an ambrotype, and the name of Mary
                  Haviland upon the case, which could not by any means be common to the pictures in
                  possession of the family. After fumbling with the minerals, Red Riding Hood
                  match-safes and other trifles on the mantel, a few moments, and opening and
                  shutting the cases of the half dozen of family daguerreotypes and ambrotypes lying
                  there—she called to Sarah, who had returned to the other room and left her to her
                  apparently childish amusement.</p>
               <p>"Sarah, there was an ambrotype here, that I was trying to find—Sone of Mrs.
                  Haviland, with her name in gilt letters on the case. Do you know what has become
                  of it?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure I don't know," very naturally answered the girl, who did
                     <emph>not</emph> know any thing about it. She remembered the picture, by the
                  description, but had no idea where she might have seen it last. The fact was that
                  she had not seen, it for many months, Burtnett Haviland having carried it down to
                  the store to have the broken case repaired, and then forgotten it there, as
                  husbands have a bad habit of doing when they undertake to perform errands for the
                  household. He had other and more valuable pictures of the same dear face, and the
                  little ambrotype had been quite ignored in favor of the still better specimens of
                  the same art succeeding it.</p>
               <p>But Kate Haviland was not to be foiled by the ignorance of the girl. "It seems to
                  be gone," she said. "Perhaps Mr. Haviland may have taken it away with him to the
                  war."</p>
               <p>"No, I guess not," said the girl. "He had a picture taken of her, only a day or
                  two before he went away, on leather, or something of that kind, so that he could
                  carry it in his pocket-book and not have it broken. I don't think he took any
                  other."</p>
               <p>"What can have become of it, then?" persisted the inquisitor. "I am sure I saw it
                  there not long ago." A little<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7282-00000126"/> fib, for
                  a purpose, and answering a very different purpose from the one intended.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am sure I saw it there after Mr. Haviland went away," answered the girl,
                  her ideas as to time fixed by the questioner. Then the perpetual thought of Mary
                  Haviland, her haunting spectre, came into her mind, and she added, without any
                  thought how well the reply would darry out her own intentions: "Mrs. Haviland must
                  have given it away to somebody, I suppose."</p>
               <p>That closed the conversation. Strange how little will sometimes satisfy those
                  already half satisfied! Five minutes afterwards, Kate Haviland left the house with
                  a sore heart, convinced that Burtnett's wife was in the habit of going to the
                  theatres with a man of doubtful character, that she had given him her picture, and
                  that she was sly as well as weak. Thenceforth confidence between the two, both so
                  good and both so true, was necessarily destroyed, and Mary Haviland had lost one
                  of her guardian angels. Kate's next letter to her cousin, which very soon
                  followed, was full of a sad, sober earnest, and had not even one jesting allusion
                  to relieve it.</p>

                  to which he had attached himself in entering the Union Army. To pass to sterner if
                  not sadder scenes than those with which we have already been conversant, and to
                  note some of the early peculiarities of that struggle to destroy the great

               <p>The Fire Zouaves dropped down the bay and went to sea, on board the Baltic, on
                  that Monday evening the 29th of April, with high hopes and noble aspirations. The
                  enthusiastic young Colonel, only half acquainted with the material of his men,
                  believed it to be excellent; and he possessed that sacred hunger of patriotism (to
                  alter a little an old and well-known phrase) which made any means of fulfilling
                  his desire apparently sufficient for the end. His men had been hastily gathered;
                  but had he not the assurance of those who should know them best, and of his own
                  observation of the actions of the firemen, that they were far better than any
                  other commander could hope to gather? Their weapons had only been found at the
                  moment of starting, and of course they knew nothing whatever of they use; but were
                  not their hands used to the tools of their various trades and to the implements of
                  their fire-duty, and could they not learn more quickly than the same number of men
                  taken from any other class of society? They had not been drilled even in the
                  marchings and facings which constitute the A. B. C., of soldierly education;<ref

                   but had they not been used to the semi-soldierly discipline of the
                  fire-parade, and how much trouble could it possibly be to change that discipline
                  to the necessary movements of the camp and the field, especially under
                     <emph>his</emph> instruction, when he had won the credit of being the first
                     drill-master on the continent?</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_029">*</ref>Only a single and very short attempt at drilling the Zouaves in the facings

               </note>
               <p>Such were the hopes and beliefs of the young Colonel. Some of the other officers
                  of the regiment knew that the organization was little more than a
                     <emph>mob,</emph> with sufficient bad material to vitiate the remainder, and
                  that peculiar independence in composition which could scarcely be brought to
                  submit to that necessary restraint called discipline. They knew that the common
                  soldiers did not look up to the officers, nor even hold, many of them in any
                  personal respect. They<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7282-00000127"/> had been brother
                  members in the same company—had been "Jack" and "Bill" and "Bob" to each other,
                  and were so still. They might temporarily keep their tongues silent and their
                  passions under control, when on parade or under the immediate eye of the Colonel
                  or one of the other field officers; but even the Colonel had too much familiarized
                  himself with them and made them too nearly comrades and not enough soldiers under
                  his command. Off parade and when away from the eyes of the field officers,
                  discipline was actually a thing unknown. Equality, in its largest sense, was the
                  rule, with plenty of liberty but not much fraternity. The Captain slapped his hand
                  on the shoulder of the private and said "How are you, Jim?" just as he had done
                  when they were running together as members of Old Two Hundred and Eighty-Seven
                  Track. The private returned the Captain's slap and invited him to "smile," when
                  circumstances were favorable and good humor prevailed; and when ill-temper arose
                  he had no hesitation whatever in recommending that officer to "go to"—some place
                  not set down in ordinary geographies, calling him a "foo-foo" with a very harsh
                  adjective prefixed, or threatening to "lick him when he got him in a square
                  place." At times, rumor said, the private really did administer that corrective to
                  his officer, and without any subsequent action being taken to punish what would in
                  any other organization have been called a "want of respect" at least!</p>
               <p>Then the firemen, as any one who knew them well should have known, were naturally
                  clannish to a degree never elsewhere equalled since Graham of Claverhouse
                  attempted to marshal the Highlanders in opposition to the forces of King William,
                  and found all his sins against the Covenanters revenged in the effort.<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_030" xml:id="return_030">*</ref>
                   Soldiers they might become, but they could never cease to be firemen and
                  attached to their respective fighting as well as working companies; and at any
                  moment a dispute was likely to arise between two members of different engine
                  companies, whether One Hundred and Ninety did or did not "wash" One Hundred and
                  Eighty-Nine, at Laird's Pole on Thanksgiving Day of a certain year, or whether One
                  Hundred and Eighty-Eight did or did not pass One Hundred and Eighty-seven fairly,
                  coming down Chatham Street hill on the night of a certain fire, in the Eighth. It
                  is a melancholy fact that our fire organizations have not always been the most
                  peaceful in the world, even when coming home from the funerals of deceased
                  brothers; and such little disputes between members of different companies were
                  almost sure to result in open hostilities at the time, or the smouldering of anger
                  to a future period, infinitely worse. It was almost impossible, meanwhile, for an
                  officer to be either feared or obeyed, except by such members of the regiment as
                  had feared and obeyed him in another relation; and the effect of all this, and of
                  bickerings and disputes about old Engineer elections and examinations before the
                  Board of Fire Commissioners, may be imagined by any one who has closely observed
                  one of the so-called "happy families" of the menagerie.</p>

                     description of the "Military character of the Highlanders." in the

                     an army out of the Highlands clans, and the pleasant probabilities that the

               </note>
               <p>There was something worse even than this, in the regiment; and long before they
                  had completed their prosperous sea-voyage and landed at Annapolis, even the
                  blindly enthusiastic Colonel had become aware of it. There were nearly thirteen
                  hundred men attached to the organization when it left New York, and at least two
                  or three hundred were thieves and vagabonds. Burtnett Haviland had scarcely
                  composed himself to sleep, down in the dusky steerage of the Baltic, on the first
                  night out and when the ship was yet in sight of the Jersey coast, before he had
                  occasion to fight in the dark for the retention of his watch and pocket-book; and
                  some were really robbed without being able to trace the depredators, before they
                  reached the place of disembarkation. The officers<pb n="268-269"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000128"/> did all in their power to overawe the ruffians and
                  maintain order, but they could do but little; and calm observers, if any there
                  were in the regiment, saw serious trouble ahead, before they again set foot on the
                  land.</p>
               <p>Such was Burtnett Haviland's opening experience as a soldier, and such were the
                  omens for the future usefulness of the regiment staring him in the face. And if he
                  had a momentary regret that his lot had not been cast, by his own choice, among
                  men who promised to do more honor to the service,—he had at least the consolation
                  of knowing that he had taken a wise course in refusing to accept any command. To
                  serve was bad enough: to command would have been murder of body and soul. Such at
                  least was the experience of poor Ellsworth, and of Farnham and Cregier and the
                  more capable Captains, before their connection with the regiment closed in one or
                  another misfortune.</p>
               <p>There was, of course, much to relieve this somewhat gloomy picture. The body of
                  the regiment was formed of elever fellows, full of the capability as well as the
                  will of enjoyment. Hilarity without disorder reigned among many of the circles
                  into which the Zouaves naturally segregated, and high hopes of future honor and
                  usefulness still animated those who had within them the truth of patriotism. More
                  than once during the passage down, vessels were descried and rebel privateers
                  believed to be looking out for the transport-ships; and the alacrity with which
                  the Zouaves answered the calls to arms on such occasions, evidenced, what every
                  one. knew before, however—that if they had little proclivity for discipline they
                  lacked neither courage nor a firm determination to uphold the honor of the flag.
                  These were false alarms, of course, and the voyage ended without accident or
                  obstruction, other than those supplied by the shoal water of the Chesapeake and a
                  little official stupidity to make it effectual.</p>
               <p>The Baltic was off Annapolis on the morning of Thursday the 2d of May, exchanging
                  salutes with the Cunard steamship Kedar, that had preceded her but yet had on
                  board the Fifth New York, Duryea's Zouaves, destined afterwards to reflect such
                  glory on the volunteer service. General Butler was in command at Annapolis and in
                  high feather; and the town was literally one vast camp, with the Sixth, Eighth and
                  Thirteenth of New York, Massachusetts Fourth and Boston Flying Artillery, and two
                  Pennsylvania regiments. The Sixty-ninth New York were meanwhile doing yeomen's
                  service in guarding the railroad between Annapolis and the Junction, so
                  laboriously repaired by the Seventh on their march.</p>
               <p>The Zouaves disembarked, after many delays—without some of which at intervals the
                  voyage would have been incomplete,—and made the rest of the journey by rail,
                  reaching Washington between eight and nine o'clock on Friday evening the 3d, after
                  a long delay at Annapolis Junction and much of what is known in foraging phrase as
                  "chicken experience." Thoroughly beaten out by their different modes of travel, in
                  spite of the hardihood of their frames under ordinary circumstances, half fed and
                  with rest broken altogether, they would have presented a miserable sight to the
                  spectator, had there been light enough to observe them, as they came in at the
                  Washington Depot that night, the cars packed to repletion, and nearly as many on
                  the outside as the inside, clinging to the tops like so many bees to the hive at
                  swarming time. But this did not conclude the infliction. The fame of the Zouaves
                  and the expectation of what they were to do in arms had widely preceded them;
                  there were not yet too many soldiers in Washington for its defence, and every new
                  regiment was at once an object of interest and congratulation; and though it was
                  so dusky that nothing more than a gray mass could be discerned beneath the
                  starlight, the foot-sore and weary (and it must be added, <emph>swearing</emph>)
                  fellows were marched all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Railroad Depot
                  to the White House, more or less paraded there, and addressed in a speech which
                  they neither heard nor heeded, by a President of the United States who could not
                  see them to distinguish them from so many street boys! Then another weary and
                  foot-sore march (let it be remembered that the boys were taking their first lesson
                  in trudging under knapsacks and in military order) the entire length of
                  Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, to quarters in the Hall<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000129"/> of Representatives that had never before been so
                  thoroughly filled or so oddly occupied, and to those chances for supper which
                  might have been doubtful enough but for the forethought of some of the officers
                  who had learned the art of "foraging" under other circumstances, and the
                  commissariat of one of the Massachusetts regiments already occupying a portion of
                  the national building.</p>
               <p>It was one week that the Zouaves lounged in the chairs of Honorable Members, made
                  burlesque speeches, told stories of doubtful morality but undoubted jollity,
                  smoked their cigars and carried things with a high hand generally, in that Hall
                  where so many worse follies had before been perpetrated and have since been
                  continued, by men claiming much higher position than the Fire Regiment. It was
                  during that week that fortune favored them with a fire of magnificent proportions,
                  in the burning of one of the temporary hospitals, giving them an opportunity for
                  the display of that one accomplishment (fire duty) which they certainly possessed
                  in a perfection beyond all others, and furnishing one of the wits of the time with
                  the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mot</foreign> in regard to them, that "if anybody
                  wanted the Fire Zouaves to go through a body of rebels, the proper course would be
                  to ring a fire-bell on the other side of the enemy, and they would sweep away all
                  opposition within two minutes." It was within that week, too, that Burtnett
                  Haviland received the odd letter of poor little Tim, read it twice, then kissed
                  the spot where his wife's name was mentioned, said: "The poor boy must be crazy!"
                  put the letter into his pocket and thought no more of it—<emph>until
                     after-wards.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It had been on Friday that the Zouaves reached Washington. Though they commenced
                  preparations to leave the Capitol on Thursday, it was not until Friday the 10th of
                  May that they finally left the scene of their Congressional exploits and marched
                  to the camping-ground selected for them. And it may be said, here, that subsequent
                  events seemed to give some countenance to the old omen, as Friday proved to be
                  their <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dies iræ.</foreign> In addition to the two Friday
                  movements just recorded, they moved from the camp now selected, to the second, on
                  Friday; it was on Friday that they captured Alexandria and lost their brave but
                  rash and head-strong young Colonel; and it was on Friday that they took up their
                  line of march for the battle-field of Manasses (Bull Run), which virtually "wiped
                  out" the organization.</p>
               <p>"This first camp lay beyond Anacosti bridge, in Maryland, three and a half miles
                  from the Capitol, one and a half from the Navy-Yard bridge (then guarded by two
                  companies of the New York Seventy-first) and about a quarter of a mile south from
                  the Insane Asylum which crowns the heights opposite the city. The location was
                  consequently about four miles from Alexandria, at which place the rebels were
                  reported to have from one thousand to three thousand troops, though after events
                  made it doubtful whether there had been at any one time in the town more than five
                  hundred.</p>
               <p>The camp, named Camp Lincoln (after the President—perhaps because he had not bored
                  the boys with a longer speech on the night of their reception: perhaps because of
                  Colonel Ellsworth's personal attachment to that dignitary), was not remarkably
                  well selected, the ground being a deal level, very retentive of rain and liable to
                  mud, and woods flanking it on either side within a distance of one hundred yards,
                  rendering it liable to dangerous night-approach by the enemy, unless under
                  remarkable vigilance. It was capitally laid out, however, under the direction and
                  special care of the new Lieutenant-Colonel, Egbert L. Farnham, who joined the
                  regiment here in that capacity, leaving a position in the Seventh to assume it.
                  The new Adjutant, Loeser (afterwards temporarily Colonel) also joined the regiment
                  here and began to make his soldierly qualities felt in the organization.</p>
               <p>Here, for the first time, Burtnett Haviland and most of his companions had their
                  first experience of what could be truly called "camp life." They learned how damp
                  a bed straw when well sunken into the mud, can make; but they learned, at the same
                  time, how much better and less injurious to the bodily health is even that soft,
                  damp bed, than any one dry and hard and not capable of yielding to the graduated
                  pressure of the human body. They learned how much more of sound than of substance
                  there was in the name of the celebrated<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7282-00000130"/>
                  brated "Sibley" tents, an improvement (believed by many to be
                     <emph>backwards</emph>) on the old bell tent of the European armies,—with an
                  iron tripod for centre and cooking support, and a ventilator at top that
                     <emph>would</emph> permit the rain to come in when that refreshing form of the
                  watery element was descending, and soak the sleepers thoroughly, red blankets and
                  all. They were firemen, however, used to water, and rather thrived under such
                  regimen than otherwise. They learned how monotonous a day can be, when broken up
                  by no great effort of body or mind, however varied by morning reveille, and the
                  serving of rations, and roll call, and guard mounting, and morning parade and
                  drill, and dinner, and parade and drill again, and cards, newspapers, conversation
                  and writing letters, for recreation, till tattoo at nine o'clock and the putting
                  out of lights for another night of tossing about in the red blankets. They learned
                  that breakfast cooked <foreign xml:lang="ITA">al fresco</foreign> and dinners
                  prepared in the same manner, when the beef was reasonably fresh, the bread and
                  biscuits neither dry nor mouldy, the coffee not all beans, the fresh fish not a
                  flat contradiction of the name and the mess-cooks not too incapable,—tasted about
                  as well as they would have done when prepared in smoky kitchens and served by
                  waiters with black skins and white aprons, anywhere along in the line of luxury
                  between Crook's in Chatham Street and Delmonico's on Fourteenth. They learned, at
                  least to some extent, how truly the occupation of a soldier is a
                     <emph>trade,</emph> and how much labor and earnest application are necessary
                  before it can be mastered—what blunders and oversights are inevitable, and what
                  marchings and countermarchings, facings and filings, are to be endured with
                  patience, before the human machine can become useful to the God of War in whose
                  hands he is afterwards to be a living puppet. They learned, too, and finally,
                  something of that experience which no soldier, volunteer or regular, ever forgets
                  after a little indulgence in it within a hostile section—<emph>picket
                     guard.</emph> The long, lonely hours in darkness and storm—the feeling that a
                  cat, or a hyena of not too fierce propensities, would be better company than
                  none—the doubt at what moment a bullet may come whizzing through the bushes and
                  supply a subject for the hospital surgeons, if it does not put a period to the
                  career of the picket—the overstraining of the eyes in looking through the gloom at
                  distant or doubtful objects, that may or may not be creeping up for a shot at the
                  sentry or an attack on the camp the overstraining of the ears in listening for
                  sounds that never come or that prove to be very different from those at first
                  imagined—the thoughts of home, and lighted rooms, and places of public amusement,
                  and gatherings of friends—the wonder how late it is, how soon the relief is to
                  come, and whether, after all, a man is not a fool to place himself in any such
                  position—all this belongs to the experience of the picket guard; and all this,
                  informs more or less positive, the Zouaves endured around that first camp on the
                  Eastern Branch of the Potomac, though such of them as lived and kept heart to join
                  other regiments, afterwards found another and sharper experience in the same
                  direction, along the lower Potomac, the Chickahominy, the Rapidan and the
                  Rappahannock, when the hostile forces only lay separated by narrow rivers, and
                  picket-shooting had become an amusement, for both armies, about as common as
                  rabbit-hunting in time of peace. It may be imagined with what yearning the young
                  soldier in whose fortunes this narration is principally interested, thought of
                  Mary and little Pet and his pleasant home, when his chanced to be the lot of the
                  picket, and the long night-hours that seemed as if they would never bring the
                  morning, crept slowly by.</p>
               <p>There was one variation in the life of the Zouaves in camp, then and afterwards,
                  that should not be passed entirely without notice. Some allusion has already been
                  made to the clannishness of the members. They were a class as well as clannish;
                  and the body from which they had been selected, never ceased to consider them
                  members or to hold some oversight upon their movements. Holiday excursions down to
                  the camp, by men who had no idea whatever of going into camp for any more warlike
                  purpose, became fashionable at once among the stay-at-home New Yorkers,—just as
                  Greenwood is considered a good place for an idle, laughing summer-afternoon ride
                  or stroll, by people who have no desire whatever to go there and be buried. There
                  may have been good<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7282-00000131"/> feeling in all this,
                  as there certainly were variety and amusement for the Zouaves; and no doubt kind
                  messages were interchanged between soldiers and their friends and families,
                  through the means of such visits to the Zouaves and to any one of five hundred
                  other regiments, that might never have been conveyed under different
                  circumstances; but there are some who have always doubted the nobility of position
                  of the able-bodied man, equally capable with his friends of leaving home and
                  business and taking the chances of war in their company, paying mere idle holiday
                  visits to, them in camp, and then going calmly back to his own pursuits or
                  pleasures, while the soldiers went on to fight the battles of the nation. Of
                  course these parenthetical remarks, if there is any severity in them, do not apply
                  to those who have at any time during the war visited the camps on official
                  business, for the purposes of benevolence, or even to carry out the very
                  ostentatious presentations of municipal and civic bodies: they apply only to the
                  useless, insignificant human butterflies who have had the face to show themselves
                  where they had no excuse for not remaining permanently, and yet where they lacked
                  courage or patriotism to remain. Neither discipline nor efficiency have very often
                  been promoted by the visits of any: and so let the subject be dismissed.</p>
               <p>The Fire Zouaves remained a week at Camp Lincoln: then came a change. A better
                  location had been selected for them, on the banks of the Potomac, three miles
                  below and immediately opposite the Washington Arsenal, and occupying a part of the
                  lands of a Virginian named George Washington Young, a large landed proprietor and
                  slave-owner, who never managed to make the fire-boys believe that he was any thing
                  more amiable than a covert secessionist. Here they had an elevated position, fine
                  wood and water, and a splendid parade ground stretching back from the river. They
                  took possession of the new location on Friday the 17th of May, and pitched the
                  tents composing the camp with the belief that they were not soon to be called to
                  the more active duties of the war, and that the pleasant parade-ground might be
                  their place of daily exercise for weeks if not months, until they had gained some
                  proficiency in that drill which was to make them true soldiers. And so they might
                  have done, to some extent, even in the brief space that was really allotted to
                  them in that position, but for the same blundering mismanagement which had seemed
                  to cling to them from the beginning. What an odd medley of weapons they carried
                  away from New York, has already been seen; and it did not need any extended
                  military experience to know that a regiment going into action with thirteen
                  different varieties of fire-arms and all the thirteen in different stages of
                  uselessness, could not be very efficient. They were promised new arms from
                  Washington; and through some strange miscalculation which may have had its origin
                  in Col. Ellsworth's unconscious belief that he was still drilling a company of
                  Chicago Zouaves for exhibition instead of a regiment for active and dangerous
                  service—the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">olla podrida</foreign> of weapons had been
                  left stacked under guard, at the previous camp, and were again so deposited at
                  Camp Decker,<ref rend="super" target="#note_031" xml:id="return_031">*</ref>
                  and the Zouaves only drilled in the marchings and facings.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_031">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_031">*</ref>So named in honor of Mr. John Decker, then and now Chief Engineer of the New
                     York Fire Department,—before referred to as one of the great promoters of
                     the regimental organization.</p>
               </note>
               <p>There was to be only one week at Camp Decker, as there had been only one at Camp
                  Lincoln. Thursday the 23d May arrived. The fateful Friday was again approaching,
                  and with it the fate of individuals and of the regiment. Just now the fate of the
                  individual is of even more consequence than that of the aggregate, and it must
                  have precedence. There had been serious difficulties in the reception of letters
                  from home by the regiment; but at last some regularity had been secured, and a
                  daily communication with Washington established through the means of a boat and a
                  "special agent"; and at this juncture some of the arrears of correspondence began
                  to come in. Among the letters received that Thursday were two by Burtnett
                  Haviland—one from his wife and the second from Kate.</p>
               <p>The morning was pleasant, the young soldier was for the time at leisure, and he
                  went down to the bank of the Potomac to secure a fair opportunity for reading
                  without interruption those missives which should again brighten the link
                     binding<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7282-00000132"/> him to his home. The Zouave
                  made a pleasant picture as he took his seat upon a convenient stone lying near the
                  bank, with the white beach shelving below, and prepared for the perusal. A bird,
                  sitting in one of the trees near the bank, seemed to think so, for he sang on as
                  if soldiers were not haunting his favorite grounds and as if there was no war in
                  the land.</p>
               <p>"Sing away, little birdie," said the Zouave, turning up a face somewhat browned
                  from what it had been a month before, but trim in beard, healthy in complexion,
                  and comporting well with the neatness of his gray uniform. "Sing away, little
                  birdie. Your music is not quite so loud as that of Wallace's band, which it seems
                  costs too much to have any longer; but it will answer as an undertone while I read
                  my letters from home. You can't carry a musket, little fellow, unless they make
                  them very small up in bird-paradise; but you have one advantage of me—if I had
                  your wings and knew how to use them as you do, I fancy I should just pop over to
                  New York to-night, and be back again in the morning"</p>
               <p>" Whir—r—r," and the bird, as if <emph>he</emph> had some home to look after, flew
                  away. "There he goes" said Haviland, breaking the seal of Mary's letter and
                  catching it to his lips as he did so, "but my letters remain. Here it is—dear
                  little hand!—dear little wife!" and he read on. It was such an epistle as he had
                  already received several times before from her since his leaving New York, in
                  spite of the interruption of the mails; for the wife had written almost daily
                  during the first week, and he had answered her, though in pencil and not with his
                  best chirography, nearly as often. This letter had been written nearly ten days,
                  but as the latest it was quite as welcome as it would have been with less time
                  consumed in the delivery. It was one of those gentle, cheerful, wifely little
                  epistles, such as some happy fellows have the joy of receiving when they are
                  absent—all well, all happy though a <emph>little</emph> lonely, with dear good
                  wishes, and a love that could never change indicated at the end by a thousand
                  imaginary kisses. To transcribe such a letter and expose it to the common mon gaze
                  would be little less than sacrilege against the most sacred revelations of the
                  tenderest of all human bonds.</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland read the letter twice over, as if it had been the face of his
                  living wife and he could not be quite contented with perusing it. Then he pressed
                  it again to his lips (this man was what the world would call a "spoony," in the
                  romantic depth of his affection for his wife—the writer is quite aware of the
                  fact), laid it on his knee and turned to the second.</p>
               <p>"Kate's funny, hurried hand-writing," he said as he broke the seal. "I am very
                  glad to hear from her, and I am sure there is a laugh inside of this, if nothing
                  more."</p>
               <p>There <emph>was</emph> a laugh within it, for the Fire Zouave first smiled as he
                  read, then laughed outright at the oddity of the young girl's conceits in
                  scriptural antiquity. Then suddenly he laughed no more—his face sobered—and
                  something like a frown settled on a brow where frowns had seldom been in the habit
                  of finding place. "What is this she says?" he muttered aloud. "Charles Holt
                  carrying around a picture of <emph>my wife?</emph>" Then he paused a moment, the
                  hand containing the letter resting on his knee, and his face full of trouble.
                  "Pshaw! stuff—nonsense—it cannot be! Somebody has told Kate this, or she must have
                  mistaken some other picture hurriedly seen, for Mary's. Charles Holt with my
                  wife's picture in his possession? Not a bit of it. He might have taken one from
                  the mantel in the house, when he came there to see me, but he certainly would not
                  have done so without a motive, and he could have had none whatever. I do not
                  believe a word of it."</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland's nature was too true and honest to make him very quick of
                  suspicion. It did not follow that, his suspicions once aroused, he might not be
                  found fatally tenacious of them and the most deadly of enemies. Such men are
                  sometimes terrible when the depths of their beings are stirred; and it is never
                  best to stir them unpleasantly. But he had said that Charles Holt could have no,
                  motive for possessing himself of his wife's picture; and he could have sworn, and
                     <emph>would</emph> have sworn, that it had not come into his hands by any act
                  of hers. Still he did not feel so pleasantly<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000133"/> as he had done the moment before. The sunshine was
                  not quite so bright, the bird sung no longer in the tree, and the yellow Potomac
                  rushed by him more sullenly. One drop poisons the purest spring, and the fresh
                  waters must long trickle down from the hills and wash the polluted fountain,
                  before the last trace of the taint is borne away. Cæsar was right when he said
                  that his wife must not only be virtuous but above suspicion. Stained garments may
                  wash white; stained records seldom do; stained reputations never entirely. It was
                  just as well for Menelaus that Helen went away with Paris, though his life was
                  thenceforth to be one of war on that account. For he had seen the lovelit eyes of
                  the young Trojan answered by glances from the fair partner of his throne, that
                  made him rest unquietly on his lion-skin couch at night; and he had heard of the
                  young type of every manly grace lying at her feet, his sunny curls played with by
                  her tiny white fingers, through long summer days of that fatal embassy at Sparta,
                  while he himself was absent in Crete; and it was quite as well that he should come
                  home to find the woman he so worshipped fled away altogether, as to lie by her
                  side in mingled love and doubt and hope and fear and devouring jealousy, and to
                  find his worst suspicions corroborated at some future day.</p>
               <p>Haviland did not think of all these things, and yet he was unquieted. But the drum
                  was rolling, up at the camp, and he must join his comrades. He took the two
                  letters, the one so different from the other in its effects, and attempted to put
                  them into the inner breast-pocket of his Zouave jacket. Their going in was
                  obstructed by a thick, clumsy piece of paper already there, and he drew it out. It
                  was the letter received from little Tim a few days before, and almost
                  unconsciously he opened it. What was it that made the face of the Zouave change so
                  suddenly? It had lost its ruddy smile before, and become a little troubled and
                  thoughtful. Now it grew dark as night, for one instant, and the hazel eyes flashed
                  with an expression that had probably never visited them before since they first
                  opened to the light. He saw the words—and he could no more have removed his eyes
                  from them or prevented their burning into his brain, than he could have emulated
                  the little bird he had so lately apostrophized, and flown away: "Mister Holt—dern
                  him—doesn't mene no good to Missers Hevlin. I've seen him a lookin at hir when she
                  was down to the stoar, and a smakin of his lipps. He wantid your to go away, and I
                  thoat your outnent to go. Seems to me 's ef your had better come back if your
                  cin."</p>
               <p>"In the mouth of two or three witnesses may every word be established," says an
                  authority which we all reverence somewhat more than we obey it; and good old
                  Bishop Butler tells us, in his "Analogy of Religion," that while the rising of the
                  sun one morning, to a man observing it for the first time, would only mark it in
                  his mind as a beautiful phenomenon that had never been exhibited before and might
                  never be exhibited again, yet when the same spectator saw it rise again, with
                  precisely the same surroundings, on the second morning, he might begin to believe
                  that such a spectacle was not unusual, and when he saw the rising in the same
                  manner on the third morning, would be justified in assuming that three such
                  coincidences could not have been accidental and that it would probably rise every
                  morning thenceforward. Burtnett Haviland had put Tim's letter into his pocket with
                  a "Pshaw!" and words that indicated his belief that the little fellow was crazy:
                  he had managed to throw off, at least partially, the disquiet which Kate's
                  information of the picture naturally awakened; but when the two were confronted
                  each seemed to assume a different shape and consistency. He had said to himself,
                  the moment before, discrediting the statement of Kate, that Charles Holt could
                  have no <emph>motive</emph> for procuring her picture. He had totally forgotten
                  the picture left at the store, and did not remember it then or for a long time
                  after-ward. Motive was the thing that had been wanting to the belief, and here it
                  was, before supplied in little Tim's letter; and great God!—what a motive!</p>
               <p>Tempests may be blinding in the fury of their rain and wind, whirlwinds may sweep
                  material objects to destruction and swollen rivers rush down with a fury defying
                  the human hand to check or even the human fancy to measure; but all these are very
                  tame and slow to the operations of the mind of an active man when the flood-gates
                  of a new thought or<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7282-00000134"/> especially of a new
                  suspicion have just been opened and every thing that can possibly bear upon the
                  subject comes rushing in. Without one glance before of all this, at once swept
                  through the brain of Haviland all the events and recollections of the days
                  following Sumter. How Charles Holt had himself proposed to make his going to the
                  war possible by continuing his salary, while he had not manifested corresponding
                  anxiety to assist young Foster in the same manner; how the merchant had introduced
                  himself into his house and tried to make his going away more certain and easy
                  (might it not be more deadly?) by procuring him a commission; how——but here
                  another thought, darker and worse than any of the others, crept up into his mind,
                  never to be dislodged thence until suffering had done a work he then little
                  conjectured. Could it be possible that at that moment, suddenly learning to doubt
                  all others, the trusting husband of half an hour before could begin to doubt even
                     <emph>his wife?</emph> It could be possible—it <emph>was</emph> possible—it was
                  true.</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland was a true, good, warm, loving husband; he was a good man, a
                  brave and a patriotic one; that was all. He was neither a very wise man nor an
                  archangel. For the interest of this narration it is to be wished that he might
                  have been one or the other—wise men are so rare, and archangels so interesting. He
                  had never for one instant doubted his wife, any more than he had doubted God and
                  Heaven; but then he had had no occasion. He had never known by experience the
                  meaning of that fatal word—jealousy; but then he had been so fenced away from the
                  necessity of knowing it that he must have been either fiend or fool to manufacture
                  such a gratuitous torture for himself and others. Now that the temptation had
                  come, he was human and consequently weak. It is to be wished, again, that he had
                  not been so—that it was the task of the writer to set down upon this page the
                  record of one more man who had implicit and abiding faith in woman, and fortitude
                  to believe her true under every appearance of falsehood. There is nothing nobler
                  in all dramatic literature than the conduct of <hi rend="i"/>Gonzaga in Sheridan
                  Knowles' great drama, "The Wife"—maddened by accusations against the fair fame of
                  the lady of his love, and yet never faltering for one moment in the belief that
                  any appearance against her, even to the apparent passing of the night in her
                  chamber by the reprobate <hi rend="i"/>St. Pierre, must be the result of
                  conspiracy against her, and could not indicate any thing against her truth. But
                  Gonzagas of this creation are rare, if, indeed, they exist outside of the creative
                  genius of the dramatic poet. The true measure of the <emph>possibility</emph> of
                  jealousy, though not of jealousy itself, is probably to be found in the two
                  conditions of <emph>love</emph> and <emph>trial.</emph> No man can be truly
                  jealous, who does not love: perhaps it may be said that no man who loves, is
                  beyond the possibility of jealousy when subjected to the full severity of trial.
                  Men have been found who even jested at the word and passed through all the
                  relations of life without one moment of that painful experience; and yet when the
                  hair has grown gray upon their brows and that age come to them when the fiercer
                  passions should all have been laid at rest, the demon of jealousy has awoke to
                  stir them to new exertion or to mar their peace. They have found a new love,
                  stirring their beings to a depth before unknown, or they have been placed under
                  trial before undreamed of; and the capabilities of their natures have then been
                  proved to be the same as those of other men. To all which may be added that the
                  possibility of jealousy is something like temptation to any vice: beyond a certain
                  point of oppression the resistive power ceases and the field so gloriously
                  contested is lost.</p>
               <p>At that moment and <emph>from</emph> that moment Burtnett Haviland doubted his
                  wife. Not that he believed her to be guilty, but that the impression seemed
                  unavoidable that she was weak and in consequence unsafe. He remembered, now, how
                  warmly the merchant had been received by her—a subject of congratulation to him,
                  then, that she would have a powerful friend remaining near her; a subject of
                  suffering, now, that she might be under the influence of an unscrupulous enemy.
                  And something more. Oh, how we can turn every thing to self-torture, when the mood
                  is upon us! Does the reader remember with what heroic determination Mary Haviland
                  had kept down her tears and her regrets at his coming absence, from the moment her
                  husband read her that stern<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7282-00000135"/> lesson of
                  duty in the picture of Valley Forge, and how she had martyred her own heart to
                  send him away from her without a sad thought of their parting? That day, on the
                  banks of the Potomac, that very absence of tears and spoken regrets came up as a
                  witness against her! Absorbed in a new friendship, if nothing warmer and dearer,
                  the wife of his love and the mother of his child had been almost willing to have
                  him leave her. Cruel—unjust—mad, of course, all this, on the part of that tortured
                  thinker; but it is a truth, if a sorrowful truth, that is being recorded.</p>
               <p>Again that drum. Some movement was certainly going on in camp. This feeling must
                  be shaken off at every hazard. The Zouave, who had some time before risen from his
                  stony seat and been pacing the young sod on the river bank, turned to walk toward
                  the camp. As he did so, a couple of New York city visitors, in company with one of
                  the officers of the regiment, came down towards the river, and they met. As they
                  exchanged greetings, one of them, a subordinate city-official and an acquaintance
                  who had sometimes visited at Haviland's house with his sister, said:—</p>
               <p>"Why, Haviland, you look dull. What is the matter? Unwell?"</p>
               <p>"'No," answered the Zouave. "Perhaps a little bilious—nothing more."</p>
               <p>"I hope they are all well at home? You have had letters, I suppose? I have not
                  seen your people for some time, though by the way, I <emph>did</emph> see your
                  wife the other evening, but did not get a chance to speak to her. She was at the
                  Winter Garden, and <emph>looked</emph> very well."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed? Glad to hear that she was enjoying herself. That was what I told her
                  to do, when I came away," answered the Zouave, something a little forced in his
                  utterance, meanwhile, that the friend did not notice. "Did you see who was with
                  her?"</p>
               <p>"Eh?" said the New Yorker, pleasantly—"want to know <emph>that,</emph> do you?
                  Well, really I don't know. She was in a private box with a gentleman—one of her
                  relatives, probably—a rather fine-looking middle-aged man, with short
                  side-whiskers and dressed very handsomely."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I know. One of her cousins, from Boston—Mr. Williams," Haviland managed
                  to utter, and the friend, with a nod, passed on down to the river.
                     <emph>How</emph> he managed to articulate that falsehood, he never knew
                  himself, for the words he had just heard, coming immediately after what had before
                  occurred, struck and stunned him as a blow on the head might have done, and the
                  words that he uttered internally at the same moment were: "Great God!—what next?
                  That man is Charles Holt!"</p>
               <p>Two minutes after, Captain Jack was standing on parade, his company forming and
                  evident bustle throughout the whole camp. Burtnett Haviland strode rather than
                  walked up to him, his face darker than any man had ever before seen it, touched
                  his hat in military style to the officer, and said, in a low voice but one that
                  evinced much earnestness:—</p>
               <p>"Captain, I want you to do me a great favor. I want you to get me a few days'
                  furlough, to go to New York."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry you ask it just now, Mr. Haviland," said the Captain. "I would do any
                  thing in my power, for you, you know; but I am afraid Colonel Ellsworth will not
                  wish to spare a man. Your face looks troubled—nobody dead, I hope!"</p>
               <p>"No," said the Zouave. "But for certain reasons I wish to go to New York at
                  once—this very day if possible."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid it is <emph>not</emph> possible, if you have not the excuse of a
                  death," said the Captain. "I was just wondering why I did not see you at your
                  place in the first file. Don't you see the muskets coming, yonder? We have been
                  here a month, you know, and done nothing. The Colonel is half crazy, and I fancy
                  we are all anxious to have something to do. I tell you as a friend, not as your
                  officer, that this regiment must drill hard in the firings and general use of the
                  musket, to-day, as we are under orders for secret service to-night."</p>
               <p>"To-night!" echoed Haviland.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-night," said the Captain. "You see how difficult it would be to get a
                  furlough for any purpose, and besides—"</p>
               <p>"Besides," said Haviland, as Captain Jack paused, "it would not <emph>look</emph>
                  very well to go away just when the regiment was going into a fight? Eh,
                  Captain?"</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7282-00000136"/>
               <p>"That was what I meant," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Just so," said the private, "and I hope you know me well enough to believe that I
                  would not ask for a furlough under such circumstances, or even take one if
                  offered. I did not know there was to be any movement, of course. If there is to be
                  any work, count me in for my share of it, and be kind enough to forget that I said
                  any thing on the subject."</p>
               <p>"I know, of course, that you had not heard the report when you made the request.
                  All right!" said the Captain; and giving and receiving another salute, the private
                  stepped quickly to his company, received his weapon and took his place in the
                  ranks. Perhaps nothing could have been more grateful to him, at that moment, than
                  this promise of immediate action, that, if it would not put him entirely at ease,
                  would at least drown too rapid thought and make anxiety comparatively endurable.
                  To some extent his private griefs were to be swept away in the public service, as
                  his private affairs are again to be, for a time, merged in the fortunes of the
                  regiment.</p>

                     MAD IMPRUDENCE OF COLONEL ELLSWORTH.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"SECRET service" was the word used by Captain Jack to Haviland, as expressive of
                  the peculiar condition in which the regiment was at once to be placed, rendering
                  any furlough difficult if not impossible to obtain. And "secret service" was the
                  word that had been for an hour previous running around the camp, seeming to have
                  arrived with the new weapons. Where or for what purpose, no one seemed to have any
                  idea, and it may be said that no one had any anxiety on the subject. The Zouaves
                  were as unquestionably brave, personally, as restless and undisciplined as a body;
                  and to them any change, especially if it involved that "fight" for which they had
                  been "spoiling," seemed preferable to the comparative monotony of camp life. They
                  could not know, nor was it necessary they should do so, that a general movement of
                  the forces at Washington into Virginia, was to take place that night, under favor
                  of the "bright May moon." The new arms proved to be Springfield muskets, for all
                  the regiment except the two flank companies, for the latter of which Enfield
                  rifles were supplied. And all the balance of the day the Zouaves drilled in what
                  they should have been instructed in from the beginning—the loadings, firings and
                  general use of their weapons. Thoroughly tired were even those hardy fellows, when
                  the evening closed down and the drill was exchanged for the striking of tents and
                  other preparations for the immediate evacuation of Camp Decker, to all which the
                  light of the full moon lent a welcome aid.</p>
               <p>It was midnight before the steamboats that were to carry the Fire Argonauts on
                  their expedition, which they had a premonition would be likely to thin the ranks
                  of some of them and hand them over to the mercies of Dr. Gray, the Crimean
                  surgeon,—arrived in the river opposite and made preparations for taking them on
                  board. These were two river-craft of no especial note then or afterwards—the Mount
                  Vernon and James Gray. But even those moderate craft could not make a landing at
                  the river bank, on account of the slope of the sandy beach, and the soldiers were
                  obliged to go on board by means of a bridge of boats (the launches of the Pawnee),
                  serious if not dangerous delay being caused by that necessity. It was perhaps two
                  o'clock when the last man stepped over the side, and the first faint premonitions
                  of day began to tint the eastern sky as they steamed silently as possible down the
                  Potomac. Not till the day was fairly breaking, and they were off Alexandria and
                  heading in for the shore, with the dark hulk of the Pawnee lying in the river
                     beyond<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7282-00000137"/> as a sullen and silent
                  witness of this first war movement of the Federal forces,—did they become
                  thoroughly certain of their destination. Their orders were, they then understood,
                  to capture that dilapidated old town, important from its position, eminently
                  secession in its popular tendencies, and well-known to be sheltering a rebel force
                  more or less numerous.</p>
               <p>The boys were well in towards the town before any notice seemed to be taken of
                  them by the rebel sentries posted on the wharves and around the warehouses that
                  just began to have their dark and mouldy sides touched by the first light of
                  morning. Crack!—crack!—went the warning muskets, however, the moment the discovery
                  was made; and the gray figures of the sentries could be seen dodging rapidly away
                  from what they evidently believed to be a dangerous neighborhood. It may have been
                  a mark of enthusiasm, but it certainly indicated any thing rather than
                  discipline—that a dozen or two of muskets were discharged, without orders, towards
                  the flying pickets, at such distances that the shots could not possibly do any
                  good or any harm,—and that loud cheers burst from the throats of the Zouaves, as
                  if over the capture of a town which they were as yet only approaching. But then
                  our aborigines always attacked with shouts and war-whoops; and the fire-boys
                  generally yell a little louder when going to a fire than when going home from one
                  that has already been extinguished!</p>
               <p>No resistance whatever was offered to the landing; and the pickets once out of
                  sight, there was nothing left to mark the existence of a hostile force in the
                  town, as, in broad daylight and with the sun just coming up beyond the Potomac,
                  Colonel Ellsworth stepped with his Zouaves on the old wharves at
                  Alexandria—captors, so far without a struggle, of the first rebel town to fall
                  into Federal hands. His exact position and the orders under which he was acting
                  (or <emph>not</emph> acting) were only known to himself and perhaps his
                  Lieutenant-Colonel; but as the whole details are now unfortunately too well known,
                  they may be briefly given at this period.</p>
               <p>Col. Wilcox, commanding the Fort Michigan, had been ordered, as senior officer, to
                  take his own and the Fire Zouave regiments, with one of the United States
                  batteries, and effect the capture of Alexandria. The Zouaves were to go down by
                  steamboat, in the manner already shown, while the Michigan regiment was to cross
                  the Potomac and make the march by land. The two regiments were to effect a
                  junction, or at least concert the attack upon the town before entering it, and Col
                  Wilcox of course to hold the right of making the final dispositions. In pursuance
                  of this plan, Col. Wilcox, with his regiment and the battery of four pieces, had
                  left Washington by the Long Bridge, at nearly the same time as the embarkation of
                  the Zouaves, and must have been, at the time of their landing, rapidly approaching
                  the town. Col Ellsworth, however, bravely insubordinate himself and therefore the
                  last man in the world to teach subordination to a regiment of peculiarly
                  independent character, had been unable to repress his desire to strike the first
                  blow in the War for the Union; and his landing without artillery and without
                  concert with his superior, had been the consequence. It may be that the difference
                  between the fate of the two officers was at that moment marked by Providence as
                  the result of the partial obedience to orders of the one and the absolute
                  obedience of the other: the one to lie in a grave too early for his abilities and
                  conferring no benefit, even if honor, on the great cause by his death—the other to
                  suffer hardship and imprisonment, but to wear eventually the star of a Brigadier
                  and do long and important service in the struggle.</p>
               <p>Such had been the arrangement, and such the departure from it. But the young
                  Zouave Colonel had doubtless his own plans and purposes, that death, hovering then
                  in the air above him though unseen by mortal eye, was so soon to seal up from
                  mortal knowledge; and whether acting entirely upon his own judgment, or from
                  partial conference with his superior, he at once gave a first order which showed
                  some appreciation of the military position. This was to Captain Jack to take his
                  company of eighty men, as the most thoroughly disciplined and reliable in the
                  regiment, march rapidly across the town, secure what rolling-stock might be found
                  at the Depot of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, and tear up the track beyond
                  the Depot in such a manner as to prevent<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7282-00000138"
                  /> the removal of any munitions of war or the arrival or departure of any rebel
                  troops by rail.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the order given than it was promptly obeyed; and Burtnett Haviland,
                  who had already participated in the capture of the first town taken by Union
                  troops, was thus sent into participation in the first capture of rebel soldiery,
                  as well as into peril so deadly that no ordinary chance of war could be likely to
                  blot away the recollection.</p>
               <p>It was now some time past sunrise, when Captain Jack's company filed rapidly up
                  King Street towards the Railroad Depot lying some two miles away. The very heart
                  of the town was to be crossed; but so far as any signs of life were concerned, the
                  command might almost as well have been traversing some city of the dead. One third
                  of the inhabitants had fled at the first alarm—the rest had concealed themselves.
                  Here and there, around some corner of the miserable tumble-down place a male
                  figure could be occasionally seen, but it shuffled away as rapidly, at sight of
                  the soldiers, as legs could very well carry it. Occasionally a slip-shod woman, or
                  a lounging negro, could be seen dodging along one of the ill-paved streets, but
                  even they seemed as apprehensive as all the other inhabitants, that neither life
                  nor property was safe under the Zouave invasion. At times, too, Captain Jack and
                  his men could see a movement of some half-closed shutter, indicating that vengeful
                  eyes, whether of male or female, might be flashing through crannies, while the
                  lips between them might be muttering male curses or saying female prayers
                  backwards; and it would not have surprised any of the more intelligent members of
                  the company, if at any moment the crack of a rifle had come suddenly from some one
                  of the closed houses and put the locked step of the Zouaves into confusion.
                  Whatever the "Union feeling" so anxiously looked for, might be elsewhere, there
                  was evidently little or nothing of it in Alexandria; and though on some spots in
                  the Old Dominion it was believed that the coming of the Federal soldiers would be
                  hailed as a deliverance from hated tyranny, too certainly here it was only
                  regarded as an inroad of that tyranny itself.</p>
               <p>And here perhaps it may be proper to say a word more with reference to that "Union
                  feeling" at the South, which has caused so many disputes and contradictions at the
                  North, and the existence or non-existence of which has been a question as steadily
                  mooted as was that of the sea-serpent shortly after that terrible marine
                  nondescript made his first appearance in the shape of two or three barrels lashed
                  together with old ropes, off Nahant. To some it does exist, to others it does
                  not—even in the same spot. Generally speaking, however, it is found to be, where
                  its existence would be of any service to the Union cause, very much like the
                  benevolence of that gentleman who never gave anything to any charity—"neither here
                  nor there." And it has perhaps been unreasonable to expect it—at least under the
                  surrounding circumstances. The government, from the beginning, have taken no pains
                  to foster and very little to protect it, while the rebel authorities, in their own
                  behalf, have done both for the opposite feeling. The property of the rankest rebel
                  has been protected and his person held sacred, when the Union troops have taken
                  possession of any district before held by the Confederates; and however ultra may
                  have been his offences against loyalty, there has been no more thought of
                  punishing him than there habitually is of meting out justice to one of the roughs
                  of the "dangerous districts" of New York city, who belongs to the dominant
                  faction, is a useful man at elections, and has only shot one of the poor devils
                  who intended to vote the wrong way! The offence of the rough is "bailable," and
                  eventually forgotten or rather looked upon as a virtue: that of the rebel is
                  passed over for "policy" sake, and eventually forgotten if not rewarded. When the
                  rebels take possession of a district in which the Union power has before been
                  dominant (though, to be sure, their opportunities in that line are something like
                  the liabilities of the unfortunate company who have been making a costly plaything
                  out of the Great Eastern—<emph>limited</emph>) they dragoon every man who is
                  either known or suspected to have rendered aid and comfort to the "Yankee
                  invader," and if he finally escapes with his neck he certainly does not with any
                  thing to feed or clothe the other parts of the body. It has therefore become, very
                  naturally, the part of prudence to espouse the Confederate<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000139"/> cause, as no one can say when the tide of battle
                  may-turn sufficiently for the overrunning of a small section, and the Confederates
                  both punish the refractory and protect the "patriotic" (in <emph>their way</emph>)
                  as the Federals do not. As well might a crop of wheat be expected to spring from
                  the trodden paving-stones of Broad Street or Wall, as Union sentiment where its
                  manifestation is likely to bring punishment and cannot bring protection. What the
                  early colonists learned of the savages might long ago have been learned by the
                  descendants of those colonists, had they been even respectably wise and observant.
                  So many of the Indian tribes as they taught by force of arms that it was safer and
                  cheaper to be friends than enemies with the whites, became and remained their
                  friends: so many as they failed to teach that needed lesson were and remained
                  their bitter and injurious foes. Wherever the hand of the Federal Union is proved
                  to be stronger than the grasp of that black mongrel which has sprung from the
                  unholy embrace of Southern treason and Northern fanaticism—secession,—there will
                  be found "Union feeling"; and that man is a fool who expects to find it
                  elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the whole idea may be illustrated more drolly and yet not a whit less
                  earnestly, by the experience of the bank-clerk and the French depositor, during
                  that period of depression following the United States Bank explosion. Pierre had
                  money in the bank; the banks were breaking all around him; therefore Pierre came
                  to draw his money out of the bank. He was red of face and terribly excited: the
                  clerk was cool and equable. Pierre demanded his money, with many hard words and
                  many exclamations that he "vant him ver mooch, and must 'ave him immediate—yes by
                  gar!" The clerk drew out his money and handed it over. "Vat!" said the depositor,
                  "you 'ave my monish?". "Certainly," said the clerk. "You 'ave him all ze times?"
                  queried the depositor. "Of course," said the clerk. "Zen by gar," said the
                  depositor, "I not vant him at all!" "What do you mean by your shilly-shallying?"
                  said the clerk. "If you want your money, say so and take it along; if you do not,
                  don't bother!" "Eh, by gar," said the Frenchman, putting the great financial
                  question of confidence in a new light, "zis is vat I mean. If you no 'ave my
                  monish, so zat I can't get him nevare, zen I vant him ver mooch, all ze times. If
                  you 'aye my monish, so zat I can get him ven I vant him, zen I no vant him at
                  all!" Wherever the Union forces stand in such a relation to the rebels that the
                  existence of "Union feeling" is necessary to turn the balance and give eventual
                  success, there will be none to render that aid: wherever the power of the
                  government is thrown forward in such overwhelming force that it asks no aid to
                  achieve success and can command what it would otherwise be obliged to ask—there
                  will be Union sentiment in abundance.</p>
               <p>Though there are and have been throughout the war, noble and glorious examples of
                  devotion to the old flag and desire for its regained supremacy, in the very heart
                  of the disloyal territory, and though whole communities may be eventually found in
                  which the true feelings of the people would incline to loyalty if permitted,—yet,
                  taken as a great average, rebeldom is about as rebellious as human nature is said
                  to be human; and that military leader or that ruler who depends upon Union
                  sentiment for any considerable assistance, except as he compels it, will find the
                  same splendid success once achieved by the aquatic experimentalist who tied
                  bladders to his feet and depended upon them to keep him above water, in his first
                  dash at swimming. Military success is the touchstone for evoking fealty to the
                  Union, in any part of the rebel territory over which it sweeps; and let no man
                  lean upon a staff of less unfailing dependence. It is scarcely necessary to say,
                  in returning to the single event from which we have so widely digressed, the march
                  of Captain Jack and his handful of Zouaves through Alexandria,—that there had then
                  been no time for the acquirement of all this wisdom since attained at so costly a
                  price, but that this earliest capture of the war was made upon the plan afterwards
                  to become so popular—force inadequate if not contemptible, no overwhelming power
                  to overawe treason, and of course no invitation of corresponding strength, to that
                  loyal sentiment, which may have been lying dormant in the poisoned community.</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7282-00000140"/>
               <p>Slowly and steadily the Zouaves held on their way, however, in close order, in
                  comparative silence, and ready for any hostile demonstration. Something more than
                  half an hour at rapid step, and they were in sight of the Orange and Alexandria
                  Depot. A train was just shooting away, loaded with munitions, valuables, and
                  fleeing men, women and children; and another, in sight, had just been hailed by
                  the people at the Depot and ordered to back away as rapidly as possible—an order
                  which was being executed with all haste. At the same moment that this spectacle
                  met the view of the company, some of the scouts who had been thrown forward,
                  brought in word that at the Slave-Pen, a block away to the right and hidden by the
                  intervening buildings, a rebel cavalry company seemed mounting for attack or
                  flight. There was evidently work ahead, but of what character the Captain could
                  not well decide at that moment. One point was clear—the track of the road, the
                  subject of his first instructions, must be torn up instantly, to prevent any
                  further movements of the rolling-stock. Another—that when engaged in the labor of
                  tearing up the track, his men would not be favorably situated to receive a
                  headlong cavalry-charge, unless—and at this point the quick eye of the Captain
                  caught the solution of the problem in a moment.</p>
               <p>Only a hundred or two of yards beyond the Depot the railroad entered a cutting of
                  considerable depth, and there the work must be done. Vulnerable as his command
                  might be to a cavalry-charge of possibly much superior numbers, when half of them
                  should be acting as railroad-laborers of the reverse order,—the cavalrymen would
                  be able to make but a moderate charge through a cutting where the only footing for
                  their horses must be among railroad-ties and iron-rails. Quick as the thought had
                  been, necessarily was the action upon it. A moment threw the Zouaves between the
                  walls of the embankment; and in five or ten the tough fellows, fancying for the
                  time that they were digging out some buried comrade from the ruins of a fire at
                  home, had so deranged the track of the Orange and Alexandria road in that
                  immediate vicinity, that neither car nor locomotive was likely to go over it until
                  extensive repairs should be completed. Had they been aware what a system of
                  railroad destruction on both sides they were assisting to inaugurate, to go on
                  until nearly one-third the whole railroad wealth of the country should lie in
                  ruins,—even the well-seasoned men who had grown used to seeing Mrs. Fitz-Finnick's
                  pearl-and-rosewood piano rolling down stairs at a fire, her costly mirrors shied
                  out of the window, and her tapestry carpets soaked and thrown over a gutter to
                  prevent its catching blaze from the heat—might have paused in horror as they pried
                  up rails and sent ties and sleepers into one wreck of confusion.</p>
               <p>But they had little time to think of these things, even if they had the
                  disposition. The task was scarcely done when word came to the Captain from his
                  scouts that the cavalry was certainly mounting and forming, apparently for a
                  charge, and no one could say what additional force, infantry or cavalry, might
                  have come up in the interval. The cavalry must not be allowed to form. Moments
                  were pressing, as they had indeed been all the while since the landing. The
                  company were evidently on their good behavior, for they obeyed like old soldiers,
                  and dropping pries and seizing muskets they formed again at a word. Double-quick
                  back to the corner of the street at the Depot, then sharp to the left for one long
                  block, down the lateral one that ran beside it, and facing across the street to
                  the west they were in full view of the Slave Pen and the cavalry that threatened
                  fight or escape.</p>
               <p>"Price, Birch &amp; Co., Dealers in Slaves," (so read their singularly suggestive
                  sign over the door, indicative of whipping as well as selling) had evidently for
                  the time ceased the slave business. They had had "a good thing or it" (to quote
                  one more expressive modernism) in other and more peaceful days, judging by the
                  extent of their accommodations for what Exeter Hall hates but England loves. In
                  front stood a large brick dwelling-house, and behind it two immense slave-pens
                  (literally jails or prisons) also of brick, one each for males and females, the
                  walls some twenty or twenty-five feet high, and the doors and windows so strongly
                  grated with iron as not to indicate that the occupants were in the habit of
                  clinging to their temporary home with peculiar tenacity. Just then they had all
                  gone out (as the Zouaves<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7282-00000141"/> afterwards
                  found) with a single exception remaining in the male department, and that single
                  exception, oddly enough, bearing the name of "George Washington." Price, Birch
                  &amp; Co.'s building had ceased to be a pen for black slaves, and become the
                  quarters of a part of the military power of the budding Confederacy. In front,
                  some mounting, some attempting to form into line with the others, and some riding
                  around to the rear of the building and apparently getting away, was a squadron of
                  the Fairfax Cavalry, in their gray coats and broad black hats—capitally mounted
                  though somewhat shabbily equipped, and looking as if they might be dangerous foes
                  under different circumstances.</p>
               <p>Quick as thought, at the word of command, the Zouaves covered the cavalry with
                  their pieces, and every motion at mounting or forming or riding away was suspended
                  as if each of the horsemen had been suddenly turned to stone. They were
                  caught—overpowered—helpless; there was no alternative but surrender or the sudden
                  emptying of more than half the saddles of the command. The Zouaves had made the
                  first personal as well as material capture of the war; and every heart beat so
                  high with exultation that weariness, thirst and danger were forgotten, and the
                  shouts rising to their lips could scarcely be restrained. Captain Jack, leaving
                  his company covering every man as before, was just about to step forward and
                  receive the formal surrender, when—God of Heaven!—what was that?</p>
               <p>There are some moments in life full of such unheard-of and hopeless agony and
                  horror, that the man who once meets them is alike incapable of forgetting, and of
                  ever experiencing their counterparts. They come by land and sea, in the daylight
                  and in the dusk night, falling usually with no warning and apparently with no end
                  to subserve except the testing of that metal out of which humanity is made. The
                  treacherous sea has most of them: the steady land presents them sometimes in such
                  terrible force that even the sea is robbed of its supremacy. They seem blows from
                  the very clenched fists of the gods, dashed down in an anger that has no mercy.
                  They stun—they blind—they choke—they make or unmake us Beneath them we lose the
                  noblest parts of our natures, or put on semblances almost divine. They have their
                  purpose, beyond a doubt, that humanity will never be wise enough to see until the
                  Great Unveiling. Sometimes they come at the very moment when a great success has
                  made them less easy to endure: sometimes when long struggle against other and
                  minor misfortunes has given preparation for the worst and yet unstrung the nerves
                  that must meet it. Sometimes they merely calm and ennoble, as when Herndon, after
                  providing for the welfare of every woman and child on the Central America, and
                  when human energy could avail no more for the safety of his own life or any of the
                  others committed to his charge, yielded to the weariness of his labor, lay down
                  and slept the peaceful sleep of childhood, within fifteen minutes of the awful
                  plunge that he knew to be inevitable. Sometimes they freeze into stolidity, as
                  when Luce, inert in action, stood calmly on the deck of the Arctic and went down
                  with her as if he had been merely a statue of stone placed in that position.
                  Sometimes they provoke to bravado, sublime and yet pitiful, as when Follansbee,
                  knowing that the last moment of the St. Denis had come, stood on the deck as the
                  last boat shoved away and the ship beneath him reeled for the final plunge,
                  winding his watch! Sometimes they come when a man all health and hope slips down
                  between two cars of a railroad train and the wheel is already pressing him that in
                  another second is to crush him into a mere pulp of blood and bones and flesh;
                  sometimes when the accused, standing in the dock and confident of his acquittal,
                  hears that awful word "Guilty!" drop from the set lips of the juryman; sometimes
                  when the physician comes once too often to the bedside and says: "You may live
                  half an hour." Some meet them at the very moment of actual death, and so with
                  reference to them the agonized man is dumb forever; others when the apparent doom
                  is yet escaped by the breadth of a hair. Driesbach the beast-tamer meets one when
                  the attendant has locked the door of the cage and gone away, leaving him powerless
                  to escape from the fangs of the unbroken lion that is all the while lashing the
                  bars with his tail and crouching for a spring that may come at any moment—sees it
                  for thirty long minutes of fixed eye<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7282-00000142"/>
                  and bated breath, man against beast, hope against despair, till the keeper comes
                  at last and the peril is averted; Van Amburgh, his rival and perhaps his master,
                  meets one when the tigress of the "Tiger King" springs upon him on the stage,
                  buries his whole shoulder in its engulfing mouth, and leaves him with no hope of
                  deliverance except the sledge-hammer blow of that iron arm and hand, crushing
                  brute brow and brain like the fabled stroke of "Front de Boeuf." Eliot War-burton
                  sees one of them as he stands on the deck of the burning Amazon, and in the horror
                  of that moment the glory of all the Orient lands is forgotten: he can do nothing
                  but die, and dies as becomes a man. Gilman Appleby sees another on his burning
                  Constitution on Lake Erie, and again when the storm is dashing her on the rocks
                  that in another moment will grind her to powder; but his wild, reckless will alike
                  defies the good and the evil, and with two pistols in his belt, literally driving
                  his frightened passengers to safety, or sitting astride of his overburthened
                  safety-valve, with his eye glaring fiendishly down on the frightened engineer, he
                  seems to dash the very thunderbolts from the immortal hands and reverse the
                  decrees of fate. No man is quite the same after enduring one of these moments; for
                  though he <emph>may</emph> be better and wiser, as befits one who has stood on the
                  threshold and seen the Mystery face to face,—yet he <emph>may</emph> be wilder and
                  more reckless, as one who feels that there is no terror possible to be added to
                  his experience.</p>
               <p>All which may or may not have a legitimate connection with the event of that
                  particular moment in front of the old Slave. Pen at Alexandria. There was horror
                  enough, certainly, to mark the culmination of any man's experience of pain,
                  disappointment, bitter anger, and that other and baser passion—<emph>fear.</emph>
                  For at the very instant that Captain Jack moved to receive the sword of the
                  surrendering cavalry-officer, there was a sharp rattle and clash behind him and
                  his company, the tramp of hurried feet upon the pavement, the roll of wheels, and
                  almost before he could turn his head a battery of four United States pieces dashed
                  up, unlimbered, trained full upon his company and himself, so near that the
                  discharge of grape must have swept the street clear of every living man,</p>
               <p>and he heard the quick voice of Wilcox, full of hurry and anxiety, shout to the
                  officer in charge of the guns:—</p>
               <p>"Fire!"</p>
               <p>How many in the company saw the peril, no man knows. Every man in it, questioned
                  afterwards, would have said he saw it, for no man likes to lose the credit of
                  having known, as well as passed through, a great danger. So many as
                     <emph>did</emph> forsake their aim at the sound, and catch a glimpse of what
                  lay behind, undoubtedly set their teeth and waited their fate in dogged despair.
                  Captain Jack, the first to see the impending catastrophe, and probably the only
                  one who understood it, followed Shakspeare, "swore a prayer," and waited for his
                  doom with an impression that the whole thing was an outrage—to blow away a company
                  at the mouths of a battery, just when they were about making a neat haul of
                  prisoners.</p>
               <p>But all this did not occupy an instant, as the space after an officer of a regular
                  battery gives the command to fire and before the command is executed, is
                  singularly short to those who happen to stand in the way. But what did the
                  hesitation mean? Why did not the iron come tearing through their ranks? Strange!
                  Yes, strange—one of those hair-breadth chances which partake a little of the
                  character of the miracle. Colonel Wilcox had believed his regiment the only Union
                  force in the town—seen the grey uniform of the Zouaves as he came rapidly up, and
                  supposed it to be the prevailing rebel color—and the danger had been that just
                  related. By the merest accident Lieut. Ramsay, of the regulars, who commanded the
                  battery (and who afterwards had his head shot off, fighting bravely at Bull Hun)
                  had chanced to see a Zouave uniform or two as the battery came in through the
                  city; and at the moment when the fatal command was given, the thought had darted
                  suddenly into his head that the Zouaves might have reached the city in advance.
                  This had withheld the last order to the cannoniers, and by just so narrow a chance
                  had the taking of Alexandria been saved from going upon record as even a darker
                  and sadder tragedy than it now exhibits in the early history of the war. Sorrow
                  for the cause of the nation, for the lives of many brave men, and the peace of
                  many hearts now broken,—that even so narrow an escape as this from the<pb
                     n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7282-00000143"/> murder of friends has not always been
                  accorded by the envious fates, and that once and again, from Big Bethel to some of
                  the last fights of the summer campaign of 1863 in Virginia, score after score of
                  lives has been lost, and regiment after regiment disabled, by mistakes in uniform,
                  flag or position, quite as stupid and quite as sad as that which sacrificed a
                  great battle and a kingdom, in English history, through the belief that foes were
                  coming into the fight, carrying the Rising Sun of York, instead of friends bearing
                  the Silver Star of Oxford.</p>
               <p>It is surprising how short a space of time may be consumed in occurrences that
                  take a considerable period in their most concise relation. It did not seem more
                  than a moment after the unlimbering of those guns, when Colonel Wilcox spurred his
                  horse past the left flank of the Zouaves, dashed up to the Captain and drew rein
                  in front of him, with the sharp, angry, puzzled inquiry:</p>
               <p>"Who are <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Captain ——, commanding Company ——, of the First Fire Zouaves," replied the
                  Captain, who had scarcely yet recovered from the impression that he should by that
                  time have ceased answering questions on this side of the line between life and
                  death.</p>
               <p>"What!" exclaimed the Colonel, who had before entertained no more idea that the
                  Zouaves could be in that position, than that they were quartered in South
                  Carolina. "And what are you doing here, then?"</p>
               <p>"Obeying orders!" answered Captain Jack, with just the least dash of offended
                  dignity in his tone. He knew Wilcox, at a glance, but did <emph>not</emph> know
                  that he had any business, after threatening to blow his company out of existence,
                  to follow it up by bullying <emph>him</emph> in the execution of his duty. "I was
                  sent by Colonel Ellsworth, who holds the town, to tear up the track of the
                  railroad yonder, I had just done it, and was making a capture of that body of
                  rebel cavalry, when your little arrangement for blowing us away with that battery
                  spoiled the fun, and about half of them have taken the chance to get away."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said the Colonel, who saw that the last allegation tion was true, at
                  least. "If that is the case, look to your prisoners."</p>
               <p>"Thank you for nothing!" muttered Captain Jack, as the Colonel wheeled his horse
                  and dashed back to the battery and his own regiment that was now coming up and
                  filling the whole street close behind. A moment more sufficed to throw his men
                  into such position that no further attempts at escape on the part of the cavalry
                  were possible, and the rebel Captain Ball stepped forward and delivered up his
                  sword. The whole number of the rebel force when the Zouaves came upon the ground,
                  had been about their own number, eighty; but the interruption had enabled half of
                  them to get away, and the capture actually made was that of thirty-six men and
                  forty horses—unimportant of itself, but embodying some interest from the fact that
                  it was <emph>the first capture of men in the war,</emph> as the taking of
                  Alexandria was the first re-possession of any town that had fallen into rebel
                  hands, by the Federals.</p>
               <p>The rebel cavalry were being disarmed and placed under guard, while details of the
                  Zouaves and the First Michigan had commenced exploring the Railroad Depot and the
                  Slave Pen for traces of the Virginia troops who had been quartered there,—when a
                  mounted scout rode hastily up the street from the direction of the river and
                  stooped from his saddle to speak to Col. Wilcox, who had dismounted. He spoke in a
                  low tone and the conversation was carried on out of easy earshot of the men, but
                  some of the command saw that the Colonel's face grew agitated and that his eyes
                  seemed anxious and troubled. A moment more, and the scout rode away again, while
                  Colonel Wilcox, coming up in front of the spot where the body of the Zouave
                  company yet stood in position, and said, so loud that all could hear him:</p>
               <p>"Captain, my men will relieve your company of the charge of the prisoners. I have
                  other service for you. There is a hill about two miles west-south-west, between
                  the Fairfax and the Leesburg roads, called Shooter's Hill. It has a commanding
                  position, and it may be necessary to make a post there at once. You will go
                  forward with your company and take possession immediately. Never mind being a
                  little tired, boys. Away with you, quick!"</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7282-00000144"/>
               <p>What is the magnetism which informs us when we are hearing a positive lie or only
                  being entrusted with half of a truth? That we do have such intuitions, is beyond
                  question. Captain Jack knew, just as well as he could have done had the fact been
                  sworn to him by most competent authority, that Shooter's Hill was <emph>not</emph>
                  a matter of any such consequence to the Colonel, just then, that he would send the
                  tired Zouaves out to take possession of it. Besides, he had no superior officer in
                  the town, from whom he could have received orders, by the scout, to make any such
                  movement. Then, he was in too much of a hurry to get them away, as a few minutes
                  could not possibly make so much difference in the occupation of a mere outpost.
                  There was something else, and that something had a connection with the hurried
                  riding in of the scout. What? He was soon to be answered.</p>
               <p>The company were ready in file for marching, when the Colonel drew Captain Jack
                  aside for a moment, and said, in a low, agitated voice:</p>
               <p>"Get your fellows away as quick as you can, Captain! Every moment is an hour! The
                  next scout that comes in may say a word too much!"</p>
               <p>"In God's name, what is the matter, Colonel?" asked Captain Jack, his tone as low
                  and anxious as that of the other. "I saw that something was wrong, but could not
                  guess what. In a scrape below?"</p>
               <p>"I meant to tell <emph>you</emph> before you went," said the Colonel. "Worse than
                  a scrape. Oh, why will men go beyond their orders and make fools of themselves!
                  Your Colonel has just been killed at the Marshall House, by the landlord, and God
                  knows whether Farnham can even manage the rest of the regiment and keep them from
                  burning down the town, even if we can keep these in the dark a few hours."</p>
               <p>"Colonel Ellsworth killed!" gasped the Captain, who seemed as incapable of
                  realizing that a man <emph>could</emph> be killed in so short a time, as the man
                  who backed up the validity of his own note was incredulous of the possibility of a
                  man dying "within ninety days."</p>
               <p>"Yes, killed, and the landlord with him," said the Colonel. "But you will hear all
                  about it, soon enough. Get out to Shooter's Hill as fast as you can, and not a
                  word to the boys about it until the day is over."</p>
               <p>"The landlord killed, too! Well, that is some comfort!" muttered Captain Jack, as
                  he went back, took his place at the head of his company and marched them away at
                  quick step up the Fairfax Road. They were very foot-sore and weary, and fancied
                  that one place was enough to capture in a single day; and Burtnett Haviland,
                  file-leader of the first file, caught himself thinking that if the bottoms of his
                  feet were not blistered and his stomach was not empty, they probably would be by
                  the time they had finished their march and found breakfast. But they had taken a
                  town and captured the Fairfax Cavalry, the boys thought—that was something; and so
                  they stepped away with very good spirits towards Shooter's Hill, which was to
                  form, with its neighborhood, the scene of almost all their camp experience in
                  Virginia.</p>
               <p>Ellsworth dead! Yes, that was the story told by the Colonel, and too truly he
                  indicated the misfortune. The young Colonel had already reached the end of his
                  career—the close of all his brilliant anticipations of the life of a patriot
                  soldier. He had seen the rebel flag flying on the top of the Marshall House, a
                  dingy old brick building at the corner of King and Pitt Streets—had had too much
                  headlong patriotism to despise the exhibition, too much courage to hesitate at any
                  peril, and too little prudent forethought to be capable of taking care of himself
                  or others. He had sprung into the house on the mad as well as useless errand of
                  tearing down that flag, been shot through the heart by Jackson, in performing it,
                  and his slayer laid dead beside him by Brownell, who could revenge his Colonel but
                  could not remember to shoot quickly enough to save him. He was dead, and his plans
                  and purposes as well as his hopes dead with him; while his regiment had its own
                  welfare to look after, under officers who an hour before had no dream of assuming
                  such a responsibility.</p>
               <p>That is the story of the death of Ellsworth, somewhat more briefly told than in
                  the inflated relations and atrociously bad plays with which, as the first death of
                  an officer in the War<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7282-00000145"/> for the Union, it
                  has since supplied current literature. It was a mad, reckless waste of life and
                  desertion of command—, nothing more nor less. Washington was a hero at Princeton,
                  when he rode between the cross-fires of the two forces, and Napoleon at Lodi when
                  he charged over that deadly bridge,—because all was lost to each without the
                  exertion, and the stake was worth life. But the one would Lave proved himself a
                  fool by exposing himself in the same manner in a mere skirmish, and the other by
                  leading an ordinary forlorn-hope instead of directing it. Ellsworth at once proved
                  his personal bravery and his unfitness for command, when he went on a service for
                  which (if it was to be done at all) he should have sent a corporal's guard, and
                  lost his life in taking down a rebel rag of very doubtful cleanliness, from the
                  roof of a second-rate Virginia tavern. Two of his own Zouaves had "taken down" its
                  predecessor from the same roof, only a few days before, at much less cost, by
                  climbing out and stealing it after dinner, and one of them bringing it away
                  wrapped round his body and concealed under his clothing! And they could have
                  performed the same task again, if necessary.</p>
               <p>Striking the balance of the reckless exposures of the Union War against its
                  poltrooneries, perhaps there might be less to complain of. For against one officer
                  throwing away his life in this manner, we might set another lying at ease behind a
                  haystack during a whole battle; and against a second daredevil we might oppose
                  another taking a sudden fancy, when under fire, for whortleberries growing in the
                  remotest parts of a wood;<ref rend="super" target="#note_032" xml:id="return_032"
                     >*</ref>
                   but unfortunately one fault does not quite do away with the disadvantages
                  of the other, and the middle ground of bravery in conflict seems about as
                  indispensable for the success of our armies, as the middle ground of conservative
                  policy for the furtherance of the national cause.</p>

                  <p>CHARLES HOLT WITH A CALL ABROAD—HOW HE PAID A FAREWELL VISIT TO BURTNETT
                     HAVILAND'S—MISS SARAH SANDERSON'S LITTLE AMUSEMENT, AND A COMPACT FOLLOWING—HOW
                     THE MERCHANT MADE A CONFIDANTE OF MARY HAVILAND, AND BADE HER GOOD-BYE—FIVE
                     MINUTES IN THE ROOM OF OLYMPIA HOLT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AGAIN the active operations of war must drop for a time into the back-ground and
                  the course of this narration return to those actors in the drama who have not
                  passed into the theatre of actual bloodshed. Only temporarily for the war-clouds
                  thicken, and one of those fierce struggles of one rank of the descendants of Cain
                  with another, which sometimes make us doubt the identity of human origin, is in
                  the near prospect.</p>
               <p>It has been more than intimated, before this, that Mr. Charles Holt, merchant,
                  some of whose "little amusements" have begun to dawn upon the mind of the reader
                  as at least liable to moral objection,—was not by any means a mere man of
                  pleasure, or even of fashionable vice, but a thorough, incarnate commercial
                  manager as well, carrying on an extensive business with signal ability, and losing
                  no opportunity, proper or improper, to add to a fortune already believed to be
                  colossal. No better proof of this need be adduced than the manner in which he had
                  seized upon the needs of the government, at the very earliest moment, and entered
                  into those cloth speculations paying and promising so finely. To this fact may be
                  added another apparently very different—that if "the course of true love never did
                  run smooth," that of false and dishonorable love is at least liable to an
                  occasional ripple; and the connection between the two facts will soon be made
                  apparent.</p>
               <p>Coming into the store late of an afternoon not far from the<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000146"/> close of May, the merchant was accosted by Mr.
                  Wales, the gray-haired book-keeper:</p>
               <p>"Quite a number of letters this afternoon, Mr. Holt, and one that is privately
                  addressed. It bears the London postmark, and you will find it lying on your
                  desk."</p>
               <p>Charles Holt took up the letter, broke the seal and ran his eye hastily over it.
                  It was from London, by the steamer that had reached Boston only the day before,
                  and bore the signature of Mr. Beverly Andrews, his partner, who yet remained
                  abroad. One portion of it ran as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"All your advices are duly noted; and so far as I have judged it prudent to do,
                     I have acted upon them. But the fact is that for the first time in my life, in
                     a plain matter of business, I find myself at fault. The Sumter affair has
                     created almost as much excitement here as it undoubtedly has done at home; and
                     things are confused terribly. Exchanges begin to run against us so that I
                     scarcely know what to buy and what to leave untouched. I would give almost any
                     thing to have your older and you must not think I intend to flatter) clearer
                     head, here, even for consultation an hour or two. I suppose it is too much to
                     ask, but could you not manage to run over, even if you went back by the same
                     steamer? I cannot possibly leave here, in the present posture of American
                     credit; and yet I feel that some large operations might be performed if one
                     could only be perfectly sure of his footing."</p>
               </q>
               <p>For five minutes the merchant leaned on the desk, holding the letter in his hand,
                  and in silence. His brow was bent, as if many conflicting thoughts were beating
                  beneath it, and then the cloud cleared away. He had decided.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wales," he said, "you had better see Mr. Nellis tomorrow morning before you
                  come down-town, and tell him that he must give up his arrangement for going to
                  Chicago, until a month or two later. We shall need all our force at their
                  posts."</p>
               <p>"I will attend to it, sir," answered Wales, a thorough old martinet, who never
                  questioned orders but obeyed them.</p>
               <p>"I am going to England by the Cunarder from Jersey City to-morrow," the merchant
                  continued. The fact was all that he had any occasion to announce: the why was his
                  business and his alone. "Some of those Western accounts must be sent out by
                  mail—have them attended to at once. Send to the office and have me a forward
                  state-room engaged, if there is one left. If I can see Nellis in the morning
                  before I leave, all well; if not, I will hand you a letter with full instructions
                  for him, as I go down."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir," answered the book-keeper. "Do you have any idea of the time of
                  your return? As I suppose that your arrangement is somewhat sudden, we may have
                  occasion to answer the question."</p>
               <p>"I may return by the same steamer," said the merchant. "If not, by the next; and I
                  shall not be absent more than thirty to forty days, at the longest. You understand
                  the arrangement, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Entirely, I believe," said the book-keeper, and the merchant slipped the letter
                  into his side-pocket and left the store. He stepped out to Broadway, then down to
                  the front of the Astor House and motioned to the driver of one of the carriages in
                  waiting there. A few words, and the carriage whirled off up Broadway, with its
                  occupant lounging on the back seat, but his head so thrown forward that the chin
                  reposed upon his breast, and the brow again wrinkled with thoughts that seemed to
                  keep his brain continually busy.</p>
               <p>It was a little past sunset when the carriage, having pursued Third Avenue from
                  Astor Place, whirled into East Forty-eighth Street and set the merchant down just
                  below the corner, driving round into the Avenue afterwards and awaiting him. For
                  reasons of his own, which may have been delicate unwillingness to be seen
                  habitually going in a carriage to a house the occupants of which so seldom used
                  that costly mode of conveyance, and which may have had the far less creditable
                  motive of not wishing to be observed at all—he had only been driven to the house
                  once or twice, in a considerable number of visits. On the present occasion be
                  walked briskly down the sidewalk and as briskly up the steps, like one who had
                  much business to do in a very limited period. The May evening was soft and
                  pleasant, and many doors along the street had been left standing open—among
                  others, that of the house he was about entering. He had, or fancied that he had,
                  now, sufficiently the footing of an intimate acquaintance, to pass in, under those
                  circumstances, without ringing, and merely tap at the door at the head of the
                  stairs. He followed out the first part of this intention, but found the<pb
                     n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7282-00000147"/> remainder impossible. As he passed the
                  dining-room door at the head of the stair, he saw that it was open, cast a glance
                  within but perceived no one. Passing to the other door, he found that also open,
                  and as he was about to tap his knuckles upon the casing as a summons, saw that
                  there appeared to be only one person in the room and that person Sarah
                  Sanderson.</p>
               <p>The eyes of the merchant had the habit of taking in all the details of a scene at
                  a single glance, as well as embracing the whole contour. They exercised that power
                  in the present instance. He saw that the young girl was alone and that she had not
                  heard his foot on the stair or at the door. He saw, too, that she stood with her
                  face turned three-quarters away from the door, that she held a letter in both
                  hands and was applying it to her lips. Kissing a letter, eh?—thought the merchant.
                  No!—every thing else rather than that. She was <emph>licking</emph> the letter
                  instead of kissing it—taking the innocent liberty of coaxing open the seal by
                  dampening the gum of the envelope with her lips and tongue! Aha!—and the merchant
                  read the story at once. She was tampering with correspondence! Perhaps he had seen
                  such a thing done before: at all events he did not utter any audible sound of
                  surprise or indignation. He merely took three steps to the spot where the young
                  girl was standing—steps that she did not hear any more than those which had
                  preceded them,—reached his hand partially over her shoulder and took away the
                  letter with a quick jerk.</p>
               <p>Sarah Sanderson half screamed with the surprise and fright, then turned and
                  recognized the merchant, and finished by trembling like a leaf and nearly falling
                  upon the floor. Beyond the half-suppressed scream and an attempt at repeating it,
                  not a word could she utter.</p>
               <p>"Stop your noise and don't make a fool of yourself!" said the merchant, with the
                  calm superiority of older years and better practised villainy, and at the same
                  time catching a glance at the envelope in his hand, which showed that it bore the
                  Washington post-mark and that it was directed to Mrs. Mary Haviland in the
                  well-known writing of his absent clerk. "Where is Mrs. Haviland?"</p>
               <p>"She has—gone out," stammered the culprit.</p>
               <p>"And you are alone in the house?" queried the immaculate judge.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Please——" and here the small hands began to clasp themselves and the
                  merchant became aware that pleading was about to commence.</p>
               <p>"I tell you again to stop your noise, except when <emph>I</emph> speak to you,"
                  said the man of experience, whose mind had already taken in and revolved the
                  thought how much more completely this discovery would place the young girl in his
                  power. "Now then, what were you doing with this letter?"</p>
               <p>"Please, sir, I was only trying to—to—to fasten it up—oh, don't tell of me, Mr.
                  Holt! Please don't!" and the hands went together again and more pleading was
                  likely to begin, though there was no flush of shame on the cheek and the eyes were
                  entirely dry.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> tell of you, and have a policeman here in five minutes, if
                  you do not do precisely as I bid you!" said Charles Holt, determined to finish the
                  fright at once and crush out the last spark of hope except in plain truth and
                  abject obedience. "Now I have you in my power, Sarah, and can ruin you in a
                  moment. I will do it if you try to deceive me or disobey me. Tell me the whole
                  truth, and you will be in no danger. What were you doing with that letter?"</p>
               <p>"I was trying—to—to—"</p>
               <p>"Open it, by dampening the gum?" the merchant helped her out.</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered the girl, evidently with a violent effort.</p>
               <p>"Yes, so I thought!" said the merchant, with that sneer in his tone which a lawyer
                  uses when he has at last extorted the injurious admission from the reluctant
                  witness. "Now, then, one thing more, and you had better answer this question quite
                  as candidly—<emph>why</emph> were you opening this letter?"</p>
               <p>It has before been remarked that there was no flush of shame on the cheek of Sarah
                  Sanderson at her detection. Now, and at this question, the whole cheek became one
                  intense crimson, until it seemed that more blood than the whole body ought to have
                  contained, was concentrated in the face. The merchant saw it, and his mental
                  comment was as quick as the<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7282-00000148"/> flush. She
                  attempted to answer, and yet she <emph>could</emph> not answer the truth.</p>
               <p>"Because—because I wanted to—to hear from Mr. Haviland—"</p>
               <p>"Because you <emph>love</emph> Mr. Haviland!" and these words were spoken in a
                  low, concentrated tone, close down to the ear of the young girl. She started away
                  from him, trembled, yet more violently than before, and if there had been any
                  possibility of the amount of blood in the face being added to, that addition was
                  made at the moment. If she tried to speak, the words stuck in her throat, for she
                  uttered no sound except what might have been the gurgle of one choking. Her eyes
                  were bent to the floor.</p>
               <p>"Look at me," said the merchant. As if compelled, she obeyed, and met eyes that
                  had power but little pity in them. "Now answer my question, without any further
                  delay, or you will be very sorry that you had not done so."</p>
               <p>The answer came, but the eyes went down again to the floor and the assent was
                  given in three or four nods that told more than words could have spoken.</p>
               <p>"That is well," said the merchant. "Now one thing more—you hate his wife. She is
                     <emph>in your way.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, heavens! what are you saying?" broke out the young girl, looking
                  apprehensively towards the door. "Suppose she should hear us!"</p>
               <p>"No fear of that!" answered Charles Holt. "<emph>My</emph> ears tell me when any
                  one is approaching. Answer my question."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the girl, finding voice this time, and the voice having an
                  indescribable sound of angry dislike that might have been any thing but reassuring
                  to the subject of the reply.</p>
               <p>"I thought so, and that is very well also," said the tempter. "Now, Sarah, we
                  shall get on very well together, I fancy."</p>
               <p>"And you will not tell of me, Mr. Holt?" asked the girl, somewhat reassured by the
                  less threatening, even patronizing tone in which the last words had been
                  uttered.</p>
               <p>"Tell of you?—no, not if you obey my orders," answered the merchant. "Tell of
                  you?—no. You are more of a woman than I thought—have loves and hates, and I like
                  you the better for them. And besides, you have given me a new idea, for which I am
                  going to be very grateful in some of those nice yellow pieces that you have seen
                  before. And by the way, here is one of them."</p>
               <p>As an earnest of the future as well as a reminder of the past, Charles Holt's hand
                  again went into his pocket and emerged with a gold coin within the fingers, which
                  he at once transferred to the palm of the young girl.</p>
               <p>"Now listen to me for one moment, and see that you pay attention to what I am
                  going to say," he went on. "You love Burtnett Haviland, and you hate his wife
                  because she is in your way. Obey me, and she may get <emph>out</emph> of the way,
                  almost before you know it."</p>
               <p>"Out of the way!—She?" queried the girl, an expression of fierce delight passing
                  over her face, but still blended with something of uncertainty, as if such a joy
                  must be impossible.</p>
               <p>"I said so," answered Charles Holt, "and what I say I generally have the power of
                  proving. Now mind—by your having the letter in your hands, before it came to Mrs.
                  Haviland, you must be in the habit of taking in the letters yourself."</p>
               <p>"Almost always," answered the girl.</p>
               <p>"Make it <emph>always,</emph> then," directed her mentor. "Let every one of the
                  letters that comes to the house pass through your hands. Stop—what is the name of
                  the post-man who serves on this route? And where does he live?"</p>
               <p>"His name is —— and I have heard that he lives in East —— Street, not far from the
                  Station," was the answer, the young girl's eyes somewhat expressive of that wonder
                  and alarm which come of getting beyond one's depth.</p>
               <p>"That will do," said the merchant. "I will see him, and any letters that come here
                  for Mrs. Haviland will be given to you, and if she happens to go to the door,
                  there will be none for her—those, I mean, that are in her husband's hand-writing.
                  See to it that she does not have one more letter from him, until I come here
                  again. Do you understand me?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>think</emph> I do!" said the neophyte.</p>
               <p>"Something more—you take the letters to the Station, do you not?"</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7282-00000149"/>
               <p>"Yes, sir—or hand them to the post-man."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, stop every one of Mrs. Haviland's letters addressed to her husband,
                  If one of them goes, all the rest of the labor will be thrown away. Not
                  one—mind."</p>
               <p>"Oh sir—Mr. Holt—what are you going to do!" broke out the young girl, completely
                  off her depth in villainy, shocked and stunned by the idea of entirely breaking up
                  that correspondence between husband and wife into which she had only intended to
                  pry, and quite as much frightened at the possible result as she had been at the
                  prospect of discovery in her comparatively trifling crime.</p>
               <p>"My own business, and yours!" answered the merchant, severely, to her frightened
                  inquiry. "And mind—you have no choice in the matter! If you do not do as I have
                  ordered, and do it effectually, I will have you taken up for breaking open
                  letters, and sent to the State Prison; if you do, you may some day find that the
                  man you love is your own, the woman you hate out of your way, and yourself a
                  woman. Hush!—some one is at the door and coming up the stair. Not another
                  word—remember!"</p>
               <p>The last word was spoken threateningly, though very low; and the lips from which
                  it emanated were scowling. One moment after, when Mary Haviland entered the back
                  room with little Louise, Sarah Sanderson was making a clatter there, as if she had
                  been steadily at work for an hour, and Charles Holt was pacing slowly up and down
                  the parlor, humming a ballad tune in a low, gruff voice, to "make assurance double
                  sure" and supply an explanation if one of his last words should have happened to
                  be heard by the returning wife. The young girl, as she busied herself about the
                  supper arrangements, may have been frightened and flustered at the thought of the
                  situation into which she was being plunged deeper and deeper by her own fault and
                  the ascendancy of that strange man in the parlor; but she had no more intention of
                  disobeying him than she could have had of sawing off one of her own little hands
                  with the dull carving-knife in the box on the dresser. And as for the merchant
                  himself—he was not flustered or frightened one whit. He had simply performed
                  another "operation"—one quite in his line—if not in cloths and cassimeres, in
                  something quite as saleable—human happiness and perhaps human souls.</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland heard the step and the voice of the merchant in the parlor, as she
                  surmounted the stair, and she went first into the dining-room, dropped Pet and her
                  bonnet, and came into the parlor through the passage. How very handsome she
                  looked—really, as well as to the eyes of the scheming merchant and man of
                  pleasure! Her cheeks, that did not redden as do some others, to the extent of
                  ungracefulness, by walking, were yet a little flushed with exercise, and her dark
                  dress with its plain little white collar and cuffs, touched her blonde hair with
                  something almost angelic. Charles Holt did not see the "angel" quite so plainly as
                  he recognized the woman; but he was touched, nevertheless.</p>
               <p>So far, in intercourse that had now lasted for nearly a month, never for one
                  moment had that subtle and powerful voluptuary forgotten the prudence and
                  propriety of his role. Not one word had yet been spoken that could compromise his
                  position with the wife, simply because he had not been certain that the time had
                  come. He preferred, generally, the McClellan system of warfare, that is twice or
                  three times as long as it should be at building a bridge, but builds it, at last,
                  two or three times as strong as is necessary. He knew, intuitively, that too soon
                  would be worse than too late, in that quarter, and that one premature fright would
                  destroy future chance for all time. He had seen, all the while, that the young
                  wife, left so lonely and thrown so much into his society, was growing more and
                  more pleased with his visits and reliant upon him. That was something—it was even
                  almost enough, in his mind; for no matter how slight may be the slope of the
                  inclined plane, give it length enough and it will come down to the lowest level
                  desired. With this in view, he had so far been able to restrain himself; and the
                  nearest approach to familiarity yet attained had been the holding of one of the
                  little hands something too long for strict propriety, and a kiss which he had once
                  or twice impressed upon that innocent member with apparent courtly dignity and yet
                  with lips that burned more than the young wife knew. So far the restraint had
                  lasted: how much longer<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7282-00000150"/> was it to last
                  and how much longer could it last, with such visions continually beaming before
                  him? One step forward—one step if no more, before the long swell of the Atlantic
                  should roll between them on the evening of the morrow.</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland received her guest with even more warmth than had been her wont When
                  he held out both hands to her, one of hers fell into each, and she allowed him to
                  retain them long, as he walked beside her towards the front window where the light
                  of the May evening was fast fading away into dusk. It was time for lighting the
                  little chandelier, and yet not only he but <emph>she</emph> felt that no other
                  light was needed. Nothing could have been more dangerous. Sunlight may be
                  exhilarating and moonlight may be entrancing, but neither can for one moment
                  compare with the soft dusk uncertainty of twilight, in its peril to two who love,
                  or fancy that they love, or wish to fancy that they love, each other.</p>
               <p>Then followed what the pen of the narrator has no fancy for portraying, and yet
                  what cannot be avoided—a little bit of acting on the one side, which would have
                  made Ned Booth or Ned Davenport expire with envy,—and a corresponding bit of
                  womanly yielding, not to say culpable weakness, on the other, which might have
                  induced Mary Gannon (queen of all the juvenile simplicities) to indulge at least
                  in a small exhibition of feminine spite.</p>
               <p>The two were very near together as they took seats near the window—nearer than
                  they had sat on any previous occasion. The dark may have been the reason of this
                  accident. A few commonplaces, and the tone of the merchant's voice sunk very low,
                  at the same time that his hand, which had been toying with the tassel of the tidy
                  on Mary Haviland's chair, fell over on her lap and rested there, partially upon
                  one of her own. Then it crept closer to the companion member, and at last
                  encompassed it. Neither of the motions were opposed or resisted by the young wife.
                  The grasp of the merchant closed warm around the little hand in his own, and Mary
                  Haviland heard him utter a deep, low sigh, almost a groan in its intensity. The
                  instant after, she saw him spring to his feet and clasp his hand to his brow, as
                  if some sudden pain had struck him there or some deadly recollection stung him
                  like an asp. It was the most natural thing in the world for the little woman to
                  spring from her chair and grasp her guest by the arm, in real anxiety.</p>
               <p>"You are in pain—sick?" she asked, that bewildering touch still upon his arm.</p>
               <p>"No—yes," with another sigh, half a tone still lower than its predecessor. "Do not
                  mind me, I beg of you."</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>must</emph> mind you!" said the wife. "I cannot see you suffer and be
                  unmoved."</p>
               <p>"Can you not? Then God bless your kind, good heart!" said the consummate actor,
                  sinking back again into his chair and allowing the little hand to slide down his
                  arm until it not only touched his hand but actually took it unbidden. Then a
                  shudder as he felt the touch, and then he continued: "And yet I am afraid, Mrs.
                  Haviland—may I not say Mary?—that I must either never come into your presence
                  again, or you may be doomed to see much more of such suffering, without any power
                  in the world to relieve it." He was calmer now (as an attendant physician might
                  have said after the paroxysm of a patient), and did not sigh again in the same
                  heart-rending manner.</p>
               <p>"What can you mean?" asked the young wife, her hand still retaining his in her
                  grasp, with some kind of idea in her heart that she was playing ministering angel.
                  So she was, but—bless her little innocent heart!—to a very different subject from
                  what she imagined.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am a fool, if not a villain!" said the merchant, his whole expression one
                  of dissatisfaction and anger with himself for this betrayal. "What right have I to
                  cloud <emph>your</emph> life with my unhappiness, with my—"</p>
               <p>"Unhappiness!" echoed the young wife, to whom, it must be confessed, spite of the
                  content of her state, unlimited wealth and position had seemed to be a bar against
                  the possibility of such a thing as that word represented. "Unhappiness? You, so
                  good and so powerful, unhappy?"</p>
               <p>"I could bite off my tongue for allowing me to utter that word," exclaimed the
                  merchant. "And yet it is out, and I cannot recall it. Unhappiness? yes!—of course
                  you could<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7282-00000151"/> not be aware of the fact, but
                  I have no home, and have never had one. There are words that we cannot speak, and
                  some that we must not. But after my unguarded speech," (oh, very unguarded!) "I
                  suppose that I owe you the justice of explaining that my home is a hell, and that
                  my marriage has never been any thing more than a mockery."</p>
               <p>How sadly he seemed to be in earnest, now!—and how impossible it seemed that all
                  this could be assumed! Alas!—in this one passage he assumed nothing, as the reader
                  of this narration is partially aware, and as he may become more fully convinced
                  before it closes. And who does not know how much more terribly real the tragedian
                  becomes, though only playing his part, when he chances upon some passage which
                  bents his own real life?</p>
               <p>"My dear, good friend! How I pity you!" said Mary Haviland, his hand yet in hers
                  and their chairs very near.</p>
               <p>"'Pity's akin to love'—Shakspeare!" said the merchant to himself. "I am getting on
                  famously." But his lips uttered something very different.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you do pity me—I believe it, I know it!" he said, his hand more than
                  returning the kindly pressure. "And that—can you believe it?—makes me more
                  wretched."</p>
               <p>"My pity make you wretched!" echoed the young wife, not fully enough versed in the
                  alchemy of human thought to understand how that effect could be produced.</p>
               <p>"Yes, wretched beyond thought!" said the merchant. "Oh Mrs. Haviland—Mary—you do
                  not know how I am torturing myself as well as you, and yet what a straw I am on
                  the current of a misery I cannot resist. I came to bid you good-bye, and I meant
                  to do so, calmly; but see what a child I have been—what a child I am!"</p>
               <p>"To bid me good-bye?" asked the wife. "What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"That I am going to Europe to-morrow," said the actor, "and that I could not go
                  without seeing you—you and your little house once more."</p>
               <p>"Going to Europe!" said the wife, and her tone and manner were so sincere that the
                  close observer had no difficulty in discerning how she felt the coming
                  loneliness.</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered the merchant, "I am suddenly called there, and I must be absent
                  for weeks, at least. I can bid good-bye to my own lonely home without one pang;
                  but if you only knew, Mary—there, you see I have called you by that sweet name
                  again, and you have not scolded me!—if you only knew how much of my enjoyment—of
                  my happiness—has lain for weeks past in the visits I have paid to this little
                  house—how much nearer, even for a few brief hours, it has been to supplying me a
                     <emph>home</emph> than any other spot in the world,—you would know what has so
                  unmanned me and made me a child when I came for a moment again into a heaven of
                  goodness, to go out of it for so long!"</p>
               <p>He had risen as he spoke the last words, and reached over to the little table on
                  which it had been set, for his hat. He was going, and going for so long. How kind
                  and good and flattering he had been, to be happy in her humble dwelling when he
                  could not be in his own luxurious home! What a good, honest, impulsive man he was,
                  and how little the world could be likely to understand him! How much of her life
                  he had lately made, and how lonely she should be during his absence! Such were the
                  thoughts of Mary Haviland—just those thoughts, nothing less or more. And when
                  Charles Holt moved towards the door of the little room and she said: "I am really
                  so sorry you are going!" her soul was in her words as well as in her face. And
                  when Charles Holt, as if moved by an irresistible impulse for which he could not
                  be more accountable than the madman for his action or the man under the influence
                  of the exhilerating gas for his antic,—when Charles Holt sprang forward, said:
                  "Mary—dear Mary! good-bye and God bless you!" caught his arm with convulsive
                  suddenness around her and pressed his burning lips to hers,—she did not repulse
                  him or even start back; nay more, it is to be believed that beneath the hot
                  pressure of his lips there was for one instant the throb of a sensation through
                  the rose-leaves under which the sweet blood coursed!—that she actually returned
                  his kiss!</p>
               <p>Close your spiritual eyes as well as your physical ones, oh Burtnett Haviland,
                  soldier in the Army of the Union, as you stand on guard on one of the wharves at
                  Alexandria and hear<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7282-00000152"/> the Potomac
                  rippling by in the twilight! Close them, so that by no chance you can peer through
                  the many miles of dusky air lying between the Virginian city and your wedded home,
                  and see how foul a serpent is creeping into the paradise of your love, and how the
                  flowers do not even shrink away and fold themselves at the approach of his
                  poison!</p>
               <p>And you, ye overwatching intelligences who make record of every minute as well as
                  every day of our mortal lives!—be careful how you do your duty at this moment!
                  Analyze well that subtle substance called the heart of woman, before you set down
                  the record that can never be blotted away! There are very sad shames and wrongs in
                  the world, but there are benevolences. Woman's life is one long martyrdom to the
                  drain made upon her heart, even as man's becomes a torture and a suicide under the
                  demands made upon his brain. If there is shame and wrong, let it be so recorded;
                  but if a holier feeling moves and the heart is blind instead of erring, let the
                  record bear no more. For the same Divine Lips that added to the merciful dismissal
                  of the woman taken in adultery: "Sin no more!"—promised eternal blessings to the
                  giver of even a cup of cold water in the name of Faith and Goodness; and there may
                  be those who bear the benevolence even upon their <emph>lips,</emph> that they
                  believe shall save from wretchedness and despair, and who therein sin not but
                  blindly and erringly tread a path whose last footstep will yet be within the
                  courts of Heaven!</p>
               <p>"Without any exception the most successful little operation I have managed in a
                  long while," said Charles Holt to himself, as while Mary Haviland, her head all a
                  strange whirl which she by no means understood, was preparing sleepy little Pet
                  for her crib, he stepped again into the long-delayed carriage and was whirled down
                  the Avenue. "If she ever forgets that kiss, or ever again closes the door that I
                  have so snugly opened, until I am quite as willing to do it as herself—then my
                  name is not Charles Holt, or I am a milksop. Now I can afford to go to Europe, and
                  who knows how ripe some of the fruit may be against I return!"</p>
               <p>Probably some of the billiard players who were knocking away at the balls in the
                  back room of a saloon on the Third Avenue just above Thirty-fifth Street, and who
                  certainly could not be accused of being over-censorious in their morals—seeing
                  that Sunday was their grand gala day there,—would have shuddered a little and
                  missed some very easy caroms, had they known what was the real errand of the
                  well-dressed and eminently-respectable-looking man who a few minutes afterwards
                  stepped into the bar of that establishment, asked to look at the Directory, and
                  came back to the billiard-room to find it. Quite as probably the post-man whose
                  full name and direction were just then so diligently sought after, might have
                  indulged in a corresponding shudder, had he been aware of the temptation which was
                  a few minutes later to be offered him. But the billiard-players were ignorant, and
                  if the post-man had any scruples it is to be believed that he parted with them at
                  a stated price, as men have habitually done from the days of Judas downward.
                  Certain it is that Charles Holt succeeded in transacting his business to his
                  eminent satisfaction, though his purse became somewhat lightened thereby; and that
                  within a very short space of time thereafter he was set down by the carriage and
                  dismissed it (after paying nearly all the vehicle was worth) at the door of his
                  own house on Fifth Avenue.</p>
               <p>He passed into the house, as we have seen him do on a former occasion, with his
                  pass-key and without summoning a servant. His splendid drawing-rooms lay in the
                  same cold and empty magnificence that has before been indicated. A servant,
                  hearing his step in the hall, came up from the "lower regions," saw that it was
                  "the master," and dodged down again. He entered his own room, found the light
                  burning low, turned it up, lit a cigar, threw himself into the easy chair and
                  smoked a few minutes with his eyes closed. Then he threw away the half-smoked
                  cigar, turned his face to the ceiling as if listening, remained perfectly silent
                  for a moment, with a "Humph!" passed out again into the lighted hall, and ascended
                  the broad stairway. His tread was slow and loitering—the exact opposite of what it
                  had been when running up the steps of the house on East Forty-eighth Street—the
                  precise antipodes of the step of a lover hurrying to meet the dearest object in
                  the world. He trod slowly: had he known<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7282-00000153"/>
                  the future, he certainly would have trodden yet slower or he would never have
                  ascended that stair at all; for there was a drop of life-blood (whose—no matter)
                  oozing away at every step!</p>
               <p>At the head of the stair he turned to the left and followed the upper hall so many
                  feet as brought him to a door immediately over his own. It was closed, and he
                  tapped lightly upon it with his hand. No answer from within. Then he tapped
                  louder, and waited an instant. Still no answer.</p>
               <p>"Humph! I wonder if she can be out at this time in the evening, or only——" he did
                  not close the sentence, but opened the door and entered. What he saw when within,
                  must be set down at a little more length than the extent of his observation at
                  that moment.</p>
               <p>The room, immediately over his own, was of the same size, and fitted up with the
                  same luxury for female purposes that his showed for the uses of manhood. The
                  curtains were of heavy dark blue silken damask, and the walls of blue several
                  shades lighter; the two sofas and the chairs were of rosewood, covered with some
                  very rich dark blue worsted stuff with silken raised figures; the carpet was
                  Venetian, of a rich small pattern and warm colors; a massive pier-glass filled the
                  space between the windows, from floor to ceiling; a piano with legs of carved
                  rosewood showing beneath the heavy dark cloth, stood on one side of the room; two
                  or three feet from the pier-glass stood a table, the legs also of carved rosewood,
                  covered with a damask cloth, and on it a liqueur-case, with glasses, a basket with
                  cake and a salver half filled with hot-house grapes; near it stood a small table
                  with chess-men and a pack of cards in a counter case; and beyond it still another,
                  of larger size, had several costly articles of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >vertu</foreign> scattered over it. A splendidly appointed room, and yet a most
                  painful one to look in upon. For the carpet was stained and littered; the cover on
                  the piano was awry; one of the sofas was slewed out of its place and the tables
                  arranged without any regard to propriety; one of the glasses on the large table
                  was tumbled over, a bottle out of the liqueur-case, and a piece of cake lying over
                  the side of the basket; and looking through a door leading but of the apartment
                  ment into a smaller one adjoining it, a tumbled bed could be seen, evidently
                  lounged upon and then remaining unmade. Splendor in neglect and ruin—so unlike
                  what could be seen in any other portion of the house that it has been our duty to
                  traverse.</p>
               <p>And yet this was not all—no, nor the one-millionth detail of the painful sight
                  which revealed itself under the lighted chandelier to the eye of the merchant, and
                  which must have filled any other observer with disgust and horror. For at the foot
                  of the sofa standing opposite the door, as if she had tumbled from it in restless
                  sleep, lay Olympia Holt—her unbound hair streaming backwards on the floor; her
                  dress wofully disarranged, so that the contour of the splendidly rounded limb was
                  too plainly revealed; her dress of rich dark silk unloosed at the throat and bust;
                  and her breathing that short stertorous snort which tells the condition of a
                  sleeper better than almost any other test that can be applied. A most painful—a
                  most disgusting sight! If the room showed splendor neglected and in ruins, what
                  was this?—a beautiful woman prone and insensible on the floor—humanity also in
                  ruins, and that humanity of the same sex which supplied our mothers, our sisters,
                  our wives and sweet-hearts!</p>
               <p>"Drunk and insensible on the floor; by all that is unendurable!" was the
                  exclamation of the spectator. "What is the next degradation? That was the reason
                  every thing was so still. Here! hallo! wake up!" and he advanced across the room,
                  stooped down and shook the sleeping woman. Apparently he might as well have
                  attempted to wake one of the mummied Ptolemies whom the antiquarians will not
                  leave alone in their crypts. A second shake, and he desisted from the attempt. As
                  he ceased, the eyes of the sleeping woman opened, though how much they saw was
                  doubtful. The disgusted husband did not see that they opened at all, for when he
                  looked down they were apparently close shut, and there certainly had been no
                  change in the breathing. Disgusted—did we say?—that word faintly expresses the
                  sensations of the husband, fresh (however unholily) from the presence of beauty
                  and purity, and outraged<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7282-00000154"/> by this
                  spectacle of degradation to a degree beyond words and almost beyond thought. How
                  much of this had he before endured, whether the fault which originated it was his
                  own or that of some other? What writhings might the proud man, splendid even in
                  his vices, have suffered during long years of this debasement? It seemed as if he
                     <emph>must</emph> have endured much, for his lip set heavily and his brow
                  lowered threateningly. "Sot! disgrace!" at length broke from lips that seemed to
                  speak without opening; and at the same moment, moved by an impulse for which he
                  could not probably himself have accounted, and under the culmination of a feeling
                  of shame and anger which had been accumulating for years, with whatever of justice
                  or injustice,—this man, who had never before in all his life broken the great
                  first law of chivalry by laying violent hand upon a woman, with a muttered curse
                  drew back his booted foot and twice so violently kicked the sleeper that he even
                  moved the body upon the floor! There was no sign of sensibility, that he saw,
                  though the eyes opened again as he turned away, then closed again as suddenly.</p>
               <p>The merchant stepped to the bell, rang it violently and waited a moment. A female
                  servant came rapidly up the stairs, tapped, stepped within the room, and waited
                  for his orders.</p>
               <p>"Get one of the other girls, undress that woman and put her to bed," he ordered.
                  "When she gets so that she can understand you, if she ever does, tell her that I
                  am going to England to-morrow, and that I stepped to her room to tell her as much,
                  but found her so <emph>sick</emph> that she could not listen to me. That is
                  all—go!"</p>
               <p>The servant disappeared down the stairs in search of the required assistance. The
                  merchant, with one look at the mass of lost womanhood on the floor, went out,
                  closed the door and descended to his own room, which he did not afterwards leave
                  until his carriage was called at nearly eleven. But the door of Olympia Holt's
                  room had only closed behind him, when the degraded woman opened her eyes once
                  more, struggled to a sitting position, shook her trembling fist after him with an
                  expression on the face that if drunken was yet demoniac, and muttered thickly
                  through her clenched teeth:</p>
               <p>"Wretch! devil! It has come at last! Be careful, <emph>now,</emph> if I ever get a
                  chance at you!"</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE peculiar feeling which oppressd Kate Haviland, with reference to the wife of
                  her cousin, after the episode of the ambrotype, and after that visit to
                  Forty-eighth Street which revealed to her the (supposed) fact that her
                  cousin-by-marriage was in the habit of going to theatres with a comparative
                  stranger during the absence of her husband,—cannot very well be described and
                  could not easily be analyzed even by the young girl herself. Herself pure as the
                  modest little violet that she had been in the habit of plucking under the hedges
                  and by the borders of the woods in the early spring-time—she knew and thought of
                  vice only as a name; but she had caught the name and heard of the reality,
                  nevertheless. She had heard in her quiet country home, that the great city was one
                  correspondingly great haunt of vice and crime, where sin was the rule and virtue
                  the exception; and she had necessarily contracted something of that indefinable
                  horror which many of the good people of the country indulge towards the city, who
                  believe in the exploded nonsense about green fields making mankind more honest and
                  upright than stone pavements,—and who do not know that the country "party," its<pb
                     n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7282-00000155"/> "night-meetings" and its long and
                  lonely walks in a wooded solitude unattainable within the "fire limits," exert the
                  same doubtful influences that are brought into play and allowed scope by the ball,
                  the theatre, and places more openly dedicated to the service of vice, in the city
                  so set under ban. Those good people who cannot be brought to believe that
                  temptation can assume the same dangerous and insidious forms, under the green
                  trees and in the rustic paradises of the country, and do the same effectual work
                  of desolating the heart and the life, as on pavements and under tiled roofs that
                  cover three or four stories;—who do not suspect that the same moral ruin can be
                  wrought among budding boys and incipient young men playing division-loo or
                  draw-poker all the Sunday long in the upper story of the country wheel-wright shop
                  or the hay-mow of the farmer, that could be entailed upon them by the
                  plate-glassed and gilded gambling-halls of the metropolis;—who do not know that
                  Old Bill, buying his bad liquor by the keg, and keeping himself in a continual
                  muddle with potations of it as he sits at home—or Young Bill, dashing about with
                  his fast team and stopping to drink half a dozen times at each of the country
                  taverns he passes,—is going quite as prosperously down the road of drunkenness as
                  any old man or young man of the city, who procures his means of intoxication at
                  the most splendid or the most degraded of the places of universal supply; who do
                  not realize that frivolity goes to church under the little white spire in the
                  village, just as frivolity displays itself in the pews of Brown—that misers crawl
                  and schemers plot, universally—that the good and the evil exist everywhere, so
                  mixed and blended that no mortal eye can discern their boundaries—that thefts,
                  slanders, marital falsehoods, debaucheries, unhappy and criminal marriages,
                  murders, and all the long array of crimes, spring up on every square rood of God's
                  footstool, as rank fungi in dank and rotting swamps,—and that there is no
                  exclusive patent for goodness or even for wickedness, existing in any particular
                  spot of the earth's surface because it happens to be capped with a flag-stone or
                  tufted with a few blades of grass.</p>
               <p>Sharp, bright, intelligent Kate Haviland had imbibed something of this prejudice
                  of the country against the city, long before, and only living in it for a few
                  weeks had not yet been able to make the proper mental equation. She had but two
                  points of view of society in the city—the Fullerton house, and that of her cousin.
                  The first was not by any means such a place as would be likely to disabuse a young
                  mind of unfavorable impressions; and what had she seen of the state of affairs at
                  the second? Much as she had loved and respected Mary, and much as she was disposed
                  yet to love and respect her, the omens might have been puzzling if not
                  unfavorable, to more hackneyed minds than that of the teacher; it seemed to her
                  that any thing and anybody, however pure, might be corrupted in such a Babel; and
                  the fact is that she quitted Forty-eighth Street, on the day of the visit there
                  before recorded, with her head in a whirl, her heart ill at ease, and a sort of
                  dim and indefinite impression creeping over her that all her country education had
                  been only a tithe of the truth, and that New York must be a second Sodom, worse
                  than the original and somehow forgotten in the punitory distributions of aerial
                  brimstone in a state of combustion.</p>
               <p>As a result of these things, the foot of the young girl did not cross the
                  threshold of her cousin's house for weeks, confident as she would have been, under
                  other circumstances, of Mary's loneliness, and much as she might have been
                  anxious, under those circumstances, to relieve that loneliness and comfort her in
                  her husband's absence. She believed that Mary Haviland, without guilt but in great
                  weakness, was "consoling" herself; and that belief at once removed the wish and
                  the duty. Then the young girl had really plenty to do in the Fullerton residence,
                  what with the arrogances of Mrs. Fullerton (never quite so decided, however, since
                  her signal discomfiture in the great "overhauling"); the impertinences of Miss
                  Dora; the difficulty of keeping Myra and Mildred from the most serious infractions
                  of all those rules supposed to be set down for the government of children not
                  intended for subsequent savage life; and another little occupation, in the
                  frequent presence of Mr. Ned Minthorne in the school-room, of which something more
                  will be seen at a very early period. All these causes, combined, kept her absent
                     from<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7282-00000156"/> the house until the beginning
                  of June, and consequently ignorant of any thing that had occurred there since her
                  previous visit.</p>
               <p>But one pleasant June morning, past the middle of that month, when Mrs. Fullerton
                  had declared her intention of taking both Myra and Mildred down-town and having
                  one more portrait taken of each of the dear children—so that they would have no
                  studies demanding her attention until the afternoon,—bonny Kate felt all her
                  good-nature predominant and her desire to see how Mary was "getting along"
                  altogether too strong to be resisted. She smoothed down her chestnut hair a
                  little, swung herself twice round before the glass in her room to see that her
                  dress of pretty brown-and-white French gingham had the proper fall and sweep for
                  the street, crowned her rattle-head with a coquettish little jockey hat (just then
                  coming into use), and sallied forth for a walk and a voyage of discovery.</p>
               <p>Her cheeks glowing with the exercise of her walk of a mile and a half, and her
                  blood tingling pleasantly with the soft June air and the sun that she felt were
                  both playing among the opening roses around her old home in the country, the young
                  girl reached the little house on Forty-eighth Street, rang, and was admitted by
                  Mary Haviland herself. The first glance that Kate caught of the face of the wife,
                  told her that some marked change had come upon her. She looked troubled, care-worn
                  and anxious, and it did not need much imagination to believe that there had
                  recently been tears in her eyes. This would have been quite enough to disarm any
                  ungenerous suspicion of her young cousin, and to put the two good, whole-hearted
                  and loveable little souls once more <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en rapport</foreign>
                  with each other, as they had always before been and as they never should have
                  ceased to be,—but that two hindrances intervened. <emph>First:</emph> Kate noticed
                  that when Mary took her seat near the window of the front room and resumed her
                  sewing that had been temporarily interrupted, her eyes were most of the time
                  downcast in a manner quite unusual for her; and that the rest of the time they
                  were glancing about, and especially towards the window, in a troubled and restless
                  way that seemed furtive and anxious to escape observation. This was not the Mary
                  of old—Kate said to herself; and as she had many a time read that the eye of guilt
                  was downcast and furtive, there seemed something in her conduct to corroborate the
                  most painful suspicions. Besides—and here a new light broke upon the very keen
                  young person, quite as reliable as many of the lights which guide the feet of
                  elder people until they lose their way and tumble over. She had no knowledge, of
                  course, that Charles Holt had gone to Europe: and the thought crept into her busy
                  brain—what if his visits had become so frequent that Mary had no idea at what time
                  of day another might occur, and if her furtive glances towards the window and the
                  constant down-casting of her eyes should be in anxiety to see him and fear of an
                  awkward arrival while she [Kate] was in the house! If she thought such really
                     <emph>was</emph> the case, how quickly she would get out of that house and
                  never set foot in it again while Burnett Haviland was absent and such visits were
                  permitted—never.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Second:</emph> Mary Haviland herself had a word to say about any continued
                  cordiality between Kate and herself. She had depended much upon Kate's running
                  over often to see her, and making company in her loneliness. Since her husband's
                  departure, she had only called three or four times, and within the past three
                  weeks, not at all. She probably—Mary thought—had found gayer company down at the
                  rich house on Twenty-third Street, and did not care to spend any of her valuable
                  time upon a poor "grass-widow." If so, let her stay away—that was all! And as a
                  consequence, though Mary received her visitor kindly enough, that day, she did so
                  without any pretence at cordiality; and so barrier number two between the little
                  women was firmly established.</p>
               <p>Kate did not ask after Burtnett and when his wife had heard from him. She really
                  did not dare do so, after her observations of the wife's face and manner, for fear
                  of increasing her agitation and producing an effect by no means desirable. Mary
                  wondered why she did not inquire, was ready to pour out her whole heart-full of
                  trouble if she only would do so, and thought her more heartless than ever from the
                  omission. So that bond which might and should have drawn them together<pb
                     n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7282-00000157"/> gether held them apart—not to be joined
                  again for—alas!—how long!</p>
               <p>Does the picture seem exaggerated? Do not kind, good, whole-hearted people, who
                  have the dearest reasons in the world for clinging together more closely than one
                  fibre of oak to another, grow separated in this manner, from vague suspicions and
                  slight misunderstandings that should not he allowed to influence them for one
                  moment, and sometimes never unite again while the life of both endures? We fear,
                  too sadly, that they do, and that in the great day of final account, not open
                  quarrels resulting from radical differences, but nameless nothings springing from
                  one word too much, one glance too many, or the lack of one or the other, will be
                  found to have desolated more human hearts than all the battle-fields of history
                  have sacrificed of human bodies!</p>
               <p>The veriest commonplaces, that might have been indulged by two strangers
                  accidentally meeting, instead of two persons connected by the closest ties of
                  blood and old acquaintance, were the result of all this. Little Pet ran in from
                  the other room, eventually, lugging a doll a little larger than herself; and in
                  Kate's involuntary catching her up and hugging her out of all discretion, there
                  was for one moment a chance that the feelings of both might melt and confidence be
                  re-established. But no!—Her High Mightiness was not in the best of humors, and she
                  had some suspicion that the raiment of her darling (which said darling had lost
                  one leg and was in a serious state of dilapidation) might be creased by the
                  too-close pressure, and consequently she was put down in a moment, after uttering
                  this solemn and impressive adjuration and statement:</p>
               <p>"Put Pet down, Katy! 'Oo muss up Dolly! Pet don't like 'oo!"</p>
               <p>Within ten minutes Kate Haviland discovered that her time was nearly exhausted,
                  or, in other words, that she had never before found the atmosphere of the house so
                  uncongenial and did not care to stay in it another moment. However, there was one
                  point upon which she intended to satisfy herself before leaving—that of the
                  ambrotype. Though she had not since heard any thing of it as in the possession of
                  Mr. Holt or the Fullertons, yet that such a picture of Mary had been in their
                  hands was beyond doubt: would the wife, if the subject should be introduced,
                  honestly state how it came to be out of her own custody? If so, there might not be
                  any serious misconduct, after all; while falsehood or prevarication would stamp
                  the intention as an improper one beyond peradventure. There was nothing, for this
                  end, but to repeat, with variations, the same manœuvre that had been practised
                  upon Sarah; and this the young girl immediately put in practice. Shaking off her
                  depression, so far as was possible, humming a snatch, meanwhile, from the popular
                  opera, "I Handorgani," she rose from her chair and stepped to the mantel,
                  apparently having discovered some new beauty in the photograph of Pet which hung
                  over it. After standing there a moment and fumbling a little among the pictures
                  and other incumbrances of that usually overloaded receptacle, she said, in the
                  most natural of tones and as if there was not a thought of purpose in the
                  inquiry:</p>
               <p>"Seems to me, Mary, that some of your pictures are gone off the mantel. What has
                  become of them all? There was a very pretty little ambrotype of yourself, that I
                  was admiring when I came up to the city and meant to ask you to give me some day.
                  I don't see it now."</p>
               <p>"I do not know what you can possibly mean," answered the young wife, with that
                  candor born of truth. "I dusted off the mantel not an hour ago, and every picture
                  was there that has been there for the last six months, I am sure."</p>
               <p>Kate turned and looked at her as she said this. Not one indication in her face
                  that she was telling a falsehood (as she was not—the reader well knows). But Kate
                  knew (or thought that she knew—which was quite the same thing!) that this must be
                  a falsehood; and she said to herself that the woman who could conceal or pervert
                  the truth in this manner, without one sign of blenching on the countenance, must
                  be a miserable little deceiver, altogether unworthy of credit in any particular.
                  Whereupon, without any further experiments as to her cousin's truth, she turned
                  away from the mantel, curtly said that "her time was up, and she must go back to
                  her school-room," bade Mary good-morning and<pb n="328-329"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000158"/> ran down the stairs to the street-door, leaving the
                  house with a determination that she would not come into it again in one while—that
                  she wouldn't!</p>
               <p>Poor Mary Haviland sighed, after Kate had left the room. During all the brief
                  visit she had felt that some marked change must certainly have taken place in the
                  young girl—that her words were curt and her manner dictatorial—and that the last
                  chance of Kate's affording to herself any companionship during the absence of her
                  husband, was quite as effectually gone as if she had been dead. If such was to be
                  the atmosphere thrown out by one of her visits, she had no objection whatever to
                  her remaining absent all the while; for there <emph>is</emph> one thing worse than
                  utter loneliness—uncongenial company; and at the moment when Alexander Selkirk
                  fancied himself arrived at the summit of human unhappiness in his little
                  retirement on the isle of Juan Fernandez, there is no doubt whatever that he might
                  have been made much more miserable than any loneliness could make him, by the
                  presence of one ignorant, peeping, chattering human magpie of his own sex, or one
                  woman who had the happy faculty of always misunderstanding and crossing him—always
                  wanting to stay at home and scrub the poles of his hut when he particularly wished
                  her to go fishing with him—always going to sleep in the midst of the most
                  thrilling passage of the story he was telling her—and always managing to be asleep
                  and snoring when he came to bed.</p>
               <p>Kate Haviland had decided that Mary's beaten eyes, furtive glances and general
                  depression indicated "something wrong." So they did, too truly; but how far were
                  they from indicating, in truth, what she suspected! The young wife was
                  unhappy—wretched—miserable!—how truly miserable, only those can conjecture who
                  have had the whole fabric of their happiness seem to crumble away as suddenly and
                  as thoroughly. Yesterday the mistress of a happy home, with a husband fondly
                  loving and as fondly beloved, at her side: to-day a lonely wife, widowed perhaps
                  by something worse than death!</p>
               <p>Not one single letter for a whole long month. Not one. Writing often herself, but
                  receiving no answer—none. There could be no mistake in the matter, for had she not
                  interrogated the postman at the door, after waiting in vain for weeks, and
                  received his assurance that every letter for that distribution passed into his
                  hands, and that none had come, bearing her name? This indicated sickness and
                  perhaps death. No—for in the one case some comrade would certainly advise the
                  wife, at his request, of the situation of the husband; and in the other the
                  officers of the regiment would consider it their duty to convey the intelligence
                  of their bereavement to the afflicted family. No—sickness or death could not be
                  the cause; something worse must certainly have supervened. And what
                     <emph>could</emph> be that "something worse"?</p>
               <p>One channel of information was beyond the meddling of Charles Holt and his
                  postman, and accessible to Mary Haviland as well as to others. That channel was
                  the daily newspaper, with its correspondents everywhere and all the while peeping
                  and grasping for the least item of information concerning the men and the
                  movements of any of the local regiments. From the newspaper she learned that the
                  company of the Fire Zouaves to which her husband belonged, had been for some time
                  detached from the body of the regiment and employed in guarding the government
                  warehouses in Alexandria. That company, then, was within easy reach of Washington
                  and the mails, and the failure could not be on account of any difficulty in
                  communication. That knowledge made the mystery greater and the heart of the young
                  wife more hopelessly sad as she endeavored to fathom it.</p>
               <p>Then, only the day before Kate's visit, she had what appeared to be a peep behind
                  the curtain. And such a peep!—if a true one, she prayed heaven that she might be
                  spared any closer and more definite. That evening one of her few "pleasant
                  neighbors" "happened in," to chat a few moments and to "give her a little company
                  when she knew she must be so lonesome," as the visitor kindly expressed it. It did
                  not become evident to the wife, but it would have done so to a close observer,
                  that the visit was paid especially to unburthen the mind of the visitor of certain
                  news that was trouble-some in the keeping and needed help to hold it properly. Not
                  five minutes of conversation had elapsed when the<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000159"/> "pleasant neighbor" took occasion to remark that
                  one of her relatives had just been down at Washington and Alexandria, and that,
                  among other persons, he had seen Burtnett Haviland.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Did</emph> he see him?" asked the young wife, glad at last to hear
                  something definite from him—that he was alive and with his regiment,—and ready to
                  pour out her whole heart to the kind friend who had been so good as to bring her
                  news of her husband.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he saw him," said the visitor, "and no doubt you are glad to hear from him,
                  though I suppose he writes very often."</p>
               <p>The young wife was just about to give her the startling information that for weeks
                  past he seemed not to have written at all, and the statement might have provoked
                  comment and inquiry not favorable to the success of the plotters: but the tongue
                  of the "pleasant neighbor" was too rapid for her, and before she could undeceive
                  her on that point, the informant went on:</p>
               <p>"But oh, my dear, I don't believe your letters tell you the half of what is going
                  on down there. The soldiers do not appear to have gone down to fight, but just for
                  a spree. You must not feel hurt about it, my dear, but John says that the company
                  at Alexandria is doing nothing but drink—drink—drink, gamble, and—some other
                  things that I think I had better not mention to you."</p>
               <p>The heart of the wife beat quick for an instant, then sunk low and almost died
                  within her. But she forced herself to be calm and indeed to smile some kind of a
                  sickly libel upon merriment, as she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Burtnett tells me that they are enjoying themselves; but are they so
                     <emph>very</emph> wild?"</p>
               <p>"Very wild? Enjoying themselves? I should think so, my dear!" said the "pleasant
                  neighbor." "Oh, you don't half know what goings on they have, nearly all the time;
                  and I fancy your husband would not be very likely to write in any of his letters
                  what I hear about <emph>him.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"About <emph>him?</emph>" gasped the wife.</p>
               <p>"Yes, about <emph>him!</emph>" echoed the informant. "I don't know that I ought to
                  have said any thing about it. I did not mean to say a word, but I have let my
                  foolish tongue run away with me, and gone so far, now, that I suppose I must tell
                  you the whole of it. Don't be <emph>too</emph> much hurt, my dear."</p>
               <p>"I? oh, I shall not be hurt at all!" answered the young wife, forcing such a
                  discordant laugh as some sufferer on the rack might utter to prove that mind was
                  still superior to matter.</p>
               <p>"Soldiers are a horrid set, always—no offence to your husband, my dear," pursued
                  the visitor. "I suppose they are all alike when they get away from our sight, so
                  there is no use in thinking too much about them. Well, it seems that the whole
                  town is full of women of the very worst character—worse than any of the dreadful
                  wretches on Broadway, and you know how bad <emph>they</emph> are!"</p>
               <p>"I have heard," said the wife, in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the visitor, "the town is full of just such dreadful women, and a
                  good many of the soldiers forget that they have any wives at home."</p>
               <p>"I do not believe that of my husband!" said the wife, with a good deal of her old
                  energy and a little asperity.</p>
               <p>"I dare say not," replied the visitor. "That is right—always believe the best you
                  can of these men; and bad enough is the best, dear knows! Well, the other night,
                  while John was asleep in the quarters of one of the officers, there was an alarm
                  and a musket fired, and the sentinels rushed towards an old building not far from
                  the dock, that was used as a sort of temporary prison. The evening before they had
                  been obliged to put two or three of the worst of these women up in one of the
                  chambers of the upper story, to prevent mischief, my dear; and a little after
                  midnight the sentry in the yard had been nearly killed by a man dropping upon him
                  from the window of the room where the women were shut up. He had fired his musket
                  as he fell, and that had caused the alarm. When the other sentries came, they
                  found that the man who had fallen from the window was one of the Zouaves. He was
                  drunk, and his leg was so badly injured that he could not get away. They took him
                  up and put him in the guard-house. I need not tell you, my dear, what his name was
                     or<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7282-00000160"/> what his character must have
                  been, to be up among those women, at that time of night, and then dropping out of
                  the window!"</p>
               <p>"And you mean to say that soldier was—" gasped the wife; and there her voice
                  failed.</p>
               <p>"I mean to say that soldier was your husband, if you <emph>will</emph> have it
                  all!" said the informant, with the demeanor of a person who had been compelled to
                  do a very distasteful duty.</p>
               <p>"And I mean to say that it is a falsehood—a base, cruel falsehood!" uttered the
                  young wife. "I don't believe one word of it!"</p>
               <p>"Just as you please, my dear," said the "pleasant neighbor," putting on an air of
                  offended dignity. "That is always what people get for telling the truth! The next
                  time you want to hear from your husband, somebody else may tell you!"</p>
               <p>"I hope to heaven somebody else will have sense enough to keep such news to
                  themselves!" said the wife.</p>
               <p>"Hoity toity!" commented the visitor; and she went away in high dudgeon, to be a
                  bitter enemy of Mary Haviland ever after. And it may as well be said that she went
                  away to be hated by Mary Haviland quite as cordially.</p>
               <p>But she left an impression behind her that could no more be shaken off, however
                  the young wife might make the effort, than the earth can obliterate the chasm made
                  in its bosom by the earthquake, or the tree the scar ploughed down its side by the
                  lightning. "I do not believe one word of it!" had been the reply to the "pleasant
                  neighbor." But "I <emph>do</emph> believe too much of it!" was her communion with
                  her own heart. She had always heard terrible stories of the crimes and vices of
                  soldiers, though she had thought nothing of them when her husband went away, and
                  had not even conceived the possibility of his falling off from his goodness and
                  his love for her, into any of them. What else than this could really be the
                  explanation of his long silence? Had he not indeed been over-tempted, fallen into
                  evil courses from bad companionship, and then been ashamed even to write to her
                  with the same hand stained with the coarse vices of the libertine? He might not be
                  utterly lost to her—he might come back to her, some day, if the chances of war
                  should spare him, and be nearly the same. But he could never be more than
                  "nearly;" for when once a serious flaw begins to exhibit itself in our idol,
                  though we may love it still, we can never worship it more.</p>
               <p>It was a sleepless night for Mary Haviland, that followed this revelation; and in
                  the silence of the dark hours, hugging up to her bosom the child that had no
                  longer slept in its little crib since its father's departure, she rained tears on
                  its unconscious face, and kissed it, and thought whether some day in the near
                  future, that would not be all that she could claim as a reminder of the by-gone
                  happy days! And it was on the morning after that night, of all the mornings of her
                  whole life, that Kate Haviland visited her and marked her heavy eyes and her
                  furtive glances at the window. If the young girl could only have known the fact,
                  those glances at the window were the truest tests of her agonized love for her
                  husband; for she was listening—listening—listening yet, for the ringing of the
                  bell by the post-man, who might bring her a letter to disprove all her suspicions
                  and quiet all her fears; looking—looking—looking yet, to see him coming up the
                  street and bringing some word of comfort for her lonely heart.</p>
               <p>Suppose that at this stage of the narrative, keeping in mind the story of the
                  "three black crows" ejected from his stomach by the unfortunate subject,—we "boil
                  down" the story of the Zouave dropping from the window, and ascertain what truth
                  there really was in the report. The task is a very brief one. During the visit of
                  the "pleasant neighbor's" relative to Alexandria, such a circumstance had really
                  occurred. There were a considerable number of women of loose character in the
                  town, a part of them brought down by a Maine regiment that should have been
                  Puritanic enough to know better. Some of them had been abandoned there or left the
                  command of their own will when the regiment marched away. On the night in question
                  two or three of the uproarious females were really committed to that upper room in
                  the old house, and locked up as well as put under guard. During the night one of
                  the Zouaves managed to elude the sentinel and climb in at the window, cat-like,
                  just as he had often before done when intent on saving life or property at a
                     fire.<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7282-00000161"/> After a time he came out
                  again, by the same substitute for a door, but was careless as well as a little
                  tipsy, missed his footing and tumbled down into the yard below. The sentry fired
                  as before stated, the other guards came up, and the blending of Leander and Sam
                  Patch was taken away and put under lock. So far the story had really been told to
                  the "pleasant neighbor" by her returned relative. But what had all this to do with
                  Burtnett Haviland, and how did <emph>his</emph> name happen to be involved? Simply
                  thus. One of the sentries who came up and arrested the midnight prowler, was the
                  husband of Mary Haviland, and the narrator mentioned the circumstance of his being
                  an acquaintance of both. Whether the "pleasant neighbor" really managed to get the
                  names confused into the wrong relation, or whether she understood the fact all the
                  while and merely thought that the story would sound better by making that slight
                  inversion, is a question not easy to decide. She told it as before described, with
                  the result indicated; and whether she blundered or plunged wilfully into the lie,
                  is something which she, not we, may have occasion to settle hereafter.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the poison will not be found without its antidote, if the first ten
                  readers will take the lesson of this incident and be somewhat more careful of the
                  exactness of the next relation made by each, that can in any way affect the
                  character of others.</p>
               <p>If Kate Haviland left the little house on Forty-eighth Street, that day, with her
                  opinion of her cousin's Wife sadly deteriorated, she was destined not to reach her
                  own home before the depreciation should be much more signal and unqualified. It so
                  happened that at the moment when she quitted the house, Sarah Sanderson, having
                  disposed of the breakfast-dishes and put the kitchen into the requisite order, was
                  about sallying out, basket on arm, to make some family purchases at the grocery at
                  the corner. She came down the stoop very close behind the young teacher, and
                  quickening her steps a little, came up to her before she had half measured the
                  distance between the house and the Third Avenue. The two girls, as will be
                  remembered, had been born very nearly together, and though not moving in precisely
                  the same rank in society, were necessarily well acquainted. As they joined company
                  that morning, a few words of conversation were inevitable. These were
                  commonplaces, until Kate, full of the thought of her cousin, felt constrained to
                  say:</p>
               <p>"Sarah, Mrs. Haviland says that there has no picture gone off the mantel since I
                  came to the city."</p>
               <p>Sarah, who well remembered the previous conversation, felt it necessary to back up
                  what she had said on that occasion, and threw up her own unoccupied hand in holy
                  horror, as she exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh!—what—a—story!"</p>
               <p>"I thought so!" said Kate, sententiously. "But you need not tell Mrs. Haviland
                  that I asked any thing about it. I suppose she knows her own business."</p>
               <p>Something in the young girl's tone told the servant that she was displeased with
                  Mary Haviland; and that restless devil of hate to the wife of the man she loved,
                  lately called into renewed life by the wrongs she was inflicting upon that wife,
                  suggested that this must be the proper period to speak a truth to her
                  prejudice.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Haviland <emph>ought</emph> to know her own business," said the
                  flaxen-haired little wretch. "But if you had seen all that <emph>I</emph> have,
                  Miss Kate, maybe you would not think she did!"</p>
               <p>Now if there was any thing in the world that Kate Haviland hated and despised, it
                  was prying into family business through servants; and at almost any other time,
                  had she been so addressed by Sarah, she would have closed the conversation by the
                  curt: "Mind your own concerns, and don't meddle with those of your mistress!" but
                  just then she was puzzled and worried. Eve has left in all the descendants of her
                  own sex (as well as a few of the other) proof that she ate the apple not because
                  she coveted or needed it, but from curiosity to know how such a thing as a golden
                  pippin might taste; and the desire to gain at least some clue to the matter that
                  was evidently wrong in her cousin's family, made the present temptation too strong
                  for the teacher. She did not rebuff the tenderer of illicit information, but
                  rather encouraged as well as piqued her with:</p>
               <p>"Ah? and what have <emph>you</emph> seen, I should like to know?"</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7282-00000162"/>
               <p>"I seen" (the writer is not responsible for Miss Sarah Sanderson's grammar, any
                  more than for the peculiar lingual gymnastics of some of the other characters
                  embodied in this story)—"I seen Mr. Holt, the merchant, that brings her the money,
                  have Mrs. Haviland in his arms the other night, hug-gin' and kissin' her."</p>
               <p>"Sarah Sanderson, you are telling me a lie!" said the young girl, turning suddenly
                  upon her.</p>
               <p>For one instant the eyes of the servant blazed with rage, then they softened, and
                  she said, looking the teacher steadily in the face:</p>
               <p>"I hope I may die this minute, if he didn't, and if I didn't see it with my own
                  eyes!"</p>
               <p>"You dare swear to that?" asked Kate Haviland, shocked and yet half convinced.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> swear to it, now!" said the girl, "and may I never live to see
                  to-morrow if it is not the truth!" The reader knows that she <emph>was</emph>
                  telling the truth, or at least something very nearly approaching to it; though
                  there has not before been occasion to reveal the fact that Sarah Sanderson, on the
                  night before the merchant's departure for Europe, was keeping a close watch
                  through the door between the two rooms, and that the merchant was not sufficiently
                  prudent in the location of his demonstrations to prevent her seeing the most
                  important event that occurred.</p>
               <p>This blow, coming so close upon the others, somewhat staggered the teacher, and
                  made her almost as blind in the eyes and dizzy in the head as she had been a few
                  weeks before when confronted by her own shame and Ned Minthorne. It would have
                  needed but little more to make her totter in the street—twenty years older, and
                  under the same pressure of feeling, she would have done so.</p>
               <p>Lost! lost! oh, poor Burtey!" was her mental comment. But her lips syllabled
                  something different, and that was:</p>
               <p>"Sarah Sanderson, if you are telling me the truth, you have been doing right in
                  telling it to <emph>me,</emph> because I am a relative; but if you ever say as
                  much to any one else, even to Mr. Haviland when he comes back, without my
                  permission, yon will be doing very wrong and no one can tell what injury you may
                  cause. If you have been telling a falsehood, with that oath—well, you will get
                  roasted some time, that is all!"</p>
               <p>"Humph! I don't care if you <emph>never</emph> believe me!" was the model
                  servant-girl's reply, as having reached her destination, at the corner grocery,
                  she flung away into it with her basket, not over-well satisfied with herself,
                  while bonnie Kate, to escape the hot sunshine of the June meridian, took one of
                  the cars just passing, and was jolted, jerked and pounded along down the Avenue to
                  Twenty-third street.</p>
               <p>Sarah Sanderson would have been somewhat better satisfied than she really was when
                  she stepped into the grocery at the corner, could she have known the impression
                  really made by her words. The information tallied, though shamefully, with all the
                  circumstances that had preceded it, and Kate Haviland believed so much of the
                  story that she would almost have given her right hand for the privilege of
                  discrediting it. Her actual concern at the apparent heartlessness of Mary and her
                  shame at belonging to the same sex that could deceive under such a guise of angels
                  of light, found an odd blending with the reserved merriment of her own character,
                  just as she stepped from the car at Twenty-third street and tripped along towards
                  what she sometimes mentally designated as the Fullerton "menagerie," with herself
                  the Amazon Queen and trainer of the animals, in the characteristic remark, not
                  more than half muttered:</p>
               <p>"I wish to gracious I was not a woman! I shall trick somebody one of these days, I
                  know I shall! No—I don't wish any thing of the kind, though; for if I was a man I
                  should never know what to do with my big hands, and a pretty figure I should cut
                  with a crop of sedge-grass growing on my chin—ough!"</p>

                     HAVILAND MAKING ANOTHER DISCOVERY AND EXECUTING A WAR-DANCE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MISS KATY had thrown off the worst of her depression, and concluded to live and be
                  as happy as possible, in spite of all the wickedness that she supposed to exist in
                  the world,—at about the time she reached the house so flatteringly designated in
                  the previous chapter, tripped up to her chamber and disrobed herself of her
                  walking attire, preparatory to entering the "cage" with her "animals."</p>
               <p>When she did so, or in other words descended to the school-room in which she by
                  that time expected to find her pupils, she found only <emph>one</emph> bearing
                  that relation, and that one was altogether of an odd sex and style to come under
                  the tuition of a young lady, though a good many inconsiderate persons, holding the
                  same relative position, have first or last put themselves under the same perilous
                  influence. In short, Kate Haviland's single pupil was of the male sex, approaching
                  six feet high, and looking old enough to have mastered nearly all the rudiments of
                  ordinary education.</p>
               <p>He sat at her desk, or perhaps it may be more correctly stated that he sat
                     <emph>on</emph> it, as though a portion of his person rested on the arm chair
                  in which the dainty figure of the young girl generally reposed when she was
                  throned in her full authority, he leaned back so far that at least half his
                  length, including all his legs, was sprawled upon the desk, his patent-leathers
                  just cosily perched between the ink-stand and the pot of mucilage, and his
                  stupendous width of trowsers (then an innovation, now an almost exploded
                  antiquity) literally covering the whole of the green cloth of which the top of the
                  article of school-furniture was composed. The trowsers aforesaid, as well as the
                  coat that surmounted them and the vest which formed an isthmus between the two
                  continents of clothing, was of a very light creamy gray, the nearest possible
                  approach to white without being it; the hat which surmounted his head was of the
                  same color, round and low in the crown and narrow in the brim, reminding the
                  observer something of an inverted soup-plate applied to improper uses (such hats
                  have since that time become common, but never "proper," although dignified by the
                  name of "tourist"); the neck-tie which confined his garotte was of the richest and
                  bloomiest cherry-color, and the kid-gloves covering his well-shaped hands were the
                  nearest approach that could be found at Stewart's, to the same tropical hue. A
                  switch malacca cane, with the counterfeit presentment of a woman's bent leg as the
                  head, lay across his lap; and all this, and the book which the student seemed to
                  be attentively perusing, was to be seen through a halo of tobacco-smoke emanating
                  from a cigar of the Emperor brand, not less than eight inches in length and good
                  for a cost of two hundred and fifty dollars the thousand, which reposed in a state
                  of blissful conflagration between his lips.</p>
               <p>This was Kate's pupil, by name Ned Minthorne; and she must have lost something of
                  the awe with which he had inspired her on that eventful morning of their first
                  meeting, for her first act on taking in the whole aspect of the man and his
                  surroundings, was to forget all that had oppressed her during the morning, to
                  literally double up with merriment until she leaned against the door frame for
                  support, and to laugh one of those loud, clear, ringing, girlish laughs which the
                  hackneyed woman of the world would give half the charms she has managed to
                  preserve,—to be able to throw out once more. One of those peals which combine the
                  exquisite melody of the human voice with the trill of a black-bird singing in the
                  alders by some brook-side early in spring.<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000164"/> One of those embodiments of mirth and melody for
                  which we might have been puzzled to find a fitting comparison, had Adelina Patti,
                  the little red-bird of song, never rippled out "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Una
                     voce,</foreign>" "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Batti batti,</foreign>" "<foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">E d'amarmi,</foreign>"—or her rival sister Carlotta never
                  trilled that "Laughing Song" which even makes us forget bird-music.</p>
               <p>Ned Minthorne, millionaire and noodle, rather seemed to enjoy the laugh than
                  otherwise, when it had made him fully aware of the presence of the young girl. He
                  dropped his book a little lower, but neither put it down altogether nor took down
                  his feet from the desk, as he said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, you are there, are you—you know! Come here!—I want to talk to you!"</p>
               <p>"Bah! you wretch, spoiling, my room and making me sick the whole day with your
                  tobacco-smoke! I wish they would take you men and use you for chimneys when they
                  build houses, so that you could become avenues for smoke to your heart's content!"
                  was the emphatic response to this modest demand.</p>
               <p>"Ha ha! he he!" laughed the millionaire, with such an expression of idiocy that it
                  was really pitiable. "Not a bad idea, by gracious! I'll ask Trimble, when he
                  builds my next block of houses, if he can't put in half-a-dozen fellows I know—you
                  know."</p>
               <p>"Ned Minthorne—stop that!" was the reply to this speech. What the lady meant, may
                  be something of a mystery to us, but it did not seem to be to the object of the
                  command, for the expression of his face changed instantly; and, strangely enough,
                  he did not seem to feel that his dignity was outraged by that simple girl, without
                  wealth or position, and nothing but a school-teacher, addressing him in that
                  reprehensibly familiar manner. There is reason to believe that had either the
                  dignified Mrs. Fullerton or her exigeant daughter overheard that style of address,
                  however, there would have been stormy weather in and about that latitude, very
                  shortly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Not yet did the millionaire noodle make any movement to take down his feet from
                  the desk. He seemed, in fact, to he quite as much at ease in that position when
                  the young mistress tress of the room was present, as he had been when alone. He
                  merely held out his hand—that hand so burthened with the immense seal-ring—and
                  said, again:</p>
               <p>"Come here."</p>
               <p>The young girl crossed the room and held out her hand. He took it in his, lifted
                  it to his lips with a gesture of courtly grace that would have sat well upon him
                  if he had not been a fool, and pressed his lips to the fingers that were yet rosy
                  with the flush of her morning's exercise. The movement did not seem to be at all
                  repulsive to the young girl, even if it had not been expected, for the hand rested
                  in that of the millionaire a moment even after he had lowered it from his
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"Stop," said Kate. "Where are they?"</p>
               <p>"They—ah—the rhinoceros and the young filly are both gone out with the cub, and
                  not back yet," was the zoological response to this very enigmatical question.</p>
               <p>"For shame!" said the teacher.</p>
               <p>"Well, I <emph>am</emph> ashamed—see me blush!" said the pupil.</p>
               <p>"Back of your ears, so that nobody can see it!" was the response.</p>
               <p>"How very well you are looking this morning!" said the millionaire. "Now that I
                  see you closer, you are almost handsome."</p>
               <p>"Am I?" answered the young girl, with a pout on her lip, real or assumed. "Well,
                     <emph>you</emph> are not! You look like every thing that is dreadful, in that
                  new suit. It <emph>is</emph> new, isn't it? Get off my desk, and come out here
                  where I can have a fair look at all that cream-color and red."</p>
               <p>And before the millionaire could quite conjecture what she was about to do, the
                  teacher caught him by the shoulder, seizing the chair at the same time, and gave
                  him such a whirl that the extensive legs, trowsers and all, came off the desk in
                  double-quick time, and the owner had occasion for quite all his gymnastic
                  experience to prevent his measuring his length upon the floor. He proved equal to
                  the occasion, however, and landed safely upon his feet in the middle of the room,
                  concluding the performance by one of those appeals for applause so commonly made
                  by <foreign xml:lang="ITA">prima donne</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >premieres</foreign>
                  <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7282-00000165"/>
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">danseuses</foreign> at the theatres. Though not much used
                  to the habits of those places of amusement, the young girl understood the gesture
                  and patted applause with her little hands, the compliment being received with a
                  low bow and the leading performer thereafter remaining erect.</p>
               <p>"And you don't like it, eh?" was the inquiry of the ill-used individual, when he
                  had finally reached the perpendicular.</p>
               <p>"As a means of using up a good deal of cloth and hiding away the man so that no
                  one can find him, the thing is rather a success," said the young girl, "but as a
                  suit of clothes—no, I don't like it in the least."</p>
               <p>"Expect to see me in black, then, to-morrow," said the pupil, "and that black
                  fitting me a little closer than my skin. Will <emph>that</emph> suit?—I mean, will
                  that suit suit?"</p>
               <p>"Don't be a ninny!" was all the reply, which certainly seemed an inappropriate
                  one, as addressed to a man who had been recognized as a fool from the moment of
                  his entrance into society.</p>
               <p>"Where have you been?" asked the millionaire, in the most matter-of-fact tone in
                  the world, and precisely as if he thought that he had a right to ask the
                  question,—dropping into a chair at the same time.</p>
               <p>"None of your business, impudence!" was the reply. "And yet I don't care if I tell
                  you. I have been visiting at the house of a man whose wife has forgotten him in a
                  little more than a month of absence. What do you think of that?"</p>
               <p>"A month is a long time—you know," drawled the millionaire—the first drawl he had
                  vented in a considerable period, it will be observed,—and indulged in apparently
                  more as a matter of habit than from any natural proclivity to that mode of
                  utterance.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" said the young girl, holding up her finger with a gesture of mock
                  threatening.</p>
               <p>"What a little tyrant you are!" said the millionaire, without the least drawl
                  whatever.</p>
               <p>"I mean to be worse," said the teacher, "if you keep intruding on my school-room
                  and disarranging every thing. And there is your book on the floor. What were you
                  reading?"</p>
               <p>"See!" answered the millionaire, picking up the book and handing it to her.</p>
               <p>"Natural History, upon my word! Who would have believed that you could peruse any
                  thing so practical?" commented the lady.</p>
               <p>"I? oh, I am very practical," said the millionaire. "But by the way, your book is
                  not extensive enough—does not go deep enough into the relations of the different
                  classes of birds. Did it ever strike you that the mosquito is lineally descended
                  from the crane or the blue heron—some one of those long-legged birds that they
                  used to fly their falcons at? Scare your mosquito a little, after he is gorged, as
                  I did one a little while ago, and he rises just as the heron used to do when he
                  saw the falcon coming—his long legs dangling behind him in the same manner; and I
                  am going to look over my Buffon and my Cuvier, to-morrow, to see whether either of
                  those old jokers recognized the resemblance."</p>
               <p>"Will you <emph>ever</emph> get done with that nonsense?" was the reply to all
                  this.</p>
               <p>"If that is nonsense, I would like to know where your wisdom is to be found!" said
                  the amateur naturalist. "Oh, I suppose you expect to find that in another
                  description of bird—the owl—the totem of school-mistresses."</p>
               <p>"As the jack-daw is of lazy fellows with fine clothes!" shot back the teacher.</p>
               <p>"Good—very good! you will be almost witty, by-and-bye!" was the encouraging reply,
                  the male hands patting applause in their turn.</p>
               <p>"Hark!" said the young girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I hear," said the millionaire. "The caravan is arriving. I will run down to
                  the parlor—you know. Day-day!" and he held out his hand once more for that of the
                  young girl, who responded to the gesture and allowed him to kiss her fingers with
                  the same courtly manner as before, though she replied to his farewell with a
                  rather equivocal compliment:</p>
               <p>"Day-day, you goose!"</p>
               <p>Ned Minthorne left the room and took his way to the parlor on the floor below,
                  awaiting the coming in of his expectant<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7282-00000166"/>
                  pectant mother-in-law and his still more expectant bride; and when those important
                  personages finally disembarked and reached that place of family resort, they found
                  the young man playing a medley of airs on the piano there, in which "Old Hundred,"
                  the "Last Rose of Summer" and "I'll Bet my Money on the Bob-tailed Hoss" seemed to
                  be blended about as oddly as ideas were generally supposed to be in his
                  queerly-constituted brain.</p>
               <p>Kate Haviland walked the floor in silence and evidently in thought, after the
                  millionaire had left the room. She had been merry and almost merry-mad in his
                  presence: a very different mood appeared to possess her at that moment. And yet
                  the expression on her face did not seem to be actually one of
                  <emph>trouble</emph>—it was more like deep and absorbed <emph>feeling,</emph> with
                  a little wonder and newness (so to speak) blended with the other mental
                  ingredients.</p>
               <p>Of all the odd things that could have been imagined, possibly the oddest was to
                  find the proud, vacuous ninny millionaire a habitue of Kate Haviland's school-room
                  and so much at home there that both he and the gay young girl could take liberties
                  in speech that are not likely to be taken except by the most intimate
                  acquaintances. And it might have been supposed that such an intimacy could not
                  exist in the house of Mrs. Fullerton. And yet it did so, not only with the
                  knowledge of that good lady, but of her daughter. No one but a recognized fool
                  could have been permitted to form the same intimacy, within the walls of that
                  house, and yet retained his relations with mother and daughter—that fact is beyond
                  question. But every reader knows that among all savage nations the half-witted are
                  held sacred and permitted to do many things from which ordinary mortals are
                  debarred. There had been a "flare-up," as we have seen, when Ned Minthorne first
                  mentioned having met Kate Haviland upon the stairs; but afterwards, when he one
                  day requested Miss Dora to "take him to the school-room and let him see how they
                  managed that sort of thing—you know," she graciously accorded the privilege,
                  without the slightest idea that he had ever before been inside the walls of that
                  room. And when he afterwards took a fancy to stroll in and see the children study,
                     <emph>without</emph> her company, and she chose to say something ill-natured
                  about it, he quite disarmed her by saying that "a fellow ought to learn something
                  about such things as the nursery and the school-room and all that sort of
                  thing—you know, because he might some day have such things of his own." Dora
                  Fullerton meant that he should at least enter upon wedlock, that recognized
                  preliminary to the filling of educational halls; and her blush and simper,
                  accompanied by a slap of the hand intended to be playful, gave the millionaire
                  thereafter the entree to the school-room. And if for a moment mother or daughter
                  could have believed that any danger was possible from such visits, they would both
                  have been quite re-assured by the air with which he informed them, on his second
                  or third visit, that "it was really devilish refreshing—that is, funny, you
                  know—to see those common people doing things—he had not been used to that sort of
                  people—you know." Thus was repaired every breach in the social wall, and all
                  anxiety was dismissed.</p>
               <p>The millionare oddity had strolled into and out of the school-room, sometimes when
                  he came to the house and found the family absent—sometimes when Dora gave evidence
                  of being bored with him and virtually gave him permission to "go away." He
                  generally, in fact always, when either Myra or Mildred was present, sat silently
                  studying the sublime mysteries of teaching, or dawdling with a book. There could
                  not be any harm in that—could there? Reasonable people would be likely to think
                  not! And as both writer and reader are supposed to be reasonable people, the one
                  has no hesitation in assuring the other that so far as he knows, no harm whatever
                  resulted. If the millionaire and the school-teacher at this stage addressed each
                  other somewhat familiarly and seemed to have a good understanding, "the fact only
                  proved that America was growing to be more truly a republic than before; and if
                  the millionaire was a little more careful of his language in the young girl's
                  presence than when otherwise confronted, what did that prove except that the
                  school-room had been found a profitable place of study even for the noodle?</p>
               <p>But here this theme must be dismissed, as to Mr. Ned<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000167"/> Minthorne; though Kate Haviland does not yet
                  disappear from view.</p>
               <p>After her promenade which followed the departure of Minthorne, the young girl,
                  still apparently absorbed in thought, sat down at her desk, leaned her head upon
                  her hand, and closed her eyes, waiting the coming of the children, who would, as
                  she supposed, be sent in by their mother (to get them out of the way) the moment
                  their hats and street-dresses were removed.</p>
               <p>She had no need to wait long, for one of her pupils, at least. A trampling like
                  that of a couple of race-horses was heard in the little chamber adjoining the
                  school-room, used by Mrs. Fullerton as a wardrobe; and through it the two children
                  dashed from their own, opening the door so violently as to threaten the integrity
                  of the latch, and plunging in as if learning was the sweetest morsel in the world
                  and they had been kept in a state of starvation from want of it. Miss Myra
                  preceded, bearing in her arms one of the drawers of Mrs. Fullerton's private
                  bureau, which she had unfortunately found unlocked and partially open as she came
                  through the room, a heap of finery of every description, blended with small
                  packages wrapped in paper, and a miscellaneous jumble of almost, every thing that
                  a careless woman would throw into some spot of which she always kept the key,
                  showing in charming profusion from the top of the drawer. Behind her came Miss
                  Mildred, who had paused in the clothes-room long enough to array herself in a silk
                  apron, a mantilla and a costly veil belonging to Dora, the very sight of which in
                  such use would have driven that young person of weak nerves very nearly into
                  hysterics. It was evident, at a glance, that neither of the children had supposed
                  the teacher to be within the school-room, and that they had made up their vigorous
                  minds for a spree among Ma's and Dora's finery, with that room as a capital place
                  for its display.</p>
               <p>The sight of the teacher sitting at the desk somewhat took the two young ladies
                  aback, and they paused suddenly, just within the door—very suddenly, in fact. The
                  stoppage was the more violent, without doubt, from the energetic exclamation tion
                  of Kate: "What have you been doing, you young monkeys!" and aware that,
                  discovered, they would at once be obliged to disgorge their plunder, they turned
                  to retrace their steps. But they had come in very violently; Mildred, behind, ran
                  upon Myra in front; the drawer that the latter carried was nearly as large as
                  herself and altogether too bulky for safe holding in small hands; and the result
                  of all this was that the foot of Mildred caught in her long mantilla, she fell
                  against Myra, and the two children and the drawer went down in a heap and with a
                  crash, about half the articles in the drawer aforesaid temporarily emancipating
                  themselves from confinement and flying out upon the carpet.</p>
               <p>The children scrambled to their feet pretty rapidly; and at the word of command
                  from the teacher: "Pick up every one of those things, and put them back where they
                  belong, instantly!" accompanied by an energetic stamp of the foot,—Myra scrambled
                  up all the articles that she saw, thrust them back into the drawer, and the two
                  disappeared through the door about as rapidly as they had first made their
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>"What a beautiful row there would be before many hours, if I should allow the two
                  seraphs to play all the finery into ribbons!" said the young girl to herself; and
                  just then chancing to cast her eyes on the floor behind one of the chairs near the
                  door, she discovered that quite a number of small articles of the finery had
                  fallen at that distance and not been seen by the child in picking up the contents
                  of the drawer. She was on the point of calling Myra back and enforcing discipline
                  by making her pick up the remainder, but finally concluded to perform the office
                  herself, take the lost articles into the room and see that the drawer was properly
                  restored to its place and the clothing hung where it belonged.</p>
               <p>A pair of gloves, a roll of ribbon, an India fan and two pieces of paper were the
                  articles which had managed to get behind the chair, and which the young
                  school-teacher thus rescued. Both the papers were of the dimensions of a full
                  sheet of foolscap paper folded four times into the shape of a document for filing
                  or sending by letter. Neither had any indorsement on the back; and the teacher
                  would probably<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7282-00000168"/> have carried them at
                  once into the room and disposed of them, had not the singularity of color of the
                  one attracted her attention. It was very yellow and seemed so old that she fancied
                  it might be some document connected with the early history of the family—perhaps
                  even as far back as the time of the Revolution, when the Brixtones might have had
                  something to do with Sumter or Marion—with Eutaw or King's Mountain. The young
                  girl did not know how rapidly paper sometimes musts and yellows when shut away
                  from light and air, and how a document that has only seen a quarter of a century
                  may put on the semblance of four times that age. Believing that it must be very
                  old, and having a very big bump of reverence for every thing of the antique,
                  hidden away somewhere under the chestnut hair—she took the liberty of just opening
                  that yellow paper before returning the articles to the room where they belonged,
                  and saw—what? It is not the province of this narration to say precisely what, at
                  the present moment. Something that at first interested her by its novelty, because
                  she had never before seen a paper of the kind; then something that struck her by a
                  similarity of names and made her start as if a small bomb-shell had burst in one
                  corner of the apartment. She looked again at the paper—rubbed her eyes—muttered
                  over a name or two as if in surprise and some doubt—then read the paper all over
                  again, stuck it into that inevitable pocket, and sat down at her desk.</p>
               <p>Two or three minutes of uninterrupted meditation, with her head between both
                  hands, and then the young girl raised it with such a shake as almost sent the
                  chestnut hair flying loose down her shoulders, sprang to her feet with the
                  not-over-intelligible exclamation: "It must be so!—it <emph>is</emph> so! A pretty
                  party, <emph>you</emph> are! Hurrah for Jackson!" and then and thereupon went into
                  a saltatory movement about the room, which might have been a waltz if she had only
                  found a partner, but which really seemed to be accompanied by such suppressed
                  convulsions of laughter, such writhings and contortions of delight, and such
                  un-christian movements generally, as to suggest the war-dance of a very athletic
                  young Indian just after he has taken the scalp of his hereditary enemy.</p>
               <p>The teacher had certainly made a strange discovery, the full amount and purport of
                  which will soon be understood—unearthed a secret which had lain buried, not for a
                  hundred years, but for many more than all those numbered in her own life. A
                  secret, the knowledge of which might exercise an untold influence upon her own
                  fortunes and those of others. And all this by a mere <emph>accident!</emph>
                  No!—let the word be substituted by that better word, <emph>providence,</emph> and
                  then let the wonder cease.</p>
               <p>There are no "accidents," really, though we, pretending to be a Christian people,
                  delight in so expressing ourselves as to deny the existence of a God capable of
                  exercising an oversight upon a human life, oftener than once in a twelvemonth. The
                  fact is that he exercises it continually, in every instant of that human life, or
                  not at all! It was no accident, the other day, which sent half a dozen steam-tugs
                  in to a certain pier at the same time, all ready to steam out again at an
                  instant's warning and save the lives perilled by one huge steamer making her
                  course between the two severed ends of another. Others than the architect of St.
                  Peter's and the spiller of ink over bad manuscript, "build better than they know,"
                  not only in the tragic but the comic. It was not even accident, but a sense of
                  fitness weighing upon her, of which she was entirely unconscious, which induced a
                  sleepy young lady coming home late from the Japanese Ball, to hang her "order of
                  dancing" of that great event, on the umbrella of <hi rend="i"/>Aminadab Sleek, in
                  Karl Muller's statuette of that Burtonian character, occupying one end of the
                  mantel. It belonged in that place, by the inevitable fitness of things, and would
                  have been wasted anywhere else.</p>
               <p>And there is no wonder, even if a singularity, in the late discovery of that which
                  has long remained hidden. The eye sees what it needs to see, at once: all that
                  remains it afterwards takes in by degrees if at all. Very often it goes to the end
                  without discovering half which really lies in the possibility of sight. Only last
                  summer, at Niagara, a habitue who had made that popular resort his
                  "stamping-ground" every summer for twenty years, came in to dinner one day, big
                  with the discovery of a tree of gigantic proportions and<pb n="350-351"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000169"/> great beauty, that he had never seen before, on
                  that very limited continent, Goat Island.</p>
               <p>Going up the Hudson a dozen years ago, the writer was in the pilot-house of the
                  steamer with an old North River pilot who had passed up and down the river nearly
                  every day far thirty years. Just above West Point, on that occasion, he looked off
                  to the west bank and said: "By George," [or some other name] "there is a house I
                  never saw before!" The writer looked, and saw a little old brown house, close down
                  to the bank, that had certainly been built not less than half a century, and
                  signified to the pilot that he <emph>must</emph> have seen it before, during some
                  one of his ten thousand passages up and down. "No," said the pilot, in such a tone
                  and with such a manner that he left no doubt of the correctness of his
                  allegation—"of course the house has stood there all the while, but I tell you that
                  I have never happened to see it till this moment." Did the writer still doubt the
                  correctness of the pilot's memory? If he did at that time, he has ceased to doubt,
                  in the light of added experience. For behind him, as he writes, hangs a framed
                  copy of that marvellous etching from Moritz Retzsch, the "Game of Life," in which
                  the young man is playing at chess with the devil for his own soul. He has had the
                  picture in possession for nearly or quite twenty years, and made it a habitual
                  study, and yet less than a year has elapsed since he one day found a spider
                  crawling over the edge of the tomb-stone on which the combatants have set their
                  chess-board. Since then, the spider has been one of the most conspicuous objects
                  in the picture; and as the suggestion of little Brown Eyes cannot be received as
                  conclusive—that the spider had been all that while crawling up from the sculptures
                  on the side of the tomb below, and only made his appearance at that time,—it only
                  remains to suppose that it must have been there all the while, but that the eye
                  had only then recognized that feature in the detail.</p>
               <p>So much for the discovery of things long hidden, and the accidental or
                  providential character of the modes employed in their revelation. Enough, in
                  addition, on the events of that day, to say that after a time the young girl
                  concluded her "war-dance" and calmed herself sufficiently to fulfil her duties.
                  Not <emph>all</emph> her duties, perhaps,—for she retained that old yellow paper
                  in her own possession, when she carried in the remainder and added them to the
                  heterogenous collection in the drawer. And something <emph>more</emph> than her
                  duties, perhaps,—as before she slept that night she wrote and forwarded a letter
                  to Burtnett Haviland, in which the reader would have been puzzled to trace any of
                  the merriment shown in her former epistle.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Fire Zouaves held Shooter's Hill, two miles southwest of Alexandria, between
                  the Fairfax and Leesburg roads, and commanding views of both through the few
                  scrubby trees that fringed it, while the towering bulk of the Fairfax Seminary
                  could be seen a few miles further to the southwest, and beyond it the great road
                  stretched away towards Fairfax Court-House. They were building Fort Ellsworth
                  there; and there, as has before been said, occurred most of their experiences and
                  exploits in camp life.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Noah L. Farnham, so suddenly become Colonel of the Regiment by
                  the death of Colonel Ellsworth, did <emph>not</emph> go mad when suddenly left in
                  the streets of Alexandria with that horde of half-disciplined and impracticable
                  men; and afterwards, when the same unfortunate officer was lying in the hospital,
                  after Bull Run, suffering and slowly dying with the terrible wound in his head
                  received in that<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7282-00000170"/> battle, and the
                  debility arising from earlier and neglected injuries,—he made his preservation of
                  reason on that occasion the test of his general power to retain it, in an
                  exclamation not easily to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>"They tell me you have been out of your head, Colonel," said one of the other
                  officers, coming in to see him as he lay writhing on his pallet of suffering.</p>
               <p>"Do they?" said the Colonel, grimly. "They lie, then—that is all! If I did not go
                  crazy at the moment when Ellsworth left me in the streets of Alexandria, with that
                  lot of fellows and no idea what under heaven to do with them—why, there is not
                  pain and suffering enough in the world to drive me crazy: you may bet on
                  that!"</p>
               <p>Colonel Farnham, known among his familiars as "Pony," from his short stature and
                  compact figure, was the very incarnation of a soldier, by nature; and under other
                  circumstances than those in which he chanced to be placed, he would unquestionably
                  have illustrated the service. The little man, with his thin face, high
                  cheek-bones, dark hair and eyes and poor pretence at beard in a thin goatee, had
                  been a capital gymnast when resident in the great city and a "fire-laddie"; and
                  when a member and officer of the Seventh, with which he marched away, he had spent
                  many of his hours in the bunk-room, reading military books and planning operations
                  in that active service which he then little expected to enter,—while his
                  associates were finding other and more congenial employment. It is just possible
                  that, placed originally in command of the Fire Zouaves and given time to
                  discipline them before they were thrown into service, he might really have made
                  the general dream of their capabilities a reality and left a proud record of the
                  regiment to be read in the future.</p>
               <p>But this is mere speculation. Enough to know that if any man ever had his "hands
                  full" of any body of men, the new Colonel was placed in that position immediately
                  after the fall of Ellsworth. And no man who was a member of the command will be
                  likely to forget the two days in Alexandria following that event, with the body of
                  the Zouaves drunk and unmanageable, the town threatened with fire in an hundred
                  places from their revengeful hands, theft frequent and rapine not beyond very
                  rational fear. All day and all night, on both those days, the few remaining true
                  to discipline, with the Michigan troops, were busied in hunting out the skulkers
                  and returning them to their commands; and when on the Monday following the death
                  of Ellsworth the regiment finally left their quarters at the Railroad Depot and
                  marched to take position at Shooter's Hill, it is a matter of question whether the
                  people of the old "secesh" town, no longer afraid of their very lives, or the
                  Colonel, with his command once more gathered into something approaching
                  discipline, felt the more grateful for the order dictating the movement.</p>
               <p>One company, that of Captain Jack, with Burtnett Haviland yet in the ranks, found
                  different employment from the rest of the regiment, in guarding the government
                  warehouses skirting the river at Alexandria, a duty for which their better
                  discipline and greater steadiness made them available. With them we shall have
                  occasion to deal presently: our immediate view is to be taken of the body of the
                  regiment and the builders of Fort Ellsworth.</p>
               <p>They were a merry body of fellows, beyond a question, and when away from
                  temptation they behaved like men and soldiers. Fort Ellsworth sprang up quite as
                  rapidly, in comparison, under their active hands and ready spades, as the
                  extensive lilies of fortifications opposite Washington were growing under those of
                  the Sixty-ninth and the other regiments of New York State Militia. They were
                  happy, contented, even jolly. If they were ill-fed, they fared no worse in that
                  particular than any other regiment in the service; and if the soldiers of some of
                  the regiments were damaged in comfort and actually suffering in health from the
                  miserable quality of the shoddy clothing and blankets furnished them, the Zouaves
                  had not the same cause of complaint. In fact, long before most of the regiments
                  had any hope of seeing the Quartermaster with requisitions for new clothing, they
                  had shed their shabby gray and appeared in the blue Zouave pants and jacket, with
                  red shirt, in which (or a part of which) they afterwards went into their first and
                  last battle.</p>
               <p>The fire-boys were fire-boys still, at Shooter's Hill as they<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000171"/> had been in their native city. Not one but expected
                  to return, some day, and connect himself with his favorite machine; not one but
                  could and would tell the same stories of the night when the old wall on Broadway
                  fell over and buried an engineer and half of Fifteen's fellows, or the time when
                  Forty-eight got fast in a snow-bank, at the corner of Broome and Mercer, and let
                  Forty-nine pass her,—that they had been in the habit of telling before war came
                  upon the land. Not one but could "bet his life" when occasion required, on the
                  honor of a friend or the capacity of an engine; and scarcely one but was both
                  ready and willing to give the most trusty of his comrades what he graphically
                  designated as a "mash in the jaw" when he "came foo-foo-ing around" with some
                  story that did not please. The musket was only a temporary substitute for the
                  trumpet, the brake and the spanner; and not even Farnham could make the boys
                  soldiers instead of firemen.</p>
               <p>One ambition spread a little among the officers, meanwhile—that was peculiarly
                  soldierly. That was the desire to <emph>learn to ride.</emph> It is well known
                  that not one man in ten, at the North, is sufficiently at home in the saddle to be
                  able to make a good dragoon; and not one in fifty is capable of riding with
                  sufficient grace to escape unpleasant attention among professional riders. Of the
                  Fire Zouaves, in gross, perhaps the scale of equestrian power was almost as low as
                  it would have been found among the same number of old salts who had spent half
                  their lives at sea. But the Virginians rode well as well as rode capital
                  horses—that every man in the regiment could see, whether looking at them as they
                  casually passed, or through the spectacles of an enemy. To the rank and file, this
                  made very little difference; but some of the officers were more ambitious. Suppose
                  some of the line should rise to the dignity of field officers or be placed upon
                  the staff!—and suppose some of the field should have occasion to be almost
                  constantly in the saddle! Such things were not inevitable, of course, but they
                  were quite as likely as that the female daughter of the house of Toodle should
                  marry a man with the name of Thompson. Therefore—said both field and line
                  officers—we will perfect ourselves in riding, while there is an opportunity. They
                  did so, to a great extent; and it is to be believed that no spot on the earth's
                  surface ever saw such specimens of equitation as some of the Virginia roads
                  surrounding the camp, when leisure allowed and horses were supplied by the
                  "accident" of a "secesh" Virginian tumbling off his steed and forgetting to get up
                  and mount him again!</p>
               <p>Captain ——, of Company ——, could tell us a good story, if be only would, how he
                  longed, nay, yearned for a horse of splendid proportions and gallant mettle, with
                  the which he would at once perfect his equestrian education and astonish the whole
                  camp with the knightly grace and firmness of seat which might have belonged to one
                  of the old Paladins—how one day a steed, coal black and glossy, from which his
                  rebel owner had just accidentally tumbled off, was brought in to him and tendered
                  for his coveted exercise—how the horse neighed, curveted, and did many other acts
                  and things calculated to allure him to a seat in the saddle—how his orderly, just
                  before he essayed to mount, tendered him a pair of spurs, of the which he felt a
                  trifle shy, but the which he did not dare refuse, owing to the many who stood
                  around to witness the first mounting of the neophyte—how the orderly then and
                  thereupon buckled on the spurs aforesaid, of which the rowels seemed to the
                  expectant rider of about a foot in length each—how he mounted, with the assistance
                  of the orderly at the horse's head—how the horse playfully shied the moment after,
                  throwing him violently to one side, upon which one of the spur rowels entered the
                  horse aforesaid about twelve inches—how he dismounted over the horse's head, the
                  next instant, somewhat in a confused condition, without any assistance from the
                  orderly whatever—how the horse turned around and nosed him, when he lay half
                  stunned and altogether discomfited upon the ground, with motions and gestures
                  which said quite as plainly as words: "Poor devil! What did you fall off for?"—and
                  how he did not ride any more, at that juncture, on Virginian horses and <emph>with
                     spurs.</emph> But Captain —— will not tell the story, and he must even be
                  content with its relation? the name suppressed, by one<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000172"/> who could have tumbled off, under like
                  circumstances, a little more heavily than himself.</p>
               <p>Major C—— (there was only one Major in the regiment, and so any attempt to
                  disguise his personality must be futile) had a more extensive experience, and in
                  some senses it may be said a more unpleasant one. To say that the Major rode very
                  badly might be a libel: to say that he rode very well would be a still more
                  culpable perversion of truth. He practised much, and certainly improved, though he
                  did not achieve that thickening of the cuticle which could render him, after a few
                  miles' ride, free from sensations best known to unpractised riders who go up from
                  the Crawford House to the top of Mount Washington and back again the same day. Of
                  the epidermis of such people, under peculiarly unfortunate circumstances it may be
                  said that it is "neither here nor there." Of that of the Major, after his
                  equestrian practice of a particular day, very nearly the same might be said
                  without exaggeration.</p>
               <p>Not many days after the occupation of Shooter's Hill and the commencement of the
                  fortification there, a detachment of two companies was thrown out to Cloud's
                  Mills, on the Fairfax Road, with pickets lying a mile beyond. This brought the
                  Zouaves into the immediate vicinity of the rebels, so that firing between the
                  pickets began to be prevalent, and the utmost vigilance became necessary. One
                  scalding day in June, when walking was a labor and riding a torture, the Major
                  rode out to Cloud's Mills, and afterwards to the full extent of the Federal lines,
                  to look after the vigilance and the welfare of the pickets. He was a little
                  plethoric that day, and sensation seemed to ooze out to the skin very easily.
                  Though not by any means angry or indignant, it may be said that he "chafed," as
                  the caged lion is reputed to do, though perhaps not in the same sense. By the time
                  he had ridden to the station of the last picket, the Major might have said,
                  without exaggeration, that he had ridden quite enough for that day; and a close
                  observer would have seen that he scarcely kept so erect in the saddle as he had
                  done early in the morning. In fact, from "causes beyond his own control," he
                  leaned forward a little, something after the manner of that estimable ble
                  gentleman and model historian but sad innovator on the science of equitation, who
                  so often sets gratis riding-lessons in the Central Park.</p>
               <p>Riding away from the most distant of the pickets, with pleasant visions of the
                  relief he should embrace when once more arrived at Fort Ellsworth, the Major took
                  what he conceived to be a "short cut" through the woods and away from the main
                  road, gave his horse another, and galloped forward. His seat in the saddle became
                  less endurable and the motion of the horse more intolerable; but was he not
                  getting back to camp and to repose? When he had galloped so far that he fancied he
                  should again have struck the main road, and yet without being able to recognize
                  any landmark—he took the liberty of inquiring of one of the estimable residents of
                  the soil, whom he met, whether he was on the right road for Shooter's Hill. He was
                  answered in the affirmative, by that reliable person, so decidedly that he felt
                  almost ashamed to have asked the question and galloped on yet more briskly than
                  before. Mile upon mile, it seemed to the tortured Major, and the day growing
                  hotter and hotter, with all the other circumstances aggravated, that have before
                  been hinted at—and still no appearance of Fort Ellsworth.</p>
               <p>Still riding ahead, the Major proved that he possessed the material for a
                  commander, by taking a view of the position. Something was wrong,
                  unquestionably—but what? A little astronomical knowledge conjoined with the
                  suspicious circumstances, gave him the clue. The sun was on his right instead of
                  his left: he was going the wrong way. Dimly the fact began to reveal itself—he had
                  lost his way and the estimable citizen had been lying!—he was some miles within
                  the enemy's lines, and riding rapidly into the rebel stronghold of Fairfax Court
                  House!</p>
               <p>"About ship!" sings out the Captain when he discovers that his vessel has been
                  swayed out of her course by false currents and is just going head on to some rock
                  that must shiver her to atoms. The Major did not shout to his helmsman, being the
                  helmsman himself; but he swayed hard on the near rein, which the Captain before
                  mentioned would have designated as the "port tiller rope," and brought his<pb
                     n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7282-00000173"/> equestrian vessel about as rapidly as
                  possible. Just at that moment he found an additional incentive for wheeling
                  suddenly, for over the crest of a hill immediately ahead dashed three rebel
                  horsemen, who had caught sight of him and who rode as if there was no such thing
                  in the world as want of sympathy between the horse and his rider.</p>
               <p>Then followed one of those events which the writer feels himself entirely
                  inadequate to describe. The Major was a brave man—none braver in the Federal army
                  then or afterward. Many a man, before that time, had seen him under circumstances
                  quite as trying to the nerves and quite as perilous to life as the shock of any
                  battle conflict. Some of the same persons afterwards saw him riding among the
                  bullets on Manasses, swearing a little, but apparently no more excited by bodily
                  fear than if he had been ordering up another engine to a big fire or making an
                  insurance calculation. And yet the Major, in this instance, ran away—ignominiously
                  ran away! He had his pistols, but they were only two against six—fearful odds for
                  the weaker party. His four horse'slegs, so far as they could go, were just as good
                  as twelve—therefore—" g'lang!"</p>
               <p>There are several rides in history, mythology and romance, that might be
                  introduced profitably, here, except that none of them rise equal to the parallel.
                  How the old Greek heroes of the mythological period swept down to the hunt of the
                  Calydonian Boar—how the men of the Scottish border dashed through Liddesdale after
                  the rievers of their cattle fleeing away to their mountain fastnesses—how the Wild
                  Huntsman of the German forests rushed by with horn and hound, on unholy nights
                  when all the demons of the air were unloosed—nay, how John Gilpin rode on that
                  fateful day when he dined everywhere and nowhere,—all these might be brought in,
                  with great advantage to the general interests of the literature of many lands, but
                  they would only furnish a dim shadow of the stern reality of that flight and that
                  pursuit. Away with you, up hill and down hill, horses that bear the rebel
                  cavalrymen, for nobler prey will not be hunted during all the war! Let out another
                  link, gallant roan that bears the Major, for he will never need your best speed
                  more imminently than he needs it at the present juncture! Let the scrubby trees of
                  the Fairfax Road and the shabby worm-fences all sweep by like the sudden shift of
                  a panorama or the flash from railroad-car windows! Away! away!—after a life, and
                  to save one!</p>
               <p>But if language fails to describe that flight and that pursuit, what shall be said
                  of the sufferings of the flying Major, before worn out with equitation, and now
                  only able to keep his saddle from the grimest of all necessities. Let the reader
                  make no attempt to roll with him, or writhe, or bend forward, or lean back, or
                  change from one dreadful position to a worse, as every leap brings a new blister
                  to the skin and every spring half tears out another nerve or half dislocates
                  another bone! There is terrible heat pouring down from the sky, but what is it to
                  that apparently radiating up from the earth? Saint Lawrence was broiled on a
                  gridiron; but the gridiron, if we are correctly informed, remained stationary and
                  did not gallop. Saint Herminigildus was flayed alive before being cut in pieces;
                  but he was at least allowed (so far as any volition of his tormentors was
                  concerned) to remain quiet during the unpleasant operation. The flying Major was a
                  worse victim than either of these: he was both flayed and roasted at a speed of
                  twenty-five miles the hour.</p>
               <p>The four legs were triumphant over the twelve, after all the vengeance of the
                  fiends had been exhausted on the unfortunate horseman. It seemed an age and a
                  flight of fifty leagues before the pickets beyond Cloud's Mills came in sight, but
                  they did come in sight at last, and a shot or two sent the rebel pursuers to the
                  right about. The Major rode in under the sheltering fire. He was saved—what there
                  was left of him! Draw the curtain. There is no cold cream in the army
                  commissariat, though rest and cold water applications may do something. The Major
                  will ride again, and ride better than ever, some day—just as the pedestrian will
                  eventually walk further and with less suffering, on the heel once blistered to
                  torture!</p>
               <p>These are only glimpses of the camp-life at Fort Ellsworth, but they must suffice.
                  So wore on June and July with the main body of the Fire Zouave regiment, while the
                  war-cloud was gathering darker and darker over all Virginia, rebel,
                     fortification<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7282-00000174"/> ification answering to
                  fortification built by Federal hands and the thunder muttering before that great
                  conflict which was to drench the soil of Fairfax with the blood of so many who had
                  but lately been brothers.</p>
               <p>The main body of the regiment—we have said. Let it be remembered that one company,
                  that of Captain Jack, held post at Alexandria and guarded the munitions of war and
                  provisions stored in the warehouses on the wharves. It may at Shoolter's Hill did
                  not forget the fact, and that Zouaves at footer's Hill did not forget the fact,
                  and that when they found opportunity to express themselves they did so something
                  in the manner following:—</p>
               <p>"Eh-yah! You fellows of Company —— are nothing but a set of foo-foos! Soft bread
                  and houses to sleep in, for <emph>you,</emph> while the rest of us have nothing
                  softer than hard tack and sleep in the mud! Eh—yah! much good <emph>you</emph>
                  do!"</p>
               <p>Captain Jack had certainly a company somewhat better disciplined that the balance
                  of the regiment, and he certainly manifested much better talent in managing them
                  than most of the others (though the other Captains, and their subalterns, no doubt
                  did wonders under the circumstances and with their material). But if it should be
                  said that the discipline of even Captain Jack's Company was much superior to that
                  of the regular service, there is some fear that the statement might smack of
                  exaggeration. In the last chapter casually came out one of the occurrences in
                  which some of the company figured—that of the women in the old ware house and the
                  Zouave creeping in at the window, in which the good name of Burtnett Haviland was
                  so sadly made to suffer at home. Let us glance at a few more of the salient points
                  of guard-life at Alexandria.</p>
               <p>If there was any commodity, liquid or solid, difficult to keep intack in the
                  neighborhood of the Zouaves, it was whiskey. Perhaps the same difficulty may
                  sometimes have existed in the vicinity of other Zouaves, and even of those
                  soldiers who never wore baggy trousers—who knows? At all events, nearly every time
                  that Captian Jack left his quarters, located in an old dwelling house not far from
                  the wharves, when he returned the stock on hand would be materially reduced and
                  yet no culprit discovered. Pete, the escaped contraband who acted as body-servant,
                  was not drunk on those occasions, so he could not be the depredator: yet how could
                  the favorite compound be abstracted without Pete's knowledge?</p>
               <p>Going out to the regimental quarters one day, Captain Jack held a conference with
                  that indispensable darkey before leaving, and calmly informed him that the
                  stealing of whiskey had now gone far enough, and that if on his return he
                  discovered that any further depredations had taken, place, he, Pete, would be
                  incontinently tied up and more soundly flogged than he had been during all his
                  days of "involuntary servitude." The negro muttered something about: "Try to keep
                  um, Masser Captin!" and with that assurance the officer departed. Coming back to
                  the house after dusk, and well knowing that the sentries, in obedience to orders,
                  had left the house to itself and kept their posts nearer the river, the Captain
                  was hailed by a threatening voice from the dark quadrangle, as he approached the
                  house:</p>
               <p>"Who come dar? Keep off, I tell you, or I shoot!"</p>
               <p>No answer to the challenge, and the Captain approached still closer. This time it
                  came still louder and more hurriedly, and with evident fright in the voice.</p>
               <p>"Keep off dar, I tell you! Keep off, or I shoot! Can't come foolin' round dis
                  nigger no more!" Then with something approaching a yell, as the object of its
                  terror approached still nearer, the voice repeated: "Keep off, I tell you, or dis
                  nigger shoot! Keep away, now mind!"</p>
               <p>"Why, who the deuce are you, and what are you doing here?" spoke the Captain for
                  the first time, as through the dusk he descried the negro, somewhat darker than
                  the dusk itself, standing sentry before the door with one of the condemned
                  muskets, that he knew to be unloaded, from the old storehouse, the musket shaking
                  and the poor darkey's knees trembling still worse, with terror.</p>
               <p>"Oh, is dat you, Masser Captin!" said the negro, dropping his musket with a very
                  howl of joy, "Oh, lord, I'se so glad! Tot it was some o' dem fellers again; and
                  den I lose de whiskey, sure, and get licked into de bargain!"</p>
               <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7282-00000175"/>
               <p>Under the double impulse of his past fright and his present joy, poor Pete at last
                  explained the secret of the whiskey disappearances. The moment they found the
                  Captain had gone away to any distance, some of the Zouaves were in the habit of
                  coming to the house, tying up the poor negro and then helping themselves to the
                  liquor, untying him when they left, but effectually sealing his mouth by the
                  threat that if he dared to tell what had become of it they would "flog him within
                  an inch of his life." Between such a double fire had the victim been placed;
                  though it is scarcely necessary to say that after his valorous attempt to defend
                  his own skin and the Captain's whiskey by keeping guard in the dark with an
                  unloaded musket, he was not again allowed to be placed in the same position.</p>
               <p>Another trouble, imminent with the commandant, was the impossibility of teaching
                  the men that they were soldiers and <emph>nothing else</emph>—that they were not
                  now firemen and gymnasts. This trouble has been before alluded to, but it had a
                  ludicrous illustration in a single instance. There was an alarm, one day, down on
                  one of the wharves just below the storehouses; and going down to see what had
                  occurred, the officers found that the "P. R." had suddenly made its appearance in
                  the antique city, seriously to the detriment of the armed service. Two fellows
                  were in a "rough-and-tumble" clench on the pier, pounding each other merrily. One
                  seemed to have been a Zouave and a sentry, at no distant period, from certain
                  cast-off appurtenances lying on the dock; and the other appeared to be a gentleman
                  of bivalvular antecedents, from one of the oyster-boats in the river. Rigid
                  inquiry established the fact that the little physical discussion had originated in
                  this wise:</p>
               <p>Occupant of the oyster-boat approached the wharf at a point where the regulations
                  strictly forbade any landing to be allowed. Zouave, musket on shoulder, hailed him
                  with: "Look a here! Jest you keep off, will you? See this thing?" tapping his
                  musket. "This shoots—<emph>this</emph> does! So jest keep off!" "Bah! you're a
                  smartey!" ejaculated the gentleman in the oyster-boat. "Very big, <emph>you</emph>
                  are, because you have a musket and I haven't any! Jest put down that musket, and
                  I'll——." He needed to proceed no further with the challenge. The gallant member of
                  Two-hundred-and-fifty-seven Hose was not in the habit of backing out from what he
                  considered a "square fight." Down went his musket and off went all his other
                  warlike appurtenances. The gentleman from the oyster-boat landed without
                  hindrance, and the little exercise in the "P. R." commenced, afterwards kept up
                  with such spirit on the part of the boatman that when the officers arrived the
                  Zouave was under and considerably damaged. The ex-sentry did not understand then,
                  and probably (if he is alive) does not understand to this day, why he should have
                  been arrested and sent to the guard-house for his "ex-sentri-city."</p>
               <p>Still another trouble, and one more difficult to manage than either of the others,
                  was that propensity for variety manifested by the Zouaves in common with all other
                  bodies of armed men since the time when Xerxes found a few hundred thousands of
                  his million going back to Persia without formal furloughs—a propensity cruelly
                  designated by the moderns as <emph>desertion.</emph> Probably not many of the boys
                  wished to escape from the service, but they did want to get away to Washington or
                  elsewhere and enjoy a few days of liberty and jollity not attainable within sound
                  of their drum-beat. And they did it. Especially after the cars began to run
                  northward again on the Leesburg road, were there vacancies continually occurring
                  in the ranks. Evidently they left with the aid of the cars, but no one could
                  ascertain how, as the trains were examined inside and outside before starting. One
                  day, however, the station-master came to Captain Jack and made a report. He had
                  discovered the modus operandi. The fellows were in the habit of stowing themselves
                  away under the cars, on the trucks, until some stoppage might occur after leaving
                  the town, when they would drop off quietly and seek their "fresh fields and
                  pastures new."</p>
               <p>The station-master informed Captain Jack that there were at that moment three of
                  his men stowed away under the cars of the train about to start, and suggested that
                  they had better be removed. Captain Jack thought a moment, and adopted a<pb
                     n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7282-00000176"/> peculiar plan for their removal. He
                  ordered a load of straw to be scattered along the track a few hundred yards ahead,
                  where the "skedaddlers" could not be aware of the operation—and that straw set on
                  fire. Then he ordered the engineer to go ahead and stop his train immediately over
                  the burning straw. Bees have been known to come out of their trees, and rats from
                  their holes, from the employment of similar processes; and once upon a time, in
                  Algeria, was it not Marshal Magnan who proved that there is nothing in a name by
                  adopting that any thing but magnan-imous plan of smoking out the Arabs from their
                  caves or letting them stay in and be smothered? At all events, three Zouaves came
                  out from under the Leesburg train, at that particular juncture, quite as rapidly
                  as they had ever run to a fire; and they did not again attempt that mode of escape
                  without being fully aware how much dry straw there might be in the
                  neighborhood.</p>
               <p>One more reminiscence of life in Alexandria, and this tells not against the
                  soldiers, but the officers—and, what is more, against the officers of the regular
                  service.</p>
               <p>An United States steamer lay off the town when Ellsworth went down with his
                  Zouaves, and the same vessel kept guard there during all their sojourn. The
                  officers were jolly fellows; Captain Jack was a jolly fellow; and Captain Bob S——,
                  of the regular army, was quite as jolly as either. The two officers had
                  semi-occasional invitations to visit and dine on board the steamer, especially
                  when they had themselves sent off a few boxes of claret or baskets of champagne
                  that had come into their own possession. One day claret was the medium, and the
                  two officers lingered somewhat long in the ward-room, so that it was dark when the
                  boat's-crew was called away to convey the guests to the shore. When they landed,
                  Captain Jack had just brains enough left to be aware that the jolly tars should
                  have some compensation for their row, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, took
                  out the handful of silver change to be found there, and poured it into the palm of
                  the coxswain. Captain Bob, who was "droopy," roused at this, with a: "See
                  here—bo-o-oys!—there's a lizzle m-o-o-re for ye!" thrust his hand into his pocket
                  and passed over his handful; whereupon the boat's-crew, with many pulls of the
                  top-knot, rowed away, and the two officers separated for their respective
                  quarters.</p>
               <p>The next morning Captain Jack, very early, was favored with a visit from Captain
                  Bob. Captain Jack was cool, serene and happy: Captain Bob seemed puzzled and
                  discomfited. "Captain Jack, did I lend you any money last night?" "Not a cop!"
                  "Did I lend <emph>anybody</emph> any, that you saw!" "No!" "Did you, see me use
                  any money at all, anywhere?" "Yes—I saw you give a handful of money, out of your
                  trousers pocket, to the sailors who brought us ashore,—just after I had given them
                  a handful myself." "Thunder and lightning!" said Captain Bob—" then I have just
                  given them a twenty dollar gold piece, two tens, a few gold dollars and a lot of
                  silver—just every dollar I had in my possession!" "Phew!" whistled Captain Jack.
                  "Oh, that won't do, you know!" said Captain Bob—" I must go off and see about
                  it!—can't be stripped in that manner!" "Think I wouldn't, if I were you," said
                  Captain Jack. "And why in thunder not?" added Captain Bob. "Because they
                     <emph>might</emph> take a fancy to say that you must have been
                     <emph>drunk,</emph>" suggested Captain Jack. "So they might—I think I will let
                  it slide!" concluded Captain Bob. And he did so. The boat's crew must have
                  realized somewhere between fifty and sixty dollars of Captain Bob's money by that
                  pull of a few minutes—probably the best pay of the kind on record; and yet that
                  amount might have been worse spent, in any one of a dozen different modes that
                  will suggest themselves to the imaginative mind.</p>
               <p>And yet one more incident, which must be preserved here, lest the coming American
                  Scott and the coming American Macaulay may both chance to miss it in making up
                  their actual and imaginative records of the war. Let the Macaulay dig out for
                  himself the particulars of those melancholy records involving the hanging of a
                  member of one of the Pennsylvania regiments at Fort Ellsworth, for the shooting of
                  a woman,—and that sad spectacle, when the first dead and wounded of the war came
                  in from General Schenck's terrible mishap at Vienna, with the secession men, women
                  and children<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7282-00000177"/> dren gathering around the
                  cars at the Leesburg depot at Alexandria, as they were disembarked, reviling the
                  dead, taunting the living wounded, and showing the most fiendish joy at the
                  disaster, till the Zouaves and their Michigan comrades could stand the insults no
                  longer and charged bayonets upon the pack of wolves that then turned to be sheep
                  of a very timid order. Let the historian dig out these for himself: we have to do,
                  just now, only with one more grand provocative to merriment.</p>
               <p>Concealed arms were all the while among the bugbears that haunted the Union
                  soldiers during the early campaigns in Virginia. Swords, muskets and pistols could
                  be found hidden almost everywhere by the rebels, above ground and under ground,
                  ready for use the moment they dared bring them forth. Alexandria was a secession
                  hold, and many seizures of concealed arms had been made there, until the Union
                  officers believed that the contraband stock must be very nearly exhausted. But one
                  night orders came for the Zouave company and one company of the Michigan troops,
                  to surround a certain block half a dozen squares from the wharves, and seize a
                  cannon, or perhaps two, hidden there, the locality of which had at last been
                  betrayed. Solemnly and sternly, at daylight the next morning, the troops marched
                  from their quarters and drew a cordon around the entire block. Solemnly and
                  sternly they entered every house, searched it from garret to basement, explored
                  the yards and even dug up the cellars where the loose earth rendered the burying
                  of a piece practicable. Much perspiration they expended, and much wonder they
                  vented, for at least one piece must be there—they <emph>knew.</emph> And a little
                  after noon they found the gun so dangerous in rebel hands, lying in one of the
                  back yards; and they gathered solemnly and reverently around it. It was a
                     <emph>child's toy cannon, just four inches long!</emph> And two companies of
                  the United States forces had been "sold" for almost an entire day, by one of the
                  cleverest "put up jobs" of the century.</p>
               <p>It is time to return for a moment to Burtnett Haviland, who shared the fortunes of
                  the other Zouaves of Captain Jack's company, in keeping watch over the warehouses
                  at Alexandria. Nothing has been said of his state of feeling, since weeks before
                  when the regiment was about moving from Camp Decker. What had he heard from his
                  wife? What had occurred to soothe or to intensify that lacerated and almost
                  exasperated feeling which moved him to apply for a furlough on the day of the
                  departure? He had heard nothing from his wife—not one word, from that day. Letters
                  had ceased to come to him, though that no stoppage in the mails could be the cause
                  of the continued failure, was but too evident, from his occasional reception of
                  letters from others—his cousin Kate among the number. The reader knows what he was
                  likely to hear from his home, through <emph>her:</emph> none of his other
                  correspondents had any occasion to speak of his wife, or would have any thought of
                  doing so. He had heard nothing of her—nothing—not one word,—from the hour when the
                  careless remark of his acquaintance showed her to have been in a place of popular
                  amusement with the merchant; and as a consequence, in spite of himself, from that
                  hour he had seen her with the eyes of his mind, in no other relation but that of a
                  gay, heartless woman who had forgotten her husband and plunged into fashionable
                  dissipation as a substitute for his society.</p>
               <p>Precisely what Haviland believed of his wife at this juncture, it is difficult to
                  say: it might have been difficult for himself to explain. That he had been driven
                  by a combination of circumstances to believe her weak and heartless if not
                  criminal, and his own domestic happiness destroyed for the remainder of their
                  natural lives,—is beyond question. What he harbored of discontent and anger, of
                  the feeling of intense wrong, and of the necessity of some future revenge, he was
                  precisely the man to have kept altogether to himself, even had the dearest of
                  friends stood at his elbow. And if he had not found a total change of his nature,
                  in the unexpected circumstances crowding upon him, he had at least been stunned
                  (so to speak) and found some of the better qualities of that nature paralyzed.
                  That he should not have allowed himself to receive those suspicious circumstances
                  blindly—that he should have shown more faith and trust in the woman who had for
                  four years slept upon his heart—that he ought to have investigated the reports
                  that seemed so injurious, and found<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7282-00000178"/>
                  some means to discover why he received no letters, instead of receiving that
                  failure as a proof that he was cast off and forgotten—that he should have gone
                  home, all other researches failing, at any price, even that of
                     <emph>desertion,</emph>—may all be true; and yet no man knows precisely how
                     <emph>he</emph> would have acted under corresponding circumstances.</p>
               <p>Enough to say that he seemed to have accepted his fate—that he applied for no
                  furlough and held no more conversation with Captain Jack on the subject—that he
                  mechanically asked for letters when the mail for the Company arrived, and
                  swallowed any disappointment he might have felt, at that sad word to the
                  expectant, "None!"—that he grew taciturn and comparatively moody, and asked no
                  questions of the New York visitors who might have chanced to say at least
                     <emph>some</emph> word to enlighten if not to comfort him—that he mechanically
                  performed his duties as a soldier, his uniform, accoutrements and person always in
                  order and himself quoted as a model of discipline and reliability—and that during
                  all this time his ruddy cheek grew thinner, his eye heavier and more lowering, his
                  lips more silent, and himself less and less, day by day, the frank, whole-hearted,
                  joyous man who had so conscientiously and ardently enlisted in the Union service.
                  To which may be added that with his hair cut short to his head, for coolness, and
                  with his beard clipped close, after the manner of all the Zouaves who had any, he
                  was shamefully disfigured, and half his best friends would not have known him
                  under that radical change.</p>
               <p>We shall catch one more glimpse of him, at a very early period, and before he
                  became a part of that sorrowful spectacle set for the eyes of the world on the
                  plains of Manasses, on the 21st of July, 1861.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>SATURDAY EVENING, 13th of July. That afternoon the Cunard steamer had gone to her
                  moorings at Jersey City, and half a dozen of her passengers, not yet quite content
                  with the companionship they had kept for the previous ten days on shipboard, had
                  gone up to the St. Nicholas, dined, and indulged somewhat freely in "Green Seal"
                  and other varieties of the liquid products of French vineyards and Jersey
                  cider-presses. One of the party had taken a different carriage from the others, at
                  the pier, promising to keep the appointment nearly as soon as his companions. He
                  had reached the hotel but a little while after them, in fact, but with quite time
                  enough elapsing to permit of a hurried visit to a mercantile house in a street
                  which the reader of this narration has before had occasion to enter. Man of
                  pleasure as was this passenger by the Persia, hurrying away from his enjoyments on
                  board that steamer, to other and wilder orgies on the land—he was yet a man of
                  business, and the ramifications of an extensive trade were to be looked after
                  before even the parting banquet could be enjoyed. The merchant shook hands with
                  Mr. Wales and nodded to one or two of the others, glanced hastily over half a
                  dozen letters especially kept for him by the gray-headed book-keeper, made
                  inquiries as to certain important operations, commended the position of a few
                  things and found fault with a corresponding number by way of keeping up the<pb
                     n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7282-00000179"/> necessary balance of discipline, and
                  then rolled away in his carriage—hurrying home to the embraces of his family, as
                  most or all of his subordinates believed; to the St. Nicholas and a species of
                  dissipation not very usual with him, in reality.</p>
               <p>The scope of this narration does not bring us within any close view of the
                  movements of the merchant during his few weeks of previous absence. Except in the
                  rare yet not impossible event of the loss of a steamer by fire or storm, there is
                  very little of mark in voyages by steam between two nations only separated by a
                  paltry three thousand miles. Things have changed materially since some of us, then
                  at adult age and even now only a little gray about the temples, confidently
                  prophesied that any attempt to traverse the ocean by steam must be a melancholy
                  failure. They have changed almost as much, in the staunchness and reliability of
                  those very steamers, since poor Power went away in the President and buried all
                  that wealth of Irish humor where so many other gems too bright for the world had
                  preceded it—"down with Wally, drownded, in the deep, deep sea!" as Burton used to
                  say with a pathos of drollery that made the eyes moist while the laugh was yet
                  rippling from the lips. They have changed again, and in another direction, since
                  the day when Collins directed a fleet of steamers unequalled in speed and
                  power—when America was at the head of the passenger-trade between New York and
                  Liverpool—and when the world fondly believed that she had wisdom and liberality
                  enough to hold fast what she had attained. The. Cunarder dwarfs and outstrips all
                  others, now, even when there is no war in the Western World to make an excuse for
                  the failure of our capital and the want of spirit of our merchants. They may
                  change again, some day, for better or for worse; as the whole communication of
                  intelligence between the two continents certainly will change when Cyrus W. Field
                  and his brother American blunderers, unwarned by the history of the past and the
                  omens of the present, have assisted in laying down once more, with the aid of
                  American capital, an Atlantic Telegraph Cable with both its ends on British soil,
                  and the only hope that it will not add to the consolidation of British power and
                  the consequent crippling of our own, lying in the chance that it may again refuse
                  to work, from its location in those regions of eternal aurora-borealis where air
                  and water necessarily conduct more electricity than land-wire or sea-cable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Charles Holt, merchant, had made a pleasant run over on the steamer, relieved
                  the burthened mind of Mr. Beverley Andrews, assisted him in some financial
                  arrangements just bold enough to be successful and just near enough to the verge
                  of being dishonorable to escape that reputation, made a terrible onslaught upon
                  those styles of goods which he felt would supply "his country's need," lounged a
                  couple of days at the "Crystal Palace, inspected a couple more of old castles that
                  he had happened to miss on previous visits and that lay very near London, heard
                  Tietjens for the first time and Sims Reeves for the fiftieth, and then made a
                  pleasant run back again, after blending the "utile" and the "dulce" something on
                  the principle of that thrifty young merchant who once went on his "wedding and
                  collecting tour." He had gone—he had transacted his business—he had returned, to
                  transact other business: so few words tell what might otherwise be made a long
                  story. And this brings us back once more to that popular caravanserai from which
                  we had wandered even beyond the reach of its tremendous dinner summons—the St.
                  Nicholas.</p>
               <p>It was some six o'clock when the party took their seats at the table in one of the
                  private parlors of that hotel; and it was about eight when the merchant, looking
                  at his watch, declared his inability to remain longer, because business of the
                  most pressing character demanded that he should look after it immediately. The
                  good steamer that had carried them safely over, the courteous Captain who
                  commanded her, America and England (the latter in compliment to two or three of
                  the guests who were of British birth), and each of the party by name, had all been
                  toasted meanwhile; and while there was not a member of the party who could be
                  spoken of as "drunk," in the vulgar acceptation of the word, there was not one but
                  had taken sufficient wine to fever his blood and destroy the cooler balance of his
                  judgment.</p>
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7282-00000180"/>
               <p>What with the still-sensible motion of the steamer and the effects of the wine he
                  had taken, Charles Holt, when he left the table amid the regrets of the party and
                  stepped down to the office of the hotel to order a carriage, was nearer tipsy than
                  he had before been for many a long day. And yet not tipsy—only heated,
                  exhilarated, and the cooler and more reliable nature of the man for the time held
                  under thrall by a power foreign to itself.</p>
               <p>At a little later than half-past eight the same evening, Sarah Sanderson was
                  descending the steps of Burtnett Haviland's little house on East Forty-eighth
                  Street, basket on arm, to make some late purchases at the baker's and the
                  groceryman's. Just as she reached the last step and descended to the side-walk,
                  she was confronted by the figure of a man who stopped full in front of her. For
                  the instant she did not recognize him—the next, as she caught a glimpse of his
                  face by the light of the street-lamp, she saw that it was the merchant.</p>
               <p>The false are always cowardly, and almost always superstitious. They are
                  themselves outrages upon nature, and believe all other outrages upon it to be
                  possible. For the moment, so suddenly had the merchant come upon her, and so
                  little had she dreamed of his being within thousands of miles of herself, the girl
                  was disposed to believe his appearance supernatural; and she barely escaped
                  uttering one of those screams of terror, ranging between a howl and a yell, which
                  are considered more forcible than agreeable, even by the ablest defenders of the
                  music of the human voice. A scream which might have perilled more than her
                  ill-regulated brain could then have imagined. She did not scream, however, for
                  before she could fairly modulate the sound, the voice of Charles Holt reassured
                  while it rated her, and she did not even drop her basket.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, you little fool?" it said. "You tremble, and seem ready to
                  scream! Do you think that I am a ghost?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, sir, I don't, <emph>now</emph>" said the girl, "but indeed you scared me
                  for a moment. I did not know you was back."</p>
               <p>"And I did not know it myself, until an hour or two ago," said the merchant.
                  "Never mind that, now. I came to-day. It is very lucky that I met you here. Come
                  this way—there may be some one listening around these stoops."</p>
               <p>A portion of both sides of Forty-eighth Street, between Second and Third Avenues,
                  and nearest the latter, was then unimproved ground, not even enclosed from the
                  street, and some of the lots scattered over with huge boulders of stone not yet
                  cleared away from the blasting that had taken place in the neighborhood. Few
                  persons passed up and down the broken sidewalk; and it was not easy to find a
                  better place for a conversation not intended to be overheard, than opposite the
                  vacant lots. The merchant's eye had scanned the fact, weeks before, and it was to
                  that place that he rather preceded than accompanied the servant-girl.</p>
               <p>"Now," he said when they had reached the spot, "I wish to know all that has taken
                  place since I have been absent. Did you obey my orders?"</p>
               <p>"Every one of them," was the answer.</p>
               <p>"How many letters has the post-man brought for Mrs. Haviland?—I mean letters from
                  her husband?"</p>
               <p>"None—not one."</p>
               <p>"You are sure?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I <emph>know</emph> he hasn't brought her any."</p>
               <p>"Humph! well, I rather thought he wouldn't, after the little conversation I had
                  with him!" said the merchant, his tone very much like a sneer. "And how many have
                  you allowed her to send <emph>him?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I don't think she has sent any, though she has written a good many," answered the
                  girl. "She always sent me with the letters, I guess, and I have kept them all.
                  Maybe she may have put one or two into the box herself—I think not, though. Lately
                  she does not write any, as she never receives any answers."</p>
               <p>"Hum! no, I suppose not!" commented the merchant. "Well, Sarah, you appear to be a
                  very good girl, so far. By the way, those letters are not safe for you to keep—let
                  me have them the first opportunity. Now tell me something more. Haw is your
                  mistress? Well?"</p>
               <p>"She's well enough," replied the girl, with something in her tone which implied
                  that she was even too well for her own<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7282-00000181"/>
                  individual fancy. "But she is a little mopey and peaked—she couldn't help being
                  that, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"No," said the merchant, "that is all natural enough. Been lonely, of course—poor
                  thing! Now that I am back again, she must not be left alone so much. She is alone
                  now, I suppose? And where were you going when I met you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I was going up to, the grocery and the baker's," said the young girl,
                  answering the last question first. "And she is alone—not a soul but herself and
                  the little girl in the whole house."</p>
               <p>"You mean in <emph>her</emph> part of it," said the merchant, recalling a thought
                  that had more than once crept into his head—what a bore it was that people could
                  not live in houses without other families under the same roof, and how—. But that
                  portion of his contemplation may be quite as well left unwritten.</p>
               <p>"No, I don't mean any thing of the kind!" said the girl, in reply. "She is
                     <emph>all</emph> alone—all but the little girl. You will find no oil-cloth in
                  the hall, when you go in, for the family that lived below moved out in the
                  country, on a farm, two or three weeks ago."</p>
               <p>Are there fiends who move beside us and stand at our elbows wherever we go, ready
                  to drop a temptation or a foul suggestion into the heart and the ear, at any
                  opportune moment—just as there certainly are ministering angels always beside us,
                  ready, whenever permitted, to whisper some suggestion of good and drop some seed
                  that may blossom for eternal life? Is there an Anteros to be worshipped as well as
                  an Eros, the one as a bribe to absent himself and be an innocuous enemy, as the
                  other is to be wooed and welcomed as a dear friend? And were the philosophical
                  heathens of old right after all, in this particular? Who knows? Certain it is that
                  some of us, when only a minor evil is in the heart, find temptation and
                  opportunity for one more damning, so often that the Tempter becomes a reality
                  instead of an abstraction; and even the saint upon his knees and the ministering
                  angel beside the couch sometimes have occasion to shriek out their prayer for
                  deliverance.</p>
               <p>Charles Holt stood silent for some moments after the girl had uttered the last
                  words. He could not have spoken, then, had his existence depended upon the effort.
                  More than forty years of life had done nothing to render him marble in feeling,
                  however they might have made him unyielding as that stone in heart and purpose. He
                  could yet thrill—enjoy—suffer. For a moment after the girl had ceased speaking,
                  one short sentence rang through his head with an hundred repetitions—so many
                  repetitions, that not one tenth part of the number could really have been made by
                  the voice within that space. "All alone—except the little girl" "All alone—except
                  the little girl!" "All alone—except the little girl!" The strong man trembled,
                  under the weight of that sudden and overwhelming temptation—to what, even he
                  scarcely knew himself. In one moment every thing had changed to him. Restraints he
                  had dreaded were removed as if by some infernal providence. Opportunities he had
                  never hoped for, sprang forth to meet him. The steamer had arrived at the right
                  moment. He had dined at the St. Nicholas at the right time, and taken carriage at
                  the very instant. There was a thrill in all his nerves—a choking in his throat—a
                  beating of heavy hammers at his temples. How much of this was wine and how much
                  the natural development of human passion, is a matter for the physiologists to
                  decide at their leisure.</p>
               <p>But the nerves calm more quickly, after forty and before the weakness of decay
                  comes on, than they do at twenty-five; and if resolutions are less quickly formed
                  they are formed with more steadiness. Whatever the surprise and whatever the
                  temptation, the one was overcome and the other accepted, before the girl, standing
                  in the dim shadows by the open lot, had time for more than a few heart-beats of
                  wonder at his sudden silence. When the merchant spoke again, his voice was
                  certainly hoarser than it had been before, as if he might have taken a chill even
                  in the warm summer air; but it was quite clear and steady.</p>
               <p>"You are going up to the grocery, you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; and to the baker's; and the baker will be shut up if I stand here much
                  longer."</p>
               <p>"Humph, well, Sarah, you can take your time and need<pb n="376-377"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000182"/> not hurry back to the house," said the merchant,
                  his tones equable as they could have been in directing the overlooking of an
                  invoice. "I am going down to chat with Mrs. Haviland awhile, and she will not miss
                  you, while <emph>I</emph> am there, if you run in to see some of the neighbor
                  girls and do not come back for an hour or even longer. Do you hear me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said the girl, "but Mrs. Haviland——" and she was going on to say that
                  some of the articles from the grocery might be wanted, when the voice of the
                  merchant, hoarse as before but much sharper, interrupted her.</p>
               <p>"I asked you if you heard what I said, and you answered 'Yes.' That is enough. Now
                  obey my orders without question. It is now nearly nine," pulling out his watch and
                  deciphering the hour even in the dim light. "Go and do your errands. At ten
                  o'clock—not a moment before—come back to the house. Do you hear me this time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," answered the girl, her voice lower, more broken, and as if frightened.
                  How nearly she understood the man, only the overwatching intelligences can say.
                  That she understood something, and was a little frightened thereat, was but too
                  evident.</p>
               <p>"You know <emph>me,</emph>" continued the tempter, now become the master, "and you
                  know that I can ruin you the moment I choose. Here is something more to buy
                  ribbons—that proves that I can be a good friend to you when you obey me," and the
                  girl felt that he dropped a heavy golden double-eagle into her fingers. "Disobey
                  me, and you will very soon know the consequences. By ten o'clock I shall be done
                  chatting with Mrs. Haviland, and you may come back. Now go and do your errands,
                  and then pay your visits."</p>
               <p>His voice had lost all its severity of a moment before, and seemed almost playful.
                  If there was any perception of his true meaning in the mind of Sarah Sanderson,
                  and if she had one spark of feeling left for the honor and reputation of the woman
                  she at once served and hated—that change in tone somewhat reassured her. She
                  turned away without another word, and went towards Third Avenue with her basket,
                  while the merchant, watching her disappearing form for a moment, then retraced his
                  steps down the street to the door of the house he had before approached.</p>
               <p>The door was closed, and he rang the bell. It is doubtful whether that singular,
                  bold, bad man, who had passed through so many varied scenes and enjoyed so many
                  triumphs as well as suffered so many agonies—had ever before rung the bell for
                  admission to any house, with precisely the same course of reflection while waiting
                  for the answer to the summons.</p>
               <p>Two or three minutes—they seemed many more to Charles Holt—and then a light foot
                  descended the stair and the door opened. Mary Haviland stood once more before the
                  man who had, without her knowledge, exercised so controlling a power over her
                  destiny, and who seemed likely to sway it still further—where, heaven only knew!
                  She recognized him at once, even in the dim light that came down from the landing;
                  and when he said: "Mrs. Haviland!—Mary!" and held out both his hands to her, it
                  was with something very like a cry of joy that she rather flung than put both
                  those small hands into his grasp. And when she said, in response to his words:
                  "Mr. Holt—I am very, very glad to see you!" she told nothing more than the truth,
                  and her eyes, which the merchant saw had grown sadder and larger than he had known
                  them a few weeks earlier, seemed to light up with joy that could not be
                  controlled.</p>
               <p>For just one instant that confidence and trust touched the man of the world; but
                  it was only for one instant. The next, that subtle flattery fell upon other and
                  more dangerous senses, and the demigod became the fiend! She thought of the bare
                  appearance of the hall, without oil-cloth or any covering to the floor, and
                  apologized for it in the simple words: "You must excuse the looks of our hall
                  floor—laying down the oil-cloth here belongs to the people who occupy the lower
                  story, and they have moved away suddenly and left it as you see!" and those very
                  words recalled the haunting sentence: "All alone—except the little girl!" No, he
                  did <emph>not</emph> relent: had he <emph>ever</emph> relented, or been foiled in
                  any purpose of his will? Never!—and it was scarcely time, then, to begin!</p>
               <p>Hark! there came the very echo to his thought! Never woman spoke words with less
                  of improper meaning than her<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7282-00000183"/> gentle:
                  "We are all alone—little Pet and I. Sarah has gone out. Come up-stairs!" but they
                  fell upon the ears of that man—God forgive him!—almost as an invitation to pursue
                  his schemes of lawless love! There are men (aye, and women!) who see
                  voluptuousness in the marble and catch libidinous sensations from the very songs
                  of birds. They are coarse, material Bjorns standing beside the Frithiofs of love
                  and devotion, and seeing in Ingeborg the Fair only a woman to be torn shrieking
                  away from her husband's side, while the Viking beholds her as something holier
                  than mortal flesh, to be worshipped afar off with a purer flame than that which
                  once burned in the temple of Balder. And of them and of all such let the solemn
                  invocation be uttered once more—God pity and help them! For they lack all that
                  makes earth beautiful and heaven possible.</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland turned to lead the way up-stairs. There was a small table standing
                  at the foot, where the hat-rack of the departed family had stood so lately, and
                  Charles Holt laid down his hat upon it. As he did so, though the light was very
                  dim, he caught the glitter of the brass key on the inside of the door, Then,
                  another thought perhaps, and perhaps merely the carrying out of one before
                  harbored. It was but a turn of the head, quick as lightning, to see that the young
                  wife was going steadily up the stair, with her back towards him,—and then a turn
                  of the wrist, almost as quick, but steady and careful, so that not even a click
                  should be heard. It was done—the merchant was alone in the house with the woman
                  whom he had marked as his victim—alone except as to the little child that lay
                  cradled in sleep—alone, and with the door locked, so that none—not even Sarah with
                  her pass-key—could enter from without!</p>
               <p>There was no light, or a very dim one, in the back-room. In the front, one burner
                  of the small chandelier was ablaze; affording sufficient light for the unromantic
                  task of "mending" upon which the young wife had been engaged before disturbed, and
                  proving (by the care taken not to waste the illuminating vapor) that the gas-bills
                  were habitually paid on call!</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland set a chair for her visitor, very near where her own remained, and
                  resumed her seat as well as her work; while perhaps it may be said the merchant
                  resumed his! He had, for the first time, an opportunity to scan the countenance of
                  the young wife closely, and to see the inroads which disappointment and anxiety
                  had been making upon it. It was so much thinner, and the eyes looked so large and
                  mournful, while something like a quiver, born of many tears, played continually
                  around the mouth. But the blonde hair seemed brighter than ever; the beauty of the
                  young wife had not been of that fragile order incapable of bearing the least
                  depletion; and it may be said that she was more winningly—more meltingly—beautiful
                  than ever before. If the heart of the merchant for one moment smote him in the
                  knowledge that more than half the shadows on that fair face had been of his
                  setting, other and less creditable feelings, promoted no doubt by the fiery wines
                  he had so lately been drinking, surged upwards and drowned all impulses of
                  mercy.</p>
               <p>But this man was a man of business, always—as has before been remarked. There was
                  not a joy so dear or an agony so acute that in the midst of it he could not count
                  dollars and cents! He had ascertained, at the store, that the salary of the clerk
                  had not been paid for the past week; and after the first commonplaces he drew from
                  his pocket a little roll of bills and handed them to the wife, who nodded her
                  thanks and dropped them into her pocket with the tiniest of charming blushes for
                  the moment lighting up a face that had become almost too fair if not pale. Then
                  the recollection of the service for which the money was paid, and that total
                  separation from her husband which she could neither explain nor understand, came
                  suddenly over her, her work fell upon her lap, she dropped her head forward, and
                  the merchant could see that two or three bright tears trickled away from her eyes
                  and gemmed her cheeks. Mary Haviland could not conceal feeling as she had done
                  before her husband's departure!—who <emph>can</emph> be as strong after a month of
                  fever and exhaustion, as when the system is healthy and the veins bounding with
                  life?</p>
               <p>The merchant drew his chair close to that of the unhappy woman—drew it up so
                  quickly that she perhaps did not know of the movement. The next instant he had
                  both her<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7282-00000184"/> hands in his and was leaning
                  over close to her. She made no effort to withdraw her hands, and the tempter was
                  even deceived if she did not faintly return his warm pressure. An instant more,
                  and he had dropped upon one knee at the side of her chair, thrown his left arm
                  around her shoulder and drawn her over to him. Even this movement was not
                  resisted, and the fair head fell upon his shoulder as if the neck had long been
                  aching with the effort to support it. "Mary!" said the merchant, his voice so
                  expressive of sympathy and affection that it might have won a less yielding woman
                  than Mary Haviland; and at the same instant his head bent, forward to the face
                  that lay half upturned to the light, and his lips glued themselves to those which
                  should have been so sacred against such a touch.</p>
               <p>"No—you had better not kiss me," once said a lady in a particular presence, the
                  words rippling from her tempting mouth in a musical burst that was half laughter.
                  "Those who kiss me have a bad habit of never forgetting the touch of my lips!" The
                  man who was warned did not heed—he persisted in his opportunity—and as a result,
                  from that moment there grew a thrill upon his memory that not even changing years,
                  gray hairs, pain, toil and suffering could ever take away. In that one touch he
                  read the secret of all the thraldoms held over strong men by weak woman—by
                  Semiramis over Ninus, by Cleopatra over Antony, by Rosamond over Henry of England,
                  by Gabrielle over the Conqueror of the League, by Castlemaine over the Merry
                  Monarch, by Montespan over Louis, by—(let us bring down the comparison to our own
                  times)—by Mrs. Howard over the husband of Eugenie. Ever after he carried about
                  with him a recollection which enslaved him to one as it emancipated him from all
                  others. Had those lips been evil, he would have been ruined from that instant: as
                  they were pure in every pulse that beat beneath them, and fragrant in every breath
                  that issued through gates of pearl to those crimson portals, they only opened to
                  him a new life whose duration ended with the beginning of the life beyond.</p>
               <p>This is the story, briefly told, of the witchery of the lips. If their touch is
                  thus madness when only purity and goodness dictate the pressure, what indeed must
                  it be when the pulses are running riot with passion and all the better angels of
                  our nature have veiled their eyes from the spectacle of the man turned for the
                  moment to the demon! Whatever may have been the thoughts and intentions of Charles
                  Holt the instant before, the touch of those marvellous lips maddened him as a
                  dozen additional bottles of wine might have failed to do—removed every
                  restraint—broke down every barrier—and made him a fiend to be wrestled and prayed
                  against with all the failing energies of poor human nature.</p>
               <p>In one instant he had flung his arms around the waist of the young wife; his
                  sacrilegious hands gathered her close to him without any regard to the propriety
                  of his touch; his lips devoured hers with burning kisses that dropped thickly as
                  sparks from some great conflagration and seemed to blister where they fell; and
                  his tongue, even between those most unholy and enforced caresses, uttered words of
                  miscalled love so reckless and dangerous that no ear could misunderstand them.</p>
               <p>"Mary! Mary! My own Mary! How I have waited for this moment! I have loved you—I
                  love you, deeply, fondly—as I never before have loved woman in all my life! You
                  love <emph>me,</emph> I know that you do! You are mine!—you <emph>must</emph> be
                  mine—body, soul and spirit! Come here—closer—you are all mine, and there is no
                  power under heaven that can take you out of my arms!"</p>
               <p>Great heaven!—what was this revelation to Mary Haviland?—She who had up to that
                  moment no more dreamed of bestowing upon him a love more intense than that she
                  could have borne a father of brother, than she had of plunging body and soul into
                  eternal perdition! She who night have been, and no doubt <emph>had</emph> been,
                  imprudent—first in her gratitude towards him, on account of her husband, and again
                  through her loneliness, the great difference in their ages, and that ignorance of
                  the nature of unholy passion which was a part of her very being! She who might
                  have acted as if centering an unholy love around that man, but who had all the
                  while never dreamed of any thing more than friendship and protection! What were
                  the sensations of that spotless wife, the<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7282-00000185"
                  /> doubtful past all illumined as by a lightning flash, and the whole horrible
                  precipice on which she had been standing made too revoltingly plain? What did she
                  suffer in those few moments, clasped in the arms of that hot-blooded,
                  fierce-tempered man, his kisses raining upon her lips and cheeks, his physical
                  power enchaining her, and his words stunning her ears while his fiery and
                  blood-shot eyes literally devoured her face? Not even her broken and agonized
                  words could give any indication of the terrible fear and horror that oppressed
                  her; for words are sometimes powerless, and they are almost always so when they
                  should carry the force of the thunder.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Holt! oh sir! Shame! Shame! Oh, do let me go! Please let me go! You
                  frighten me! You suffocate me! My God!—my husband! Oh, sir! you forget that I am a
                  wife! Do let me go! Please let me go!"</p>
               <p>No response, except that clasp tightening yet more closely, the hands more
                  reckless, and the words more and more fearful. Then a horrible culmination of fear
                  took possession of the outraged wife, and the strength that madness gives, came to
                  her relief. Came to her relief too, at the very moment when the past delirium for
                  an instant weakened her tempter and the stiffened nerves relaxed. By an almost
                  superhuman effort she released herself and flung him off, springing to her feet,
                  and dealing him, as she did so, a blow of some force, merely by accident and
                  without the least intention of resisting violence by violence in that manner. The
                  merchant was on his feet at the same instant, and his eyes glared upon her with
                  the passion of rage that the apparently-intentional blow had engendered, blended
                  with the fierce energy of will that had only become more violent from resistance.
                  She could see that the human tiger was fairly aroused—all the bad passions in
                  play—all the advantage on his side. Man against woman; reckless strength and long
                  experience against weakness and innocence; wealth, that always compels what it
                  cannot buy, and habitually makes merchandize of the feelings and the honor of
                  poverty—against that poverty in its most helpless form; all overbalancing against
                  her—not one hope that was not crushed down by a deadly fear!</p>
               <p>At this stage of the narration, it becomes a matter of regret gret that this story
                  is not a melo-drama—only a relation of the actual life of to-day. A little change
                  in time and place would so smooth away the difficulties! How easily, in the
                  melo-drama aforesaid or the novel of the intense school upon which it is founded,
                  the heroine can always pick up or have conveniently about her those little
                  articles necessary for her rescue! It is always so convenient, in either of the
                  walks of "litter-ature" just named, for the Lady Isolinda, borne away from her
                  sheltering bower by the demoniac Lord of Noirdiable, immured in his lonely tower
                  and visited by the tyrant baron at midnight with the basest intentions, just as he
                  lays hand upon her, to break out with a "Ha! ha!—villian, you are foiled!" and
                  present full at his breast a horse-pistol of such dimensions that it could not be
                  conveniently carried even under modern crinoline—thus holding him at bay till the
                  walls of the tower can be battered down, precisely at the right moment, by two
                  men, three women and a boy, headed by her true lover, the young Knight of
                  Silvergilt, who was a thousand miles away only a few minutes previous, but has
                  annihilated space as easily as probability,—and the rescue duly accomplished! And
                  what difficulty has lovely Susan, the cottager's daughter, in finding a
                  table-knife of athletic proportions, lying loosely around, ready to catch up and
                  give the corresponding threat against his life or her own, when De Hirsute, the
                  whiskered town villain, makes his deadly onslaught upon her fair fame, down in the
                  meadow, out in the summer-house, or anywhere else that may be most convenient for
                  the story? Alas!—real life has its, limitations, and the nineteenth century is
                  peculiarly <emph>exigeant.</emph> Mary Haviland should have been provided with a
                  six-shooter or at least a big jack-knife, to make the narrative run smoothly; but
                  the poor little woman would really have been a good deal worse scared at such a
                  thing, had she possessed the first, than any person at whom she pointed it; and
                  there is really no way of accounting for the presence of a big knife in the room,
                  seeing that the time was too early in the season for the peeling of apples or
                  peaches. Her scissors, even had she thought of them, were not large enough to
                  supply a dagger of very dangerous proportions; and besides, the more formidable of
                     the<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7282-00000186"/> two points might have been
                  broken off by Pet a day or two before, in an effort at Archimedean leverage
                  between two slabs of the chimney-piece, and Sarah failed to signal a "grinder." So
                  there is really nothing left for it, but to fall back upon the solemn, sombre
                  reality of a poor little woman in terrible peril, with no means of defence and
                  apparently none of escape.</p>
               <p>We left the two, a moment since, confronting each other. It was but a moment that
                  the pause endured. In the next, the hand of Charles Holt was laid upon the young
                  wife's wrist, and he spoke two words in a tone that he strove to render something
                  other than fierce, and yet one terribly decided:</p>
               <p>"Come here!"</p>
               <p>There was not strength enough in Mary Haviland, and she knew it, to resist his
                  drawing her towards him; but there was yet strength, as she believed, in prayers
                  and tears, and she burst into an agony of sobs, as she uttered:—</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't! Please don't! Don't hurt me, please don't! For God's sake, Mr. Holt,
                  please let me go!"</p>
               <p>Alas, once more! Her soft blonde hair had become partially dishevelled during the
                  first struggle, and fell bewitchingly over the rounded and dimpled shoulders left
                  partially uncovered in the freedom of her summer-evening dress. There was enough
                  even in the charms revealed, to excite colder and purer men than Charles Holt:
                  there was enough to make him nearer mad than ever. Even the tears softened and
                  added to the attraction of the pleading face; and the ripe lips really trembling
                  in fear and agony, quivered an ungovernable feeling into the human animal.</p>
               <p>"I have told you, Mary Haviland," said the merchant—and his voice was steady, firm
                  and threatening—"that I will never let you go until you are mine! I love
                  you—deeply and devotedly. You love <emph>me,</emph> though you dare not own it.
                  Your husband has deserted you—you have no choice but to accept my love and
                  protection."</p>
               <p>Again that low, broken answer—"Please let me go!" Suddenly a new thought of hope
                  struck the young wife, and she gave utterance to it at once. "Oh, Mr. Holt, you do
                  not know to what danger you are subjecting me—and yourself. Sarah has only gone
                  out for a few minutes: she may come back at any moment, and then we should both be
                  ruined."</p>
               <p>"Not yet!" said the merchant, triumphantly, his hand still around her wrist.
                  "Sarah has gone to the grocery and the baker's, and I have ordered her not to come
                  back until ten—more than three-quarters of an hour, yet."</p>
               <p>"You have seen her?—<emph>you</emph> ordered her? Oh, my God!" and the cry was one
                  of heart-breaking agony. The moment before, the young wife had caught one
                  lightning glance at mysteries before dark and hidden. Now she caught another and
                  scarcely less terrible. She had seen the merchant chatting aside with Sarah, when
                  he supposed himself unnoticed, before he went to England. She had thought nothing
                  of the circumstance then—but now! Little Pet had seen him giving the girl money,
                  and he had taken so much pains to turn off the conversation at the table. It
                     <emph>had</emph> been "yellow money," gold, as the child said, after all. Sarah
                  Sanderson was a suborned tool of the merchant, and her enemy! She had obeyed his
                  orders and left her mistress to be destroyed! Putting aside the peril of the
                  present moment, she was deserted and alone—had not one friend left in the city!
                  Father of the innocent!—what <emph>should</emph> she do?</p>
               <p>Once before this time Mary Haviland has been seen in a position to develop
                  extraordinary strength of will—when she crushed down her tears and her regrets and
                  allowed her husband to believe her cheerful when he went away. Since that time she
                  has been seen as showing no marked energy, but at times absolute weakness.
                  Something of the causes of that blending of strength and weakness, may have been
                  found in her paternal blood of the Howlands of New England, used to fighting the
                  descendants of Moby Dick on the far Pacific, where nerve and readiness were
                  life,—and in the soft, calm, yielding blood of her mother's Quaker family. It was
                  her first great peril, and under its very imminence thought and determination rose
                  to meet it—determination in despair and blindness of body and soul, but yet quick,
                  active and efficient. One moment more of agony formed her resolution, and a half
                  moment more began to put it into action.</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7282-00000187"/>
               <p>Charles Holt, the merchant, had no doubt been surprised a great many times in his
                  life, but it is doubtful whether the greatest of all those surprises did not fall
                  upon him at that time. For as he still held the wrist of the young wife and
                  repeated the commanding words: "Come here!" she turned, literally threw herself
                  into his arms, clasped her own around his body, glued her lips to his face and
                  covered it with passionate kisses! Could the man believe his senses? Still
                  more—could he believe his ears the next moment? The woman was actually laughing as
                  she clung to him with really shameless familiarity, and her words were:</p>
               <p>"Love me, do you, Charley Holt? Well, I wonder if this farce has not been played
                  far enough! Why don't you kiss me? You are not half a lover!"</p>
               <p>Actually the man was so surprised that he recoiled. It is very possible that for
                  that one moment the suspicion struck him that this woman was one of the most
                  consummate actresses in the world—not only a false but a shameless wife, who had
                  "played him" (to use an expression that the fishermen, if not the politicians,
                  will understand) in the disguise of a pure modesty, and that instead of being the
                  winner he was really the victim! A man of decidedly exclusive tendencies,
                  especially in his vices, that would not have suited his mental calculation by any
                  means. He could defy heaven and beard the fiends, to win what could not be won by
                  others and should not have been by himself; but what any other could win, however
                  precious, was chaff before his breath and dust under his feet. Yes, it must be
                  said that at "Charley Holt?" and the flippant use of the word "lover," that bold,
                  bad man actually recoiled. He could not utter a word. The tempted, now apparently
                  become the temptress, went on, still laughing, and there was not keenness enough
                  in the brain yet a little affected by the fumes of the wine, to know how
                  hysterical that laughter really was:</p>
               <p>"Why, what a sober face you have, all at once! Don't you love me, after all? I
                  never saw such a man as you are, in all my life!" and half a dozen more kisses
                  rained upon his face.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, and before the merchant had yet spoken, she drew away from him, went to
                  the door leading out into the hall (the other was shut already) closed it and
                  turned the key! After that movement, the lover so suddenly outrun in the course of
                  his calculations scarcely needed her "Pray, sit down, and excuse me a moment!" to
                  induce him to drop into the chair from which he had lately risen, and wait the
                  next proceeding of this singular creature. He followed her with his eyes, as with
                  a familiar nod and a smile she passed through the half-opened door into the little
                  bed-room adjoining, and there for the moment disappeared from his sight, the door
                  still retaining its half-open position. He never saw her again, after the folds of
                  her soft evening-dress disappeared behind the bed-room door. He will never see her
                  again, until that great assemblage of all ages and all nations, for whose trumpet
                  summons the reverent ear unconsciously keeps listening over all the noise of the
                  street, the chorus of the opera, the hum of busy voices, the great commingled
                  shout of human joy and the still greater aggregate moan of human sorrow!</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland passed into that little bed-room, every nerve one shudder of
                  excitement and her physical and her mental systems both so overtasked that she was
                  on the point of falling in a dead faint on the floor,—reached over into her bed
                  and caught up the little girl that lay slumbering there; opened the door that led
                  from the bed-room into the hall, with such careful fingers that the slight click
                  of the latch did not sound above the painful catching of her breath and the wild
                  beating of her heart; descended the stair so softly that if there was even a creak
                  it did not reach to the ear of the watcher in the room above; laid her hand upon
                  the street-door, started with fear when she found it locked and with joy when she
                  saw the glitter of the key; unlocked it, opened it, went out, closed it again,
                  with the same careful hand; and all unbonneted as she was, with no mantle, her
                  thin slippers, and her unbound hair streaming about her shoulders—but with the
                  child which seemed all that was left to her in the world, still sleeping
                  peacefully in her arms,—fled away into the night!</p>
               <p>For perhaps five minutes the merchant retained his position in the chair, waiting
                  for the return of the woman who had so puzzled him. Then, hearing no rustle within
                  and anxious to<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7282-00000188"/> solve the mystery in one
                  way or another, he rose and went to the door. He looked in. The door into the hall
                  was nearly wide open, and the light from the burner at the head of the stairs
                  streamed into the room. There was no one there! He went to the bed, of which the
                  light covering was turned down, and for some unexplainable reason felt within it.
                  In the middle his hand encountered a warm spot—the nest out of which the little
                  bird had just been taken. He said nothing, but set his teeth hard and passed along
                  the hall into the back-room. No one there. Then he descended the stairs and laid
                  his hand on the street door. It opened at once, without any aid of the key. He saw
                  it all. The door had been unlocked—the woman was gone!</p>
               <p>It may be incorrect to say that the merchant "saw it all" It might have been a
                  puzzling study to see "all" of that singular adventure. But he saw enough. Only
                  one exclamation escaped his lips, as he took his hat from the little table, put it
                  on his head and left the house with that peculiar slam of the door which does not
                  indicate the possession of an equable temper. That exclamation was, slurring a
                  little gross profanity:</p>
               <p>"Tricked at last, by all that is outrageous!"</p>
               <p>The little house on East Forty-eighth Street was at last truly "alone." Without a
                  great deal of concert among the members, it is true, another family had "moved
                  away."</p>
               <p>Perhaps fifteen minutes after the departure of the merchant, Sarah Sanderson, who
                  had been spending the allotted time in gossip with some of her companions in one
                  of the neighboring basements, returned to the house and admitted herself with the
                  pass-key, a little doubtful, all the while, whether the influence of the merchant
                  would be quite sufficient to save her from the scolding she had deserved by
                  disobedience. She found the light burning, but no one in the house, and when she
                  had called "Mrs. Haviland!" and ejaclated, "Where <emph>can</emph> she be?" to her
                  satisfaction, she explored the bedroom. Little Pet was gone, as well
                     <emph>as</emph> her mother; and from the moment of making that discovery the
                  girl was struck dumb with horror. She, too, "saw it all," or thought that she did!
                  Mrs. Haviland had eloped with Mr, Holt, or been carried off by him—there could be
                  no doubt of it. And Sarah Sanderson, hardened as she had been by the defects of
                  her early education and the wrongs she had already committed against her mistress,
                  was not yet so totally lost as not to feel some upbraidings of conscience and some
                  terrors for the future. What would be the end of all this? This she asked herself,
                  sitting dumb and stupid in the room that Mrs. Haviland had so lately deserted, and
                  listening, far into the night, to hear if there should not be some noise at the
                  door or some other symptoms of her returning. No sound whatever; and as the summer
                  night wore on, the poor girl became so frightened that she dared not go to bed,
                  but fell uneasily asleep in her chair dreaming that her betrayed mistress was
                  being dragged screaming away by three men with masks over their faces, while a
                  fourth, who looked like Burtnett Haviland, was pelting her (Sarah) with
                  paving-stones. One at last hit her on the side of the head, and she awoke to find
                  that it was daylight, the gas still burning, and that she had fallen over out of
                  the chair and struck her head against the pommel of another standing near.</p>
               <p>Around the house, after daylight, the girl staggered like one in a dream. She was
                  not more frightened and worried, than stunned. It seemed to her that all the world
                  had turned topsy-turvy in a night, and that every one must fall off into thin air.
                  If she had sinned, terribly was she suffering at that moment, however a little
                  time might reconcile her to all her past deeds and all their future consequences.
                  She called "Mrs. Haviland!" again, from garret to cellar, and looked under the
                  beds. All that she discovered, in this search, was that the young wife had taken
                  nothing from the house except the clothes in which she sat—not a bonnet, shawl,
                  and not even a cent of the few dollars in money that had been lying in a little
                  pocket-book in one of the cupboards. She did not know (perhaps Mary Haviland
                     <emph>did,</emph> and thought of it before she left the house) that the
                  merchant had paid her the past week's salary of her husband, and that she had it
                  in her pocket at the time of flight. If not with Mr. Holt, then, she must have
                  gone away penniless; and that fact proved, more conclusively than any other, that
                  she had fled with the merchant<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7282-00000189"/> chant.
                  Stop!—there was one fact yet more conclusive—the merchant had told her, weeks
                  before, that if she would obey his orders, Mrs. Haviland should soon be "out of
                  her way"; and after that what question could remain?</p>
               <p>At last this loneliness and fear became unendurable. The girl well knew the street
                  and number of the Fullerton house, where Kate resided—though she had never been
                  there. By ten o'clock that morning, as a consequence, Kate Haviland was informed
                  by one of the servants that a girl was waiting below to see her. She went down,
                  and found Sarah Sanderson in that state of mind and body that might have been
                  expected—very confused in the one, shaky in the other. A few words revealed the
                  story which the girl came to tell, and in which she by no means told all the truth
                  (that part, especially, which concerned her enforced absence from the house). She
                  had gone to the grocery, she said—met Mr. Charles Holt, who told her he was going
                  down to the house—had been absent between a half and three-quarters of an hour—and
                  when she came back, had found the house deserted and all those evidences of a
                  sudden flight.</p>
               <p>Bonnie Kate Haviland was "bonnie" no longer for that moment. She looked "wolfish,"
                  to use a Westernism. She had believed some unpleasant things of her cousin's wife;
                  but this—elopement and final ruin—this was too much! Seducer or seduced (as she
                  believed them) would have fared badly in her hands at that moment, little and
                  dainty as they were.</p>
               <p>Ten minutes afterwards the young girl had her gipsy flat on her head and was
                  accompanying Sarah Sanderson up to Forty-eighth Street. There was still no one
                  within the house, nor could any indication be found to discredit the belief of
                  Sarah that Mary Haviland had eloped with the merchant—fleeing with that suddenness
                  to prevent being caught by the girl on her return.</p>
               <p>By that afternoon's mail another letter from Kate Haviland to her cousin Burtnett,
                  written on Mary's little writing-case in her own parlor, and upon paper that the
                  young wife had specially designed for keeping up correspondence with him,—left the
                  city for Alexandria or wherever the Fire Zouaves should be "on service." What that
                  letter contained, in the then prevailing state of mind of the young teacher, may
                  be easily imagined. It told Burtnett Haviland that the night before, beyond doubt
                  or hope, his wife had abandoned her home at a moment's notice and eloped with the
                  merchant, his former employer!</p>
               <p>Three things more must be said before the close of this chapter. One, that Sarah
                  Sanderson, at Kate's suggestion, though with many fears and quakings, remained in
                  the abandoned house, to "see what would turn up," using the money left behind by
                  her mistress, to purchase what food was necessary for her very small family. The
                  second, that Charles Holt, whether already for the time sick of a city where such
                  disappointments as his own could be met with, or with some business connected with
                  his "shoddy" operations to transact at Washington, left New York for the Capital
                  on Wednesday morning the 17th. The third, that Kate Haviland, after her researches
                  at the house on Forty-eighth Street and her arrangements for the subsistence of
                  Sarah Sanderson, went back to Mrs. Fullerton's and the care of those seraphs, Myra
                  and Mildred, with an indefinite impression floating about beneath her chestnut
                  hair, that all men were scoundrels, that all women were fools, and that if any of
                  the male sex ever tried tricks of that character upon <emph>her,</emph> they would
                  be very likely to have a good time of it!</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE history of the battle of Bull Run has never yet been so related as to clear
                  away much of the mystery at first surrounding it and make the world fully aware
                  why and how that thunderbolt of national disaster fell out of an apparently
                  cloudless sky—how it was brought on, and fought, and won, and lost. The cause of
                  truth might be subserved, did space permit the writer fully to avail himself of
                  the copious materials furnished,<ref rend="super" target="#note_033"
                     xml:id="return_033">*</ref>
                   and to narrate with that particularity which trenches upon the province of
                  the historian, the story of that battle which has so much influenced the national
                  cause at home, and so affected our name in arms abroad. The limits, however, of
                  this story, now necessarily approaching its conclusion, render impossible any
                  thing more than a brief and rapid recapitulation of leading events and movements
                  connected with that battle, while so much is necessary as a part of the history of
                  the time, as well as from the influence produced on the fortunes of leading
                  characters in the narration, by the closing events of the conflict. And in this
                  hasty review of the battle, it must be understood that only the corpsmovements of
                  the <emph>Union</emph> troops can be given, while the rebels are more or less
                  dealt with as a formidable Aggregate.</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_033">*</ref>By Lieut. William H. White, the desultory but graphic historian of the
                     Mexican War, unquestionably the closest and most capable student of all the
                     battles of the War for the Union, from its commencement, and to whom the
                     writer has before had the happiness of avowing his obligations for the
                     materials of the description of the battle of Malvern Hill, in the previous
                     volume of this series—"Shoulder-Straps." Mr. White is not to be either
                     credited or held responsible for the operations of the Fire Zouaves, in
                     their formation, campaign, before, during and after the battle—the data for
                     the movements of that corps, during all its career, being derived from
                     personal observation, from the journals and letters of "A. O. A.," who went
                     down with the regiment as a fighting newspaper-correspondent in the interest
                     of the Fire Department, was captured at Bull Run and kept for ten months a
                     prisoner at Richmond, Charleston and elsewhere,—and from the relations of
                     officers and members of the Zouave and other regiments.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"On to Richmond!" was the cry. The seat of the rebel government had been removed
                  to Richmond from Montgomery, and the belief then existed—<emph>first,</emph> that
                  Richmond could easily be taken;—<emph>second,</emph> that to take Richmond and
                  capture the rebel President and Cabinet, would close the secession. The second of
                  these opinions is still retained when nearly three years have passed since the
                  first effort; the first is as fresh as ever in the public mind, when some hundreds
                  of thousands of lives have been sacrificed on the road and some dozens of the most
                  gallant reputations in the nation sent to keep them company.</p>
               <p>Secretary Seward had predicted that the war would be over in three months.
                  Beginning in April, the three months ended in July. What was called a mighty army
                  lay in and around Washington, and extensive fortifications stretched
                  south-westward over Arlington Heights into Virginia. From the beginning the power
                  and determination of the rebels had been underrated, and in spite of the fact that
                  nearly or quite two thousand cannon and more than two hundred thousand stand of
                  arms had fallen into their hands by theft and capture, they were said to have "no
                  weapons." Scott, noble, glorious, but broken down and superannuated, sat in his
                  easy-chair at his headquarters in Washington, tapped the maps on the wall with his
                  cane and scolded the young officers. Only once in a long period was he even able
                  to ride out to the field in his carriage and overlook a few of the more important
                  evolutions. Yet he "commanded." McDowell commanded under him, doing what he could
                  to form an army out of raw materials, but, as an old army officer, painfully aware
                  that no army had as yet been formed, though one of the finest in the world might
                  still grow up in the near future.</p>
               <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7282-00000191"/>
               <p>But "On to Richmond!" was the cry. Congress, not doing mischief enough otherwise,
                  bellowed it, and the country took up the cry. The radicals, who felt that some
                  share of the responsibility of the struggle rested upon them, insisted upon it;
                  and the conservatives, who felt that the struggle could not close too soon,
                  acknowledged the justice of the demand. McDowell was not ready, but he must "go
                  ahead." He has not been the last man, in the Union service, hounded on at the
                  wrong time and under suicidal circumstances—then abused and underrated for
                  failure. But enough of this, and quite enough to recall to recollection what so
                  many well remember when reminded.</p>
               <p>Brigadier General Irwin McDowell had a "grand army"—so the journals designated it,
                  and so the people spoke of it. In numbers it was really formidable as compared
                  with any body of troops that had before assembled on this continent; and Gov.
                  Andrew's happy phrase for it, of "an aggregation of town meetings" (to which
                  allusion may before have been made) had not yet been applied. But even in numbers
                  it was contemptible, as compared with the force that subsequent events showed to
                  be needed, and as contrasted with the hordes that sprung up on either side, when
                  it had been destroyed, and sown in the Virginian furrows after the manner of the
                  dragon's teeth. Let us for one moment, before examining what was done by this
                  force, glance at its numbers and composition, when it took up its line of march
                  from Arlington Heights and the various encampments around Washington, at 3 P.M.,
                  on Tuesday, the 10th of July, 1861, to sweep away the army of the rebel
                  Beauregard, and "put an early close to the secession."</p>
               <p>At that early day a "division" was the largest command in the service, "<foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">corps d'armee</foreign>" (since better known among the rough
                  wits as "<hi rend="i"/>corps dammee") not having yet come into use in the United
                  States armies. The Army of the Potomac was made up of five of those divisions,
                  each, with the exception of the fourth (or "reserve") composed of two or more
                  brigades. The reserve was not subdivided into brigades, but held in one entire
                  command. There were in all, eleven brigades. Of cavalry there were eight
                  companies, all regulars. There were twelve regiments of three-months militia,
                  thirty-six of Volunteers from the various States, one battalion of marines and
                  another of foot regulars—composing the infantry force. The artillery consisted of
                  fifty-five pieces, light and heavy, divided into eleven batteries and one section
                  of two pieces attached to the New York Seventy-first. One of these batteries, of
                  six pieces, belonging to the Eighth New York, was thrown out of service the day
                  before the battle, by the expiration of the term of service of the members, and
                  marched away at that awkward moment, giving rise to a piquant charge which will
                  not soon be forgotten, of their having "marched to the rear to the sound of the
                  enemy's guns." The whole force of artillery remaining was therefore forty-nine
                  pieces of all calibres, twenty-eight being rifled. The batteries were fully horsed
                  and equipped, but the section accompanying the Seventy-first was drawn by
                  drag-ropes manned by detachments from that regiment.</p>
               <p>The men, armament and horses of the "grand army" may be summed up briefly thus:
                  thirty-three thousand five hundred infantry, one thousand artillery and five
                  hundred cavalry: thirty-five thousand men of all arms. Horses—artillery one
                  thousand, and cavalry five hundred—in all fifteen hundred. Artillery, forty-nine
                  pieces; sabres and cavalry carbines, five hundred; bayonets, thirty-three
                  thousand.</p>
               <p>The highest officer in rank was a Brigadier General. Two of the division
                  commanders—Tyler of the first, and Runyon of the fourth—were Brigadiers, both
                  belonging to the three-months men. The other three, Hunter, Heintzelman and Miles,
                  were Colonels, all of the regular army. Each of the eleven brigades was led by a
                  Colonel Four of these—Keyes, W. T. Sherman, Franklin and Andrew Porter, belonged
                  to the regular service; the others, Schenck, Richardson, Burnside, Wilcox, Howard,
                  Blenker and Davies, were volunteers, temporarily detached from their
                  regiments.</p>
               <p>There were eighteen regiments from New York; four from Michigan; two each from
                  Ohio and Pennsylvania; one from Minnesota and one from Wisconsin. New England had
                  fourteen, of which Maine sent four, Massachusets three, Connecticut three, Rhode
                  Island two, and Vermont and New Hampshire<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7282-00000192"
                  /> shire each one. New Jersey had seven regiments, all in Gen. Runyon's reserve,
                  and consequently (as well as very unfortunately) never thrown into the fight,
                  though a part of them did good service in checking the retreat. One of the
                  Pennsylvania regiments, the Fourth, took the same view of the situation as that
                  embraced by the New York battery, and marched away when the conflict was actually
                  beginning. This, with the reserve subtracted, left the advancing army with only
                  forty-one regiments, or less than thirty thousand men of all arms.</p>
               <p>On the 17th, McDowell entered Fairfax Court-House and drove the rebels towards
                  Centreville and Manasses, making some unimportant captures of material, but the
                  South Carolina troops who had previously held that place, escaping. The pursuit
                  was not pushed beyond Centreville, owing to the early exhaustion of the raw
                  troops.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the 18th, the situation of the various commands was as follows:
                  Tyler's first division at Centreville; Hunter's second at Fairfax Court-House;
                  Heintzelman's third at Sangster's and Fairfax Stations; Ruayon's fourth in
                  reserve; and Miles's Fifth between Fairfax Court-House and Station.</p>
               <p>Each of the brigades encountered obstructions on the march, from trees felled
                  across the roads and other incumbrances, that were yet easily removed by the
                  axemen of the commands. The pioneers, however, had no power to sweep away the
                  Virginian forests, fill up Virginian swamps or level the face of the country; and
                  obstructions to advance a thousand times more serious were found eventually in
                  those peculiarities of the "Old Dominion."</p>
               <p>Richardson's brigade of Tyler's division passed on through Centreville and
                  advanced towards Bull Run Valley. At noon Gen. Tyler commenced a reconnoisance in
                  force, with this brigade, consisting of the Twelfth New York, First Massachusetts
                  and Second and Third Michigan—all volunteers; Ayres' battery and two companies of
                  cavalry. This force, moving up the Run through troublesome timber, near
                  Blackburn's Ford, two and a half miles from Centreville, came upon a strong rebel
                  force, and the first hostilities were commenced by Ayres, with a vigorous reply
                  from the rebels, who had the advantage of shelter. The eventual result of this
                  skirmish was that the Federal troops were virtually repulsed, (the Twelfth New
                  York, Col. Walrath, behaving badly)—and that after a vigorous shelling of the
                  woods by Ayres, Richardson fell back in good order upon Centreville. The Federal
                  loss in this opening fight was perhaps one hundred in killed, wounded and
                  missing.</p>
               <p>Friday the 19th and Saturday the 20th, though with heavy skirmishes on both days,
                  were principally employed in reconnoisances, the body of the Federal army
                  remaining quietly in camp in the various positions taken on the 17th and 18th. The
                  rebels who had been driven from Fairfax Court-House, Germantown, Centreville and
                  other points in the neighborhood, during those two days of fatal delay joined the
                  main body under Beauregard, strongly posted on the formidable range of hills near
                  Manasses. Naturally a very strong position, this had been further strengthened by
                  miles of earthworks and acres of that formidable obstruction so well known to
                  military men as abattis; while thick woods so screened their works on the crests
                  and sides of the hills that it required the sharpest scrutiny, even when close
                  upon them, to discover their precise locality before suffering the worst results
                  of their presence.</p>
               <p>Beauregard was evidently informed in good time of the determination of McDowell to
                  advance upon Manasses,—through some one of the many ramifications of that
                  treachery which paralyzed all the Union movements at the commencement of the war,
                  and has ever since so sadly crippled them. He was thus enabled to withdraw his
                  troops from the Northern side of Bull Run, in time to escape McDowell's
                  skilfully-planned and well-executed attempt to effect their capture. The
                  precautionary spirit of that officer, leading him even to check by a lift of the
                  finger the cheers about to break from the troops as he rode through them at
                  Centreville, for fear of the noise that might thus be created,—was of little use
                  when rebel spies and traitors lurked at every corner, ready to betray each
                  successive movement!</p>
               <p>Bull Run, insignificant then and now in size, unknown then except to the dwellers
                  in its neighborhood, but now as<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7282-00000193"/>
                  historic as the Danube or the Tiber,—is a small stream having its source in the
                  Bull Run Mountains, flowing in a direction generally South-east, and falling into
                  the Ocoquan about three and a half leagues from the junction of the latter stream
                  with the Potomac. Narrow in width, it is usually very low in the dry weather of
                  summer, but in winter almost always deep and unfordable. At times, even in summer,
                  heavy rains and their consequent freshets swell it within a few hours so that the
                  fords are rendered impassable. The country, on either side, is thickly wooded and
                  hopelessly broken, making it the most troublesome of barriers to an armed advance
                  in the ace of defences so easily thrown up on the surrounding hills.</p>
               <p>Manasses is seven miles distant in a South-west direction from Centreville; and
                  the latter is a small village of a few straggling houses, lying on a ridge of
                  hills taking a direction nearly North and South. The Centreville and Manasses road
                  runs along this ridge and crossing Bull Run at Mitchell's Ford, about equi-distant
                  between the two villages. The Warrenton turnpike runs nearly East and West over
                  the ridge, through Centreville, and crosses Bull Run some four miles from that
                  village, at the Stone Bridge, first passing over one of its tributaries, Cub Run,
                  by a bridge of mason-work two miles west of Centreville;—the latter and smaller
                  stream falling into Bull Run about half way between the Stone Bridge and
                  Blackburn's Ford That ford is nearly Southeast of Centreville, distant about three
                  miles, and the lowest down-stream of any near the scene of action. Passing
                  upstream, the next is Mitchell's Ford; then the Stone Bridge—each at the distance
                  of about one mile. Another ford one and a half miles above the Stone Bridge, and
                  still another at Sudley's Springs, ten miles North-west of Centreville. This brief
                  view of the ground partially or altogether covered by the battle, may do at least
                  something to make intelligible the movements rapidly following.</p>
               <p>The original purpose of Gen. McDowell had been to turn the rebel position on their
                  right, but a reconnoisance in person conviced him that such a movement was
                  impracticable; and the affair of the 18th stamped as equally futile an intended
                  attempt to cross at Blackburn's Ford, which would bring his forces directly in
                  front of the rebel main position at Manasses. The only alternative remaining was
                  to turn the enemy's extreme left. Hunter's and Heintzelman's divisions were
                  accordingly put under orders to cross at Sudley's and the ford below; Tyler's to
                  threaten the Warrenton turnpike by the Stone Bridge, leaving Richardson's brigade
                  to watch Blackburn's Ford against a possible attempt to flank by the rebels;
                  Miles, sending one brigade to Richardson, with the remainder to occupy the heights
                  at Centreville, in reserve. The plan was to cross at the tipper fords, less
                  strongly defended because the enemy had been expecting an attack on his
                  right—press down to the Stone Bridge before reinforcements could be thrown there,
                  form a junction with Tyler's division crossing there, strike the enemy's flank,
                  then turn to the right and force his left, attacking his rear and destroying the
                  railroad leading down to the Valley of Virginia, where a heavy force was know to
                  be concentrated. The rebels, meanwhile, were really in force at all the fords
                  except Sudley's; and the Stone Bridge was strongly defended by artillery and thick
                  abattis.</p>
               <p>The various columns were directed to move from their camps at half-past two
                  o'clock on the morning of Sunday, July 21st. Tyler marched out on the Warrenton
                  turnpike at the time designated, and arrived in front of the Stone Bridge at six.
                  His force then consisted of Schenck's and Sherman's brigades, with Ayres' and
                  Carlisle's batteries. After posting his troops and examining the position, Tyler
                  fired the first gun of the battle proper of Bull Run, at half-past six, eliciting
                  no response, and leaving the question an open one whether the rebels did not
                  themselves intend to attack by a flank movement at Blackburn's Ford.</p>
               <p>Hunter's division had meanwhile followed Tyler by the same road until Cub Run was
                  crossed, then wheeled to the right and moved North towards Sudley's Ford.
                  Heintzelman's division broke camp at the same time, but was blocked for three
                  hours by Hunter being in the way, near Centreville. He then followed Hunter across
                  Cub Run, and wheeled to the left for the ford next below Sudley's; but no such
                  road as<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7282-00000194"/> that reported by the scouts was
                  found to exist there, and the division was pushed on to Sudley's Ford.</p>
               <p>During the march of the two columns dense clouds of dust were seen rising in the
                  direction of Manasses; and before the head of Hunter's division reached Sudley's,
                  a heavy body of rebels was seen at the distance of a mile, advancing to meet the
                  expected attack. The leading brigade of Hunter, Burnside's, reached the ford at
                  half-past nine, when intelligence was received that the enemy was in force in
                  front. Even at this early hour the heat of the July morning began to be
                  oppressive, and the thick clouds of dust rising from every direction not only
                  obscured the view, in advance of the smoke of battle, but caused intolerable
                  suffering among the Union forces, as it no doubt must have done among those of the
                  enemy.</p>
               <p>A brief halt for rest and water—too brief, in the already exhausted condition of
                  the troops—and Burnside pushed forward, the Second Rhode Island crossing first,
                  throwing out skirmishers to the front and on both flanks. These were met in a few
                  moments by those of the enemy, firing commenced, the main body of the regiment
                  fell into line of battle, the battery wheeled into position and opened fire, and
                  the battle of Bull Run commenced in earnest.</p>
               <p>The ground over which Burnside moved was thickly wooded and hilly, for about a
                  mile between the Sudley road and the Run; on the other side, or right of the road,
                  it was for an equal distance divided between fields, hills and woods. A mile South
                  from the Run the country on both sides of the road was more open; and still
                  farther beyond, large rolling fields extended a mile or more to the Warrenton
                  road. A small tributary of Bull Run, fringed with thick woods, crossed the
                  battle-field; and in the valley of this water-course, at that point, ran the
                  Warrenton turnpike. While the Second Rhode Island was there engaging, the
                  remainder of the brigade formed on the right of the road.</p>
               <p>It was at this juncture that Col. Hunter, pressing forward with the advance, was
                  severely wounded and obliged to leave the field, his command falling upon Col.
                  Andrew Porter of the First Brigade. The Second Rhode Island became hard pressed,
                  and the Second New Hampshire, the First Rhode Island and Seventy-first New York
                  went forward to their support, the First Rhode Island coming into position first,
                  owing to greater celerity in forming. The Second Rhode Island had gallantly held
                  its own and even forced the enemy back for a short distance, though Col. Slocum
                  was killed, Major Ballou badly wounded, and the regiment under command of Lt. Col.
                  Wheaton. Col. Martin led the Seventy-first New York splendidly into action,
                  planted his two Dahlgren boat-howitzers, and worked them most effectually. The
                  battery of the Second Rhode Island, Capt. Reynolds, meanwhile did heavy service,
                  nearly silencing some of the rebel batteries masked in the woods at the right, and
                  driving back six regiments thrown forward to force that position. The Second New
                  Hampshire came into action and fought well, though Col. Martin was early wounded
                  and the regiment fell under the able command of Lt. Col. Fiske. The whole of
                  Burnside's force was now under fire, and Col. Porter's first brigade was ordered
                  up to his support.</p>
               <p>The enemy, at this time, was drawn up in a line extending along the Warrenton
                  road, from a house of some size and half a dozen hay-stacks fronting the extreme
                  Federal right, to a smaller house lying a little beyond the left of the division.
                  A rebel battery was masked behind the first of these houses, others along the
                  lines; and a thin wood partially in front of their right gave shelter to that
                  wing, while shrubbery and fences screened their centre and left.</p>
               <p>Griffin's battery opened a deadly fire upon the batteries on the rebel left, and
                  not only silenced or drove them back, but threw that wing into confusion. The
                  right of Porter's brigade was now thrown forward, including the marines under
                  Major Reynolds; the Twenty-seventh New York Volunteers, Col. Slocum; the
                  Fourteenth Brooklyn, Col. Wood; the Eighth New York, Col. Lyons; and Major
                  Palmer's seven companies of cavalry in the rear. These troops went gallantly
                  forward, and the enemy fell back in some disorder; at the same time that Burnside
                  was pouring the fiercest of his attack on the rebel right, still clinging to its
                  protecting woods with great tenacity. The Second Rhode Island battery being<pb
                     n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7282-00000195"/> hard pressed in its turn, Sykes'
                  regulars were sent to its assistance, dashed in under a terrible fire and
                  delivered staggering volleys into the very face of the enemy. At this moment
                  Burnside succeeded in breaking the rebel right and driving them from the shelter
                  of the woods. They came flying towards the Federal right, and their discomfiture
                  was completed by a withering fire from the New York Twenty-seventh. But Col.
                  Slocum of that regiment (the second of that name cut down on the field) was now
                  badly wounded, the rebels fought with the ferocity of desperation, and the aid of
                  the New York Eighth and Fourteenth, sent to reinforce the Twenty-seventh and cut
                  them off, came too late or proved too feeble, and the broken right of the enemy at
                  last got into shelter in safety.</p>
               <p>At this time, eleven o'clock, A. M., the heat of the day had so culminated that
                  severe and almost unendurable suffering commenced in both armies; and those
                  engaged, fond of American history, began to appreciate, better than ever before,
                  the suffering said to have been experienced on the day of Monmouth. From whatever
                  "shoddy" mismanagement many of the Federal troops had received no food that
                  morning; not one-tenth of their canteens were filled with water or had been during
                  the march; the sun poured clown rays that seemed direct emanations from the fiery
                  furnace; the dust choked, the smoke blinded; and the raw troops certainly had good
                  reason to feel that their first baptism in the terrible reality of war was to be
                  an effectual one. Poor fellows!—many of them came to think, before the conclusion
                  of that day, that their position at eleven in the morning, unenviable as it was,
                  had been rather desirable than otherwise, in comparison!</p>
               <p>The head of Heintzelman's delayed division (which included the Fire Zouaves)
                  reached Sudley's Ford at that hour. Gen. McDowell was by that time at the front,
                  and ordered Heintzelman to send forward two regiments to prevent the flanking of
                  the troops already engaged. Heintzelman threw forward the First Minnesota, Col.
                  Gorman, to the left of the road, and the Eleventh Massachusetts, Col. Clarke,
                  directly up it. He accompanied the Massachusetts regiment in person son, and
                  placed it in position. The rest of the division followed close, with the exception
                  of Arnold's battery and its supports formed of part of Heintzelman's second
                  brigade. His first, under Franklin, was formed of the First Minnesota, Col.
                  Gorman; Fifth Massachusetts, Col. Lawrence; and the Eleventh Massachusetts, Col.
                  Clarke. His second, under Wilcox, comprised the First and Fourth Michigan, Lt.
                  Col. Comstock and Col. Woodbury; the Eleventh New York (Fire Zouaves), Col.
                  Farnham; and the Thirty-eighth New York (Scott Life Guards), Col. J. H. Hobart
                  Ward. His third, under Howard, numbered the Third, Fourth and Fifth Maine, Cols.
                  Tucker, Berry and Dunnels; and the Second Vermont, Col. St. Clair.</p>
               <p>The line of high ground beyond the Warrenton road, before spoken of, running from
                  the house with haystacks on the hill west of the Sudley road, to another hill more
                  than half a mile to the east of the road, was at this time the particular object
                  of the Federal attack, the first mentioned point yet more especially. Ricketts'
                  battery was to take part in this attack, and took position within a thousand feet
                  of the enemy's batteries.</p>
               <p>Tyler's first division had meanwhile been busy. As soon as the divisions of Hunter
                  and Heintzelman were fairly engaged, the brigades of Sherman and Keyes (at about
                  noon) were sent across the Run by a ford just discovered below the Bridge.
                  Sherman's brigade, in the advance, consisted of the Sixty-ninth and Seventy-ninth
                  New York, Cols. Corcoran and Cameron; the Thirteenth New York Volunteers, Col.
                  Quimby; and the Second Wisconsin, Lt. Col. Peck. Keyes, on the left, commanded the
                  First, Second and Third Connecticut, Cols. Burnham, Terry and Chatfield; and the
                  Second Maine, Col. Jameson.</p>
               <p>Sherman, after crossing, ascended the steep bluff on the opposite side without
                  molestation, the Sixty-ninth New York leading. No artillery accompanied the
                  column, from the impossibility of crossing it by the ford. Here he encountered a
                  body of the retreating enemy, but a few moments after, under the shelter of a
                  cluster of pines near the bank; and it was in riding rashly forward to intercept
                  the retreat,<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7282-00000196"/> that the gallant Lt. Col.
                  Haggerty, of the Sixty-ninth, was shot down by a rebel marksman at short range and
                  in full view of his regiment. Firing on both sides followed, but Sherman was
                  intent upon forming a speedy junction with Hunter, and his forces pushed on
                  towards the field where the two divisions were already hotly engaged. Reaching the
                  field he formed in the rear of Porter's brigade, and joined in the pursuit of the
                  rebels, then falling back to the left of the Sudley road. Quimby's Thirteenth were
                  in the advance, followed in their order by the Second Wisconsin, Seventy-ninth and
                  Sixty-ninth New York. Quimby's regiment advanced steadily down the hill, across
                  the road and up the further slope to the top of the ridge lately occupied by the
                  enemy, from which it opened fire upon them in their new and favorable position.
                  Quimby continued his advance and the rebels retreated, until they reached a point
                  where the heat of the conflict had been raging against Heintzelman and Ricketts'
                  battery severely cut up. The other regiments of the brigade followed, in good
                  order though under a severe cannonading from the rebel pieces on the ridge; and
                  sheltered for a moment under the banks of the deep roadway from the terrible fire
                  of artillery and musketry pouring down the ridge, as they prepare to dash over the
                  crest and engage in some of the most splendid fighting of the day,—they must be
                  left for the time, while we trace the fortunes of the gallant brigade of
                  Keyes.</p>
               <p>This brigade crossed Bull Run, closed well up to Sherman's left, some eight
                  hundred yards above the Stone Bridge. After crossing, Keyes marched at once up the
                  opposite slope and formed on Sherman's left. In a few moments this brigade, now
                  forming the extreme left of the entire army engaged, came into conflict with a
                  strong body of rebel cavalry supported by infantry, and drove them with heavy
                  loss. Its own course was finally arrested by a severe fire from a cluster of
                  buildings standing on the heights above the Warrenton road. The second Maine and
                  Third Connecticut were ordered to assault the position, which proved for the
                  moment a Chew's House or Hoguemont against their advance. They performed that duty
                  splendidly, under a deadly fire from a rebel battery of eight and a strong body of
                  infantry,—carried the buildings and held them for a time. Then, finding those
                  buildings in turn commanded by a battery on the heights behind, they marched by
                  the left flank from the heights across an open field to the shelter of the banks
                  of Bull Run, half a mile below. Up this ravine the whole brigade pressed, with a
                  view of turning a rebel battery which commanded the Warrenton road at Stone
                  Bridge. This diversion caused the enemy to retire from that point, and gave Capt.
                  Alexander, of the engineers, an opportunity, gallantly embraced, of crossing the
                  bridge, cutting away the abattis and making way for the passage over of Schenck's
                  brigade, with Ayres' and Carlisle's batteries, thus brought to participate in the
                  action. But the rebel battery only limbered up and moved to a new position, from
                  which it kept up a galling fire. Keyes skilfully manoeuvred his force out of that
                  unsafe position, by a flank movement around the base of a sheltering hill, came to
                  a front, advanced a hundred yards and prepared to charge up the hill and capture
                  the troublesome battery.</p>
               <p>But by that time symptoms of disaster to the Federal right became palpable, and
                  Gen. Tyler ordered Keyes to face by the right flank, file to the right, recross
                  the Run, and join the main body of the Federal troops, already in fair
                  retreat.</p>
               <p>It is at this juncture necessary once more to leave the left and return to the
                  right and centre, last seen in preparation for those desperate and final charges
                  on the long ridge held by the enemy on the hill west of the Sudley road, which
                  were to decide the whole event of the battle.</p>
               <p>Three times the forces left in that position assaulted that ridge bristling with
                  musketry and pouring down one continuous rain of the most deadly missiles known to
                  modern warfare—the defenders half hidden behind formidable obstructions at every
                  point of the line: the assailants unsheltered and convenient marks for all that
                  rebel valor driven to desperation could pour down upon them. Veteran troops have
                  recoiled under less discouraging circumstances than those in which the worn-out
                  and sweltering soldiers of the Union staggered up to that assault, beneath the
                  blazing sun of the early midsummer afternoon, unfed, athirst and doubtful of the
                  capacity of many of their commanders: literally raw levies<pb n="406-407"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000197"/> might have been excused if they had scarcely
                  attempted the assault at all. Sad to say that human justice is so uncertain!—the
                  relations of the panic of that afternoon, which have ever since filled the land
                  and been wafted far and wide beyond the Atlantic, have been unaccompanied by any
                  reminder how nobly those very men fought when there was yet one hope or one chance
                  of victory!</p>
               <p>Three times that assault was made. Twice it was repulsed. The third time, nothing
                  could stand before the ill-regulated but desperate courage of the assailants. The
                  rebel lines wavered—they gave way—they broke: and foot by foot the Federals
                  pressed them backwards. Still further—away from the hill and so far down and
                  beyond it that they were literally hidden from sight,—the rebels were forced
                  backwards. To all appearances the central position was swept—the field was in the
                  hands of the Federal forces—the day was won! No thought of hunger or fatigue,
                  then! Fatigue was forgotten in the thought of victory: hunger was filled in that
                  most glorious of banquets at which the soldier sits down with the gods in the
                  consciousness of developed power.</p>
               <p>A few moments of triumph, then doubt, to be followed by despair. Dense clouds of
                  dust arose in the West and North-west, far beyond the point to which the main body
                  of the rebels had been driven. Then the head of their column advanced again—so
                  lately broken, now broken no longer, but closed up and threatening, and evidently
                     <emph>reinforced!</emph> No military eye but saw the omen too plainly. Fresh
                  rebel troops had arrived: whence, none could tell, but whence was really a matter
                  of little consequence. Not a few—not a brigade or even a division, but thousand
                  upon thousand!—absolutely what seemed to be an army quite as large as their own,
                  of rebel reinforcements. They could not know, what the country and the whole world
                  knew too soon—that General Joe Johnston, the very ablest and most dangerous of the
                  rebel commanders, with twenty or twenty-five thousand troops, had been allowed to
                  slip away form the force intended to hold them in check if not to bring them into
                  actual engagement, near Winchester, and to reach that hard-foughten field at the
                  very moment when the worst could be done by those troops for the cause of the
                  nation and for humanity.</p>
               <p>The story of the battle proper, after this point was reached, is all too briefly
                  told, though some of the most desperate fighting of the day took place after the
                  arrival of the rebel reinforcements. What Washington felt when he saw the last
                  hope of his campaign of 1776-7, destroyed by the pouring of an overpowering
                  British force against his exhausted troops at the close of the day of the battle
                  of Long Island—what Napoleon felt when he saw that the long line of troops
                  advancing to Waterloo, by Wavres, were those of Blucher instead of
                  Grouchy—something like this must have been experienced, in however less a degree,
                  by McDowell and the other officers who with him saw the imminence of the danger
                  and the probability of ruin.</p>
               <p>A fourth time the rebel force poured forward to the ridge, now overwhelming in
                  numbers and flushed with a certainty of victory. Franklin's brigade, of the First
                  Minnesota, Fifth and Eleventh Massachusetts, met the first shock with great
                  gallantry, unavailing as that gallantry eventually proved. The enemy regained the
                  ridge, and now held it against all attempts to dislodge them. Col. Wilcox's
                  brigade, on the left of Franklin, met the heaviest of this shock, but in the more
                  particular account yet to be given of the special fortunes of the Fire Zouaves,
                  the fate of that brigade is involved. Heintzelman led forward several of the
                  regiments of this command, in person, in support of different batteries, and they
                  were broken one by one—a point of military policy which will always remain a
                  question. And here occurred another of those blunders in identity, which have
                  before been alluded to as so fated during the war. The First Minnesota and a rebel
                  brigade mutually mistook each other, from the fact that the rebel uniform and that
                  of many of our militia, was the same—black-trimmed gray; and they were close
                  together and the rebels partially sheltered within a belt of timber above the
                  road, before the mistake was discovered. In the deadly fire which then opened,
                  almost into each other's faces, the Minnesota troops, sadly outnumbered, were
                  literally cut to pieces, Ricketts' battery was cut up and disabled, and
                     Heintzelman<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7282-00000198"/> elman was wounded in the
                  arm, though he did not leave the field.</p>
               <p>All the regiments of Wilcox's brigade suffered terribly here—not only the Fire
                  Zouaves, but the First and Fourth Michigan—both the latter doing duty nobly long
                  after they were broken. The last but best regiment of this brigade, the New York
                  Thirty-eighth Volunteers of Col. J. H. Hobart Ward, held their ground manfully,
                  once drove the rebels entirely in their attack on Ricketts' battery, but were
                  finally driven back and scattered by a force beyond human power to resist. It was
                  in attempting to make a last rally of this brigade that Col. Wilcox, fighting
                  determinedly, was taken by the rebels, afterwards to supply one of the most
                  notable prisoners to the dens at Richmond.</p>
               <p>Howard's brigade, on the left of Wilcox, now suffered terribly in the assaults of
                  the enemy upon Griffin's battery. Of this brigade, the Fourth Maine, Colonel
                  Barry, showed indomitable courage and extraordinary discipline, and did not lose
                  its organization for a moment, even when under the deadliest fire and actually
                  decimated. The Fourteenth Brooklyn fought nobly for a time, but that regiment had
                  yet to win its after-glorious reputation, and they too broke after a time and went
                  to the rear. In the attempt to rally them, the gallant Colonel Wood was severely
                  wounded and supplied the rebels with their second captured Union Colonel. In
                  attempted support of Griffin's battery, too, the marines, a battalion of the
                  Twenty-seventh New York under Major Bartlett, and the Eighth New York State
                  Militia, were all ordered up. The Eighth gave evidence of courage and
                  determination to fight, but a part of their field was miserably inefficient if not
                  basely cowardly, and they were soon broken and more than half the time left
                  without a regimental officer in command. Once the Quartermaster, Lieut. Cornell,
                  took command and fought them for a while <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                     amateur,</foreign> and once Major Wadsworth, finding them wandering in the
                  woods like lost children, swearing terribly and shooting very much at random,
                  performed the same service for them for a few minutes; but this was all that was
                  realized out of the excellent material and very good discipline of a regiment
                  certainly worthy, if well led, to have ranked beside or next to the
                  Seventy-first.</p>
               <p>We have now seen the fate of the Fourteenth and the Eighth, of Porter's brigade.
                  His cavalry did all that the broken nature of the ground would permit; but the
                  marines broke in spite of every exertion; and only the battalion of the
                  Twenty-seventh remained entirely unbroken, and retired, when they did so, without
                  panic.</p>
               <p>We left Burnside's brigade of Hunter's division, some time since, under heavy fire
                  between the Sudley road and the Run, to the left; and aid under Sykes, from Col.
                  Andrew Porter's, coming up to its relief. The battery of the Second Rhode Island
                  and the howitzers of the New York Seventy-first did splendid service, and
                  Burnside, with the support of Sykes, drove the rebels in confusion before him and
                  was enabled to open upon the body opposed to Porter. He sent the Second New
                  Hampshire to the support of Howard, and with the remainder of his brigade went
                  into the woods in the rear, to supply the troops with ammunition, which was nearly
                  exhausted.</p>
               <p>Sherman's brigade was lost sight of, some time ago, sheltered under the banks of
                  the roadway near the crest of a hill on the Sudley road. Here Sherman received
                  orders from McDowell to attack at once, and the Second Wisconsin went steadily
                  over the crest for a time, but broke at last, Western hunters though they were,
                  under a fire that might have staggered veteran troops. The Seventy-ninth New York
                  were now ordered to cross the ridge and drive the rebels from the sheltering
                  clusters of pines which gave them such advantage. Worthy of the reputation of
                  their race was the stubborn attempt of the Scotsmen to fulfil that duty, in the
                  face of repeated repulses. They wavered and rallied again, several times, but were
                  at last driven back to the shelter of the roadway, leaving their brave Col.
                  Cameron dead on the field.</p>
               <p>Now came the turn of the Sixty-ninth, and if the Gael had just displayed his
                  stubborn bravery, here was a chance for the exhibition of the fiery heroism of the
                  Celt. Quimby's Thirteenth was hotly engaged on another ridge a little to the left,
                  and the event in that direction seemed doubtful, when<pb n="410-411"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000199"/> Colonel Corcoran led his brave Irishmen over the
                  ridge, in the face of such a fire as few troops ever successfully encountered—such
                  a fire as up to that time had never been poured over any portion of the American
                  continent, but since that time, alas!—too often paralleled and even exceeded in
                  violence. It is the same old story once more to be told over—advance, repulse,
                  rally, the tasking of every energy; then final repulse, with the gallant Corcoran
                  in the hands of the enemy—the third and last of the Union Colonels taken
                  prisoner.</p>
               <p>It was about four o'clock, P. M., when the last charge of the Sixty-ninth was
                  made. By that time the Federal troops had begun to give way under the pressure of
                  Johnston's rebel reinforcements and disaster in that quarter became apparent.
                  Schenck, crossing Stone Bridge after Sherman and Keyes, had been recalled in the
                  midst of local success. Ricketts' and Griffin's batteries had been taken and
                  retaken three times, but finally left in the hands of the enemy for lack of horses
                  to draw them away. The rebels captured no others during the engagement, properly
                  so called.</p>
               <p>By that time (four, P. M.), the field of Bull Run had been fought, won and lost;
                  and the whole force on the other side of Bull Run was in full retreat.
                  Heintzelman's and Hunter's divisions retreated by Sudley's Ford, and Sherman's and
                  Keyes' by the ford near the Stone Bridge. Burnside, whose brigade was the least
                  disorganized, covered the retreat at Sudley's. The Rhode Islanders and the New
                  York Seventy-first brought off their guns in safety. At this period of the retreat
                  the Twenty-Seventh and Thirty-eighth New York, Fourth Maine, Fifth Massachusetts,
                  First Minnesota, Seventy-first New York, First and Second Rhode Island, all
                  displayed coolness and brought up the rear with steadiness that would not have
                  done discredit to veterans.</p>
               <p>The details of the action of the reserve, not actually included in the battle,
                  must necessarily be omitted, as well as the corps-movements of the main body,
                  while they retained regularity worthy of the name, and after the event of the
                  action was decided. It was not until more than an hour after the retreat had
                  commenced—when really no danger from the enemy was longer to be apprehended, and
                  when even the rashest bravery could not have saved the lost battle,—that the
                  retreat became a flight and the feeling of discouragement a panic. They err who
                  say that the battle of Bull Run was lost by the cowardice of the Union troops. It
                  was lost by a lack of numbers from the first<ref rend="super" target="#note_034"
                     xml:id="return_034">*</ref>
                   —delay in marching, owing partially to the inexperience of officers and
                  partially to the want of endurance of raw troops on the route—the knowledge of the
                  country possessed by the rebels and lacking in the Federals, giving the former at
                  all times the advantage in position—the wooded, broken and easily-defensible
                  nature of the ground held by the rebels—and more than all and above all, by the
                  rebel General Johnston being allowed, as before recorded, to reach the field at
                  that very inopportune moment, with his overwhelming reinforcements. Most of the
                  troops fought well—the three months militia regiments peculiarly well—when even
                  decently led and while there was a hope of success remaining: they were simply
                  beaten out, exhausted and overpowered. And if any man wants any more explanations
                  of the melancholy failure than have already been furnished, let him find them,
                  after the manner of Victor Hugo explaining away Waterloo, in some supposition that
                  "God was tired of" McDowell or the American Union.</p>

                     reinforcements brought up their strength to 40,000—the Union forces actually
                     engaged being outnumbered two to one.</p>
               </note>
               <p>How the panic commenced, before the retreating army reached Cub Run, throwing the
                  disorganized regiments into and over the top of those that yet remained intact,
                  and breaking the whole mass into one frightened horde, throwing away arms,
                  clothing, every thing, in the madness of fear and the single thought of
                  dishonorable flight,—no man can tell, to this day, any more than that panic can be
                  explained which made the Old Guard frightened sheep at Waterloo. Some say the
                  scared teamsters; others particular regiments; still others, reports that the
                  enemy (themselves too badly cut up to pursue at all) were close upon their backs
                  with still other reinforcements<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7282-00000200"/> ments;
                  and yet others, the inevitable tendencies of humanity under discouragement. Only
                  God knows the secret cause: the fact, meanwhile, is painfully patent to mankind.
                  The disgraceful affair occurred. A beaten army left the field, in no worse order
                  than hundreds of other beaten armies have retreated; but nothing more than a mob
                  reached the choked-up bridge at Cub Run, under the suddenly-opened fire of the
                  enemy; and certainly nothing less melancholy than a mob staggered fainting,
                  foot-sore, half-clothed, crazed and demoniac, along the roads leading to
                  Centreville, to be checked a little by the reserve there, to re-occupy the
                  abandoned camps in that neighborhood, or to straggle through the night towards
                  Alexandria, Arlington Heights and Washington, carrying terror and panic
                  everywhere, and doing even more injury to the nation after leaving the field, than
                  they had caused in its forced abandonment.</p>
               <p>The pitying eye of heaven has seldom looked down on sadder scenes than some of
                  that night. Men half-dressed, barefoot, bareheaded and delirious, fighting for the
                  ambulances with the wounded, dragging officers from their horses, mounting them
                  and riding away; wounded and exhausted men crawling to the brooks, drinking and
                  dying there; piteous cries for help and oaths of impatience on every hand and at
                  every step; carriages filled with civilians or men on horseback dashing down the
                  dusky roads, heedless of life or limb in their career; arms lying abandoned
                  everywhere, as if the toil and sweat of the nation had not bought them; frightened
                  inquiries on every hand, from those who had not shared in the conflict, and still
                  more frightened answers from those who were leaving it; brave men become cowards,
                  demoralization universal, and despair seeming to brood over the whole scene in the
                  thick gathering clouds that were before many hours to expend themselves in rain on
                  the abandoned battle-field and cool the fevered lips of the dying even while
                  adding to the tortures of their wounds.</p>
               <p>One word more—to say that besides the heavy material loss of the Union forces, the
                  loss in men numbered nineteen officers, four hundred and sixty two
                  non-commissioned officers and men, killed and wounded, and about twelve hundred
                  taken prisoners;—and then let the curtain of silence, thick as that of the falling
                  night, be drawn over the general sad result of the battle of Bull Run, while we
                  return to trace rapidly and briefly the fortunes of the Fire Zouaves in that
                  conflict, and especially those of Burtnett Haviland, through whom the whole has a
                  pertinency to this relation.</p>

                     SOLDIER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE battle call came to the Zouaves on Tuesday the 16th of July, at which time the
                  companies at Forth Ellsworth and those on duty beyond received orders to prepare
                  for a match and the word "advance movement" began to be bruited in the camp. Then
                  broke out afresh the petty jealousy which has before been noticed, against the
                  Company employed on other service; and though the fire-boys had no objection
                  whatever to a nearer insight into the mysteries of actual warfare, they could not
                  avoid venting such remarks as:</p>
               <p>"Oh ho! <emph>we</emph> are going to fight, are we? But you don't catch Company ——
                  going—not they! They are having a soft thing of it down at Alexandria; and catch
                  them going any nearer to a fight than that, if they know it!"</p>
               <p>Perhaps the grumblers were a little surprised, and not a little mortified, when
                  the cars from Alexandria that came in to the line of the road where they were
                  forming, a mile south of Cloud's Mills, on Wednesday morning, brought Company ——,
                  and found it formed and ready for the march, before any other of the regiment!
                  Perhaps they would have been a<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7282-00000201"/> little
                  more surprised, could they have heard what passed between Captain Jack and the
                  General in command at Alexandria, on Tuesday—the Captain's request that the
                  Company might be allowed to join the balance of the command—the veteran General's
                  gruff: "Young man—when you are as old as I am, and have seen as many battles, you
                  will think twice before you go into any fights that you can keep out of!"—and the
                  Captain's reply: "Very likely, General; but every one of my command would rather
                  be killed—at least killed a <emph>little,</emph>—than have the name of shirking
                  when the rest of the regiment is going into active service!"</p>
               <p>The same note of preparation heard at Fort Ellsworth and Cloud's Mills, of course
                  sounded at Alexandria on Tuesday, and the same rumor of the "onward movement" rang
                  among the Zouaves there, and the Michigan troops who assisted in holding the town,
                  that was stirring up the companies beyond. Activity, energy, bustle, were the
                  order of that day of preparation for sterner service than any they had so far
                  seen; and yet there was one man among the Zouaves, who showed nothing of
                  either—who moved like a man in a dream—with set and glaring eyes, compressed
                  mouth, and something in his whole demeanor that would have told any close observer
                  that he was passing through that period of quiet despair which follows the acme of
                  mental suffering.</p>
               <p>That man was Burtnett Haviland. The same hour which spread among the Zouaves the
                  knowledge that they were to participate in the army's advance movement, had
                  brought him a letter from Washington by the mail-boat, bearing the New York
                  post-mark, and in Kate's well known hand writing. What that letter contained, may
                  be easily judged, when it is remembered that Kate Haviland had written it in his
                  own house, within an hour after the discovery of his wife's supposed elopement!
                  What that true-hearted man suffered under that culminating blow which could never
                  be followed by one deadlier or more cruel, can only be known by those (and they
                  are few—and yet too many!) who have passed through the same terrible ordeal.</p>
               <p>The Zouave was on guard on one of the wharves when the letter was handed him, and
                  very fortunately he was alone When he opened and read it. For he would not have
                  been pleased at the neighborhood of too close observers, however friendly, when
                  the worst fears of the last two months were all realized a thousand times over,
                  and the last hope of his life destroyed. When he bent down his head, leaning upon
                  the weapon that at that moment seemed to be his only friend, felt the hot tears
                  gushing from his eyes in another and a deeper sorrow than he had known that fatal
                  night in the store of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews, and great sobs burst forth and
                  shook his strong frame as if the very foundations of his being were breaking up.
                  When at length he raised his head, with one fearful oath which the recording
                  angels who pity human sorrow while they measure human crime, can scarcely have set
                  down against him,—threw the unwelcome missive into the dirt that lay thick upon
                  the wharf, and ground it with his heavy heel till it was a mere mass of illegible
                  fragments.</p>
               <p>The ruin was complete and final. He believed that his destiny was
                  accomplished—that the sacrifice he had felt himself called upon to make for his
                  country, was made to the uttermost, in a bereavement fifty times worse than the
                  mere yielding up of his life. The yielding up of his life!—ah, there was one
                  thought of consolation. He had, just then, no wish for life; nor had he yet even
                  constructed out of the wreck of his hopes, that raft upon which so many float for
                  a time after existence is a burthen—<emph>revenge.</emph> His regiment was going
                  into battle: the chance was welcome—he would go with it and die! After that one
                  fearful oath he spoke no word aloud. There was no one to whom to speak it; and
                  there are extremities of outrage and misery, under which dead, stubborn silence,
                  with the lip rigid and the eye set like stone, forms the only exponent of feeling.
                  And yet perhaps it was a revenge which that wronged husband thought for the moment
                  of taking—one of those revenges which gods might exhibit, and weak, loving women
                  sometimes display to shame the arrogance of those who would claim to be their
                  masters—the terrible revenge of going away from the chance of any struggle that
                  might interfere with the mad course of unscrupulous crime, and leaving that
                  unrestrained indulgence to punish itself in the future.</p>
               <pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC7282-00000202"/>
               <p>This was the state of feeling with which one member of Captain Jack's Company went
                  forward to the fight: who knows how many others, in that and other companies, may
                  have suffered equally from some other cause as shameful, and yet found no
                  chronicler of the wrong or its effects?</p>
               <p>The whole Zouave regiment, with the others of Wilcox's brigade (already named in
                  the preceding general account of the battle), moved from Cloud's Mills on
                  Wednesday morning, and caught a new taste of the quality of "active service" by
                  sleeping that night, without blankets or any shelter, in a miserable muddy swamp
                  some eight or ten miles south of Fairfax, where frogs, lizards and water-snakes
                  had an undisputed pre-emption,—after making an unsuccessful detour to trap the
                  rebel troops at Burke's Station, and seeing the smoke rising during the day at a
                  distance, from Fairfax Court House, then being sacked by the forces advancing from
                  Washington.</p>
               <p>On Thursday night they encamped at Burke's Station, and on Friday pushed on to
                  Centreville, coming in while the cannon were yet sounding at the close of the
                  skirmish of that day. All night long poor Farnham, the Zouave Colonel, lay sick in
                  an amb ulance, unfit to move one step further, but the soul too large for his
                  broken and enervated body. At two in the morning they were again under arms, in
                  the waning moonlight, and ready for the march as the other unfed troops (one more
                  imprecation on the "shoddy" quartermasters who starved them while filling their
                  own capacious pockets!) could be under the circumstances. But it was seven o'clock
                  before they could move, other divisions (as has been seen) occupying the road
                  towards Manasses.</p>
               <p>At seven the brigade moved forward, over the broken and stony road between
                  Centreville and Manasses, the best hours of the morning lost, the air fearfully
                  sultry, the sun coming down with a blinding glare which seemed like that of
                  meridian, and the exhausted men even then dropping so fast that there was scarcely
                  a rood of the road not darkened with some human form incapable of further exertion
                  and doomed to death if left to writhe in the heat of the coming noon. But the word
                  was "Hurry!" and on they pressed—faster—faster, at every mile, as it seemed to the
                  unaccustomed soldiers. Half-past ten, and they were near Cub Run Before them could
                  be heard the boom of cannon and seen the rising smoke of the battle already begun.
                  Then rose what is to be found at times in every true man—excitement overcoming
                  fatigue, and that power born of temporary madness. An aide-de-camp dashed down the
                  road from Heintzelman, who had been long on the watch, ordering Wilcox's brigade
                  forward instantly. There were yet two miles to traverse, to reach Sudley, where
                  the bravery and dash of the brigade, upon which the General so largely counted,
                  were sorely needed for the support of the hotly-engaged centre. To the Zouaves,
                  especially, this was something like what the ringing of a "general alarm" had been
                  in the days of fife-duty. Away went coats, in some instances caps, even
                  shoes—every thing but guns and ammunition, and on they dashed at double-quick,
                  exhausted and beaten out, but believing that they had work before them and
                  determined to do it or die. More than once Burtnett Haviland, one of the most
                  able-bodied men in the advance companies, rushing on under the blistering sun,
                  through the choking dust, and feeling the blood surging to his head like a tide of
                  hot lava that seemed to scorch every vein and wither every nerve,—doubted whether
                  that object of which he was in search—death!—would not be found ingloriously in
                  the lightning flash of sun-stroke, before the bullet of any enemy could have
                  opportunity to reach his heart!</p>
               <p>It was noon when they reached Sudley's Springs, and a moment's halt was ordered to
                  "fill canteens." Down to the rivulet not yet reddened with the blood that was so
                  soon to thicken it, sprang the tired fellows; but even this justice was to be
                  denied them, for before one-third had succeeded in obtaining a drop of the fluid
                  so necessary for the maintenance of human life, there was another call for help
                  that came out of the deafening roar and blinding smoke immediately in front, and
                  the order "Forward!" was again given. There was but a little time more of pride
                  for the Zouaves; but that pride yet existed. The order was obeyed, and the Zouaves
                  rather plunged than marched forward into that hell of deadly strife—of cannon
                  roar, and the crack of small arms, and shouts, and smoke, and blinding dust—which
                  seemed so impossible<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7282-00000203"/> possible for any
                  man to escape when he should once have entered it.</p>
               <p>The Zouaves were in the advance. Ayres' regular battery, as they reached the spot
                  on the right of Sudley's Ford where the centre was so hotly engaged, was hardly
                  pressed, and they wheeled short to the right and rushed up a stony side-road that
                  climbed the wooded hill, to support that battery. So far there was no lack of
                  discipline. Orders were obeyed almost with the precision of regulars. A moment
                  placed the body of the regiment in position, and they opened fire, while the right
                  wing dashed into what they supposed to be the shelter of a clump of woods, to
                  support. A most deadly "shelter," indeed! The whole clump was a masked battery
                  with infantry at either edge! At not more than pistol-shot distance it burst into
                  the faces of the Fire Zouaves, who found, then and there, that there was something
                  in the world yet more trying to human courage than the smoke and flame of their
                  favorite service and the tottering of red-hot walls in the air above their heads!
                  They broke; and yet discipline could not have been <emph>all</emph> lost at once,
                  as some detractors aver; for military men will know what is contained in the fact
                  that the first company only drove back the second about twenty feet, and that the
                  second counted off under that fire, two men falling in their ranks as they did so!
                  Burtnett Haviland's file-closer had just answered "two!" as a fragment of shell
                  struck him in the forehead, scattering his brains over the file-leader; and yet
                  neither shell nor bullet seemed to be billeted for <emph>him.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The regiment was yet in good order when it dropped down the hill a hundred yards
                  for shelter; and it was in good order, though somewhat thinned, when it made the
                  second advance, not many minutes afterwards, to clear the clump of woods and take
                  the annoying battery. But the fates seemed against it, even if courage could have
                  availed against overpowering numbers. Poor Farnham reeled in his saddle—a rebel
                  bullet had struck him in the side of the head, tearing off his ear and injuring
                  the brain. These men were not soldiers enough to be maddened by the sight of their
                  leader tottering in his seat and only held on his horse by supporting hands—they
                  were only discouraged by it. They broke again, worse than before, and fell back
                  once more under the shelter of the hill, where they were again formed with some
                  difficulty. Want of discipline and steadiness was beginning to tell, now, at the
                  very moment when its lack or its possession was to make or mar the whole future of
                  the regiment.</p>
               <p>Heintzelman—that bundle of nerves, whose thin, active figure, ever in motion,
                  seems the incarnation of restless discontent,—hurled some fierce oaths as he put
                  himself at the head of the Zouaves, ordering the Michigan troops of the brigade
                  forward to support, and led them to that third charge which was the only one
                  connected with their action on the field, that he thought proper afterwards to
                  mention in his official report. The little General was grim and "wolfish," just
                  then—not the less so from the pain of his wound. Just as the brigade advanced up
                  the hill, the rebels poured out from their shelter upon Ayres' battery, and showed
                  not less than three brigades of Mississippi and Alabama troops, supported by a
                  squadron of cavalry known as the "Black Horse." The odds were really hopeless, and
                  this time the Zouaves broke disgracefully, the cavalry riding through them with
                  only the emptying of a few saddles, to meet destruction a few moments after at the
                  hands of the Union troopers of Capt. Colburn. Two companies of the Zouaves
                  maintained order for the time, and did their part in a sharp fight over the guns
                  of Ayres' battery, assisting at last in bringing away all the pieces but one; and
                  many of the regiment did duty afterwards as skirmishers; but Farnham had at last
                  fallen and was to lie uncared for during all that long day and night and with the
                  rain of the next day beating him into the mud it was forming; Downey and many
                  others of the best officers and men of the organization were prisoners in the
                  hands of the rebels, doomed to a year of suffering in the prisons of Richmond,
                  Charleston and Columbia; and the career of the regiment, <emph>as</emph> a
                  regiment, was ended from that moment. Traits of nobility there were to be
                  exhibited by individual members, worthy of any body of troops in any service; some
                  of the most valued members were to permit themselves to be dragged off as
                     prisoners,<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC7282-00000204"/> contrary to all the
                  usages of war, rather than desert the wounded who were imploring their aid; one of
                  the Captains was to crawl back all the way from Centreville to Cub Run, that
                  night, to look after the life of an orderly-sergeant, so unendurably footsore all
                  the while as to be obliged to throw away his shoes and return barefoot,—and
                  stopping at midnight on the bridge choked up with dead, to give water from his
                  canteen to the dying who implored it; those and other noble traits were to be
                  exhibited, but to no purpose for the eventual salvation of the regiment.
                  Disorganization had commenced and no human power could check it.</p>
               <p>Half an hour after their last repulse, when the general retreat commenced, the
                  Fire Zouaves were among the most disorderly bodies in the whole army. When the
                  panic began and disgraceful flight became the order of the day, there seemed to be
                  no bound to the miserable poltroonery of a large proportion. None in all the army
                  bragged so of their courage and disgusted all listeners with the account of the
                  exploits they had performed, as those members of the regiment who had run away
                  without doing any thing else. Captain Jack's company mustered forty men at Fort
                  Ellsworth the night following, and for a time again guarded the warehouses at
                  Alexandria. Others straggled into Alexandria and Washington, without commanders,
                  and were fed like beggars on charity, by other troops. More than half of those who
                  remained, disgracefully deserted and reached New York and other places in the
                  North, within a few days after the battle, disguised or boldly shameless. They
                  recruited vainly at Bedloe's, and went into camp vainly at Fortress Monroe. No
                  power could save what was doomed; and within a year from the date of its
                  organization, the Fire Zouave Regiment, upon which so many hopes had been built
                  when Ellsworth sailed away with it from the city of New York—after winning honor
                  in some particulars but covering itself with eternal disgrace in others—after
                  being alternately over-glorified and disgracefully ill-used,<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_035" xml:id="return_035">*</ref>
                   —was mustered out of the service, melted away and has been heard of no
                  more, except as its name has occasionally crept in to illustrate a newspaper
                  paragraph, or the circumstances surrounding some particular member have been found
                  singular enough (as in the present instance) to warrant weaving them into the
                  romance of history.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_035">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_035">*</ref>That may as well be said here which has never yet, as we believe, been made
                     public, but which is certainly true and very important as affecting the
                     career and conduct of this unfortunate regiment. Most of the Zouaves
                     believed themselves, when they enlisted, to be going for <emph>three
                        months;</emph> afterwards they agreed to remain in service <emph>one
                           year;</emph> and when they were mustered in, in front of the Capitol, by
                     Major McDowell, they were forced to agree to their term being made
                     <emph>three years,</emph> or disgrace themselves by apparent cowardice.
                     Ellsworth may not have been guilty of intentional deception: if he was not,
                     he made a sad mistake and other parties were sadly culpable. There was
                     nothing more essentially "shoddy" about any thing in the whole early
                     management of the war, than the blundering shown in the arrangements made
                     for and with this regiment.</p>
               </note>
               <p>With which observation, once more and for the last time the course of this
                  narration leaves the general events of the war to trace briefly out the remaining
                  fortunes of the leading characters.</p>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland was unwounded during either of the desperate charges made by the
                  Zouaves at Sudley. The blood and brains of comrades continually spattered over him
                  and occasionally made him sick at heart, but because he had really sought death
                  there seemed to be no bullet directed at his life. Even fighting over the guns of
                  Ayres' battery, three times in hand-to-hand conflict, twice with foot-soldiers and
                  once with a mounted officer, and twice of the three times killing his man,—he had
                  not even a scratch! He was once swept down and literally run over by one of the
                  charges made by the rebels on the battery, and believed for the moment that his
                  time was come, as he lay temporarily prostrate and guns flashed and swords gleamed
                  above him. Any one who saw him might have believed him gone beyond hope, as were
                  indeed many of those who fought at his side, in that very charge. But he rose
                  again, swept away from the spot in the irresistible rush, by some miracle
                  unwounded and not even bruised by the trampling feet of men and horses, though his
                  outward appearance was certainly not improved by that Antæan contact with his
                  mother earth, so little calculated to endow him with additional strength. He had
                  long before lost<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC7282-00000205"/> his canteen, thrown
                  away his coat, suspenders and red shirt, only retaining pants, shoes, cap and his
                  white shirt—white by courtesy, for amid the sweat, and dust, and grime, the shirt,
                  like his face, was nearer to almost any other color than that of purity, and the
                  man would have possessed keen eyes who even recognized in that desolate, grimy and
                  bandit-looking figure the once neatly-dressed and really handsome clerk of Charles
                  Holt &amp; Andrews.</p>
               <p>Then came the panic, the rush and the mad desperation in which he was borne away
                  with all the others. He heard nothing, saw nothing, except sounds and sights of
                  terror and disorganization, culminating as the flight extended and the fugitives
                  were borne farther from the field, in the opening of the rebels upon them with
                  cannon at Cub Run, and the struggling of the mass of disorganized humanity across
                  that stream—over the choked bridge and through the water below and above it. The
                  Zouave scarcely knew how he himself crossed, so stunned and deafened was he by the
                  general confusion; but he must have forded at some shallow part of the stream, for
                  he was wet to the knees. He staggered up the bank, and gained the edge of a little
                  thicket of scrubby oaks near the bank. The sounds of flight and pursuit were all
                  around him, but not in his immediate neighborhood; and for a moment he dropped
                  down upon the stump of a fallen tree, to catch breath. Haviland had been flying
                  like the rest, for the past half hour—there is no use of attempting to disguise
                  the fact,—flying for his life. He had forgotten, for the time, his desire for
                  death, as many another man has done when the spectre he invoked came too near; or
                  he had seen how many of the Union troops were being captured, and he dreaded, more
                  than the sacrifice of his life, the possibility of being dragged away to a rebel
                  prison.</p>
               <p>At all events, the next movement of this man, after sitting down upon the stump of
                  the fallen tree, showed that his grief had been made subordinate to other
                  considerations. Under the edge of the brush of the tree-top lying on the ground,
                  he caught sight of a ghastly object. It was the body of a dead rebel, a large man,
                  with the number of the Tenth Mississippi regiment on his gray cap, who had been
                  killed there or crawled there to die, some hours earlier in the battle. Burtnett
                  Haviland staggered to his feet, and a new thought, as well as the culmination of a
                  new feeling, took possession of him. He did not know that fate was bearing him on
                  and that he merely played his part; he believed that he was acting entirely from
                  his own volition. The new feeling that culminated was the sudden desire to save
                  his life or escape from imprisonment, which had been born within the past
                  half-hour. The new thought was the belief that the means for both were at hand.
                  Under such circumstances, to will is to do, and very little time is consumed in
                  preliminary operations. In a moment he had loosened the clothes of the dead rebel
                  at the waist, and in another moment had drawn off the trousers and drawn them on
                  (not as was the addition to his wardrobe) over his own. For the coat he had no
                  necessity—his own dirty white shirt was quite sufficient to make him a
                  "butternut." He threw down his own cap, put on that of the half-denuded
                  Mississippian, caught up the old long rifle that lay beside him, and was for the
                  time, to all intents and purposes, a rebel.</p>
               <p>His plans, at the moment, may be told in a word. While upon ground in the rebel
                  possession, in that guise he would be safe even against capture, and if captured
                  by any of the retreating Union troops he would of course be beyond danger, as he
                  had the means in his possession of proving his identity. If he thought of ridicule
                  in that connection, the idea did not trouble him sadly; for the man who runs away
                  in his own clothes is not much less ridiculous than the man who escapes in those
                  of another!</p>
               <p>A moment, and there was the cry of voices coming down the road from the
                  North-west, outside of the clump of trees. The new rebel ran to the edge of the
                  wood and looked out. A carriage was dashing down to the Centreville road, from the
                  banks of the Run above—one of the many containing civilians who had gone out from
                  Washington and the neighborhood, to feast their eyes on that bloody spectacle, as
                  the Roman patricians might have done on the agonies of the gladiators fighting
                  with each other or with beasts in the arena,—highly edified because out of
                  danger—both! One<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC7282-00000206"/> moment's glance told
                  the Mississippian <abbr>pro tem.,</abbr> so much; the next showed that close
                  behind were ten or a dozen rebels, attracted by the beauty of the turn-out and
                  intent on making a capture. The horses were going at speed, and though two or
                  three of the rebels were a little ahead, it seemed doubtful whether they could
                  reach the edge of the road in time to intercept the carriage; while the carriage
                  could not swerve from its course, owing to the rocks and trees to the left, and
                  must pass within six feet of where he stood. The gray-clads seemed to have
                  exhausted their ammunition, and could not fire: there was every chance that the
                  occupants of the carriage would escape: he hoped and believed that they would,
                  though of course he could do nothing to aid them at that moment.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, as the carriage came nearer, he started forward. A man had thrust his
                  head out of the right window of the vehicle, to see how matters were progressing
                  or to urge yet greater speed. Rapid as was the movement, Burtnett Haviland saw and
                  recognized that peculiar and well-known face in an instant. That man was Charles
                  Holt, the merchant, his old employer and the betrayer of his wife! Did we say, a
                  few pages back, that the husband whose domestic happiness was thus ruined, had not
                  yet found time to build the raft "revenge" out of the wreck of his hopes? If so,
                  he built that raft very rapidly at this moment! Shame, wrong, hatred, every thing
                  rose within him in an instant, and his band was ready for any deed. He would kill
                  the seducer, now while he had the opportunity! Then another thought followed,
                  quite as rapidly: he would throw him into the hands of the rebels, and trust to
                  them for his suffering a thousand deaths! No sooner thought than done. The
                  carriage was close at hand and still flying rapidly: it had cleared the rebels
                  trying to cut it off, and would escape. He had tried the rifle, before—found it
                  unloaded, and so could not shoot the horses and stop their career. But he could do
                  something else, and he did it. Springing to the side of the road as the carriage
                  swept up, he clubbed the long, heavy Mississippi rifle and brought it with all his
                  force ful into the face of the horse nearest him. Not even the flying speed of the
                  animals could overbalance such a check. A second blow, given before they could
                  recover and spring forward again, sent the horse to the ground, the other falling
                  over him, and the carriage half-over-turned on the top of both; at the same time
                  that a couple of revolver-shots came from the carriage window and one of them went
                  through Haviland's gray cap, very nearly affording him that chance of death for
                  which he had been looking during all the earlier portion of the day.</p>
               <p>The door of the carriage was dashed open in an instant, and Charles Holt, the only
                  occupant, sprang out. The driver was already on his feet. The hindrance had been
                  sufficient to give the rebels behind time to come up, and as he touched the
                  ground, he, as well as the driver, was in the hands of half a dozen of the
                  gray-clads. He looked at Haviland, but did not recognize him in that changed garb,
                  with his short hair and beard, and beneath that load of grime. Had he done so, and
                  done it but one moment earlier, the two remaining shots in his revolver would
                  probably have been better aimed!</p>
               <p>"Who are <emph>you?</emph>" asked one of the rebels, who all belonged to a native
                  Virginian regiment.</p>
               <p>"Tenth Mississippi—don.'t you see?" answered the Zouave, pointing to his cap.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes. Well, you did that smart enough, anyhow. Got a hole through your cap,
                  too, pretty near the head. Did he do it, just now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Haviland.</p>
               <p>"Well, confound his Yankee blood!" said the rebel. "He won't do so any more, just
                  now, I'll bet!"</p>
               <p>"I think he is an officer, trying to escape in other clothes. Take good care of
                  him and don't let him get away!" said the Zouave, with a refinement of ingenuity
                  which did great honor to his short military education.</p>
               <p>"Don't you want any thing? We couldn't have got him, you know, if you hadn't
                  stopped him!" said the rebel, as the rest were just completing their operations
                  upon watch, jewelry, well-filled purse, and all the other articles in the
                  merchant's possession. Others were getting up the fallen horses and preparing to
                  drive away with their prisoner.</p>
               <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC7282-00000207"/>
               <p>"No, nothing—<emph>I</emph> have been paid well enough!" answered the virtual
                  captor.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! here is a picture! the Yank has got a woman somewhere!" exclaimed one of
                  the rebels.</p>
               <p>"A picture? let <emph>me</emph> see it!" said Burtnett Haviland, stepping forward.
                  How much that word "picture" recalled, in connection with that man and his own
                  happiness! What if this should be the one to which Kate had referred!</p>
               <p>There was something in the voice that startled the merchant for a moment. He
                  looked hard at Haviland, but no human eye, not even that of his wife,
                     <emph>could</emph> have recognized him under that change in every particular.
                  Haviland took the picture, and at that moment, like a revelation, came to him what
                  he had before forgotten—that he had had that picture down at the store, and left
                  it there where the merchant could very easily have obtained it without any good
                  will of his wife. The thought disturbed him, for it half unsettled what had been
                  total misery submitted to and therefore endurable. As he examined the little
                  ambrotype, two or three of the butternuts were looking over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Purty, I tell you!" said one of them.</p>
               <p>"Them Nuthern wimmen is gallus, I reckon!" said another, who had been North on an
                  oyster-boat and seen "around the market" and perhaps even Broadway.</p>
               <p>"The Yank's mistress, I suppose!" said Burtnett Haviland, in a loud tone, glancing
                  at the prisoner out of the corner of his eye at the same moment.</p>
               <p>Charles Holt was a scoundrel, but no coward; and he lacked one vice—that of
                  boasting over female conquests never achieved—the dirtiest, meanest, foulest vice
                  of this age. Not even among those greasy butternuts would he do that, even by
                  implication!</p>
               <p>"No, by heaven!" he said, in a tone that left no doubt as to his sincerity. "That
                  woman never was my mistress, though the Lord knows I have tried hard enough to
                  make her so! She was too, smart—too <emph>good,</emph> I suppose, for
                     <emph>me!</emph> That is enough, and it is none of your business, you thieves,
                  any thing about it."</p>
               <p>Haviland reeled again, as if struck by one more of those ever-recurring blows.
                  Superadded to the exhaustion and the excitement of the day, this discovery of the
                  picture and assertion of the merchant were too much for him. There was vertigo in
                  his head, and a trembling in his limbs; and he was so fearfully excited that he
                  was almost on the point of betraying himself and sharing the merchant's
                  imprisonment by one imprudent question. But a thought of his danger and of the
                  merchant's intended if not actual guilt, confessed by his own lips, calmed him a
                  little, and he said:</p>
               <p>"Give me this picture, boys, for my share. You may have the rest."</p>
               <p>"Agreed!" said two or three voices, for such a distribution rather pleased the
                  rebels than otherwise; and Haviland dropped the picture into one of his pockets,
                  as he said:</p>
               <p>"Well, take care of the Yankee, boys. Some of our fellows are below here, and I
                  must go down and look for them."</p>
               <p>No effort was made to detain him, and he turned away and plunged into the woods,
                  looking back to see the rebels lifting the carriage around in the road and
                  thrusting Charles Holt and the driver into it, preparatory to giving them a ride
                  into the lines of Beauregard, as a turn on the road to Richmond.</p>
               <p>Half an hour later, skirting the woods stretching down Cub Run and striking thence
                  across to the Centreville road, Haviland was beyond danger from rebel capture and
                  up with some of the retreating Union regiments. Before that time, finding them no
                  longer necessary, he had thrown away the rebel pants and cap, easily supplying the
                  place of the latter with one of the Federal caps that so plentifully strewed the
                  way, and adding a jacket and a couple of revolvers to the equipment. At dusk the
                  crowd of fugitives had carried him into Centreville, amid such scenes as have been
                  hurriedly described in the previous chapter, but without their producing any
                  effect, for the time, upon him. His brain was whirling with new thoughts. Life
                  might be worth something, even yet. What if some dreadful mistake had occurred,
                  after all!—if his wife should yet be innocent! Oh, to get to New York without the
                  delay of one moment!—to solve the mystery which seemed so much thicker than it had
                  ever done before!</p>
               <p>Among the forty Zouaves who reported to Captain Jack<pb n="428-429"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000208"/> at Fort Ellsworth on Monday night, was Haviland.
                  But he did not remain. One glance at his sad face and one hearing of his earnest
                  words: "I <emph>must</emph> go to New York, Captain, immediately!" procured him an
                  informal leave from that officer, then become for the time the virtual commander
                  of what there was left of the regiment. The same hand supplied him with clothes to
                  replace those he had lost on the field, and money for his temporary use. Tuesday
                  morning took him to Washington, then one mass of fright, mourning, inefficiency,
                  wounded soldiers, beggared contractors, newspaper correspondents penning lies and
                  guesses, officers without commands, commands without officers, drunkenness, and
                  all that could disgrace the capital of a great nation. And Wednesday noon, the
                  24th of July, landed him in the city of New York, which he had left under such
                  widely-different circumstances not quite three months before, and where Coffee
                  Joe, the newsboy, a little dirtier and more dilapidated than we have seen him in
                  the spring, met him at the ferry with the sixteenth extra of that day, giving two
                  more lines of particulars from the lost field.</p>

                     JULY—HOW THE CITY AND THE COUNTRY MOURNED FOR THEIR SUPPOSED DEAD—MARY HAVILAND

                     BATTLE IN VIRGINIA—HOW THE OMENS THICKENED, AND MARY HAVILAND BECAME TEMPRARILY
                     A WIDOW.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THERE was a celebrated painter of old, who, when pressed to attempt a certain
                  grand picture which should embody great interest and command the attention of the
                  whole world, refused to do so from the insufficiency of his artistic materials and
                  his own powers. He would attempt it, he said, when the blue vault of heaven was
                  supplied him for a canvas, when the light of sun and stars and the forked
                  vividness of the lightning were all given him as colors for his palette, and when
                  Jove should inform his right hand with his own tremendous power for their
                  handling. Until then, his canvas should be a blank, so far as any connection with
                  that great subject was concerned.</p>
               <p>Very nearly the same disclamatory remark might with all propriety be made, when it
                  is demanded that a writer should attempt description of any of those peculiarly
                  black days which have fallen in the midst of the many dark ones of the
                  republic—making men's hearts sink within them under a fear little less deadly than
                  that which might fall in the sudden and unwelcome dawning of the Morning
                  Star—clouding the brow with a black shadow through which the sunlight of heaven
                  could no more shine than through the heavy stones that lie closed above a
                  burial-vault—turning love, the first passion of mankind, into a hollow mockery,
                  and avarice of wealth or power, the second, into a weakness not worth the
                  indulging—making idleness a torture and occupation impossible. Days when there has
                  seemed to be but one key-note to every thing in the heaven above or the earth
                  beneath: "Lost! lost!"—just as through every touch of one of Hogarth's greatest
                  pictures there is one feeling of desolate finality running, from the sun that is
                  never to rise again, going down behind the sea, to the watch dashed to pieces by
                  the dying madman, the murderer swinging ghastly upon his gibbet, the hour-glass
                  with the last sands just dropping out, and the half-open book with its last page
                  bearing the significant "Finis." Days which have made the nation old in an hour,
                  and caused its collective hair to whiten as that of the perilled wretch has
                  sometimes done when too much fear and agony for human endurance were crowded
                  within a limited space. Days which have "made history" with fearful rapidity, and
                  which have yet within them, perhaps, a more fearful curse than any yet developed,
                  in the temptation to "make <emph>novels!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The most notable of these, as yet, and perhaps the most desolately blind and
                  hopeless of all, was the Monday following the defeat of the Union forces at Bull
                  Run. The Peninsular<pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC7282-00000209"/> sular repulse from
                  before Richmond, Fredericksburg, the second Bull Run—all have been more important
                  reverses, in an actual military point of view; but they have all been comparative
                  trifles in public feeling, because they have all fallen in the midst of extended
                  warlike operations, and after other reverses and amid counterbalancing victories,
                  destroying their otherwise fearful isolated prominence. Nations are saddle-horses,
                  in the capacity to bear reverse as well as debt: they may be able to carry a
                  mailed warrior after long practice, but the weight of a child worries them at
                  first, and they do not willingly bear even the empty saddle itself. Nations are
                  children, with the same necessity for growth in any particular and with the same
                  capacity for discouragement, exhibited by the boy as compared to the man. A torn
                  coat is not much to a man of years and experience, who has worn an hundred
                  different coats and looks forward to wearing an hundred more; but a torn coat is
                  desolation to the boy just verging towards manhood, who has been for the first
                  time permitted tremblingly to overstep the bound and put on that modern substitute
                  for the ancient <foreign xml:lang="LAT">toga virilæ.</foreign> The first clearly
                  defined blast of the trumpet of fame tingles through the nerves more deliciously
                  than any after utterance; the first shaft of hostile criticism wounds more deeply
                  than any bolt that can be launched at the man grown seasoned to abuse; and it may
                  be that the first love torn away by death or falsehood leaves a more terrible void
                  than any after wrenching away of the whole race could create. To destroy a first
                  effort in any direction is little less than a "slaughter of the innocents"—that
                  first effort is so truly meant, so proudly looked upon, so overvalued.</p>
               <p>The blow of the defeat at Bull Run fell with peculiarly crushing force on the
                  community, because it marked the failure of a <emph>first essay</emph>—the
                  slaughter of one of those national "innocents." The battles of the republic had
                  always before been on that limited scale which made them little more than
                  skirmishes in comparison with the great conflicts of Europe and Asia; for a long
                  time, before the breaking out of the rebellion, with the single exception of the
                  short contest with Mexico, peace had been our constant and happy national
                  condition. The answer to the call of the President and the forming of the Army of
                  the Potomac, had been our first trial in what was considered <emph>war on a grand
                     scale.</emph> We had failed—miserably failed. Who wonders that the young
                  national heart should have bled—that the omen for the future should have been held
                  discouraging—that desolation and despondency should have settled down anew, with
                  every new detail and corroboration of the great misfortune, on the hope that had
                  been before so unreasonably and even childishly buoyant?</p>
               <p>New York city was once more prominent, in the grief that followed Bull Run, and
                  nowhere else could the spectator from another land have discovered so quickly, how
                  sadly the pall had fallen over and shrouded the banner. And this, too, had a
                  warrant. New York had license to be chief mourner at what seemed, for the moment
                  and to the faint-hearted, the nation's burial. No fight has ever since taken
                  place, in which so many favorite organizations and so many of what may be called
                  "citizen soldiery" have taken part. Reference to the account of the battle
                  heretofore given in these pages, as well as to common memory, will afford a
                  reminder that with the exception of the Seventh and two of three other regiments
                  which had failed to recruit in sufficient numbers for taking the field, the whole
                  body of the "household troops" were known to have been engaged in the conflict.
                  The Eighth, the Seventy-first, the Twelfth, the Sixty-ninth, the Seventy-ninth,
                  the Brooklyn Fourteenth, the Fire Zouaves—these were all type regiments for
                  themselves and others; and the general diffusion of sorrow which their
                  "cutting-up" would cause may well be imagined even by those who had no blood-kin
                  perilled in their ranks. For the slaughter of the "American Guard" and its brother
                  regiments, there would be closed doors in many a mercantile house and crape at the
                  bell-pulls of many of the wealthy dwellings of the metropolis; over the decimation
                  of the "fire-boys" there would be half-masted flags and mourning draperies on
                  every engine, hose and carriage house within the fire-limits; and to the "Wirra!
                  wirra!" of the Irish woman, wide over the city, mourning a son, a husband or a
                  brother killed in the<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC7282-00000210"/> thinned ranks of
                  the Sixty-ninth, there would answer the "Och hone-a-rie!" of her Scottish sister,
                  crooning the same lament over her dead of the Seventy-ninth, that rung hundreds of
                  years ago through Lochabar and the Braes of Appin.</p>
               <p>The news from the field—blended truth and falsehood—came precisely in such a shape
                  as to produce the worst possible feeling of anxiety and discouragement. They could
                  not have been more dexterously managed, had some fiend taken a contract for
                  breaking half the hearts in the city. First the movement was heralded with such
                  loud boasts of the certainty of the Union Army routing out the rebel wolf from his
                  lair of woods and batteries at Manasses, that the hearers ceased to remember that
                  there were chances in war and that victories could not be bespoken like coals or
                  beef-steaks! Then on Saturday and again on Sunday, came intelligence of the taking
                  of Fairfax Court House and the affair at Black-burn's Ford, the latter really a
                  repulse to the Union forces, in effect, but both gilded with all the mendacious
                  arts of newspaper letter-writers who seemed to think that boasts and hollow
                  self-glorifications were the most saleable commodities in the whole market of
                  intelligence, and made to appear like signal successes that only needed to be
                  followed up to annihilate the rebels and "crush the rebellion." Sunday was
                  especially prolific in "victories" that had never been won, and skirmishes in
                  which the advantage was skilfully set on the wrong side. But through all these
                  reports ran the one feature—<emph>desperate fighting.</emph> If the Union troops
                  had so far been successful, they had been so at the price of heavy loss—there
                  seemed to be no doubt on that point. This made the public heart sore, though not
                  discouraged. For the victory that had been promised, even the price of the blood
                  of friends and brothers could be paid, and yet no repining. But the condition of
                     <emph>success</emph> was inexorable; and there was a lacerated spot in that
                  heart, ready to receive the next blow that was so soon to fall.</p>
               <p>Monday morning, in the papers of that date, brought the sensation headings of a
                  great battle that had been fought on the day previous, near Manasses, and at a
                  place called "Bull's Run." (It needed days and even weeks before the terminating
                  ing "s" was dropped, at the instance of some who happened to have known the
                  topography of Virginia in the days of peace.) The letters and other accounts which
                  followed these headings, indicated no serious reverse, but something like a drawn
                  battle, yet the old burthen of the song again repeated—<emph>desperate fighting
                     and heavy loss.</emph> Certain regiments of the New York troops were
                  particularized as having made the most desperate charges and defences, leaving one
                  quarter or one half their numbers, as the ease might be, dead on the field. The
                  Seventy-first, the Sixty-ninth, the Seventy-ninth and the Fire Zouaves, as pet
                  regiments, were particularly spoken of, their valor lauded while their whole corps
                  were slaughtered—by the reporters! And even yet the public feeling endured and did
                  not murmur, however much it mourned. Even this for victory!</p>
               <p>The morning grew later, and the bulletins began to bear startling additions to the
                  news of the regular editions. The rebels had gained a slight advantage on Sunday
                  afternoon—the Union troops had fallen back from the attack. Still the same
                     undertone—<emph>desperate fighting and heavy loss.</emph> The general heart
                  began to be discouraged. All that heavy slaughter, after all, without result—with
                  even disadvantage to the Union arms!</p>
               <p>An hour or two still later—and then burst the peal of woful thunder that shocked
                  and stunned all ears. Extras made their appearance, and the anxious crowds around
                  the bulletins separated to read the words that seemed the death knell of the
                  republic. Not a drawn battle—not a slight repulse—not a defeat—but a total and
                  irredeemable rout; the Union troops flying like frightened sheep, disorganized and
                  disheartened, back upon Washington, and the victorious and infuriated rebels
                  slaughtering them at will! Whole regiments of favorite troops, not decimated, but
                  annihilated. Every corps—the whole army—cut to pieces. Not enough left to form the
                  nucleus of another army—not enough to offer an effectual defence of Washington,
                  where the Confederates would certainly be stabling their horses in the Capitol and
                  burning the public records in the Departments, before the rising of another
                  sun!</p>
               <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC7282-00000211"/>
               <p>Tales of horrible cruelty and yet more horrible butchery. Squads of ambulances
                  fired upon by whole parks of rebel artillery, and all the wounded they contained
                  blown to infinitesimal fragments. Disabled men begging for quarter, but bayoneted
                  by hundreds and even by thousands, by the infuriated conquerors. The dead hacked
                  in pieces with sabres, as so many hogs might have been, and their very quarters
                  distributed among different rebel corps as trophies. Indian barbarities outdone,
                  and the very atrocities of the Sepoys at Meerut and Cawnpore dwarfed into
                  insignificance. Loss—defeat—panic—hopeless ruin—slaughter!</p>
               <p>Such were the reports. We know, to-day, how grossly exaggerated they were, as the
                  previous reports of the successes had been. We know, now, how the Union troops won
                  the battle before they lost it, and that the panic only completed what
                  outnumbering had begun. We know, now, how small was the loss of almost every
                  regiment in the Union army, compared to what troops had often suffered before in
                  other services, and what others have since suffered in our own. We know, too, that
                  while too many of the allegations of cruelty made against the rebels were
                  disgracefully true, and while many must remain a damning stain against them to the
                  last day of recorded time,—many of them were the miserable exaggerations of the
                  frightened or the more miserable tales of the unscrupulous. We have seen one of
                  the Captains who was hacked into four pieces on the field (according to these
                  reports) come back from the Richmond prisons without any marks of that cruel
                  operation. We have winnowed out the wheat from the chaff of voluminous
                  misrepresentation, and know very nearly the truth of the story of Bull Run, which
                  would never have wrought us half the injury that it has done, at home and abroad,
                  if we had not been frightened children yelling at the bugaboo of a servant.</p>
               <p>But all these reports were terrible reality, then. They had their work of
                  extracting tears and groans, and they did it. Oh Rachel of the nation, how you did
                  mourn that day, for your children!—how you did shed tears of blood in response to
                  those kindred drops which seemed to have been poured out so unavailingly on the
                  battle-field!</p>
               <p>What a day was that in the city of New York!—and who that passed through can ever
                  forget it! The day after Sumter had been a spasm—this was an agony. The city lying
                  beneath the blazing heat of mid-summer—men panting for very breath in the streets.
                  The country seeming to lie under the blaze of the wrath of God, and panting for
                  its very life. Business suspended—sellers with no wish to sell—buyers with no
                  heart to buy. Men meeting with inquiries of sad omen, and parting without comfort.
                  More hands wrung in silence or with broken words, than had ever been, in anyone
                  day since the birth of the nation. Frenzied inquirers after friends and relatives
                  known to have been in the lost battle; no answers of consolation even from those
                  who had reached the city from the scene of the disaster. No pride in the past,—not
                  even the pride of believing that our troops had deserved victory if they had
                  failed to secure it; no sunlight in the future, with those ill-omened birds, false
                  and unscrupulous reports, darkening the air.
                  Anxiety—discouragement—desolation—mourning without certainty of death but without
                  hope of life—everywhere! God in His infinite mercy grant that that blackest of all
                  the dark days of the nation may never find a parallel!</p>
               <p>But the terrible news disseminated on the 22d of July, reached other hearts than
                  those that throbbed within the great cities. The blow did not fall so soon, by a
                  few hours, in the more quiet and isolated country sections, but it came with no
                  less crushing force from its short delay. The stony streets of the cities had not
                  alone echoed to the tread of the armed men who marched away to the campaign that
                  was ending so disastrously: the green lanes of the country had known the same
                  gathering and departure, and the plough and the scythe waited there for the
                  returning hand, even as the counter and the workshop waited in the town. There was
                  to be wailing along the green lanes as well as along the stony streets—fear,
                  discouragement and indignation around the doors of the little country tavern as
                  well as under the porches of the Astor House and the Continental.</p>
               <p>Mary Haviland had been just a week at the little farmhouse at Duffsboro, when the
                  news of Bull Run broke over<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC7282-00000212"/> the land.
                  The reader, not purposely but unavoidably kept in the dark as to her whereabouts
                  after leaving the house on East Forty-eighth Street, that terrible night, may
                  before this time have suspected that she had gone home—home to the place of her
                  birth and the sheltering arms of Aunt Bessy White. She had done so, indeed.
                  Protected by the policeman at the corner, and accompanied by him to the residence
                  of her family physician on Sixth Avenue, she had found rest and refuge there and
                  on the Monday following gone down to the little farm-house, to be received with
                  almost delirious pleasure and pity by the good old lady. All her griefs had been
                  poured into the sympathizing ears of Aunt Bessy, and they had all been consoled by
                  the assurance of that model aunt who should have been mother to half a generation,
                  that "wickedness would yet be punished and those who truly loved and trusted be
                  once more made happy." Then Kate had come down on the Wednesday following, for
                  reasons which will be hereafter fully understood; and between the two strangely
                  separated by misunderstanding, explanations had been made which sent them into
                  each other's arms with sobs and kisses—the school-mistress humble and abashed,
                  Mary sweet-tempered and forgiving. Not even Kate could tell the wife how much she
                  had misjudged her husband, as she could not know the secret of the lost letters
                  and the falsehood of the malicious reports affecting his character. But she had
                  been able to say enough to the wife, from intercourse personally held with
                  Burtnett Haviland by letter, and in the midst of her confessions that "she had
                  probably half-broken his heart by meddling with what she had much better left
                  alone—doing what she would never do again until she grew old enough to be
                  Methusaleh's grandmother!"—to satisfy Mary that her husband's silence had been the
                  result of neither guilt nor coldness, to show her how false her own position had
                  probably grown to be in his eyes, and to make her yearning love and burning desire
                  for his return even a thousand times deeper and more intense than they could have
                  been without the knowledge of that misunderstanding. One of the first fruits of
                  all this, in fact, had been the penning of a letter by Mary, addressed to her
                  husband at Alexandria, which, had it reached him before his departure, would have
                  sent him into battle with a different care for his life from that which he at
                  first exhibited. But, as the reader well knows, that letter could only have
                  reached Alexandria after the departure of the Zouave Company; and it probably lay
                  there waiting for him, with full explanations which would have made him the
                  happiest man in the world, at the moment when he rushed insanely back through that
                  town, on his way to New York and the quest for his wife, after the battle! So
                  vigorously and persistently we often strain body and brain, in the distant pursuit
                  of that which lies precisely under our own noses!</p>
               <p>How stronger and stronger every day, then, in the heart of the puzzled and anxious
                  but ever-loving little wife, grew this desire for her husband's return, which had
                  only been a dull pain before the late events, but now became a torture! What if he
                  should never come back—if her letter should fail to reach him and he wander away,
                  in some of the army movements, where communication was impossible! What if that
                  which had before been only a dim shadow of evil, should change to be a terrible
                  reality—if he should be killed without ever knowing, while in life, how truly her
                  heart beat for him alone, how false had been every word that set a shadow between
                  them!</p>
               <p>Bonnie Kate, the busiest, the most cheerful and the maddest minx that ever puzzled
                  a village or threw new life into a dulled circle in the great city—would have been
                  an excellent medium for the elevation of Mary's spirits, and would, in fact, so
                  have kept her in pleasant confusion as to afford little time for despondent
                  thought,—but that she had really so humbled her own position before her cousin's
                  wife, by her terrible mistakes and misunderstandings, as to be placed temporarily
                  on what might be called the "retired list" in the service of mischief, or, as she
                  herself expressed it, "obliged to be good when she did not wish to, one bit!" And
                  Aunt Bessy, ever good and hopeful, might have been found the quite-sufficient
                  consoler, had a shadow not rested over her heart and the household, in the memory
                  of the late death of Amos Haviland, on whose grave the young grass had scarcely
                  yet begun<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC7282-00000213"/> to spring, and whose shade
                  scarcely yet seemed to have departed from the doors it had unobtrusively
                  haunted.</p>
               <p>Aunt Bessy <emph>would</emph> talk of him, not alone to Kate, who had like herself
                  been with him and known him to the last, but to Mary, who had for years only seen
                  him during very brief visits, though she yet retained enough recollection of him
                  to make the knowledge that he had passed away, even in his century of old age, a
                  saddening one. And this, which kept alive the blended relations of war and death,
                  was by no means the mental pabulum on which the nervous and worried woman, who had
                  so lately been tried beyond her whole strength, should have been fed at that
                  juncture. "Misery loves company," of course, as the old proverb has it; but it
                  does not follow that misery always grows less poignant by the association; and
                  while it might be sadly jarring to the nerves of the widow of a week, to be thrown
                  suddenly into the society of half a dozen brilliant and laughing men and women of
                  the world, with wit, music and rattle alike at the ends of their tongues and
                  fingers, yet she might be quite as well prepared, at the end of a given period, to
                  meet her lonely fate and do battle with the world, as if that period had been
                  passed in the company of half a dozen people with long faces, black dresses, white
                  handkerchiefs, and who managed to excite each other to sympathetic tears and sobs
                  every half hour.</p>
               <p>Poor Mary Haviland, driven into new anxiety with reference to her absent husband,
                  found little to buoy up her spirits, in the temporary humility and silence of
                  saucy Kate or the sadly patriotic conversation of Aunt Bessy. No matter—the end
                  was coming, and coming rapidly.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, the 21st of July, at meeting at the little village church at Duffsboro,
                  the ladies from the old farm-house learned by conversation among the groups
                  gathered at the door before service, that newspapers had come down from the city
                  the evening before—that the Army of the Potomac had advanced—that a battle
                  (represented as a Union victory) had been fought on Thursday—that another and
                  heavier battle was unavoidable and might even then be in progress or decided. It
                  is now well known that the battle was at that very hour indeed deed in progress,
                  and that then (half-past ten to eleven) the whole body of the Federal troops were
                  first being hurled against the enemy, so that the spiritual ears of the
                  worshippers, could they have been keen enough, might have heard sounding over the
                  hum of conversation at the door, and afterwards floating in at the open windows to
                  blend with the sleepy drone of that summer noon discourse, the thunder of the
                  cannon then crashing over the field of Manasses.</p>
               <p>There may have been an hundred hearts in that little congregation, beating with
                  fear and anxiety for those dear to them and exposed to the shock of battle; but it
                  is only our province to measure the heart-beats of three in that whole number.
                  Aunt Bessy folded upon her breast the hands still so fair, when she heard that the
                  two armies were actually meeting in the first battle,—bent down her head and
                  uttered a prayer that the heavens heard though the ear of man lost it—a prayer for
                  perilled lives and for <emph>the land.</emph> Kate Haviland trembled like an aspen
                  leaf, then shook off the feeling, took home to her heart that peculiarly Yankee
                  confidence which <emph>knows that its own must conquer,</emph> and waited calmly
                  for what was to follow. Mary Haviland met the issue very differently from either.
                  Unnerved and overtasked as she had before been, her heart seemed to die within her
                  and lie thenceforth in her bosom a dull, cold lump of lead or stone! The previous
                  four days had been to her an omen of her husband's death—he was a member of that
                  Fire Zouave regiment so depended upon, in advance, for deeds of daring whenever
                  called upon to perform them, and so likely to be sent into the very thickest of
                  the conflict—he would fall if he had not fallen, and the hopes of her whole life
                  would expire with him. Yet, as of old, she determined to suffer in silence; and
                  she did not even tell to Kate or Aunt Bessy, as they went homeward from the little
                  church, how deadly was the fear that oppressed her. But nature had its revenge on
                  suppression, as usual; her pillow was that night wet with hopeless tears; and only
                  a mockery of sleep came to her, clasping little Pet close in her arms, just before
                  the robins began to sing in the peach-trees at dawn.</p>
               <p>Slowly and steadily fell the omens, each worse than the one<pb n="440-441"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000214"/> preceding. The afternoon boat of Monday brought
                  down to Duffsboro some of the extras containing the very worst announcements of
                  that day of the lost battle, the panic and the rout. They relieved the whole
                  country round with the news that all the regiments containing men from that
                  section had been held in reserve at Centreville, and that consequently there would
                  be no mourning homes in the neighborhood. But what was the "relief" brought by
                  that extra to Mary Haviland? The certainty that the Fire Zouaves had been in the
                  very front of the battle—that they had suffered beyond almost any other regiment
                  in the army—that they had been the subject of the worst cruelties of the
                  victorious rebels, their men shot down and bayoneted in cold blood, quarter
                  refused, their wounded fired upon in the ambulances, one of their Captains
                  quartered and his very body carried away piecemeal! What hope was there left for
                  Burtnett Haviland?—what for his wretched, hopeless, miserable wife? Thenceforth,
                  spite of the efforts of Aunt Bessy and Kate, who tried to play consolers while
                  their own hearts were full of fear and grief, the poor wife, tearless but
                  suffering a thousand times more than she could have been with the tears flowing
                  freely, rather staggered than moved about the farm-house; and when she went to her
                  lonely bed that night, though she slept from sheer exhaustion, sleep was no mercy,
                  so horribly came up in her dreams all the imaginary incidents of the lost battle,
                  thunder, cries, bloodshed—a dark cloud in the foreground of which her husband
                  seemed ever struggling with a host of foes, crying for mercy, fainting, bleeding,
                  dying.</p>
               <p>And yet there was one wretched, desolate hope, Not <emph>all</emph> could be
                  killed, even in the doomed regiment. The one dearest of all the world to her might
                  have escaped, even if only twenty, or ten, or five, should be left to tell the
                  melancholy, story. Oh, if he should be but alive, however wounded, maimed, a mere
                  wreck of the glorious type of manhood who had gone away from her!—how would her
                  whole future life be one long aspiration of thankfulness to Heaven for even
                     <emph>that</emph> mercy! Poor wife!—not even that sad hope was to be allowed
                  her, while passing through what the reader knows to have been only an imaginary
                  bereavement, but as terrible to her, for the time, as if the most fatal reality
                  had laid hidden behind it.</p>
               <p>It was at nearly noon on Tuesday that the young wife, silent and tearless in the
                  agony of her anxiety, sat with little Pet on her lap at one of the shaded windows
                  overlooking her porch and the road, twining her fingers absently in the silken
                  hair of her child, and her eyes looking out on vacancy in that fixed stare which
                  is so near to the glare of the maniac. Aunt Bessy was in the unromantic act of
                  rinsing white clothes from the wash of the day before, beside the old well with
                  its crank and bucket, a few feet from the porch, to the left. Kate was busied in
                  the kitchen behind the passage, in the preparations for dinner, the appetizing
                  savors of which floated wide through the house.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Mary Haviland heard a voice in conversation with Aunt Bessy at the well.
                  It was the voice of a man—some one had come up by the little path eastward at the
                  end of the porch. The wife summoned interest enough to turn her eyes more closely
                  in that direction, and then a deadly faintness seized her. She saw a man, whose
                  face she did not recognize, in the uniform of a soldier—blue Zouave jacket and
                  pants, with a red fez, but his face browned almost to the color of red earthen,
                  his uniform dingy and discolored, and his right arm slung to his side by a bloody
                  handkerchief depending from his neck. That last mark told of a participant in some
                  battle—the man might be conversing with her aunt of the great disaster from which
                  he had himself escaped—she <emph>must</emph> hear the words that were spoken. She
                  staggered to her feet, dragging little Pet by the hand, and moved to the door
                  opening upon the porch, where she could both see and hear distinctly. She might
                  almost as well have moved herself, as she knew the moment after, into point-blank
                  range of one of the rifled cannon that had been so fatal on the heights of
                  Manasses two days before!</p>
               <p>The man, as she could not be aware, was a scape-grace member of one of the best
                  families of the neighborhood, well known to Aunt Bessy, most of the time resident
                  in the city, but coming home often enough to be remembered. Nor could she know
                  from the changed uniform that he was a Zouave—<pb n="442-443"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000215"/> a member of the very corps which bad contained her
                  husband—one of the fugitives from the defeat and the regiment, coming home to be
                  nursed with his wounded arm. But what the eye failed to reveal the lips told too
                  soon and too suddenly. The young wife saw that Aunt Bessy had dropped the clothes
                  from her grasp and was starting back with upraised hands, in surprise and terror.
                  Half-fainting yet determined, she listened to what followed:</p>
               <p>"It was between three and four o'clock, not far from Sudley Church," she heard the
                  soldier say. "We were trying to support Ayres' battery—he and I belonged to the
                  same company, you know—but the rebs were too many for us, all the time. He was up
                  and all right, one minute—the next there was a perfect rain of balls over the
                  battery and all around us, and almost at the same moment a squadron of the rebel
                  horse followed the fire. I was hit here, in the arm, pretty badly, but did not
                  fall—only staggered against one of the wheels of a piece. He was not more than six
                  feet from me when the fire went by and the horse followed. I saw him fall, and saw
                  the horses go over him. The next, moment the dead were four or five deep, there,
                  and there was no living man at the bottom of the heap—I know that!"</p>
               <p>"You are sure that you could not be mistaken—that it was my poor boy that was
                  killed?" she heard Aunt Bessy gasp.</p>
               <p>"I wish I wasn't!" she heard the soldier reply. "I tell you, Mrs. White, that we
                  belonged to the same company. I thought I ought to stop and tell you. There was
                  not a better fellow in the regiment than Burt Haviland——"</p>
               <p>The informant went no further, for at that instant, from the piazza, went up a cry
                  of mortal pain and agony that sent Kate flying from the kitchen and Aunt Bessy and
                  the soldier hurrying to the spot. Mary Haviland had not fallen insensible, as some
                  might have done under similar circumstances. She had not even clung to any
                  support, but stood rigidly erect, her eyes set in a fearful spasm, her hand yet
                  grasping that of the frightened child, and her lips repeating that terrible cry
                  which seemed to embody all the torture of an overwrought body and a breaking
                  heart. Her lips uttered no word as they led her in; and she seemed rigid and
                  motionless but by no means lifeless, as they laid her on her bed, poor little Pet
                  crying over her "tick Mamma!"</p>
               <p>And that spasm lasted for more than two hours. No stimulant that the village
                  doctor, suddenly called over by a farmhand on horseback, could administer, had any
                  effect towards rousing her; no anodyne, when he adopted that mode of treatment,
                  had power to throw her into sleep. The doctor sat by her almost in despair, in
                  doubt whether insanity if not death from syncope, might not be the result; Aunt
                  Bessy and Kate, who knew that she must have heard all, ministered beside her like
                  human angels as they were, and tried to utter broken words of consolation; but
                  still there was no reply and no movement of the set eyes. Then the spasm seemed to
                  have spent itself. The watchers, late in the afternoon, saw her turn her head for
                  the first time, recognize little Pet, beckon her to the side of the bed and clasp
                  her to her breast, breaking meanwhile into tears and sobs that seemed to rend her
                  very being.</p>
               <p>"She is saved!" said the doctor, in a low voice. "There is no danger now."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" said the reverent lips of Aunt Bessy, while Kate went up to the side
                  of the bed, kissed the white forehead of the sufferer, and then remained smoothing
                  down the blonde hair as if she could communicate life and consolation through that
                  gentlest and tenderest of mediums.</p>
               <p>The doctor was right—the worst was over. Mary Haviland, bereaved, as she supposed,
                  of her husband, had determined to live for her child, and that agonized clasp of
                  her last link to life had been the first evidence of returned composure. Within an
                  hour afterwards she arose from her bed, calm, but oh, how unutterably miserable!
                  Then it was, thought flowing in its accustomed channels, that she began to suffer
                  the full measure of rational grief. Then it was that she realized the whole extent
                  of her bereavement, and knew how many more and worse arrows of agony fate could
                  add, and how many more human capacity could endure, than even those experienced
                  eight days before, on the night of her persecution and her flight.</p>
               <p>And here, for a little time, plunged in a grief that had ex<pb n="444-445"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000216"/> hausted its worst and most threatening features
                  within a few hours of its falling, and yet a grief that would probably remain
                  unassuaged until the last day of her life—here, wandering blindly in the thick
                  darkness of bereavement, yet so petted, caressed and consoled by the three dear
                  ones still left her, that long despair would have been impossible—here, for a very
                  little time, we leave the young wife. The light was coming, as we know—it was
                  nearly at hand. That day was Tuesday. Wednesday, as has already been recorded,
                  brought Burtnett Haviland to the city of New York. And thereafter, even we of this
                  writing and reading must wait. Only a faint and feeble picture has here been given
                  of the trials and griefs of one little wife who had given up her husband to the
                  service of his country and believed that she had parted with him forever in life:
                  what pen could depict the trials and the sorrows which have fallen upon so many
                  thousands of Union wives actually bereaved, and so many thousands of Union homes
                  permanently desolated, during all the long struggle?</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT is nothing uncommon in geography, as the travellers in many lands can tell us,
                  to find some little stream creeping lazily down out of the hills and through the
                  meadows, gathering breadth and force at every mile of its way and yet displaying
                  no sudden change, until it has at last become a rapid, rushing river, resistless
                  in the volume of its waters and terrible in the momentum of its current, before
                  which nothing of human erection can stand, and the only management of which is to
                  be found in obedience to the law of its might. Almost as often it happens that a
                  stream of circumstances in personal history, dallying and delaying for months and
                  even for years, arrives one day at a point beyond which there is no delay and
                  after which it sweeps on to the end with a rapidity inconceivable to those who
                  have so long idly watched the tardy movements of the past,—bearing lives,
                  fortunes, characters, like straws on its current, and closing in an hour what
                  seemed likely to endure for a century. If <q>
                     <l>"The mills o' the gods grind slow, but grind exceeding fine,"</l>
                  </q> there are times when the wheel revolves slowly, and others when it whirls and
                  clashes so rapidly as to dazzle and deafen the beholder; and Immar the Inevitable,
                  swinging his great flail in the garner of fate, sometimes brings down that weapon
                  on the bodies and brains of the condemned Irmenides with slow and measured strokes
                  that can be distinctly heard and counted as they fall; then anon breaks into a
                  very rage of justice and whirls that power of destruction so rapidly that only the
                  thunder of the aggregated blows meets the ear and only one constant flashing
                  glitter of the polished oak is seen through the gloom that wraps the universe.
                  Something of the same character of increased rapidity must now be assumed by this
                  narration, which only in that way can keep pace with the celerity of the closing
                  events it records; and all those events must be thrown into the intimate though
                  not involved relations of two closing chapters.</p>
               <p>All this while, though it has been more than once shown that Kate Haviland had
                  abandoned her employment in the city and returned to Duffsboro, no clue has been
                  given to the reasons which moved that slightly erratic and cometary person to
                  leave an engagement which she had at least pretended to take for a considerable
                  period, and to return to a vicinity where her clear profits at school-teaching,
                  according to her own arithmetic, footed up the magnificent figure of twenty York
                  shillings a year! Any omission of that character must now be repaired; and in the
                  explanation not only her own fortunes but those of the family of which she had<pb
                     n="446-447" xml:id="VAC7282-00000217"/> been for a little less than three
                  months an outside member, will be found involved.</p>
               <p>A somewhat strange scene was presented on Wednesday afternoon, the 17th of July
                  (some days before many of the occurrences already narrated), in the drawing-room
                  of the house of Mrs. Fullerton on East Twenty-third Street—that drawing-room on
                  the first floor which has long since been incidentally described, but in which
                  none of the incidents of this relation have as yet actually occurred. That "best
                  room in the house" has its mission now, for the house has a new visitor.</p>
               <p>At the opened piano on that occasion sat Miss Dora, who had evidently, from the
                  appearance of the musical hills and valleys with great ravines between and many
                  five-barred gates and a few dangerous ditches, on the sheet of music set before
                  her, been engaged in that description of violent steeple-chasing over the world of
                  sound, widely known and as widely anathematized by all listeners, as "practising."
                  But though she still sat at the piano, the eyes of the young lady had in them
                  nothing of the devotion or tenderness of music—they were restless, fiery and
                  blazing with anger, as those of a cat may be seen to be when that diminutive tiger
                  is driven into a corner and still worse danger threatens.</p>
               <p>At a little distance stood the dignified lady of the mansion, and if the eyes of
                  the young lady had something of threatening in them, those of the mother were
                  lakes of fire without soundings. Her dark brows were so bent in rage and her still
                  handsome mouth so wreathed in a blending of terrible anger and ineffable scorn,
                  that he must have been a bold man who expected to hear her next words without
                  wincing. Her shapely arm, from which the light mantle thrown hastily around her
                  shoulders had fallen back, was raised at the moment, and her fist clenched as if
                  object and not will was wanting for an Amazonian demonstration: and there was
                  something about the working of the mouth which indicated that only a little more
                  champing of the teeth would be needed to bring bloody foam from between the
                  lips.</p>
               <p>The third person of the group did not seem at all excited, meanwhile. He was a man
                  of medium height, rather thin, with high, bald brow, and hair and beard slightly
                  gray dressed in dark summer cassimeres, very gentlemanly in appearance and action,
                  and yet with unmistakable marks, to those familiar with criminal life and the
                  detective service, that his business had long been the disguising of his own
                  identity and the making of surreptitious discoveries. This was what he looked to
                  the instructed eye; and the impression did not belie him, for he had been for
                  years one of the most capable and trusted agents of the New York police
                  department, not long before this time transferred to the detective service of the
                  State Department, and much employed where tact and gentlemanly manners were both
                  known to be needed. This man sat on a chair four or five feet from the spot where
                  Mrs. Fullerton was standing, one hand playing with his chatelaine watch-chain and
                  the other holding the broad Panama hat of which he had not been relieved. Mrs.
                  Fullerton, of the raised arm and the clenched fist, was speaking:</p>
               <p>"Send us away, will you! I'd like to see you, or any of the Baboon's crew, do it!
                  Dare to lay hands on us, any of you, and you will know what it is to meddle with
                  the best blood of South Carolina!"</p>
               <p>"Oho!" said the official to himself, "this woman would hang herself, directly, if
                  I should give her rope enough, but I should have no fancy for carrying things so
                  far." He wished to whistle a little, but he did not, and only said, aloud: "You
                  mistake me very much, madame. 'Send away' is a hard word, and I did not use it. I
                  only said that it would be prudent for you and your daughter to leave the Northern
                  States, at once, and go South; and that arrangements would at once be made for
                  transferring you within the lines of the so-called Confederates."</p>
               <p>"'So-called!'" broke in the enraged woman. "'So-called!' I should like to know why
                  they should not call themselves Confederates, and who can hinder them! Jefferson
                  Davis is more of a President than your miserable—"</p>
               <p>"Mother," broke in Dora, who was not quite so mad as her parent. "Mother, remember
                  what you are staying."</p>
               <p>"The good lady does <emph>not</emph> remember what she is saying, I am afraid,"
                  said the official, rising, "though of course what<pb n="448-449"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000218"/> she says is quite safe in my keeping. Meanwhile,
                  ladies," drawing out his watch and casting a glance at the time it revealed, "I am
                  afraid that I shall be obliged to shorten a pleasure of my own and abridge an
                  intrusion upon yourselves, by leaving you to attend to other business. Am I to
                  understand that you decline to be guided by the advice I have offered?"</p>
               <p>"Altogether, sir!" said the matron, very decidedly. "We will remain here while we
                  please, and go away when we please."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," answered the imperturbable official. "Once more, you had better give me
                  your promise, and keep it, to be absent from this city within the next forty-eight
                  hours."</p>
               <p>"And once more I say that I will not submit any longer to this impertinence!"
                  almost shrieked the lady. "We hate you and your miserable government, and do not
                  care who knows it; but they lie who say that we have done any thing to place
                  ourselves in your power, and we will not stir one step. And now, sir, if you will
                  leave this house at once, very well; if not—".</p>
               <p>"People lie sometimes, but handwriting does not," said the official. "You put me
                  under the necessity, ladies, of adopting a tone that I would willingly have
                  avoided. You <emph>will</emph> take my advice, both of you, within the time I have
                  named, or, women though you are, you will certainly find the inside of a prison
                  within twenty-four hours after that time has expired! Did you ever see this paper
                  before?" and he threw suddenly open and held out to her a folded paper that he had
                  been drawing out from the inner side-pocket of his coat.</p>
               <p>"My letter to Walker!" exclaimed the lady, completely surprised beyond her guard
                  for the moment.</p>
               <p>"Exactly!" said the official, in the same equable tone: "Your revelation of the
                  projects of the Men of the True South, some minutes and names of one of the
                  meetings held here, and what some people call treason, in a very explicit shape.
                  Will you think better of it, and take-my advice?"</p>
               <p>"We will obey your <emph>orders!</emph>" said the lady, in a voice broken with
                  rage and hate. "Just like you sneaking spies and thieves, to steal letters out of
                  the mail. We will go, and the sooner the better, to get out of this miserable
                  abolition nest of peddlers and pickpockets."</p>
               <p>"I thought so. We shall depend upon your keeping your promise. Good afternoon,
                  ladies!" and the official bowed himself out as he might have done from the
                  pleasantest of interviews.</p>
               <p>"That letter—how ever did it get into their hands?" asked Dora, when the door had
                  closed.</p>
               <p>"Stolen, of course—just like them!" answered the mother.</p>
               <p>"And what are we to do now?" as another thought struck her. "I shall lose—"</p>
               <p>"That fool and his money? So you will! Oh, I could strangle the whole pack of
                  them!"</p>
               <p>"But, mother," said Dora, as still another thought struck her—" why that was the
                  letter that Minthorne took down to Washington himself! What does it mean? Could he
                  have——"</p>
               <p>"Betrayed us?" the mother concluded the question. For a moment her face darkened
                  still more, and she almost hissed out the words: "If he did, and I can make sure
                  of it, he will not live a week!" Then her face lightened again and her voice
                  changed, as she said: "Pshaw! what is the use of thinking of <emph>that?</emph> He
                  is too great a fool to do that much harm to anybody."</p>
               <p>"Still—why not ask him?" continued Dora. "Very luckily he went away before that
                  ruffian came in, and I suppose he is up in the school-room, dawdling again with
                  those children."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> ask him!" said the mother, and rising, she stepped out into
                  the hall and ascended the stairs, while Dora, yet a little confused at the
                  complication of affairs, remained seated at the piano but "exercised" in mind
                  only. Perhaps two minutes had elapsed, when she heard what sounded like a scream
                  from the upper part of the house, in her mother's voice, and she followed her
                  hastily up to the third story, where the spectacle that met her view was something
                  to be remembered even by a lady of the "best blood of South Carolina" with that of
                  Maryland added.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Fullerton reached the door of the school-room,<pb n="450-451"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000219"/> where she expected to find the millionaire-noodle
                  "dawdling with the children," the door was half open and she heard the millionaire
                  and the school teacher in conversation. Perhaps she did nothing more than some
                  ladies of much more refinement and principle would have done, in pausing at the
                  threshold for just one moment. But she certainly heard more than most ladies would
                  have been pleased to hear, and listened longer than she had at first intended.
                  "Come, it is time to get done with trifling," she heard the voice of Ned Minthorne
                  say, with nothing in it of the drawl and hesitation that had always saluted her
                  ears when he spoke. "I have asked you three-times, and really I think that if you
                  are ever going to answer me it is nearly time to begin. How many girls out of an
                  hundred, do you think, have an offer of marriage made them <emph>once,</emph> much
                  less <emph>three times?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Especially by a man worth a million!" answered the voice of the teacher, blended
                  with a merry, ringing laugh.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! let me hear no more of that!" said the voice of the millionaire. "If my
                  hand is not worth yours, without my money, it could not be made so by ten
                  millions."</p>
               <p>"Spoken like a man, and more than that—like a really nice, clever fellow!"
                  answered the voice of the teacher. "I have more than half a mind to put you out of
                  your misery. Stop! I have one question to ask <emph>you,</emph> before I answer
                  yours. Have you ever played false to the Union cause, for one moment, since the
                  secession commenced?"</p>
               <p>"Never, upon my honor!" solemnly said the voice of the young man.</p>
               <p>"If not, what did you do with that letter directed to Montgomery?" Female
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Took it to Washington, according to the direction, and there sent it in to
                  Secretary Seward, with my compliments, at the State Department." Male voice.</p>
               <p>"Bravo!" said the voice of the teacher. "Yes!—with all my heart!"</p>
               <p>It was at this juncture that Mrs. Fullerton, who had with difficulty restrained
                  herself during all that time at the door, found any longer restraint impossible,
                  under the double treachery that was so evidently being enacted under her own roof,
                  and dashed open the door with a scream that might with almost as much propriety
                  have been called a yell. Dora's nimble feet were but an instant in ascending the
                  stairs at the sound, and the scream had scarcely died away, and certainly
                  positions had not changed in interest, when she stood beside "her mother in the
                  open door and, saw what was being transacted in the school-room—a kind of
                  "dawdling with children" not set down in the programme!</p>
               <p>Neither of the children—to wit, Myra and Mildred—was to be seen; but near the
                  teacher's desk stood Ned Minthorne, with that young lady clasped in his arms, and
                  kissing her in that deliriously ravenous manner which indicates that the person
                  banqueting has been kept on "short commons" for a considerable time previously,
                  and that her is laying in a store against possible future deprivation. His arms
                  were both round the young girl's pliant waist; and, shame of shames!—hers not only
                  clung round his neck as if they had no intention whatever of loosening, but she
                  was receiving his kisses and paying back at least a part of them, with that
                  freedom and abandon which are so disgusting—to those who have no share whatever in
                  the feast!</p>
               <p>The fact is incredible, but the millionaire and the teacher actually kissed on,
                  and—well, the plain word may as well be used—hugged on, for quite a moment, after
                  that scream, and in fact until Miss Dora had a fair view of the interesting
                  operation, and threw in a supplementary howl of her own. Then they seemed both at
                  once to have discovered the presence of uninvited spectators; and Kate made a
                  motion to release herself with a little scream of surprise that compared with the
                  sounds uttered by either mother or daughter as a zephyr does to a tornado or a
                  penny trumpet to a locomotive whistle; while Ned Minthorne still kept his left arm
                  around her and merely stared at the intruders as if they had been two new
                  specimens in his pet study of natural history.</p>
               <p>All this was a little too much for the "Southern matron," who made a dart forward
                  as if she would tear the lovers not only apart but into several pieces,—followed
                  by Miss Dora, who had already fallen into a speechless passion of tears and sobs.
                  And yet, strangely enough, even in the midst of her<pb n="452-453"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000220"/> passion, Mrs. Fullerton seemed to retain some
                  regard for and some hope of the million or more for she began to pour out all the
                  vials of wrath upon the female head and that which wore no gilded crown of
                  wealth.</p>
               <p>"You shameless hussy! You dirty trollope! These are the goings on in my house, are
                  they?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Fullerton," said the millionaire, very calmly, and still without any
                  hesitation in his speech, "be kind enough to recollect that if there is any fault
                  here it is mine, and to know, if you do not know it already, that this young lady
                  is to be my wife!"</p>
               <p>Audacious as were these words and all the surrounding circumstances, it is
                  doubtful if they would have struck either mother or daughter with more surprise
                  than the manly and unembarrassed manner of their utterance, so unlike what they
                  had been used to hearing from the millionaire noodle,—had either been cool enough
                  to recognize the difference. But just now rage was uppermost in the one and
                  spiteful tears prevailed over the other; and the mother went on with her
                  objurgation:</p>
               <p>"You low-lived, low-born, miserable Northern scum, out of my house you go this
                  instant, and you deserve a whip on your back as you go!"</p>
               <p>Something in these words produced an effect she had not contemplated, and an
                  effect that might have been escaped (at least for the time) but for their
                  utterance. Kate Haviland had not said one word, so far; but now she flung herself
                  free from the arm of her lover, thrust her hand suddenly into the bosom of her
                  dress, took out a yellow folded paper and shook it from its folds, as she said, in
                  a tone that was far from being good-humored:</p>
               <p>"Hold on, madam, before you call the grand-daughter of a soldier of the Revolution
                  and an officer of the last war, 'lowborn' and 'low-lived,' and talk about putting
                  a 'whip on her back,' until you get clear of a little of your own <emph>negro
                     blood!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What!" cried the millionaire, and he was too nearly struck, dumb to say more.
                  Dora Fullerton dropped into a chair and covered her face with her hands, and the
                  light storm of tears and sobs that had before been passing over her deepened into
                  such a tempest of agitation as seemed to threaten her life. As for Mrs.
                  Fullerton—it has been said that when standing at the door her scream was almost a
                  yell. The sound that she uttered at this moment blended scream, yell and roar in
                  one ungovernable and indescribable sound of rage, as she sprung forward at the
                  young girl as if she would tear her to pieces with her naked hands, raving out,
                  with other words that cannot be penned here:</p>
               <p>"Liar! liar! wretch! oh, I will tear out your black, lying heart!"</p>
               <p>But Ned Minthorne's hand, small and white but strong enough for that purpose,
                  first thrust Kate Haviland behind him and then shoved away the enraged woman; and
                  storm as the latter would, the words of the young girl, now thoroughly out of
                  temper, could be heard distinctly:</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam—negro blood! I would have spared you this, had you kept your temper
                  and your tongue. Now take it all, for you have deserved it. I hold in my hand the
                  manumission papers given by your father, Judge Clifton Brixtone, of Columbia,
                  South Carolina, to you, his slave daughter Olympia, the child of Myra, his
                  quadroon slave. Deny it if you dare, you miserable old woman who talk to a
                  free-born Northern woman about 'low birth' and 'whips'!"</p>
               <p>There are points beyond which the human system, however strong and
                  well-disciplined, cannot resist the pressure of the spirit that rages within. Mrs.
                  Fullerton made one more spring forward, as she realized that the dark secret of
                  her life was at last discovered, her social position swept away, and her
                  daughter's chances of wealth destroyed; then she threw up her hands to her throat,
                  while the word "Liar!" gurgled there, tottered and fell heavily forward in one of
                  those dense swoons that are mercies to the mind however painful to the body.</p>
               <p>The curtain may well be dropped here, as the daughter still sobs helplessly in her
                  chair and the others gather around the miserable woman and try to recover her. And
                  yet, as it goes down, perhaps the reader of this narration may be able to discover
                  what had been the skeleton ever sitting at the feast of this family. Negro blood—a
                  thing well enough<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC7282-00000221"/> in its mixture with
                  white, according to the new lights,—but not yet recognized as a necessary
                  component by "our best society." That reader may remain in doubt, as does the
                  writer, whether Randolph Fullerton, purser in the United States Navy, ever knew
                  that he had married a mestizo wife, the daughter of a quadroon slave, and whether
                  his arriving at such a knowledge was or was not one means of plunging him into the
                  drunkenness which ended in his falling overboard and drowning at Port Mahon; but
                  that reader will not remain in doubt, this clue furnished, how Charles Holt,
                  merchant, must have revolted, after his marriage with Olympia Fullerton the
                  younger, at finding himself trapped in that manner with the "best blood of South
                  Carolina"—how separation between husband and wife was instantaneous and eternal,
                  from the moment of the discovery—how that domestic ruin fostered the seeds of evil
                  in his nature, and made him a worse and wickeder man than he might ever have grown
                  to be under other circumstances—how he became an unbridled voluptuary and his wife
                  a reckless wine-bibber, the husband keeping the family's secret through all those
                  years, in order to keep that of his own disgrace holding over them all that iron
                  hand which without the key seemed so inexplicable, and actually pensioning them
                  and allowing them to be supposed pure-blooded and wealthy, that some other fool
                  might be trapped with Dora as he had been with Olympia!</p>
               <p>The government official of the suave demeanor was right when he said that both the
                  ladies <emph>would</emph> leave the city of New York within forty-eight hours. On
                  Friday morning Mrs. Fullerton, Dora and the two children went Southward, with how
                  much of means of subsistence suddenly snatched from the abundance which had before
                  surrounded them, it is impossible to relate with certainty. But something else
                  occurred, upon which neither the official nor yet the family had calculated.
                  Charles Holt was absent from the city, at Washington. When informed of the
                  betrayal of the secret and the enforced flight of her family, Olympia Holt arose,
                  girded herself, shook off the dust from her feet against the house where she had
                  so heavily sinned and suffered, "spoiled the Egyptians" by loading herself with
                  all the jewelry she possessed and all the money and small valuables within her
                  reach, and "wandered on with her people."</p>
               <p>Kate Haviland was before that time in the arms (ever those <emph>arms,</emph>
                  enfolding all the world!) of dear, good old Aunt Bessy, at Duffsboro, and in some
                  other company that we wot not; and the drama of the handsome house on West
                  Twenty-third Street was closed.</p>
               <p>No slow-moving cars, now—it was in a carriage driven at flying speed (almost like
                  that he had stopped so suddenly on the Centreville road, three days before) that
                  Burtnett Haviland dashed up Cortlandt Street and Broadway and the Third Avenue, on
                  Wednesday, the 24th of July, immediately after his arrival from Washington. His
                  brain was in a whirl. Every hour made him more and more doubtful whether he must
                  not have been the victim of some terrible villany—whether the wife he had supposed
                  lost forever might not be pure and spotless after all. And yet—her flight?—she
                  must have fled—Kate could not have been deceived—what <emph>could</emph> that
                  flight mean, but guilt? Still, those words of the merchant—so unimpeachable a
                  testimony to her truth—why should they have been spoken in falsehood? And where
                  was she? Not at home, of course; yet he must go there, and go at once, or go mad.
                  Even to stand where Mary and himself had once been so happy, would be
                  something.</p>
               <p>Such was his frame of mind as he dashed up to the front of the house on East
                  Forty-eighth Street, flung open the door of the carriage, and leaped out. He ran
                  up the steps and laid his hand on the knob of the door. It yielded, and he went
                  in, the driver waiting without with the carriage. Nobody seemed to hear him—the
                  hall floor and the stairs were bare—so unlike the cozy nest of love and home that
                  the little house had been! He went up stairs, his brain throbbing wildly and his
                  heart beating with a worse excitement than he had known when making the first
                  charge at Sudley or fighting over the guns of Ayres' battery. Hurriedly into both
                  rooms and the little bed-room; but no one to be seen. Every thing nearly as he had
                  known it of old—nothing removed,<pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC7282-00000222"/> only a
                  little disordered. Ah, there had been fire in the range in the little back-room,
                  and some fragments of bread and meat lay on a plate on the side-board. Joy!—there
                  was somebody in the house, after all! But where?</p>
               <p>He passed up the second stair to the bed-rooms, and there his footstep seemed to
                  be heard. A figure darted out of one of the rooms. Was it his wife?—no, it was the
                  figure of Sarah Sanderson; but he scarcely knew the face, it was so changed and
                  woe-begone—so pinched and starved-looking. Some of us have seen a cat, discovered
                  when long shut up in a granary or an upper room, and nearly starved as well as
                  made wild with loneliness. The expression of the poor girls face was something of
                  that desolate and almost fearful character.</p>
               <p>"Why, Sarah!" was all that the returned Zouave could ejaculate.</p>
               <p>For an instant the girl did not recognize him, in his changed uniform and with his
                  bronzed face and close-cut beard and hair. But his voice reassured her, and the
                  moment she knew that it was indeed Burtnett Haviland whom she saw, she dropped on
                  her knees before him, caught her arms around his leg, burst into tears and sobs
                  that seemed to come from a heart nigh bursting, and broke out with:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Haviland! what have I done! kill me—kill me, Mr. Haviland!"</p>
               <p>"My wife, Mary—quick, tell me where my wife is!" was the answer of the equally
                  agonized husband.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know! I don't know!—she went away, somewhere, and I drove her away, I
                  suppose! Do kill me, Mr. Haviland—I have been so wicked!"</p>
               <p>"You!" said the husband. "What have' you done, Sarah?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, every thing that was bad!" sobbed the poor girl; whose week of loneliness in
                  the house, keeping vigil on Kate's bounty and under her orders, waiting for
                     <emph>some</emph> one to come back and attend to the goods and furniture it
                  contained, seemed to have been blessed by the celestial influences with an insight
                  into her own heart which the poor warped and half-educated nature had never before
                  found strength to take. She arose from her knees—dragged Haviland into her room
                  —showed him the letters that his wife had written and that she had herself kept
                  back from the mail, hidden away in a locked drawer,—and amid tears and sobs and
                  such implorations for pity and forgiveness as might have moved a colder heart than
                  she was addressing, told him all she knew of the wrongs under which himself and
                  his wife had been suffering ever since their separation. It was a terrible
                  confession, and some men, in the midst of it, might have been moved to a deed,
                  even upon a woman, that would have furnished subject of regret for a whole life.
                  But Burtnett Haviland had been seasoned in sorrow and wrong, within a few weeks.
                  He listened with set teeth, and only once, when the sublime villany of the stopped
                  letters was recounted, broke out with words that the girl little understood:</p>
               <p>"The scoundrel! I ought to have killed him on the spot! Richmond is no punishment
                  for <emph>him!</emph>" He did not know, then, let it be remembered, half that
                  Richmond could do in the way of supplying expiation for mortal sin!</p>
               <p>"And how could you do this?" at length he asked, when, the whole terrible crime
                  had been related. "What had Mrs. Haviland or myself done to you, that you should
                  do that villanous bidding? Oh, Sarah! Sarah!—how <emph>could</emph> you?"</p>
               <p>That thin, pinched, sorrowful face was red as the peony in a moment. All the blood
                  in her little body seemed have rushed into it, as she dropped once more on her
                  knees, clasped her hands so piteously and so repentantly, and tittered that last
                  confession that only the breaking up of the very depths of her being could have
                  wrung from her.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>must</emph> kill me, Mr. Haviland, because I have been so wicked! I
                  hated your wife because I loved <emph>you</emph> and had loved you ever since I
                  was a little girl, away off yonder in the country. I drove her away, but I would
                  die to bring heir back again and make you both happy, now! Oh, what will become of
                  me?"</p>
               <p>We forgive nothing so quickly or so easily as even crime done for love of
                     <emph>ourselves.</emph> Haviland was mortal, and he forgave the poor girl from
                  that moment, however impossible he might have felt it to be that the wrongs
                  committed could ever be repaired. And then her story added to his chances<pb
                     n="458-459" xml:id="VAC7282-00000223"/> of happiness. His wife had
                     <emph>not</emph> forgotten or neglected him when he thought her guilty of that
                  wrong: her own yet unopened letters bore that witness. And yet her story added to
                  his agony, for she <emph>had</emph> fled away, and Kate knew nothing of her, and
                  all was yet darkness and desolation, with only one glimmering spark to lead to the
                  possibility of happiness.</p>
               <p>He questioned the girl further. She had asked the neighbors—not one of them had
                  seen or heard any thing of the wife since her flight. Moments were years, for the
                  great end of his life seemed no nearer than when he had reached the house, So far,
                  all that remained to him of wife or child, hung over the mantel in their pictures.
                  He had time to breathe a word of forgiveness to the heart-stricken girl, to give
                  her some money, with orders still to remain in the house until she heard from him
                  again, to kiss the dear pictures over the mantel, and to cast one more glance into
                  the little bedroom that had been his nest of love before the birds flew away; and
                  then he sprang again into the carriage and dashed down-town.</p>
               <p>To the store, next. It was but a remote chance, but some one there might have a
                  clue to her whereabouts. If her flight had really been innocent, she might have
                  thought of the possibility of his return, and sent her direction there. A wild
                  hope, indeed! He found the store of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews in confusion, owing
                  to a report which had come on from Washington that the senior partner had gone out
                  to see the battle of Bull Run on Sunday, and that he must either have been killed
                  or taken by the rebels! And what a demoniac satisfaction there was for the
                  agonized husband, for the moment, looking at the puzzled and anxious faces of
                  Wales, and West, and Nellis, and thinking how much he could tell them of that
                  matter, if he only would! But he was not very likely to betray his own secret,
                  even in a boast; and it is doubtful whether either of the clerks has ever known,
                  to this day, and after all the investigations of the lawyers in winding up the
                  concern and handing over the profits of shoddy contracts to one partner and to
                  distant heirs-at-law of the other, precisely how Charles Holt fell into the bands
                  of the rebels at Cub Run.</p>
               <p>But nothing of Mary. No one of the clerks mentioned her to him, and she had
                     <emph>not</emph> sent her direction. Another hope gone! He was turning away
                  heart-sick, and just leaving the store to take that dernier resort of making an
                  application for aid at the police headquarters, when just as he reached the door,
                  little Tim, the cross-eyed and the scrubbing-brush-headed, was coming in with a
                  bundle of letters from the post-office. He remembered the boy's queer dispatch in
                  an instant, and how nearly it had proved to be true. It appeared to make him a
                  link between husband and wife: and when the boy laid down his letters and came
                  back to the door, there seemed to be a vague hope in the mind of the husband that
                  he who had know what others failed to know, before, might, know something now.</p>
               <p>"Mister Hevlin, don't think of that ere box I throwed over on your leg, or about
                  that ere letter I writ you!" he said, very imploringly, as his old friend took him
                  by the stubby hand. "I didn't mean nothin' bad, Mister Hevlin—I 'clare to man I
                  didn't! Dern old Holt—I didn't like him, and I don't care ef the seseshers
                     <emph>hev</emph> ketched him—that's all! I don't believe he meant right by
                  Missers Hevlin, no how, but I s'pose he went away to Europe or England or some of
                  them ere parts, so that he hadn't no time to do nothin', 'r else I dunno what
                  might ha' come of her."</p>
               <p>"Ha," said Haviland to himself, "they have evidently heard nothing whatever of the
                  scoundrel's movements, down, here at his own place, or the boy would have known of
                  them!" An additional pang of agitated joy went through his heart as he thought of
                  the corroboration thus given to all the circumstances weighing in his wife's
                  favor: but another deadly fear followed, that he was to catch no clue to her
                  whereabouts from Tim, from the fact that the boy had made no allusion to any such
                  knowledge, even when speaking of her. These thoughts kept him silent for an
                  instant after the errand-boy had ceased speaking: and all that time the squint
                  eyes were devouring his face with that keenest of all anxieties which looks for
                  forgiveness of an injury, from one almost worshipped. At last the suspense could
                  be endured no longer, and the boy, who really believed that his old friend was
                  growing implacable<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC7282-00000224"/> under the reminder
                  of his past conduct, repeated the imploration:</p>
               <p>"I didn't mean no harm, Mr. Hevlin—I 'clare to man I didn't; and you mustn't think
                  hard o' me!"</p>
               <p>"You didn't mean any harm, and you didn't <emph>do</emph> any harm, Tim," said the
                  husband. "But, Tim, did you ever see any thing of Mrs. Haviland afterwards? I have
                  just come home, you know, and don't know where to find her. She has gone out of
                  town, I suppose; and didn't expect me back, and so she has shut up the house and
                  left me no direction." How the heart of the husband beat with anxiety as be framed
                  this excuse to the boy for what was yet his possible shame!</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I've seen her," said the boy. "Seen her—dern it, I forgit the day—one day
                  last week. I was down to the railroad boat at the foot of —— Street, carryin' a
                  bundle, and I seed her go aboard with that derned purty little girl o'yourn with
                  her. She looked kind o' peaked, but I guess she'll get better now you've
                  come—won't she?"</p>
               <p>Poor Tim had been at the Bowery circuses on pit-tickets, two or three times in his
                  uneventful life; but he had never seen clown or gymnast make such a bolt as
                  Haviland exhibited, off the steps of the store and down the street towards the
                  wharves that lay full in sight with their mingled masts and smoke-stacks; and as
                  the seeker disappeared two blocks away, he muttered to himself:</p>
               <p>"Wonder what the dernation is the matter of him! Had all his hair cut off and must
                  ha' got sun-struck down among them are seceshers, I guess!"</p>
               <p>Burtuett Haviland, meanwhile, was fleeing as if for his life, towards the pier
                  from which the railroad boat left, which had been designated by the boy. And all
                  the time he was mentally knocking his head with his fist and saying: "Fool! fool!
                  why did I not think of that? She has gone home—hom!"</p>
               <p>Some three hours by boat and road, but they seemed three centuries to Haviland,
                  before he dropped from the cars at the little station nearest Duffsboro and walked
                  across the mile of fields separating the village and the railroad. He had asked no
                  questions on the boat, of any who might have known the whereabouts of his wife; he
                  was determined to meet complete happiness or utter misery at once—not drink either
                  in by slow and miserable degrees. Changed as he was, and not so well known as of
                  old in the section of country which supplied many of the passengers for the
                  way-station, he escaped recognition, or he might have become a subject of general
                  astonishment and conversation, so widely had the news of his death spread within
                  the previous twenty-four hours, among those who had been acquainted with him in
                  other years.</p>
               <p>It was past sunset and falling dusk when he stepped from the path behind the
                  house, on the end of the little porch where Aunt Bessy and Kate had stood that
                  Sunday morning and seen the flag raised on the spire of the village-church. Aunt
                  Bessy was coming out of the door. He recognized her at once: he was so much
                  changed that she did not at first know the rough and cropped soldier who accosted
                  her, and it was only when he managed to conquer the rising in his throat enough to
                  say: "How dy'e do, Aunt Bessy?" that she knew the voice and threw her arms around
                  his neck and greeted him with a cry of joy wild enough to alarm the whole
                  household:</p>
               <p>"Burtnett, oh Burtnett! my dear boy, how glad I am to see you! You are
                     <emph>not</emph> killed!—Heaven be blessed for all its goodness!"</p>
               <p>It was a terrible task for the anxious husband to calm down his voice enough to
                  ask: "Is Mary here?" and by the time he had done so, the good old lady, her own
                  ebullition of joy over, thought of some of the naughty stories she had heard of
                  her nephew while away at the war, and concluded to tease him a little:</p>
               <p>"Mary? Why how should <emph>she</emph> be here? Kate is here!"</p>
               <p>And at that moment the ci-devant schoolmistress came out of the door. Burtnett
                  Haviland had her in his arms before he realized that it was not indeed his wife;
                  and she heard him mutter:</p>
               <p>"Only Kate!"</p>
               <p>"'Only Kate,' you impudent wretch!" said the merry girl, who even then could not
                  altogether restrain her propensity<pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC7282-00000225"/> for
                  mischief, though the warmth of her embrace showed the real joy of her heart. "See
                  if I don't pay you for that insult, some time or other! You may go away and be
                  killed in earnest, next time!"</p>
               <p>But she spoke to the summer evening breeze that was coming in over the
                  stubble-fields, or she might as well have done so; for another figure came out of
                  the door but a moment behind her, there were two names called in one scream of
                  joy, and holding that figure in his arms the returned soldier, forgetting all the
                  past for one moment in the delight of that long kiss of reunion, and catching
                  those words of heart-felt joy that almost took away the breath of the speaker as
                  she uttered them, and that told how false must have been every word that militated
                  against the abiding truth and fondness of this dearest of wives: "Burtey! Burtey!
                  oh my husband; you have come back to me at last! Burtey! Burtey! my husband; How I
                  have gone mad because I believed that you were dead—that I should never see you
                  again—that our poor little Pet had no father!"—! did not say: "Only Mary!" but:
                  "My dear, darling wife!—worth all the battles and all the causes in the
                  world!"</p>
               <p>And then another figure, much smaller, toddled out into the gathering dusk on the
                  porch, and another embrace, almost as dear, was turned into a temptation to
                  laughter by little Pet's remark, feeling around his face, that "Papa had tut off
                  mos' all his viskers!"</p>
               <p>Explanations are proverbially dull, and there are none to make in this instance.
                  It is to be supposed that husband and wife indulged in several octavo volumes of
                  them between that time and the hour next morning when the birds woke them, singing
                  the peach and cherry-trees under their windows. But to the reader all these have
                  been forestalled; and even if they had not been, only the merest folly could tempt
                  the recital. Abu Taleb, the great Turkish preacher, refused to lecture in the
                  mosque one morning, because a part of his expectant auditory already knew what he
                  was going to say and had no need of being instructed, and the balance did not know
                  what he was going to say and could not be made to understand within such a limited
                  period; and his droll idea holds good in the present instance. Of those who read,
                  a few have passed through the agonies of such separations between those who love,
                  believed to be eternal, and the unutterable joys of such reunions. They know,
                  without an attempt at leading, their minds into that channel, what are the words,
                  what the broken sobs, what the long embraces, what the wakings in the night and
                  reachings out of the hands to feel whether the returned happiness has not existed
                  only in a dream,—that come with the weaving together once more of those chords
                  which make the divinity of human life; and to them words would be wasted. The
                  great balance of readers, meanwhile, have never known either the pangs or the
                  transports of such an epitomizing of all that is most enjoyed and all that is most
                  dreaded in the experience of love; and to them, lacking the knowledge of the
                  "shibboleth," all would appear gross exaggeration and unreality. The dramatist is
                  right when he drops the curtain suddenly, at least for the moment, on the embrace
                  of rejoined affection or the agonized clasp of the hands over the body of a dead
                  lover or a dead love. Either scene is sacred to the blessed or the bereaved, and
                  either unintelligible to all who stand without the gate. So falls the curtain on
                  the reunion of Burtnett Haviland and his wife—the one apparently rescued from the

                     FAREWELL, AND YET NO FAREWELL, TO THE "DAYS OF SHODDY."</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR a month Charles Holt had shared the captivity of the Union troops taken at
                  Bull Run and elsewhere—shared all<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC7282-00000226"/> that
                  suffering, abuse and near approach to starvation, which will in future days make
                  the old Ligon Tobacco Warehouse on Main Street, Richmond, the peer in history of
                  the Jersey Prison-Ship, the Old Sugar-House, and almost of the Black-Hole of
                  Calcutta, If the Confederates had food at command, they starved the Union
                  prisoners with full purpose: if they lacked themselves, they had some excuse.
                  Heaven and the future will arrange all that little matter of responsibility and
                  punishment. We have nothing to do, here, with the details of "prison-life at
                  Richmond," which so many have tasted, by the way, within the past three years,
                  that Richmond is becoming better known to the people of the North than even to
                  most of the native Virginians!</p>
               <p>Charles Holt had ample leisure, eating his bad and scanty beef, hard bread, and
                  drinking his bean coffee, to remember his luxurious dinners at the lonely table on
                  Fifth Avenue. He also had leisure, on his miserable pallet, at night, to think of
                  hair-mattresses, beds of down, and other luxuries equally attainable. And he
                  seemed likely to have even more leisure for such profitable contemplations. The
                  Federal government had either no power or no time, to look after the welfare of
                  its captured soldiers (another branch of "shoddy" management, not yet
                  finished)—how then could it be expected to look after civilians who had had no
                  business whatever on the battle-field, and of whose capture the general verdict
                  was that gruff but expressive Western one—" Sarved' 'em right!"</p>
               <p>One day, late in August, the merchant had two lady visitors. Somewhat to his
                  surprise, when he was allowed by the sentry to go to the door and speak to them
                  within ear-shot, they proved to be his wife and mother-in-law, who had been duly
                  passed within the rebel lines, transported to Richmond, and a day or two before
                  informed that Charles Holt was a prisoner in the Tobacco Warehouse. It would be
                  falsehood to say that the greeting was cordial on either side—it was the reverse.
                  The ladies wanted <emph>money</emph>—the most universal of all wants, and that
                  which may always be "bet upon" as the particular errand of male or female, when no
                  other is known. Mrs. Fullerton, who seemed in high feather in Secessia,
                  principally acted as spokeswoman (a habit of hers) and suggested that the merchant
                  owed something to his wife—that they had influence with the Confederate
                  authorities and might be disposed to sell him a little indulgence. The merchant,
                  whose breakfast of mouldy bread and muddy coffee had not been satisfactory, was in
                  an ill humor and did not wish to purchase. On the contrary, very much in defiance
                  of the feelings of the sentry (as well as his bayonet—bayonets "think!") he
                  addressed the two ladies, at the end of Mrs. Fullerton's peroration, in the
                  following words:</p>
               <p>"You are now among the niggers, where you belong—you know why! You can stay here,
                  or go away again, or rot, or starve, or do any thing else you like, so that none
                  of your cursed brood ever comes near me again. If ever you get another cent of my
                  money, it will be after I am dead. Now go—and the sooner you go to perdition, the
                  better!"</p>
               <p>They went, accordingly, and did not trouble him again—at least they did not
                  trouble him again in that manner. Three clays afterwards, there was another
                  arrival of prisoners, and some bustle on Main Street in front of the prison, in
                  consequence. A few of the prisoners tried the dangerous experiment of thrusting
                  their heads out of the windows to see what was the cause of the disturbance. Three
                  ladies were just turning the corner of Twenty-fifth Street and Main, when one of
                  them looked up and saw the row of heads. A sentry stood at the corner—one of those
                  rough, deadly marksmen from the South-western rivers. The woman, whose eyes were
                  heavy and red with liquor, spoke quickly and sharply to the soldier:</p>
               <p>"Look, quick, at the end window there. See that Yankee trying to escape. Shoot
                  him, and I will give you a gold dollar."</p>
               <p>The last word was scarcely out of her mouth, when the sentry, who probably had no
                  particular objection to riddling any part of the building where a "Yank" showed
                  his head, raised his piece and fired in the direction indicated. A quick, sharp
                  cry, and the head at that particular window fell inward, while the lady with red
                  eyes handed him the promised dollar, was thanked with a chuckle, and passed
                  on.</p>
               <p>"Who was that, my dear?" asked the elder lady, whose<pb n="466-467"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000227"/> eyes had not caught the features of the man looking
                  out of the window.</p>
               <p>"That was my <emph>husband,</emph>" answered Olympia Holt. "He has called me
                  'nigger' often enough, and just before he went to England he kicked me like a dog!
                  Now he has paid for it!"</p>
               <p>So he had! Lying there on the floor of the Tobacco Warehouse, with the top of his
                  head carried away by the ragged bullet and his frightened companions rushing
                  fearfully up to see who had been the last victim,—he had paid, so far as human
                  life can expiate crime, for his wrongs to Olympia Holt, for attempts against the
                  honor of Mary Haviland, for his speculations in shoddy, and for all the errors and
                  crimes of a career of prostituted power that had wrought much evil and little
                  good, dazzled the world without benefitting it, and brought no blessing to
                  humanity.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mrs. Fullerton was "in high feather in Secessia." She and her daughters must be so
                  still, if poor Olympia Holt's ruling vice has not ended her career; for a few
                  weeks ago the <title>Richmond Whig</title> contained a notice of the marriage of
                  the young lady who has been known throughout this narrative as Miss Dora
                  Fullerton, to an officer holding a prominent command in the Confederate army. How
                  much <emph>he</emph> may be deceived in the "best blood of South Carolina," we
                  have no means of knowing; but it is almost certain, in the present pecuniary
                  position of the rebels, that she has not secured her coveted "millionaire," though
                  she may find her happy husband an Earl, Marquis or Duke, some day, in that
                  appanage of the French Empire known as the Kingdom of Jefferson the First. Myra
                  and Mildred, Kate's "young wretches," accompanied the family Southward, and will
                  no doubt grow up in due time to take the places of their elders and illustrate
                  their education.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Burtnett Haviland, passing to an honorable and useful position in another
                  mercantile house, (where, by the way, at his instance, little Tim the squint-eyed
                  is also employed in his old capacity) after his return and the permanent
                  disruption of the house of Charles Holt &amp; Andrews,—occupies with Mary and
                  little Pet, a house much further up-town than that on East Forty-eighth Street,
                  and very near the Harlem river. They did not return to the same house at all,
                  after the reunion, from obvious motives of policy with which the word "neighbors"
                  seems to have some mysterious connection. There is no shadow between their lives;
                  and he would be a bold man who should attempt weaving another to intercept the
                  sunshine of their happiness, and a skilful man who should succeed. Unlike many
                  others, Haviland had "enough of war" in one three-months campaign. He has not
                  faltered in patriotism or purpose, but the sweet blonde hair of Mary twines around
                  him and the clinging pressure of her lips holds him fast; and after suffering so
                  much in one absence, how <emph>could</emph> they separate again?</p>
               <p>The suffering of that time, though a recollection which can never be effaced from
                  the mind of either any more than the Hebrew Children could afterwards lose the
                  recollection of that hour in the Fiery Furnace and the Hand which made the glowing
                  embers harmless as carpets of fallen rose-leaves,—is not even an occasional
                  sadness to either, now. They can even jest, in the full security of their returned
                  happiness, over what was once an unendurable agony—so rapidly do our very
                  sensations pass and become outworn, in the rapid progress of this lightning age.
                  Not seldom, when the "Haviland mischief" comes upon the ex-Zouave, he torments his
                  wife (though never when any other ear can catch the remark) by dating some
                  incident before or after "the time when she ran away with the policeman,"—and she
                  retaliates by making a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dies nota</foreign> out of "the
                  time when he jumped out of the store-house window, down at Alexandria." One name
                  seldom passes between them, however—that of Charles Holt, the merchant. They have
                  buried him, even in the same grave with his splendid powers and his dangerous
                  vices.</p>
               <p>Captain Jack, like Haviland tired of war and no longer a soldier, meets him
                  occasionally, and the past that is really so near but seems so far away, comes
                  back to officer and private as they speak for a moment of the deadly peril at the
                  Slave Pen or the fight over the guns of Ayres' battery at Sudley.</p>
               <pb n="468-469" xml:id="VAC7282-00000228"/>
               <p>No doubt both have faults, and no doubt both have enemies; but whether because of
                  this or in spite of it, they are not likely to sever the friendship that grew to
                  its warmest point in the midst of danger.</p>
               <p>There is still "help" in the Havilands' house—the subdued, chastened and
                  infinitely more loveable remains of what once was Sarah Sanderson, She can be
                  trusted, now, and will not falter. Both the evil love and the evil hate are dead
                  and buried out of sight. It is doubtful whether Burtnett Haviland has ever told to
                  Mary the <emph>whole</emph> of the poor girl's story; and it is quite as well that
                  he should not have done so. Enough that she is safe in his hands, though she may
                  pass out of them, some day, into those of young Poster, not a Brigadier-General,
                  but a brother clerk again with Haviland in his new house,—who has been home with
                  him to tea in a good many instances within the last few months, and who seems a
                  little disposed to concentrate himself down from miscellaneous admiration of the
                  whole sex, to adoration of one very small flaxen-haired member of it who has been
                  enough tried and refined in the triple furnace of guilt, suffering and repentance,
                  to make him a faithful wife if he takes the hazard. His bill for smashed crockery
                  may be a little heavy, but what is that as an item in domestic life?</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Bonnie Kate Haviland is bonnie as ever, but Kate Haviland no more. And that
                  remarkable young lady cannot be dismissed without a little additional glimpse of
                  her demeanor and the choice she made in life at the eventful period of this story.
                  How she went down at once to Duffsboro and to Aunt Bessy again, the moment the
                  disruption in the Fullerton household occurred, in spite of the fact that she was
                  thrown out of her place as private-teacher and had never a country school to go
                  back to—the reader already knows. Perhaps the reader also at least suspects that
                  the betrothed wife of a millionaire had not much occasion for wearying out body
                  and brain for the miserable pittance of a school-mistress; but the truth is that
                  the merry girl was a little restless, and that if she could bare picked up the
                  excuse for doing something a little independent and undignified, even if it
                  brought her no money whatever, she would have slightly preferred that course to
                  inactivity. It has already been intimated that she is "Kate Haviland no more," so
                  that if not dead she must be married; and it is therefore no betrayal of any thing
                  kept for the future, to illustrate the feature in her character just mentioned, by
                  saying that on her marriage-day (she would be married in the old country style, in
                  the early evening, at home, and with all her old friends gathered about her, or
                  never marry!—she said)—she insisted upon spending so much time in polishing up the
                  brass knob of the front door, in a shilling calico, a pair of old gloves, and her
                  chestnut hair in a sad but bewitching tumble, that the earliest of the guests
                  caught her in that not-very-bridal array and occupation, and at first mistook her
                  for a lazy servant-girl behind time!</p>
               <p>But this, again, anticipates, even if it does not betray. There was much that
                  preceded that event, and some of it demanding relation.</p>
               <p>When Kate came home again from the city, her first business, as has before been
                  seen, was to discover the truth with reference to the maligned cousin-in-law who
                  had preceded her; and when she found how terribly she had herself erred in
                  estimation, to make such amends by the most abject humiliation as the generous
                  heart is ever prompt to do when made aware of the injustice it has committed. Her
                  third task, as we have also seen, was the attempt to console Mary Haviland under
                  the fearful grief of the death of her husband. But the second, sandwiched between
                  the other two, was exclusively personal and even more difficult than either of the
                  others. That was nothing more nor less than to inform Aunt Bessy how rapid
                  progress she had been making during her short stay in that very fast place, the
                  city—that she was engaged to be married! She tried to command her cheek when she
                  caught the good old aunt entirely alone, feeding her brood of poultry, in the
                  back-yard, one morning; but the tell-tale color would come, and she not only
                  blushed but actually stammered (think of that, with, her glib and saucy tongue!)
                  and came very near to "making a mess of it."</p>
               <p>"Why, you dear child!" was the surprised exclamation of Aunt Bessy, pausing with a
                  whole handful of moistened meal<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC7282-00000229"/> in her
                  grasp, the hungry brood cackling around her meanwhile. For such particular
                  business as the distribution of food to her poultry, the good old lady always wore
                  her spectacles; and the way in which she looked at Kate <emph>under</emph> those
                  glasses, at the moment of making the exclamation, the exclamation and the look
                  both seeming to say: "There—that crazy girl has been at another one of her pranks,
                  that she can't help, I suppose!"—did not in the least tend to reassure the young
                  lady who was making her first "confession."</p>
               <p>But when the good aunt fairly understood the whole confession—that her niece was
                  really engaged to be married to a young man belonging to one of the first families
                  of the great city, a man of fabulous wealth, who might have married the most
                  arrogant belle of Fifth Avenue—she frightened the young girl still more by
                  throwing out the remainder of her meal, going to the little bench that stood near
                  the back-door of the farm-house, setting down her basin, washing her hands and
                  drying them on the towel hanging there, and then coming back to the spot where
                  Kate stood, opening her arms and drawing her niece to her bosom, with the motherly
                  love, compounded with pity, that had always marked her demeanor in the old
                  time.</p>
               <p>"Kate," she said, looking the young girl straight in the eyes, "has this man been
                  trifling with you?" The country 'suspicion was probing the sincerity of the city;
                  the honest country woman could not quite believe that wealth and fashion would
                  seek for a bride in that hasty and incongruous manner; and heaven knows what
                  terrible thoughts may for the moment have been running through the mind of the
                  widow who was so good herself and yet not so good as to ignore what the preacher
                  told her every Sabbath at church—that this was a "wicked and deceitful world."
                  Poor Kate at least partially understood the protecting fear and fondness of that
                  question and that embrace; she remembered the pressure that had been given on the
                  little piazza on the Sunday morning when she believed she was going away on the
                  morrow; and a flush as hot as even guilt could have manifested and yet as delicate
                  as the most spotless innocence could have demanded, burned over brow, cheek and
                  bosom, as she replied:</p>
               <p>"No, Aunt—dear, good Aunt! It, does seem strange enough, does it not, that he
                  should seek <emph>me?</emph> But he has not been trifling at all—he has asked me
                  to be his true, honest wife, just as Uncle Joseph once asked
                  <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Has he'?—you dear, dear child!" said the aunt, all her fears driven away in an
                  instant by the words of the young girl, and gathering her still closer to her
                  breast. Then again still another thought took possession of her, and she stated a
                  second doubt of no small consequence.</p>
               <p>"Katy, is he <emph>good?</emph> So many of those very rich men in the city, I have
                  heard, lead such dreadful lives! If he should not be good, and you should marry
                  him and find your whole future life embittered by neglect and ill-treatment, while
                  he was pursuing the pleasures that you could not and would not share—what would
                  become of you?—and how could I live when I knew that you were miserable?"</p>
               <p>It was Kate Haviland's turn, now, to become the soother and apparently the
                  protector. They were her arms that supplied the next pressure, and it was her
                  voice, all its embarrassment shaken, off and the old mischief rippling in it most
                  deliciously, that replied:</p>
               <p>"Aunt, do not be alarmed. He is a good man—that is, as good as they make them. I
                  would stay single until the last man on earth used Sperling's Amphobia and Bray's
                  Patent Hair-Dye and Professor Drown's Patent Anti-Corrosive Artificial Teeth
                  (warranted for two years, or taken back and put into somebody else's mouth) before
                  I would marry a man whom I did not know to be something else than the miserable
                  stuck-up trifler you are thinking of! I have done better than that, Aunt, depend
                  upon it, though he is a little odd and you may see some things in him that will
                  bother you at first."</p>
               <p>"Well, I hope he is all that you believe, Katy, I am sure!" said the aunt,
                  returning the caress and then releasing the young girl.</p>
               <p>"And—Aunt—may I invite him to come over here?" asked the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >fiance</foreign> with again a little hesitation in her manner. "I have
                  promised to write to him in a day or two; and I have spoken so much of you and the
                  old place to him, that he<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC7282-00000230"/> wished me to
                  ask if he might come and see how you liked him."</p>
               <p>"Did he, child?" asked the aunt, flattered by this proof of attention. "Yes, that
                  sounds well. Certainly, ask him to come over whenever he likes, if you do not
                  think that he will be afraid of the living and fare of your poor country
                  friends."</p>
               <p>"He will be ashamed of nothing that <emph>I love,</emph>" said the young girl,
                  proudly; "or if he is, and shows it, he may go back to New York when he likes, and
                  look for some one else to help him spend his million or two!"</p>
               <p>"You are a good girl, Kate. You always were a good girl—a little wild sometimes,
                  but good—from your cradle," said the aunt, her eyes moist with the sad pleasure of
                  sorrow as she looked back into the past. And with that the conversation
                  closed.</p>
               <p>The result of that conversation, however, was that in the letter which went to New
                  York from the little village post-office the next morning, Ned Minthorne was
                  invited to pay the farm-house at Duffsboro a visit, whenever his time allowed, and
                  "whenever," as the young girl took care to add, "he could make up his mind to
                  dress soberly and respectably and not horrify the country people by making a ninny
                  of himself."</p>
               <p>It was more than two weeks after, when Bull Run had been fought and almost all the
                  other incidents herein recorded had taken place—that the good people who came down
                  by the steamboat and line of rail leading to and beyond Duffsboro, experienced, on
                  the Saturday afternoon run, something like the same sensation felt by the Roman
                  warrior in the thick of the great battle, when Castor and Pollux burst upon his
                  view, and <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"—He was aware of a princely pair</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">That rode at his right hand."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> In other words, the good people were "taken down a peg", as some of them
                  expressed it in their homely but graphic phrase, by the appearance on the steamer
                  and the cars, of a male human flower of such gorgeous color and general appearance
                  that all the centuries of ordinary human production seemed to have been mere
                  preparations for his arrival. Mr. Minthorne, on that occasion, strictly obeying
                  the instructions of Kate, who was so anxious that he should in the first instance
                  neither frighten nor shock her friends in the country, and especially Aunt
                  Bessy,—appeared in coat, pants and vest of light violet summer-cloths evidently
                  new and got up for the occasion—the pants even wider than any that he had before
                  worn, and actually forming a loose bag divided by a sectional slit—the coat so
                  short as to be little more than a jacket, and very close at the body, while the
                  sleeves contained nearly as much material as the legs of the trousers—the
                  patent-leathers of the most dazzling polish—the hat another of the "tourist"
                  shape, still lower in the round crown and narrower in the brim than any that had
                  preceded it—the gloves bright yellow—the neck-tie cherry-color—the collar garotte
                  of painful tightness—the malacca cane with the Phidian limb for a head, retained
                  and duly switched—the short light-brown curly hair parted in the middle and
                  forming little horns at the two brows, something like those that the old painters
                  have unaccountably-made Moses wear on Sinai—the side whiskers more luxuriously
                  pendant than ever—and, to complete the equipment, a gold eye-glass (which he had
                  never before been in the habit of wearing, even in his <emph>worst</emph> moments)
                  dangling by a blue ribbon from his neck and periodically applied to his eye when
                  he had occasion to draw up his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nez retrousse</foreign>
                  with the affectation of being near-sighted.</p>
               <p>This was the figure that the good people saw, coming down on the steamer and on
                  the cars. This was the figure that they saw disembark, with a large valise, at the
                  station nearest Duffsboro, and hire an open country-wagon as a hack to take him
                  over to "Mrs. White's farm-house." And if they were all struck with horror and
                  amazement that any man living <emph>could</emph> be fool enough to dress in that
                  outrageous manner, what were the feelings of Kate Haviland, when,—after waiting
                  his arrival with a good deal of real impatience to see the "dear, good fellow,"
                  and some anxiety to know what concessions he would be found to have made to her
                  wishes on that occasion,—she saw him land at the gate and approach the piazza,
                  valise in hand, in that hideous disguise, his eye<pb n="474-475"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000231"/> glass in his eye, and such an expression of
                  good-natured idiocy rampant from brow to chin that it did not appear as if he knew
                  enough to come into the house from the street when it rained!</p>
               <p>For a moment, at the first glimpse of him, the young girl was so mortified and
                  almost angry, that she came very near bursting into tears, running away up-stairs
                  and refusing to see her visitor at all, or acknowledge that she had ever known
                  him. And certain it is that the <emph>wealth</emph> of Ned Minthorne did not
                  restrain her from that course of action which would probably have separated them
                  forever,—while something else—yes, the warm regard, respect and <emph>love</emph>
                  that she bore the odd human compound inside of the violet clothes, unquestionably
                  did produce the restraint. She forced down both the tears that wanted to come and
                  the blush of mortification that would come in spite of her, and came out at the
                  door to receive the nondescript, meeting him at the edge of the piazza with
                  outstretched hand, but with the pouting words:</p>
               <p>"How you, mind me, Ned Minthorne, don't you! You're a beauty!"</p>
               <p>"Humph!—glad you like me! Had to get a new suit to come down, you know. How are
                  you all? Kiss me, Kate!" was the reply, in his very worst affected drawl—the
                  latter part probably a quotation from Shakspeare's <hi rend="i"/>Hotspur, but
                  spoken, and <emph>acted,</emph> as if original, as he proceeded with his right
                  hand to encircle the young girl's waist and secure the answer to his demand, his
                  left still occupied with holding the valise.</p>
               <p>Set down that valise and don't be a ninny. But here comes aunt, and what
                     <emph>will</emph> she think of you!" was the reply of the young girl, after the
                  kiss had been warmly accorded by the very lips that carried the pout, and as she
                  saw the good old lady coming out of the door, resplendent in a new cap with bright
                  ribbons, and her very best evening dress, both put on in honor of the expected
                  coming of Kate's "beau."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Minthorne—my aunt, Mrs. White," said Kate, introducing, though she was in a
                  terrible tremor all the while.</p>
               <p>"Glad to see you, Mr. Minthorne," said the good old lady, extending her hand,
                  though there was something of disappointment pointment and almost of pain in her
                  face, that both the young girl and her lover saw, and that produced very different
                  effects on the two. Kate Haviland was nearly ready to sink with vexation and a
                  feeling of bother, and in her heart she was saying: "See if I don't make you pay
                  for this trick and mortification, old fellow, some day when I get my opportunity!"
                  Ned Minthorne, meanwhile, though he was really impressed by the matronly beauty
                  and evident goodness of Mistress Bessy White, could not stop to recognize such
                  things just then, and carried out his role by a half-idiotic stare and a
                  drawled:</p>
               <p>"Glad to have the pleasure of knowing Mrs. White, I am, sure. Fine evening, and
                  you have a deuced nice place here, you know!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, a pleasant place enough for poor folks, and I am glad you like it,"
                  answered Aunt Bessy, dryly. Then she called her "help" from within, informed Mr.
                  Minthorne that his room was ready for him, and sent him up-stairs with the girl,
                  apparently a little in a hurry to get rid of him, and retaining Kate on the porch,
                  as if she had something important to communicate. And so she had—really.</p>
               <p>"Kate," she said, when he had gone, adjusting the spectacles on her nose, coming
                  close to the young girl, and this time looking <emph>over</emph> the glasses
                  instead of under them—" Kate, you dear child haven't you made a terrible mistake?
                  I don't think he has been trifling with you, now that I see him, but, Kate,
                     <emph>is that man sensible?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Those who know what the last word means, in ordinary country parlance, as opposed
                  to "idiotic" can understand the whole significance of Aunt Bessy's new fear. She
                  really believed that Kate had been promising to marry an absolute natural, and she
                  had keenness enough to know that even wealth could not gild and make endurable
                  such a connection.</p>
               <p>But the answer to this was what she had least expected—a clear ringing laugh from
                  Kate, that went out on the air of early evening and must have made the birds just
                  folding their wings for repose wink their bright eyes in momentary wakefulness.
                  The ridiculousness of the whole thing had at last<pb n="476-477"
                     xml:id="VAC7282-00000232"/> overcome her vexation, and she was really enjoying
                  it; now that the torture was over.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Aunt," she said, when her peal of laughter was ended. "I shall be obliged to
                  betray him, since he will not mind me. He is sensible enough, and some people
                  think that he is smart as a steel-trap. But he is the queerest fellow and the
                  greatest quiz in the world; and he has put on all that, clothes and manner, on
                  purpose to come down here, set all the people along the line talking, deceive
                     <emph>you</emph> and vex <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Aunt Bessy was not in the habit of using hard words; but she did say, when her
                  unsuspicious mind had fairly taken in the whole arrangement, and with an emphasis
                  denoting that he might "owe that young man one," some time or other, for
                  attempting to quiz her:</p>
               <p>"Drat his picture!"</p>
               <p>Yet Aunt Bessy forgave the ex-"millionaire noodle," when he came down stairs on
                  Sunday morning, dressed for church at the little village, in garments rich and
                  costly but plain enough to have beseemed the most unpretending man in the country,
                  and his hair neatly parted at the side, perhaps by fairer hands than even his
                  own—when his words were those of manly dignity and propriety—and when she saw him
                  looking upon Kate with a world of pride and affection in his eyes, waiting for the
                  time to come when he should gather her home to his heart and hold her there for
                  evermore.</p>
               <p>And he did so gather her, as has already been indicated, in due time,—with the
                  double blessing of the good old minister of the village church with the white
                  spire, and of the good aunt who had trained him a wife shaming in beauty and
                  goodness all the "wealthy curled darlings" of fashion, met day by day in the
                  street, in the rich drawing-rooms of Murrray Hill, at the Tiger Ball, at the opera
                  and at Saratoga.</p>
               <p>And that is how bonnie Kate Haviland is Kate Haviland no longer. Married to the
                  millionaire, and as she had herself once said—"much more than that—a really nice,
                  clever fellow," in the fall of 1861,—she spent the summer of 1862 with him in
                  Europe; and that of 1863 has been passed by herself and others (<emph>two</emph>
                  others—little people, both of the male sex and the same age: a shameful revelation
                  of the ungovernable ernable character of the ex-teacher, but one that must be
                  made!) with Aunt Bessy, beside the rose-bushes and under the fruit trees of the
                  old farm-house at Duffsboro; while Ned Minthorne, with not much time now for
                  Dundreary masquerading, has again been absent in Europe on special Business for
                  the government, with which it would seem probable that he must have had some
                  confidential connection, under his mask of millionaire noodle, during all the time
                  covered by this relation.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The "Days of Shoddy," as designated by that name, began with the commencement of
                  the War for the Union, though the habit of swindling City, State and National
                  governments even more deeply than individuals, had long before that time been
                  educating the national character for such an issue. They have not ended now,
                  though the struggle may be more or less nearly approaching its termination. It is
                  certain that they will not end until the contest closes, and they may linger long
                  after. While the nation remains in distress or society convulsed, thieves (moral,
                  social and pecuniary) will continue to embrace their opportunity. Men of the stamp
                  of Charles Holt, merchant, will still attempt to outrage every precept of honor
                  and virtue, by such arts as have been shown connected with his career; and they
                  will not think it beneath them, while they are taking advantage of the absence of
                  patriotic men in the public service, to destroy the peace of homes once happy,—to
                  buy and sell a few rotten satinets, shoddy clothes, shoes with glued soles,
                  muskets without vents and tents made of six-cent muslin, and all other army
                  supplies of a corresponding character, to maintain or increase ill-won fortunes,
                  or to furnish themselves with the means of indulging the costlier luxuries and
                  vices. Men who can find sale for munitions of war, useful or worthless, at prices
                  four or ten times their actual cost, will not cease to urge such measures as must
                  prolong the evil harvest. So-called statesmen and political Generals who know that
                  they can keep no hold upon rich salaries or public honors from the day when the
                  war closes, will assist in crippling and, hindering it, and yet keeping it
                  fastened upon the country, under one pretence or another of ardent patriotism.</p>
               <pb n="478-479 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7282-00000233"/>
               <p>The pecuniary dishonesty of the shoddy age will all the while be the most
                  contemptible of all, though by no means the most guilty. The wealth suddenly
                  acquired by knavery is sure to curse its holder with ridicule, if it brings with
                  it no worse punishment. The wife of the shoddy millionaire will buy diamonds that
                  she can neither appreciate nor value and wear them so unfitly and ungracefully
                  that every gem will cast a new ray of light on the splendid misery of her
                  position. The shoddy millionaire himself will struggle for places in social life
                  and public employment, for which he is no more fitted than desired; and every
                  upward step which he succeeds in taking will but make him a more shining mark for
                  covert ridicule or open detestation. His daughters will struggle for incongruous
                  marriages, and be equally miserable whether they succeed or fail; and his sons
                  will disgrace the country abroad, as types (Heaven save the mark!) of the American
                  gentleman,—will buy worthless daubs in Europe as pictures by the Old Masters, or
                  eat fish with a knife, ask for "more of them 'ere taters" and send up their plates
                  twice for soup, to the intense disgust of Newport and Saratoga.</p>
               <p>And eventually, all that has been ill-won will be as rapidly lost. Cinders in the
                  hand and Dead Sea ashes upon the tongue, must be the end of the objects unholily
                  grasped and tasted. No "moth can corrupt or thieves break through and steal," so
                  certainly and so quickly as with gain acquired at the sacrifice of every noble and
                  patriotic impulse. For God yet lives, the courses of nature are not changed, the
                  sunshine smiles broad upon the earth, the stars keep their places in the blue
                  heaven, the waves of the ocean keep their appointed bound, and the rivers run
                  sparkling to the sea. And in His hand lie the destinies of men, after all that
                  their own hands have wrought—the destinies of the republic, after all that has
                  been done by the faithful to preserve and by the dishonest and the reckless to
                  destroy it.</p>

            <head>PETERSONS MAGAZINE</head>
            <head type="sub">THE BEST AND CHEAPEST IN THE WORLD!</head>
            <p>This popular Monthly contains more for the money than any Magazine in the world. In
               1864, it will have nearly 1000 pages, 25 to 30 steel plates, 12 colored patterns, and
               900 wood engravings—and all this for only TWO DOLLARS A YEAR, or a dollar less than
               magazines of its class. Every lady ought to take "Peterson." In the general advance
               of prices, it is the ONLY MAGAZINE THAT HAS NOT RAISED ITS PRICES EITHER TO SINGLE
               SUBSCRIBERS OR TO CLUBS; and is, therefore, emphatically, THE MAGAZINE FOR THE
               TIMES!</p>
            <p>The stories in "Peterson" are conceded to be <emph>the best published
                  anywhere.</emph> Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, Ella Rodman, Mrs. Dension, Frank Lee
               Benedict, the author of "Susy L's Diary," T. S. Arthur, E. L. Chandler Moulton,
               Gabrielle Lee, Virginia F. Townsend, Rosalie Grey, Clara Augusta, and the author of
               "The Second Life," besides all the most popular female writers of America are regular
               contributors. In addition to the usual number of shorter stories, there will be given
               in 1864, Four Original Copy-righted Novelets, viz: <list>
                  <item>THE MAID OF HONOR—a Story of Queen Bess, By ANN S. STEPHENS.</item>
                  <item>THE LOST ESTATE—a Story of To-Day, By the author of "The Second
                     Life."</item>

                  <item>FANNY'S FLIRTATION, By ELLA RODMAN.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In its Illustrations also, "Peterson" is unrivaled. The publisher challenges a
               comparison between its SUPERS MEZZOTINTS AND OTHER STEEL ENGRAVINGS and those in
               other Magazines, and one at least is given in every number.</p>
            <p>COLORED FASHION PLATES IN ADVANCE, It is the ONLY MAGAZINE whose Fashion Plates can
               be relied on.</p>
            <p>Each number contains a Fashion Plate, engraved on steel, and colored—from Fashions
               later than any other Magazine gives; also, a dozen or more New Styles, engraved on
               Wood; also, a Pattern, from which a Dress, Mantilla, or Child's Costume can be cut,
               without the aid of a mantua-maker—so that each number, in this way, will SAVE A
