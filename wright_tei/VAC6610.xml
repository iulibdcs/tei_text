            <p>You are to some extent responsible for the publication of this book. It was your own
               suggestion that "COUNTRY MARGINS" should be printed and bound in a volume. Whether
               that advice was prompted by the kindly prejudices of ancient friendship, or a just
               appreciation of the merits of the work, you see it has been accepted. I therefore
               take the liberty of dedicating this book to you. If other excuse is necessary, I
               trust it will be found in the recollections of bygone years.</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>I am, very respectfully,</salute>
               <salute>Your obedient servant,</salute>

            <head>PREFATORY.</head>
            <p>THE Editor of the ALBANY STATE REGISTER received one day from an anonymous
               correspondent, a communication which occupies the first chapter of this book. He
               published it, with a playful commentary, supposing, at the time, that there the
               matter would end. A few days afterwards, he received "MARGINS No. Two," which he
               published with a commentary in like manner. From such beginning the correspondence
               grew on, until it acquired the dimensions presented in the book which is now given to
               the public. The writers were entire strangers to each other until the "MARGINS" were
               more than half written, and it was an accident which made them acquainted at
               last.</p>
            <p>At the suggestion and upon the solicitation of many friends, who professed to be
               pleased with the correspondence, most of which was published in the REGISTER, it goes
               before the public in its present shape. It makes no claim to any peculiar literary
               merit. It was simply the result of a digression in the routine of the labors of a
               daily journalist, intended to lift his paper out of the dull monotony of politics,
               rather than for publication in a book form. It does not, therefore, challenge
               criticism, nor affect to compete with the finished productions of popular authors of
               the day for public favor. The<pb n="vi-vii (Table of Contents) "
                  xml:id="VAC6610-00000004"/> end of its publication will have been accomplished if
               it shall afford amusement for the leisure hours of those who desire relaxation from
               labor or severe study.</p>
            <p>But little more than one year has gone by since the last "MARGIN" was sent down to
               the printer, and now the "Up-Country" home, where the writers first met, is lonely
               and desolate. Of the happy group there gathered on that pleasant summer night, three
               have departed to another home. <q>
                  <l>The light, the joy, of the house is gone.</l>
               </q> Time itself is but a "margin," dear reader; it is but a step over its
               borders.</p>

                     which we call <hi rend="i"/>ponds. There are also, of late, book margins. I
                     live, sir, in the country, and am in the habit of filling in my book margins
                     with such notes and exclamations as come uppermost in the course of reading,
                     some of which are possibly highly original, (<foreign xml:lang="SPA">quien
                        sabe?</foreign>) but quite lost to the great world.</p>
                  <p>Shall I send them down to you, Mr. Editor? For I think, if handsomely printed,
                     my friends might some day read them, by mistake supposing them to be by some
                     "valued correspondent" other than I. What say you? How do you make it, yea or
                     nay?</p>
                  <p>Very good. Now I can't go to town to read books, or fill margins for you. In
                     fact, I can't read a book in town. I can let my eyes run up and down its pages,
                     but I do not <emph>take</emph> the book, unless<pb n="10-11"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000008"/> indeed it is hard and abstract. Did you ever
                     read ISAAC TAYLOR'S "Physical Theory of Another Life"? I carried that book all
                     about New York city, some years since, pocketing it at every sally out of
                     doors, and reading it in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">omnibi,</foreign> and all
                     unheard-of places for meditation and study, being utterly crazed with its
                     enchanting speculations. In the same way, I could sit down on a drygoods box
                     and work out a conic section; but for a <emph>book</emph>—say of travel or
                     sentiment—you need repose; and it is so much the better if you have
                        <emph>all</emph> proper accompaniments and circumstances, harmonies of
                     place, mood, &amp;c., and for this and these there is but one place under the
                     heavens—to wit: <emph>the country.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, it is necessary to dine before taking up a book, and you can't dine in
                     town. To dine, you must have <emph>peas;</emph> and this, as Ross Brown's Dr.
                     Mendoza says, is <hi rend="i"/>imposs. Nor can you have salad. <hi rend="i"
                     />Imposs, also. You may have shot, and you may have pale round things, which,
                     with infinite buttering, cannot, however, express peas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>We</emph> had peas, sir, the other day, for the first time this season.
                     They were, perhaps, the best that ever came on the table since the creation of
                     the world. What peas were before the deluge, cannot now be pronounced. Adam and
                     Eve may have had a few messes equal to ours, but never, probably, after being
                     driven out of that beautiful garden. Your early peas, sir, are
                     abominations.</p>
                  <p>I have undertaken peas in town, before now, and the memory of those
                     undertakings, even to this day, is full of wrath and indigestion. After
                     repeated failures—Waterloo defeats so to speak—I have been again cajoled by the
                     sight (optical delusion entirely) of peas. Drawing the dish carefully up, I
                     have said, "Ah, here we have them at last—<emph>at last,</emph> thank the sweet
                     heavens. My dear wife, hold your plate; these, my excellent wife, are the
                     thing, eh? (a little nearer, my dear) so tender as they look, so delicate."
                     "Yes," says my wife, "and so little, so young." "Of course, my darling, so
                     little, so young, so—" and here I raise to my mouth a spoonful, and wait for
                     the sensation. It <emph>comes,</emph> the sensation; and as it comes, my wife
                     and I compare notes with a <emph>look;</emph> but oh, my countrymen! Don't ask
                     me to enlarge. Think of a mouthful of pills, or of soft-boiled gravel! and
                     this, in the hope—the joyful anticipation of peas.</p>
                  <p>Why, sirs and madams, the pea is the most gentle and delicate thing in all the
                     garden. It is not to be forced, but must have time, as all things must, to be
                     good. Don't force it, therefore; don't undertake to improve it; don't water its
                     life out, but give it a fair chance, soil, and sun, and showers; and let it
                     grow, as God designed it, into a properly perfected pea. The frost should
                     approach, but not touch it; and then, as it matures into podhood, I incline to
                     think that lightning (round about) is good for it—a cutting up of the air
                     giving that freshness to the atmosphere which the pea takes into its heart,
                        and<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6610-00000009"/> makes a part of its life.
                     Whence it gets its meltingness (as of strawberries), its pure apple richness,
                     and its creamy fulness of satisfaction to the palate, is known only to the
                     little round body itself, which has a way of its own, and is taught, doubtless,
                     by heaven itself.</p>
                  <p>But I was talking of books. I have been reading, of late, in the afternoons of
                     two days, before and after Sunday, "<title>The Old House by the River,</title>"
                     a book which I like at once, for its fair margin and handsome look. It is a
                     book, also, to the temper of which Sunday is no interruption. It will prepare
                     you for the day, and the day prepare you again for the book. But on that holy
                     day there are few books that I care to read, save the one Book of all. For in
                     that I find better sermons, better sentiment, better philosophy, better news,
                     better poetry, and better and more glorious facts (good for all eternity), than
                     in all the utterances and exclamations of men since the world began.</p>
                  <p>But "<title>The Old House</title>" is written with extreme purity of style,
                     almost matchless in this respect, and with the clearness of sunlight, and I
                     thank God that a man can be found to step out of the whirl of city life, and
                     write a pure book like this.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Tyng, I have been told, can write <emph>only</emph> in the tumult of the
                     city. But his nature is a fiery one. Whereas the secret of this author's
                     success is, that his true life is <emph>not</emph> in Wall street (eminently
                     successful as he is there), but in the forest, and on the sea, and in that
                     world of beautiful sentiment which surrounds, as with a glory, the heart of
                     woman. Touches of humor appear occasionally, but the author's range is mostly
                     too high for humor. He does not care to come down to it. There is one charming
                     exception in the Bear Hunt, which is the most exquisite piece of comicality I
                     have seen for many a day. Hot as the weather is, I would be willing to ride
                     twenty miles, without stirrups, to see that bear performance. But the author
                     has touched the picture so perfectly, that one can sit at home, quite at ease,
                     and see the whole thing to the life. There are, elsewhere, passages of great
                     power, as in "Ben's Death" in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Delirium
                        Tremens,</foreign> "The last leap of the Panther," "Mr. Stewart's Story,"
                     etc., but I like best, for my especial humor, "The old Chuch and its Pastor,"
                     "Old Friends," and chapters of a kindred nature. But any one who enters "The
                     Old House by the River," will find none but pleasant company; and if any one
                     can read the book without finding that, he is a better man for his intercourse
                     with that company; he ought to retire, at once, to private life,—his being
                     abroad is dangerous to the commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>And now, Mr. Editor (stopping a moment to bracket my thanks to the author for
                     having written this book, which I should like to have written myself), I will
                     say—as to peas—that we shall have another mess in a few days, and very soon
                     every day, or as often as the weather will permit. After<pb n="14-15"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000010"/> a week, you can scarcely come amiss. I have
                     never seen your face, but if we have peas that day for dinner, I'm sure I shall
                     see a glad one. Will you come? Yours,—.</p>
                  <p>Our correspondent has placed us in a dilemma. We like the country, and we like
                     peas—and we like an invitation to dinner. But it is always convenient to
                     understand two or three preliminary matters before accepting such an
                     invitation. In the first place, it is a great advantage to know
                        <emph>where</emph> you are invited to dine. It will not do to indulge in
                     conjecture on that subject; you might go to the wrong house, and get down by,
                     and possibly <emph>under</emph> the wrong table. You might tax the hospitality
                     of John Smith under an invitation from James Brown. Then, again, it is well to
                     know <emph>with whom</emph> one is invited to dine. Not that we are
                     aristocratic, or insist upon associating (especially about dinner time) with
                     "the first families." We can eat a good dinner at almost any body's expense.
                     We're liberal in such matters, <emph>we</emph> are. But we are of the national
                     school, silver gray, and no mistake. Suppose, on sitting down to table, we
                     should find ourself cheek by jowl with a rank woolly, oran out and out
                     abolitionist. He wouldn't let politics alone, of course, <emph>he</emph>
                     wouldn't; he'd take his stand on his platform, he'd denounce the Union as "an
                     unholy league" and the Constitution as "an atrocious bargain," and drawing the
                     esculents on his side of the table, demand of us concessions in favor of his
                     opinions, or leave us to go away empty. That would be subjecting our principles
                     to a test unnecessarily severe.</p>
                  <p>An anonymous invitation "to eat peas," is all very well in its way, but it
                     isn't according to our taste. There is too much of the ideal about it. It lacks
                     the solid ingredient of sober fact. If our correspondent will certify us of the
                     place <emph>where</emph> we are to "eat the aforesaid peas," and the person
                     with <emph>whom,</emph> and upon whose invitation we are to eat them, he will
                     have to lay the venue a good way off, and have a pretty hard customer for a
                     host, if he finds we decline, provided—the trimmings are all right. We take it
                     for granted we shall have something besides "peas," something solid, something
                     savory and pleasant to the taste, such as spring chickens, nicely broiled, or
                     speckled trout fresh from the brook, or maybe, a brace or two of woodcock, or
                     snipe, or a pair of fat wild ducks, and we shouldn't be at all offended to see
                     them come on the table in succession, one after another like, together with
                     salads and such vegetables as relish with them. And then a bottle or two of old
                     port, or sherry, or Madeira, or even Champagne, wouldn't "rile" us in the
                     least. The whole affair might conclude with delicate pastry and fruits, ices,
                     and such cooling<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6610-00000011"/> things as add to the
                     comforts of the inner man in the warm summer days. We never take offence at
                     such trifles. But we can't really think of accepting an anonymous invitation to
                     eat peas—we can't, indeed.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <p>YOU have confused me a little, Mr. Editor. The blood has been mounting up
                        and about my temples all the long day, at the thought of your unparalleled
                        impu——I mean your remarkable effront——, or at least, your peculiar
                        comment—upon my invitation to peas.</p>
                     <p>But I am cooler now, and touching the great topic of dinner, I will say
                        briefly, that wine with me is a memory—a reminiscence—or, if you please, an
                        abstraction. To many it is a <emph>dis</emph>traction; I make it an
                           <emph>ab</emph>straction, by putting it in the hall closet, and turning
                        the key. My wife, I will not deny, was a little elated at the idea of having
                        a city Editor to dinner; but when I repeated, one by one, your extraordinary
                        expectations, she became very thoughtful and silent.</p>
                     <p>Why you see, sir, the "spring chickens" we could count upon, by-and-bye; but
                        the "trout," the "woodcock," the "snipe," the "wild ducks," and, coolest of
                        propositions, that all these should be brought on consecutively, keeping
                        half a dozen cooks busy, and quite confounding my father and my dear old
                        aunt with such unheard-of proceedings—all these, and<pb n="18-19"
                           xml:id="VAC6610-00000012"/> ices, and wines, in our quiet country home!
                        Oh, sir, I blush at the thought of it. Moreover, I withdraw the invitation.
                        Don't come to dinner. I forbid it.</p>
                     <p>The other day, reading an account of three sunrises<ref rend="super"

                        —one on a high Northern river, one on Lake Champlain, and one from
                        the Berkshire Bowl—I said to myself, "Here is a true poet; and, moreover, a
                        philosopher. <emph>Genial,</emph> I warrant you. In short, a man to throw
                        both arms around!" "Doubtless," I continued, "this man, like Milton, drinks
                        water only, and feeds upon peas and pond-lilies, and the like wholesome
                        things. How calmly and gloriously he writes of the morning! How handsomely
                        he poises himself above the world! Like a great white cloud, close up to the
                        sky, with a sunny radiance about him, and earth, and all shadows and
                        undercurrents far away below, quite out of his beat."</p>

                     <p>Now, who would have thought, Mr. Editor—I put it to you, yes, sir, to
                        you—who would have thought that this man of brilliant sunrises was holding
                        forth, even then, through the strength of yesterday's dinner? Yesterday's
                        snipe and woodcock, or (more shocking) yesterday's wine?</p>
                     <p>I have wine, sir. It is in a dark closet under the hall-stairs; and there it
                        will remain. I have turned the key and hid it away; and no man will find it.
                        Sauterne and Claret, and Old Port and Heidsick, and with them also, "Old Q."

                     <p>There they are, and sometimes I talk to them a little through the key-hole.
                        "Lie still, my darlings," I say to them, "no one shall touch you. You are
                        all locked in, and the key lost forever. No Editor shall come nigh you. Keep

                        had, what time my wife and I "came home forever,"—lie quiet, all of you, and
                        take your ease. Let us have no souring from neglect; no poppings of summer

                     <p>In this manner, sir, I keep them under, and in a healthy way. As to "Old
                        Q.," the oily old fellow, there is no danger of his exploding. He is as
                        strong and as firm as the stars, and as <emph>high.</emph> He has great
                        command of himself, "Old Q.," he never effervesces or runs into sour humors.
                        Stand him bellydown, or on his feet, it is all one to him. Besides, as I
                        have said, the key is lost, and they all know it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, Mr. Editor, until I may suddenly find that key, or until you can
                        dine in a plain way, with<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6610-00000013"/> say for

                     <p>Lastly, as to who and where I am, the motion is not now in order. Perhaps I
                        am a country clergyman recreating in a country paper. (I <emph>shall</emph>
                        preach to you; aye, sir, I shall lay on and spare not.) Perhaps I am a
                        country farmer, trying to get his wife to read the news. Perhaps a retired
                        valetudinarian, amusing himself with a city Editor. Perhaps, and perhaps,
                        and perhaps.</p>
                     <p>In any case, for the present, my special invitation is (and my wife joins me
                        heartily), DON'T COME TO DINNER.</p>

                     <p>There it is again, just our luck to a dot. We knew 'twould be so. We'd have
                        made our affidavit to the fact beforehand. Just because we indulged in an
                        imaginary dinner, (a poetical license,) on an anonymous invitation, we're to
                        lose a matter-of-fact meal. Surely this never could by possibility have
                        happened to any body but ourself. See the hardships of the matter. When a
                        man fancies his legs <emph>under</emph> a gentleman's table, he may as well
                        fancy any variety and amount of good things <emph>upon</emph> it. Where it
                        is <emph>all</emph> fancy, why not swing loose, give rein to the
                        imagination, and let it choose its gait? It costs no more to eat an
                        imaginary good dinner, than an imaginary poor one. And yet we're to be
                        struck off the list of invited guests, and denied even the consolation of
                        "peas." Well, we're used to such misfortunes.</p>
                     <l>"We never loved a plant or flower," &amp;c.</l>
                     <p>"My wife, I will not deny, was a little elated at having a city editor to
                        dinner; but when I repeated, one by one, your extraordinary expectations,
                        she became very thoughtful and silent."</p>
                     <p>We give up the "woodcock" and the "snipe." We surrender the "brook trout"
                        and the "wild ducks," let them all go—they're no great things at best; good
                        enough in their way, but by no-means a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sine qua

                        expectations," and settle down on the "spring chickens." We would not bring
                        a shade of thought or sadness to the face of a good wife for worlds. We'd
                        have her smile. There's heaven in the smile of a true woman. We would not
                        have her silent for a gold mine. There's music in her voice sweeter than the
                        song of harps. We would have her always happy, always cheerful. No cloud
                        should ever darken the sunshine of her pure heart, if we could rule her
                        destiny.</p>

                        who would have thought that this man of brilliant sunrises was holding forth
                        even then, through the strength of yesterday's dinner, yesterday's 'snipe,'
                        'woodcock' or (more shocking) yesterday's 'wine?"</p>
                     <p>All illusory, all a mistake, but we can bear it.<pb n="22-23"
                           xml:id="VAC6610-00000014"/> We're used to such things. It isn't the first
                        time we've been made the victim of man's imperfectibility of judgment, or
                        his positive injustice. The "Yesterday" was a dark day with us, 'twas
                        washing-day with our wife at home, a day of cold meats, of half-picked bones
                        and attenuated coffee, a day (and who is not thankful that it should be so?)
                        that comes but once a week, a day of all days that brings no inspiration to
                        the poet's fancy, no buoyancy to its wing. "Yesterday's snipe or woodcock,"
                        quotha! Our very dear friend, these things are not even "memories" with us.
                        It may be we're getting old, that the mists which hang around the memory
                        when we pass into the sear and yellow leaf, obscure our vision of the past;
                        but try as we will, we can recall no such incident within the circle of half
                        a dozen years as "snipe and woodcock." Good things we've eaten at home and
                        abroad, things savory and pleasant to the taste, but of "snipe and woodcock"
                        we're innocent, indeed we are. And "yesterday's wine," too, is a fancy, pure
                        ethereality; we derived no strength from wine—we made no terms with the
                        "deceiver." Wine never had a place on our table, nor in "our closet under
                        the stairs." We never took it into our dwelling, never associated with it on
                        any terms. We look upon wine as our enemy, we do indeed. Wine floored us
                        once, and only once, and then 'twas by treachery. Under the influence of
                        "repentance and soda water" we cut its acquaintance forever. Aye! laugh as
                        you will, 'tis gospel truth; point to the imaginary dinner we sat down to at
                        your table, still we affirm its truth.</p>
                     <p>"I have wine, sir, it is in a dark closet under the hall stairs, and there
                        it will remain. I have turned the key and hid it away, and no man will find
                        it. Sauterne and Claret, and Old Port and Heidsick, and with them also, "Old
                        Q." and Otard. There they are, and sometimes I talk to them a little through
                        the key-hole."</p>
                     <p>Don't do that—it's dangerous. Hold no communion with them. Eve talked with
                        the serpent, maybe at first "through a key-hole." She talked too often; she
                        ate the forbidden fruit after talking, and the woes that darken human
                        destiny followed. Have no word to say to them. Rather go boldly among them
                        with a club and slay them, smash them into ten thousand pieces, throw them
                        away to perish as they deserve upon the dunghill. It is this talking to the
                        bottle "through the key-hole" that has ruined thousands, aye, millions of
                        men; that has snatched an army of souls from Heaven, and peopled the
                        dungeons of perdition with fallen spirits. It has broken the hearts of
                        thousands upon thousands of mothers and fathers, and sent thousands upon
                        thousands of wives in sorrow and desolation of spirit to the grave. It has
                        given thousands upon thousands of sons to the prisons, and daughters to
                        shame. It is not enough that you "have locked them in a dark closet under
                        the stairs, and hid away the key." Doors grow rusty upon their hinges, locks
                        fail in<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6610-00000015"/> their office, wine grows in
                        strength and power of seduction, with age. You are not safe, your children
                        are not safe, your servants are not safe, while the wine bottles are in that
                        closet. Turn them out, break them in pieces. 'Tis your only sure protection.
                        Talk not of your strength, your power of resistance. Look around you, see
                        how many strong men, strong in intellect, strong in moral power, who mocked
                        at the warning of danger, and derided the prophecy of their fall, who, in
                        the face of all these things, became victims at last. Aye, victims! and in
                        spite of the admonitions, the prayers of mother, father, wife, children, all
                        that could strengthen resolve, went down through the drunkard's infamy to
                        the drunkard's grave. Don't talk to those bottles "through the
                        key-hole."</p>

                     <p>That's what we call sensible talk. Don't waste time, our dear sir, in
                        looking for the key. Let it go. Get your "plain dinner" ready. Never mind
                        the "sweet water." The pure element that bubbles up from beneath the rock,
                        at the foot of the old birch, or the ancient maple, will answer our turn.
                        Certify us of the time and place, and we'll be there. Prepare your "spring
                        chickens." Let them be broiled to a demonstration, over hard wood
                        coals—crisped and browned, but not burned. Baste them with fresh sweet
                        butter, and sprinkle them with parsley. We'll come. Serve them up hot,
                        smoking from the gridiron. Accompany them with peas, young potatoes and
                        beets. We'll come. Don't forget the white wheat bread, baked the afternoon
                        before, as the Patlander would say, and the pure yellow butter, and the
                        sliced cucumbers. Yes, we'll come. We'll be there to a minute. We'll "dine
                        in a plain way." "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled
                        ox and hatred there-with."</p>
                     <p>"Lastly, as to who and where I am, the motion is not now in order. Perhaps I

                     <p>No matter, our dear sir, your "spring chickens" shall be your warrant of
                        respectability, and your peas the endorsement of your character. If you are
                        a clergyman, you may preach to us. You may "lay on and spare not." We're
                        remarkably patient. We'll listen with commendable meekness, taking our
                        revenge on the spring chickens. We respect the clergy. If you're a farmer,
                        it's just as well. Our father was a farmer, our kindred are all farmers.
                        It's a respectable calling; those who belong to it are coming to be the
                        aristocracy of the land; besides, they raise such fine spring chickens.<pb
                           n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6610-00000016"/> We don't, by any manner of means,
                        object to farmers. If you're a retired valetudinarian, it's all the better.
                        Your lack of digestion will augment our share of the chickens. Amuse
                        yourself with us to your heart's content. We're to be amused with, if the
                        chickens are properly broiled and the trimmings all right. Yes, yes! amuse
                        yourself with us. We'll take care of ourself and the chickens.</p>

                     just now at a youthful pungency that is very touching. Boiled to a creamy
                     tenderness, or cut up thin with vinegar, from the pure white globule (about the
                     size, when cut asunder, of an English sovereign), they are alike admirable and

                     you can add nothing to the young onion; or if you do, as in the more advanced

                     Thanks, therefore, that things must grow, and not spring up into rankness in a
                     single night. Why, sir, a young lady and her sister in the great city have just
                     written to us that they are coming up this summer (a journey of some hundreds
                     of miles), expressly to have a good time with that delicate plant. I
                     immediately replied with my very best married man's regards, and conceiving it
                     proper to make a few remarks, added the following: "I thank heaven that there
                     are some people left in these latter days, who are willing and ready to eat
                     onions. It is a good sign. It augurs well for the country. It will give

                  <p>When will you come? It's a good time now, our hay being well housed, and

                     in getting in his grass without rain, in fifteen years. He usually begins on
                     Monday, so as not to have the eye-sore of hay in the meadow on Sunday.
                     Accordingly, on Monday last, my father sent the men into the meadow, although
                     the clouds were ready, at the very moment, to drop with fatness. He merely
                     remarked that it would have to be rained on, and the sooner the better. Before
                     noon the grass was down, and so was the rain. A fine shower began about that
                     time, and continued at intervals all day. My aunt, who had not been watchful of
                     the grass-cutting, walked into my father's room, and taking a pinch of snuff,
                     remarked in her pleasant and thankful way, "What a beautiful shower! how good
                     it will be for the garden!" "Yes," said my father, very briefly, "and for my
                     grass, too."</p>
                  <p>The little excitement being over, and the grass made into hay and under cover,
                     we are now at leisure again. It remains, therefore, only to point you the way.
                     But I hope, sir, you will not look for a vulgar and exact chart of the route;
                     as, say, "Bungtown train 10:20, stop at Bung, inquire for Bing, and find the
                     same just round the corner." Horrid! How excessively annoying to be booked in
                     that way! Think, sir, of the nervous anxiety as to reaching station at the
                     precise 10:20; then of the great trepidation as to where <emph>Bung</emph> is,
                     the intense scrutiny of your watch and time-table, or, in your final despair,
                     the hurried exclamations to the flying<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6610-00000018"/>
                     conductor, "Is this Bung? Have we got to <emph>Bung,</emph> yet."</p>
                  <p>I never do so. When I travel (and the mood may spring upon me at any moment), I
                     kiss my wife <emph>good-bye</emph> between the eyes, and walk directly to the
                     station; she, perhaps, trotting by my side, as I go off with easy strides,
                     hoping, possibly, for more <emph>good-byes</emph> at convenient corners. Well,
                     sir, at the station I <emph>take the cars.</emph> That's all. I never ask the
                     conductor where he is going, or when he expects to get there. I take it he
                     understands his business. We are going,—that is the great point: we are
                     travelling. When it comes night, or whenever I get tired, I motion to the
                     conductor, in an easy way, to let me out; and if there is no coach handy in
                     that part of the country, perhaps I may walk; but then I never programme to do
                     so and so. I programme to do as I please, and as events shall determine.</p>
                  <p>I would say, therefore, Mr. Editor, in a general way, as to coming to dinner,
                        <emph>take the cars.</emph> Or, to be entirely explicit, take the cars for
                     the country. After riding as far as you think proper, I should say
                        <emph>stop,</emph> by all means; and after taking bearings a little, look
                     about for Small Bob. If you find Small Bob, you are in our neighborhood. Don't
                     overlook that individual, or mark too harshly the width of his hat-brim. Small
                     Bob, seeing a man of your comprehensive appearance, will address you as
                     follows:—"Is this"— removing his hat-brim—"Is this the great city Editor, come
                     to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Margin?"</p>
                  <p>Ofcourse, I need not indicate further. Only don't be alarmed at the dogs, as
                     you come up the yard. If Bob is with you, you are safe.</p>
                  <p>P. S.—Don't come to-day. We are in a revolution—temporary, it is to be hoped.
                     In fact, I suspect it's all to be for your benefit. But the fact is all the
                     same,—we are housebreaking. Half a dozen strong women are about upsetting
                     things, and busy in various burglarious operations. We are to dine on the
                     piazza, and sleep as the strong women may provide. Perceiving that all things
                     would soon be, as you may say, in a state of probation, I saved my portfolio
                     early from the ruins, and have stolen away to a spare corner up stairs, to stop
                     the press with this postscript.</p>
                  <p>You would smile, sir, to see my young wife order her forces: now with a low
                     tone of suggestion, or a hurried word of caution, and again with a cut-short
                        <emph>oh!</emph> or an unstoppable scream, as some fabric is threatened with
                     destruction: and the next moment turning to me with a woman's composure, all
                     calmness and greatness, saying—"Tell him to come. We will be ready."</p>
                  <p>My father regards the event from a different point of view, rolling his thumbs,
                     as he sits in his great chair, and looking sharply down the long vistas of
                     piled-up confusion, or chaos, as he calls it.</p>
                  <p>P. S. No.2.—We have dined as arranged, on the<pb n="32-33"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000019"/> piazza, under the roof shade and the shade of
                     the pines, and it was, as the little girls say, <emph>be-u-tiful.</emph> I
                     almost wished that we had sent our dispatch for today. We had the chops, the
                     new potatoes, the young onions, and (forgotten before, but always immortal; I
                     eat it three times a day) the black raspberry; and you, my aunt, Souchong. We
                     discussed <emph>junkett</emph> also, called in the vulgar, "slip and go down;"
                     and after dinner, I mounted the door-sill and made a speech, quite surprising
                     myself with the youthful vigor of my remarks.</p>
                  <p>During the speech, I put the question, sir, as to whether the great Editor
                     shall now be invited to come to dinner to-morrow, at say 1½ o'clock, and the
                     result was a unanimous <emph>aye.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>This matter is, therefore, as the French say, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >fini.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"We shall have lamb-chops, new potatoes, the round squash, peas, if possible,
                     and that delicate vegetable, powerful in its way, but still delicate, the young
                     onion."</p>
                  <p>Say no more, our dear sir, we accept the invitation. We won't wait for the
                     spring chickens, or, if it's all the same to you, we'll reserve them for a
                     future occasion. Lamb chops, young potatoes, the round squash and young onions,
                     will do for the present. Mark, we say, for the present. We postpone, only
                     postpone the era of spring chickens.</p>
                  <p>Talking of onions reminds us of the times of old, when youth sharpened the
                     appetite, and exercise gave a zest to plain fare. How often have we taken a
                     piece of bread spread with butter in one hand, and a spoonful of salt in the
                     other, and gone out into the garden to eat bread and butter, with onions fresh
                     from the ground. We have done this many a time when we were young, and the
                     memory of it comes back like the shadow of a pleasant dream. Onions, young
                     onions in particular, is our weakness. They are healthy, as well as delicious
                     and savory vegetables. We like lamb-chops; we like young potatoes, we adore the
                     round squash, but young onions is our weakness. True, they add no sweetness to
                     the breath, but then let others eat them too, and there will be no trouble on
                     that score.</p>
                  <p>"Why, sir, a young lady and her sister in the great city have just written to
                     us that they are coming up this summer (a journey of some hundreds of miles)
                     expressly to have a good time with that delicate plant."</p>
                  <p>Strong-minded women, those who are not to be tyrannized out of their "young
                     onions" by the potentates of fashion. Sensible girls, that go into the country
                     to get free for a time of the bad atmosphere and worse conventional proprieties
                     of a city life. Will they come during the season of young onions, or will they
                     wait for the spring chickens? Let us hear when they come, and we shall not take
                     the least possible offence at being invited about the<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000020"/> same time. We'll encourage by our example the
                     young lady and her sister in having a good time with the onions.</p>
                  <p>"My wife, who is all in white this morning, makes you a courtesy, and sends you
                     her regards."</p>
                  <p>We like white. It is the true color for a pure-hearted woman. It is the color
                     of the robes that angels wear. It belongs to the spotless beings above, to the
                     cherubims that circle around the great white throne. Let her always wear white
                     of a morning. We accept her regards—we shall cherish them as sacred things—we
                     would not forfeit them for worlds.</p>
                  <p>"If you could see her as she stands, making you this modest obeisance, you
                     would come as with wings. You would be charmed through the air as was Loretto's
                     Chapel."</p>
                  <p>We <emph>do</emph> see her in our mind's eye, not as "making" us "a modest
                     obeisance," but as a calm and dignified woman, conscious of her own worth, her
                     value, her purity. Her heart has not been chilled by contact with the cold
                     world, nor her aspirations blighted by disappointment. On her cheek is the rose
                     of life's summer, the flush of health and high hopes. May the rose bloom there
                     for many a year—may the flush continue till life's close, and may that be far
                     off in the future; may children and grand-children be around her then, and may
                     the tear of affection, as it falls upon her cold cheek, be the last sensation
                     that shall remind her of earth's cares.</p>
                  <p>But we can't come "as with wings"—we are too substantial, too earthly, if you
                     please, for that. We will come in the cars, and speak to the engineer to let on
                     the steam; but fourteen stone weight can't do much with wings. Nor can we go
                     through the air like Loretto's Chapel. We have a natural tendency to sink, a
                     downward proclivity as it were, when we step off from some high place upon
                     nothing. Loretto's Chapel was transferred through a miraculous agency, but the
                     age of miracles is past, and unless we can harness the power that moves tables,
                     and makes chairs, and stools, and stands dance a jig together, into the
                     service, we must perforce be content to go on land, and under the impulse of
                     steam.</p>
                  <p>"When will you come? It's a good time now, our hay being well housed, and
                     nothing remaining of an urgent character. My father remarked the other day,
                     that with one exception, he had not succeeded in getting in his grass without
                     rain in fifteen years."</p>
                  <p>You are quite right, our very dear sir. The best time to accept an invitation
                     to a good dinner is always <emph>now.</emph> We are sorry the grass has been
                     mowed. We want to swing a scythe again. We have done so once this summer. We
                     want to rake and pitch; we have done that too. It was away out in old Steuben.
                     We were passing a meadow where six men were mowing, marching forward like<pb
                        n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6610-00000021"/> a platoon of grenadiers keeping step
                     and stroke together, each swing of the scythe cutting down grass enough to
                     fodder an ox. We climbed over the fence, and throwing our coat upon a swath,
                     took down a scythe that hung on the limb of a thorn bush; we felt the edge, and
                     finding it keen, struck in boldly with the mowers. We understood this business
                     once, and so long as our wind held out, kept up. But editing a newspaper is not
                     calculated to make one enduring in the hot sun of July, and after mowing a
                     bout, we surrendered. Raking was easier work, and we took an hour's turn at
                     that. Then we pitched on a load and pitched it off, into the great bay in the
                     barn. By this time we had taken a sweat that a steam doctor might envy, and we
                     passed on our way. Do you remember when a boy at work in the hay field, how you
                     watched the heavens, when the signs of rain were in the air? Do you remember
                     how merrily the tree-frog piped along the fences; how gently the wind stirred
                     among the trees; how fan-like it lifted the leaves upon the basswoods along the
                     fences, turning the under side to the sun, and making the tree-top shine all
                     over like silver? Do you remember how, when the haze gathered in the air, a
                     great circle surrounded the sun, and how he became less and less bright, until
                     he disappeared in the sky?</p>
                  <p>And then, do you remember when the small drops of a settled rain came falling
                     gently around you, how you shouldered your rake, and marched to the barn, and
                     then how you clambered on to the hay mow, and listening to the soothing sound
                     of the rain upon the roof, you sunk away into the sweetest possible sleep?</p>
                  <p>Do you remember how you watched the clouds when a shower was coming up from the
                     south-west? Did you note how the great black clouds came lifting their
                     monster-shaped heads above the horizon, followed by others still more
                     ogre-looking, until the van of the storm stretched in a long dark line across
                     the sky? Did you note the flashing of the lightning, and did you catch the
                     first deep growl of the thunder in the distance? Did you hear the sound of the
                     wind and the pouring rain, while the storm was yet at a distance, and did you
                     look calmly from your bed of loose hay on the barn floor, upon the rushing
                     waters, while the clouds were emptying their floods around you? We remember
                     these things, and we have never lost our respect for a settled rain, or a
                     thunder shower in haying time.</p>
                  <p>"I kiss my wife good-bye, between the eyes, and walk directly to the
                     station."</p>
                  <p>Without intending to be personal, you must permit us to say you are wrong, and
                     the more we reflect upon the subject, the more convinced are we that you are
                     wrong. Not in kissing your wife. One may kiss one's wife without blame. We like
                     the practice—we do so ourself, occasionally. It serves to keep the affections
                     warm and the heart<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6610-00000022"/> soft. Nor do we
                     object to your walking directly to the cars, after kissing your wife good-bye.
                     That may be done with propriety and safety. But what we protest against, is the
                     kissing your wife good-bye "<emph>between the eyes</emph>" The practice is a
                     bad one. Lips were made to be kissed after their owner has become a wife. The
                     cheek of a maiden may be touched by the lips of a lover, but the lips of the
                     wife should be the recipients of a husband's kiss. This is the true principle
                     and philosophy of the matter, and we protest against any departure from the
                     ancient and orthodox usage.</p>
                  <p>"I would say, therefore, Mr. Editor, in a general way, as to coming to dinner,
                     take the cars, or, to be entirely explicit, take the cars for the country.
                     After riding as far as you think proper, I should say stop, by all means, and
                     after taking bearings a little, look about for Small Bob."</p>
                  <p>We begin really to despair of this dinner. We have made numberless concessions.
                     We have surrendered woodcock and snipe, wild-duck and venison, and settled down
                     on spring chickens. We subsequently conceded the chickens and took to
                     lamb-chops, young potatoes, round squashes and young onions, and now we are in
                     danger of losing even them. It's all very well to talk about taking the "cars
                     for the country." The country is a large place. It lays all around Albany, and
                     stretches a great way back. If we go north, we traverse Vermont. The cars go
                     thundering through the gorges of the Green Mountains. We went that way last
                     summer. We stopped at a pleasant village squatted down in a beautiful valley,
                     through which flowed a cold pure stream, to fish for the speckled trout. But
                     hundreds had preceded us, and the trout were all destroyed. We were told of a
                     little lake that few had had the courage to visit, laying just over the ridge
                     of mountains, where the trout were abundant. We started for that lake. Our
                     course lay over Mount Tabor, one of the highest ridges of the Green Mountains.
                     Blazed trees along a blind foot-path pointed out the way. We went clambering up
                     precipices that seemed to have no summits, sweating and sweltering in a July
                     sun. When we stopped to rest, the gigantic hemlocks that grew out from the
                     rugged side of the mountain away down below us, going straight up towards the
                     sky, presented their tall tops almost within our reach, so steep was the
                     acclivity. We toiled on for hours and hours with slow and painful progress,
                     till we entered a region of mist. The bushes were dripping with moisture, and
                     so were we, still we toiled on till at last the summit was gained, and we sat
                     down to rest amid the clouds on the bare top of Mount Tabor. It was cool enough
                     away up there, and we waited for the mist to pass away. It did pass at length,
                     and the prospect that opened upon our vision repaid a hundred-fold the toil of
                     the ascent. There we sat thousands of feet above the level of the sea. Away off
                     to the west lay Lake<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6610-00000023"/> Champlain,
                     stretching north and south for a hundred miles. We saw two steamboats ploughing
                     their way through the waters, while away beyond were the mountains of Essex,
                     their bald heads piercing the sky, shining in the sunlight like the glistening
                     helmet of some giant warrior of old. Beneath us were beautiful valleys, winding
                     away towards the level country to the south, with broad farms and green fields
                     spread out, dotted with farm-houses and barns, and here and there a quiet
                     village with church steeples going up from among the clustered houses. We saw
                     the long line of a railroad stretching away towards Rutland, and a train of
                     cars drawn by the iron horse dashing along on its journey towards Rouse's
                     Point. Towards the east was a dense forest standing in all its primeval
                     grandeur, clothed in everlasting green, stretching away far as the eye could
                     reach, with here and there a mountain peak towering towards the sky. We sat
                     there for an hour enjoying the cool breeze, and drinking in the grandeur of the
                     landscape beneath us, and then passed on to the pond where the trout were said
                     to abound. We reached it in half an hour, and were repaid for our labor by two
                     trout and a mud turtle. We returned at night weary enough, but in the morning
                     we remembered the vision from Mount Tabor, and were satisfied.</p>
                  <p>If we go east, "the country" reaches all the way to Boston, the metropolis of
                     the Bay State. If we go west, it reaches to Lake Erie, and beyond that,
                     thousands of miles, across vast prairies, and over the Rocky Mountains, to the
                     great Pacific. If we go south, it reaches to the Empire City. Here we are,
                     then, afloat without a compass, wandering in a boundless wilderness, with no
                     landmark save "Small Bob." And who, in the name of all the saints, is "Small
                     Bob"? Answer us that. Where are we to find him? What are his distinctive marks?
                     What is his complexion; is it ebony or topaz? Are we to wander all over the
                     land, like Japhet in search of his father, inquiring after "Small Bob," and a
                     dinner of lamb-chops, new potatoes, round squashes and young onions?</p>
                  <p>We can't do it; and we see the vision of gastronomy fading from our view, as
                     many a bright one has done before. We give it up in despair. Ah me!</p>

                  <head>IV. EDITOR'S LATITUDE &amp; LONGITUDE.</head>
                  <p>I THOUGHT of you this morning, my kind editor, almost with tears in my eyes.
                     Crossing the high bridge over Roaring River, I came upon three boys lying flat
                     on their bellies, their heads just over the edge of the bridge, shouting to a
                     boy below, who, with rolled-up trowsers, was seeking wildly for a mud turtle.
                     The excitement both below and above was extreme. The turtle, in looking down,
                     was in plain sight, floating about in quite shoal water, and evidently having a
                     good time, now with his tail up, going down among the crevices of the rocky
                     bottom, and then with raised paws, coming slowly up and skimming the surface.
                     But to the boy below all was glimmer and confusion; the dazzle of the sun and
                     the ripple on the surface suggesting to him unknown depths, and his own
                     eagerness to accomplish the feat making him almost frantic, set on, as he was,
                     by the cries of the boys above, "There he is—oh, my gracious! Don't you see
                     him? he is coming right towards you—oh crackee! Catch him, Jim, catch him!" All
                     this, I say to my experienced eye, knowing how perfectly safe that turtle was,
                     made up a scene of distress in which I couldn't help exclaiming, "Oh that the
                     editor was here!" For I remembered your experience in turtling, and that large
                     men are always magnanimous and generous to boys. I counted, also, on your
                     length (not breadth) of beam, for I take it, sir, you are a man of symmetry.
                     Your "fourteen stone" weight, I do hope and trust, is not all laid out
                     horizontally. Your downward tendency has not settled you into a rhomboid. You
                     have height as well as depth; longitude as well as latitude. You should be,
                     sir, at least six feet, in your stockings: for the symmetries are as important
                     to men as the graces to woman. Mental, moral, and physical—these are the
                     symmetries; and such is the effort of nature to make them always harmonize,
                     that having one, we invariably look for the others. If a man lack in altitude
                     (the <emph>proportionate</emph> height, I mean), he will be short in something
                     else. Inevitable, sir, inevitable. He will not be gifted in sunrises and large
                     views; though he may be good in trouting, and better still at
                     <emph>chub</emph>-bing. Some of the most patient anglers I know are those who,
                     having seated themselves comfortably on a river bank, find it exceedingly
                     difficult to get up again. <emph>You,</emph> sir, should be six feet high, and
                     well proportioned.</p>
                  <p>But why is it, I was going to ask—why is it, Mr. Editor, that boys crave
                     mud-turtle? Why hanker after the ugly? For an eel or a bull-head—(I do not deny
                     a certain beauty and philosophical harmony<pb n="44-45"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000025"/> mony in the turtle—its life in its shell), but
                     an eel or a bull-head is a greater satisfaction to most boys than the
                     handsomest trout you ever saw. There are people, also, who go about collecting
                     strange bugs, beetles, snakes, spiders, and many-legged monstrosities, which
                     they carefully bottle and keep near them, as a kind of refreshment! U—g—h!</p>
                  <p>And now, sir, I ask you, is there a sort of <emph>Young Harry</emph> in this,
                     leading on to the <emph>Old Harry?</emph> For there are older boys just as
                     intent, just as eager, just as morbidly hungry for moral monstrosities,
                     bottling all manner of vice and ugliness, and deformity, and cherishing them as
                     something very delectable, something really new under the sun, and the only
                     true facts and realities, as though hell itself were not already full of just
                     that kind of material!</p>
                  <p>As there is a love of the beautiful, so also there is a love of the ugly. I
                     have fought hard and long against this conviction, but I believe it is true as
                     Holy Writ, and the great mischief of our day is the practical unbelief in
                     regard to this matter.</p>
                  <p>A love of the ugly for its own sake—a love of vice <emph>with</emph> its
                     sequents, and because of them, almost as though it were a pleasure to be
                     damned. There are men in the world who seem to be haunted with the fear that
                     they will see or hear of something pleasant, something beautiful, or good, and
                     so be charmed by some hocus pocus, into a belief in the existence of such
                     things. "Oh my vipers," they cry: "Oh my bugs, my snakes, my excellent big
                     black spiders!"</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more painful to such men than symmetry, beauty, proportion. They
                     seek always for the ugly, and they find it. No fear as to that. They are sure
                     to arrive at the most hellish capacities, and it is rare that such men die
                     without proving to the world the height and depth of their abilities in that
                     line.</p>
                  <p>The morning that we have to-day, under these heavens, is exceedingly beautiful.
                     It would seem that on such a morning, everything that hath breath would be
                        saying—<emph>Hallelujah, hallelujah, amen, hallelujah!</emph> But it is safe
                     to say that the Prince of Darkness, and his legions, whether here or elsewhere,
                     have had no voice in these utterances. Their partialities are all "the other
                     way, the other way;" they love the ugly. I have no liking for the freedom with
                     which some people talk of that Great Creature, that "archangel ruined," who is
                     now making such terrible havoc in the world, showing his hand of late with so
                     much boldness and success, and claiming allegiance upon the very score of his
                     supreme hideousness. I am not disposed to make light of him, but I trust there
                     is no harm in offering it as my long-settled conviction, that if this "murderer
                     from the beginning" had ever, by any mistake, made a pleasant morning like
                     this, he would have hung himself before breakfast. Yes, sir, he would have
                     hanged himself high, unless<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6610-00000026"/> less,
                     indeed, he might have gone mad in the first glance at its beauty and glory.</p>
                  <p>But God made the morning—thanks to His Great and Holy name. God made the
                     morning, and in this is the hope of the world.</p>
                  <p>I did not expect to be so grave, Mr. Editor, for there is a time and place for
                     such topics, and I fear you may think I am out of both. Permit me one last word
                     about our dinner. I have been thinking, sir, that if you start out alone, you
                     may be charmed away by some inviting vista, and never find us. Your passion for
                     mountains might be too much for you. We should hear of you, perhaps,
                     clambering, coat off, and hat in hand, up some neighboring height, making
                     speeches to the clouds and the country at large; or possibly—and quite
                     possibly, too—stopping somewhere for a sunrise. I am coming after you,
                     therefore, myself.</p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"I take it, sir, you are a man of symmetry. Your 'fourteen stone' weight, I do
                     hope and trust, is not all laid out horizontally. Your 'downward tendency' has
                     not settled you into a rhomboid."</p>
                  <p>Men's notions of symmetrical beauty differ. Tastes, on that subject, take a
                     wide range. Some admire long men, reaching away up like a liberty pole, a thing
                     to hang flags on, on the Fourth of July. Length has its conveniences, we admit.
                     It's a good thing in cherry time. One can pick the fruit handily from the
                     remote branches. Others prefer horizontal dimension, a spreading out sideways.
                     It gives an appearance of substantiality, of solidity. We never quarrel with
                     people's tastes. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">De gustibus non disputandum,</foreign>
                     is our motto. We insist that it is a wise one. If the standard of beauty were
                     fixed at six feet and upwards, what would become of the short men and women?
                     For ourself, we are not a "rhomboid." We have more than four sides. We have
                     been accused of having had at least twice that number in politics alone—with
                     what justice "history must determine." All we say on the subject is, we never
                     had but one political side—at a time. We admit that politics has "made us
                     acquainted with strange bed-fellows." We entered upon political life with
                     certain <emph>fixed</emph> principles, and as we affirm, have stood
                        <emph>fast</emph> by them. Parties fluctuate, or rather circulate, revolve,
                     go round and round. We being fixed, it is not singular that we should have come
                     in conjunction with all parties, in their revolutions. True, the world differs
                     with us on this subject, and says that <emph>we</emph> have been
                     circulating—visiting different party orbits in our course. That we deny, and
                     surely <emph>we</emph> ought to know the real truth of the matter.</p>
                  <p>"You should be, sir, at least six feet in your stockings."</p>
                  <p>True, we <emph>should</emph> be, but we are not by a long shot. Doubtless it
                     was originally intended otherwise<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6610-00000027"/>
                     wise. We were meant for a six-footer, but we got spoiled in some way in the
                     making up. It was a great misfortune, we admit, but by no system of ethics can
                     it be charged against us as a fault. What a man <emph>does,</emph> he should be
                     held accountable for. He should be held answerable for what he <emph>is,</emph>
                     if he made himself such by his follies or his vices. The Deity made men right.
                     He gave them the power of choice in their course of life. He placed good and
                     evil before them, and left them free to choose. The consequences of their
                     choice were not hidden from them. All around the good were scattered peace and
                     happiness, joy and gladness in this world, and the promise of happiness in the
                     world to come. The evil was beset with sorrow. Vice carried its chains to be
                     fastened upon its votaries. A troubled life, a barren and hopeless hereafter,
                     were the rewards it promised. Between these utter divergents lay the destiny of
                     men; and, strange infatuation, transcendent folly, the evil has an army of
                     followers, in comparison with which the good can reckon only a corporal's
                     guard.</p>
                  <p>"The symmetries are as important to men as the graces to women. Mental, moral,
                     and physical—these are the symmetries; and such is the effort of nature to make
                     them always harmonize, that having the one, we invariably look for the
                     others."</p>
                  <p>Doubtless this is all true in theory, but not so clearly sustained by facts.
                     Let us look around us and see what are the demonstrations. CHALMERS was a man
                     of small stature, and lean proportions, but what divine equalled him in mental
                     power, or excelled him in moral qualities? Who has not read with rapture his
                     matchless sermons, replete with thrilling eloquence and grandeur of rhetoric,
                     his "thoughts that burn," his profound and original conceptions? One can almost
                     imagine himself soaring amid the stars, far away in the blue vault of heaven,
                     traversing the milky way, and diving between the rings of Saturn, while reading
                     his astronomical discourses. Newton was a man of medium stature, and yet in
                     intellect almost a god. Instances may be multiplied of great men with bodies by
                     no means proportionate to the giant dimensions of their intellectual stature.
                     The true theory probably is, that there is a secret balance between the
                     intellectual and physical, which depends not so much upon length of bones and
                     size of muscle, as upon a proper connection and development of
                     organization.</p>
                  <p>"If a man lack in altitude (the proportionate height, I mean), he will be short
                     in something else. Inevitable, sir, inevitable."</p>
                  <p>Excellent. This accounts for the milk in the cocoanut. We are a living
                     demonstration of the truth of the theory. Lacking in the requisite altitude,
                     we, of necessity, must be short somewhere. We have been so all our life. We
                     have been short in the pocket, short in bank deposits, short in ability to meet
                     promptly incoming bills. In short,<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6610-00000028"/> we
                     have been troubled all our life with the shorts, and here is the reason of the
                     thing—we lack in length of body. Well, it's a pleasant thing when one enters
                     upon a fight, to understand the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">casus belli,</foreign>
                     to understand the origin, the why and the wherefore of a thing. We have a
                     friend who is "six feet in his stockings," and well proportioned, and he never
                     had a bill protested in his life. We didn't understand how it could be, till we
                     measured his height, got him to stand up by the ceiling, stuck a knife just
                     even with his crown, and then got on to a stool and measured. It was six feet
                     and an inch to the floor. Our friend always has his "pockets full of rocks,"
                     and it is all owing to his altitude.</p>
                  <p>"Some of the most patient anglers I know, are those who having seated
                     themselves comfortably on a river bank, find it exceedingly difficult to get up
                     again."</p>
                  <p>This squares with our own observation. We have in our mind's eye a notable
                     example, what the lawyers would call a case in point. We returned last week
                     from an angling expedition to the mountains of Pennsylvania, away up among the
                     sources of rivers. We saw the spring from which the Genesee takes its rise. It
                     comes out of the ground in a stream large enough to propel a mill wheel, and
                     starts at once on its returnless voyage to the majestic St. Lawrence and the
                     ocean. Beyond was a high ridge over which we passed, and then stepped across
                     the remotest branch of the Alleghany that travels west to the Ohio, and then to
                     the great Father of Waters, and so along down by New Orleans to the Mexican
                     Gulf. Beyond again was a ridge higher still over which our road lay, and there
                     we came to the head waters of the Sinnemahoning, that travels through great
                     forests towards the Susquehanna, and finds its final passage to the ocean
                     through the Chesapeake Bay. By the way, will any body tell us how these great
                     springs, that go to make up these rivers, get up here on these high mountains?
                     We have read about capillary attraction, and the pressure from above that
                     forces them through, and finally out of the ground, to flow away to the ocean
                     obedient to the laws of gravity. We don't want to hear or read any more of
                     that, for we don't believe it. There is not rain enough falling on these
                     mountain ranges to supply evaporation, and these springs that gush in such
                     volume from the ground, that come welling up in a flood day and night, week
                     days and Sundays, always. But we got to the Sinnemahoning, in the woods, in the
                     middle of a vast forest with only little clearings at long intervals along the
                     valley through which it flows. Here we stopped for a week to fish for the
                     speckled trout, and have a pleasant season of communion with nature in her
                     old-fashioned dress. We do not intend to enter upon description of the scenery
                     here, we reserve it for another occasion. We had with us two friends—the one a
                     clergyman, to whom we refer as an example of patience in<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000029"/> angling. He is one of a thousand, a Christian
                     man, one fit to be trusted with the care of souls; but he is neither a zealot
                     nor a bigot; of a cheerful, but contemplative spirit, with a mind profoundly
                     stored with varied reading, he can appreciate as well as tell a merry anecdote,
                     and perpetrate as well as enjoy a jest. He was a most patient angler. He would
                     sit for hours under the shadow of some great tree on the bank of the little
                     river, by the side of a deep hole, watching with patient assiduity his hook, as
                     it floated in the water. If the fish were minded to bite, it was well; if not,
                     it was just as well. There was the bait and the hook, the line and pole, and he
                     was ready to draw them out. If they chose to remain under the logs and
                     drift-wood, regardless of his tempting offers of a grasshopper or a worm, it
                     was not his fault. Where you left the dominie, there you would him find, until
                     the sun came round and drove him to another deep, still place, where was a bank
                     and a shade, with the pleasant song of birds about him. He was not a very
                     successful angler, but his cheerful countenance spoke of the pleasant memories,
                     the bright day-dreams, the cheerful thoughts that were clustering around his
                     heart, as he sat there in the cool shade, angling in a troutless eddy.</p>
                  <p>But he is not a "short" man; he is "six feet in his stockings," and had to
                     stoop as he entered the door of the pleasant little dwelling where we stopped.
                     That dwelling is in a little clearing of some twenty acres surrounded by
                     forest, and high mountains, with tall peaks running up towards the sky, behind
                     which the sun hides himself for hours before he finally goes down to his
                     lodging-place for the night. We fishermen had our wives along, and they were so
                     merry and contented, while we stayed, that we acquiesced in the name given it a
                     year or two ago, and called it the "Saint's Rest."</p>
                  <p>"And now, sir, I ask you, is there not a <emph>Young Harry</emph> in this,
                     leading on to <emph>the Old Harry?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Very possibly, although the generally-received opinion, we think, is that the
                     elderly gentleman spoken of, has most to do with such matters. He is said to be
                     exceedingly busy in his vocation, and takes quite as much interest in the young
                     as in the elders of the human family. Indeed, many think that his policy is to
                     induct mankind into evil ways at an early age, so that as they advance in life,
                     they give him less trouble by their ability to sin without calling upon him for
                     aid in the furnishing of temptations.</p>
                  <p>"Permit me one last word about our dinner. I have been thinking, sir, that if
                     you start out alone, you may be charmed away by some inviting vista, and never
                     find us. Your passion for mountains might be too much for you. I am coming for
                     you, therefore, myself."</p>
                  <p>A most sensible conclusion to an excellent sermon. That's what we call a
                     practical climax, leaving a pleasant sensation on the mind, to aid in the<pb
                        n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6610-00000030"/> digestion of a discourse. Well, come
                     along. We'll be ready. We're not particular about the day or the hour, only let
                     it be a week day, and not Friday. That's a bad day—a day when they hang people;
                     a day full of evil omens. All the bad luck we ever had was on Friday. We fell
                     into the Crooked Lake on a Friday, and were so nearly drowned that we never
                     knew, save from hearsay, how we got out. We were upset in a stage coach, and
                     had our nose knocked to one side, and our wrist sprained on a Friday. We were
                     in the railroad cars when a collision took place; we were fast asleep at the
                     time, and the shock pitched us headforemost against a lady who sat fast asleep
                     in front of us, and whose husband threatened, in his ignorance of the collision
                     (for he had been asleep too), to do us serious bodily damage, on account of our
                     involuntary rudeness—all this was on a Friday night. Our house was burned on a
                     Friday night, and two as noble stag hounds as ever followed the trail of a
                     deer, perished in the flames. They were shut up in the wood-shed adjoining, and
                     were suffocated before the flames were discovered. We never enter upon any new
                     undertaking on a Friday. We form no new acquaintances on that day. We never
                     accept an invitation for a Friday. We did that thing once "long ago," and we
                     upset a capital dish of roast venison, covered with delicious gravy, in our
                     lap. We had to send home for a pair of pantaloons, to don in the place of our
                     white ones, spoiled by the misadventure. We have a theory on the subject of
                     diurnal influences, and laughing at us won't induce its abandonment. We point
                     to the facts, which to us, at least, are history, as evidence of its truth.
                     Don't come on a Friday; something would surely go wrong, to mar the pleasure of
                     a new acquaintance, and spoil a good dinner. On any other day, we say in the
                     beautiful langauge of the poet—</p>

                  <head>V. A FRIEND FROM THE OLD DOMINION.</head>
                  <p>IF you do not hear from me soon again, Mr. Editor, you may consider that I am
                     taking a rest. Perhaps(as I remarked yesterday to my tall friend, L. P., of the
                     F. F. V.), perhaps you carry too many guns for me. Perhaps you blow away my
                     positions, and symmetrical arrangements, too easily. Certain it is, that
                     pleasantly as we have chatted together over our peas and young onions, you
                     have, of late, grown upon me into a kind of overshadowing greatness. Besides,
                     August has come in upon us with great force, and for a space now, I must rest.
                     On the first day of the month, and among the first of those hours which I
                     include in the morning, I was rounding a pleasant dream up stairs, when there
                     was a vigorous knock at the front door. Springing from bed, I put on my
                     dressing-gown and with unshod feet went down the stairs and opened upon—the
                        <emph>first</emph> event of the day—my Rev. friend and quondam from a
                     neighboring State, whom I had not seen for many years. Our mutual bewilderment
                     in gazing upon each other, was almost at the point of awkwardness. He, so clean
                     and clerical, so firm and close-buttoned; and I, like a ragged cloud, all wild
                     and loose. He, who, ten years ago, had been spare-bodied like myself, and with
                     eyes full of that intense sensibility with which some people go mourning about
                     the world, was now round and compact; and I, who had been thin and spare, now
                     thinner and sparer still. His face, which, like mine, had been sharply
                     triangular, now presented a projection and squareness of chin, which implied,
                     that let the world roll how it may, he was ready for it. Ready for to-day and
                     for to-morrow, and for next week, built up, expanded, consolidated.</p>
                  <p>My friend seated himself comfortably by an open window, and gravely searched
                     about me for some reminder of his old acquaintance; finding, however, only ruin
                     and waste, with an occasional feeble flash, like sheet lightning, telling of
                     storms gone by. And I couldn't help thinking there was something exultant in
                     his gaze, as he saw all this change, and that hollow other-world look, which
                     might have checked him, one would say, from coolly remarking, as he did, that,
                     positively, if he had met me in the street, he should not have known me.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps not; probably not. But accustomed as I am to hear people say—"My dear
                     Margin, how well you are looking," I was taken a little aback. Leaving him the
                     freedom of the parlor, I returned to my chamber, exclaiming to the world,
                        <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> "Don't, my dear people, oh,
                     don't let us be too<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6610-00000032"/> practical in a
                     world like this." And I freely confess to you, my dear Editor, the effort of
                     getting ready for breakfast that morning was more of a labor than I have had
                     for many a day. I didn't pretend to shave, and my endeavors at getting my hair
                     straight were, for a long time, as Longfellow says, "All in vain, all in vain."
                     My young wife, however, during this time, was bracing me up, this way and that,
                     and trying to put me in shape. "Pray," said she, "what does <emph>he</emph>
                     know about you? Why, my dear husband, you are younger now than you have been
                     for years. You are! Yes, for years. Please don't hurry; your cravat is all one
                     side; yes, for years! Why, everybody tells you you are better—wait a moment;
                     your coat; yes, better a great deal; and <emph>you know you are!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Strengthened, and built about in this way, I came down to breakfast, prepared
                     to demolish my stout friend instantly, if he continued his vein of remark. But,
                     whether owing to the juvenile look which Mrs. Margin had given me, or to a deep
                     feeling of remorse on his part, we had no further collisions. My friend stopped
                     only for an hour, barely touching upon us, as he said, on his way home. But it
                     was the touch of a strong mind in a strong body, carrying me off as with a
                     whirlwind. I found myself, in a little while, bowling away with him to your
                     city, and whirling and speeding through times past, times present, and the
                     great time to come. Swift as flew the wheels in that lightning train, were our
                     exchanges changes, shuttle-wise, of the great prominences in our last ten
                     years. Nothing was too great for us. The roar of the train, and that outrageous
                     scream and blast of the steam-whistle, were as trifles to us; for we were piped
                     up higher than that, and in a wider range, discussing as we did, not our
                     affairs only, but the pressing interests of the great world, winding up, of
                     course, with the Thirty-nine Articles and the prospects of the Universe. An
                     hour after reaching your city, we parted; he, stronger than ever; I, ready to
                     descend rapidly into reactions. Strolling along, feebly, by the Marble Pillar,
                     I looked wishfully over to No. 46; but weak as I was from my one stout friend,
                     I couldn't think of meeting another. Not all our pleasant exchanges, sir, could
                     tempt me to cross that street.</p>
                  <p>In this collapsed condition, I came home in the afternoon, to dinner and
                     repose. About that time, also, came a shower opening the very windows of
                     heaven; and after dinner, over which we lingered lovingly, just as the shower
                     ceased, somewhere about four to five o'clock, there was another knock at the
                     door, and behold—<emph>second</emph> event of the day, and tall contrast to him
                     of the morning—my great friend, six feet four and three-quarters, L. P. of the
                     F. F. V.! Yes, sir, my great friend and refreshment, as you may say, from the
                     Old Dominion. All through that shower, he had been on our borders, in a shanty,
                     on the further side of Roaring River, waiting for the floods to subside. And
                        now<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6610-00000033"/> here he was, in all his extreme
                     length, and with that rich full voice, which, without loudness, could be heard
                     all over the house. I had to turn him around twice in the hall, to enjoy him in
                     different lights, and at all points. My young wife came forward to meet him,
                     almost with a shout, and I some expected to see him bend down, and leave an
                     impression upon Mrs. Margin; which, however, he did not, but talked a continual
                     stream of music and delight, at the state of things now arrived at.</p>
                  <p>Well, sir, he has been with us three days, and he grows taller every day.
                     Taller in our esteem, in our heart's regard, and in our determination to keep
                     him, if possible, to the full extent of his furlough. Having preached four
                     sermons a week, for the last ten months, now, he says, is the time for rest.
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Dulce est desipere in loco,</foreign> and what loco
                     like this (so he flatters me) with his friend, Mr. Margin, whose appreciation
                     of rest has reached a perfection scarcely to be found, perhaps, in all the
                     round world. Now for easy chairs and the piazza, the book and the hammock; or
                     rather, the hammock without the book—(books are a nuisance). At this moment, he
                     is lying at full length on the parlor sofa, smoking a cigar. He is calling to
                     me now, and his voice has to travel around through the hall and two door-ways,
                     but comes with perfect distinctness.</p>
                  <p>"I say, Margin—"</p>
                  <p>"Well, what is it?"</p>
                  <p>"Did I tell you about the little boys?"</p>
                  <p>(While I was napping yesterday, my friend walked down to the Rising Sun, a
                     village in the northeast, and there surprised another Virginia friend and
                     rector, and was passed about like a bottle of old wine with the cork undrawn,
                     his friend holding him stoutly by both hands, while he presented him to some
                     half dozen ladies and two clergymen, who were present.)</p>
                  <p>"Did I tell you about the little boys?"</p>
                  <p>"No. What about the boys?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, sir, there were four of them, and they followed me all about the
                     streets!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; and what do you suppose they were after?"</p>
                  <p>"A penny, perhaps."</p>
                  <p>"No; because I heard some of their remarks. 'I say, Jim,' said one, 'did you
                     ever see any thing like that?' 'Crackee!' says another, 'just look at him!' And
                     the rascals followed me, sir, to the very door of the rectory."</p>
                  <p>My friend having unburdened himself of this matter, relapses again into
                     silence, though I dare say he is smoking vigorously, and not unlikely, may
                     continue talking the whole matter over to himself, for some time to come. If I
                     was nearer, I should hear, perhaps, fragments of speech thrown out with
                     considerable force, such as <emph>the rogues! the scamps! the young
                        rascals!</emph> but not unkindly, for<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6610-00000034"
                     /> all fire and power as he is, he has a heart (as they say out West) "as big
                     as an ox."</p>
                  <p>And now, Mr. Editor, I will say good-morning, remarking, as once before, that I
                     am not now in the marginal way. We design—my friend and I; I say we design—or
                     rather, we do not design. That is the beauty of it: plans and designs are laid
                     aside. We rest now, and wait for events. All things of easy approach shall be
                     welcome. Nothing more. Cigars that smoke easy, we shall smoke. Dinners that are
                     patriarchally simple, and not distracting in temptations, we shall have from
                     time to time—in fact daily; unless we may arrive at that happy perfection of
                     the ideal when a day <emph>without</emph> dinner may seem to be the maximum of
                     easy enjoyment, in which case we shall <emph>not</emph> dine. Cigars and easy
                     positions will be the general order, with occasional short and celestial
                     remarks. The great point will be not so much to <emph>do</emph> things, as to
                     let them be done. While we pause, the morning and evening will continue as
                     usual: sun and shade, and rains and night-dews, and the great world to whom
                     they are sent; these all will come and go, roll about, migrate, fluctuate, and
                     so forth, but as pictures only to Mr. Margin and his eminent friend L. P., of
                     the F. F. V.</p>
                  <p>Meantime my young wife, who has finished her jellies—in which seraphic
                     employment, with short gown and up-rolled sleeves, she has been busy for so
                     many happy days—she, I say, will join us at times, waking us from too long naps
                     with some pleasant song, or suggesting occasional novelties, all in keeping
                     with our sublimated life. Of course, if occasion requires, we shall preach to
                     the people roundabout; but we hope there will be no occasion. After our four
                     sermons a week, for the last ten months, we feel more like pardoning everybody
                     out and out. I say we feel more like this, as sailors say, letting things go by
                     the run: but, of course, it's wrong; we are aware of that, and if called upon,
                     we shall hope to be ready. But it would be as wise, perhaps, to let us alone
                     just now, for our style is not of the mealy-mouthed kind. No, sir, and may God
                     preserve me from any levity in this matter: we preach, as my father says,
                        <emph>death, judgment, and eternity.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more, Mr. Editor, good-morning; and till we meet again, good-bye.</p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"If you do not hear from me soon again, you may consider I am taking a
                     rest."</p>
                  <p>Don't do that, our dear sir—don't do it. Don't take a rest. There's something
                     sad in the idea of taking a rest; something that speaks of decay, of energies
                     exhausted, of life-springs drying up. To us the words come freighted with no
                     pleasant memories. We had an ancient friend long ago, a rough specimen of a
                     man, but every inch a man—<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6610-00000035"/> one of
                     nature's nobility—honest and straightforward as truth itself, whose good
                     opinion we lost for a time by "taking a rest." He was a man of eccentricities,
                     of idiosyncrasies, if you please, and it cost us years of effort to get back
                     into our old place in his regards. We said he was a rough specimen of a man,
                     but he was one of giant sympathies and a big heart. He was a man of the back
                     settlements and the woods. He was a mighty hunter, and the game he sighted
                     might count itself as lost. He loved his friends, and was proud of them. He
                     loved his rifle and his dogs. He loved the old woods and mountains, and the
                     wild streams. He was older by a score of years than ourself, but the icicles of
                     age never gathered around his heart, and the coldness of growing years never
                     chilled the genial warmth of his nature. He has passed to his rest now, and
                     sleeps quietly under the shadow of thick foliaged maples on a little knoll
                     selected by himself. Calm be thy slumbers, mine ancient friend, and happy thy
                     long future in the world to come. He loved his rifle and his dogs, and his
                     heart was ready to embrace the man who loved the tangled forest-paths, who
                     loved to hear the music of his hounds upon the mountain, and to bring down the
                     flying deer. A marksman himself, he was ready to love the man who could equal
                     him in skill with the rifle; and to be his superior was a surer passport still
                     to his affections.</p>
                  <p>On a Christmas day, long ago, when we were younger by many, many years, than we
                     are now, we went to a gathering, known among the border villages as a shooting
                     match. Turkeys were the prizes contended for. A plank was placed at some five
                     and twenty rods distance, with a hole in it, through which was thrust the head
                     of the turkey, while his body was secured behind it. At this mark the sportsmen
                     fired. If blood was drawn, the marksman was entitled to the turkey. Each
                     competitor paid a small piece of money before taking a shot, which went to the
                     owner of the turkey. Well, we were there with our rifle to take our chances
                     with the rest for a Christmas dinner. A number of marksmen had preceded us, and
                     we ourselves had failed in a shot or two, when it was proposed to "take a
                     rest;" that is, to lay down with the rifle resting upon a block properly
                     arranged, and in that position take sight and fire at the head of the poor
                     bird. Its owner had already pocketed twice its value in shillings, and he
                     consented to the arrangement. The block was placed in position, and the first
                     shot fell by lot to ourself. Among hunters in those days, taking a rest either
                     at living game or a dead mark, was a violation of all the proprieties of
                     woodcraft. It was opposed to all rule, a practice which, if largely indulged
                     in, would cost one his position among sportsmen, and the regards of every true
                     hunter and woodman. As we said, the first shot fell by lot to ourself, and we
                     were about taking our position, when we felt a hand laid<pb n="66-67"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000036"/> upon our shoulder. Turning, we saw our old
                     friend standing beside us, leaning upon his long rifle. We had not noticed him
                     before. "Don't do it," said he; "Sam, don't do it—never take a rest, stand up
                     like a man, and fire off-hand; if you miss, you can't help it, and nobody
                     blames you, but never take a rest." His voice sounded more in sorrow than in
                     anger, but we saw that his confidence in our woodcraft was shaken, and his
                     esteem for us as a hunter fading away.</p>
                  <p>We <emph>did</emph> stand up and fire off-hand, and the head of the turkey was
                     shattered by our ball. That shot did much towards calling back to us his
                     wandering regards, but it was not until we had hunted with him, and brought
                     down many a noble deer in his company, that the impression of our weakness in
                     "taking a rest" was effaced from his mind. We admonish you, therefore, our very
                     dear sir, in the language of our ancient friend, "Don't do it, never take a
                     rest. Stand up like a man, and fire off-hand. If you miss, nobody blames you,
                     but 'never take a rest.'" There's a moral in the admonition, a moral and deep
                     philosophy in the advice. Always, and at all times through life, whatever
                     temptations may beset you, however misfortune may darken around you, yield not
                     a foot to the tempter, bend not a joint to misfortune, but "stand up like a man
                     and fire off-hand."</p>
                  <p>"On the first day of the month, and among the first of those hours, which I
                     include in the morning, I was rounding a pleasant ant dream up stairs, when
                     there was a vigorous knock at the front door."</p>
                  <p>Served you right, our dear sir, right, to a dot. What right had you, you,
                     blessed with intelligence, eyes to see, and ears to hear, what right had
                        <emph>you</emph> to be "rounding a pleasant dream up stairs," when all
                     nature was awake, joyous, full of gladness, chaunting the songs of the morning?
                     And in the country, too! Talk not of "pleasant dreams up stairs," of a summer
                     morning. There's no such paradox in nature. Dreams, indeed! In the crowded
                     thoroughfares of city life, the thronged streets and clustered houses, where
                     the air is. poisoned by the smoke of ten thousand cooking-stoves, and
                     machine-shops, and gas-factories, and forges, and the thousand villanous smells
                     that exhale from the haunts of condensed civilization, "a pleasant dream up
                     stairs" of a morning is within the range of conjecture, but such a thing in the
                     country would be a libel upon nature. No, no! Thank your stars that a worse
                     evil did not befall you. Why, our dear sir, you should have been up when the
                     first bright gleam of the morning glanced upward from behind the eastern
                     summits. You should have heard the first song of the lark, as he leaped from
                     his perch, and went carolling joyjully towards the sky. You should have seen
                     the last stars as they retired from their watch, passing away into the depths
                     of the heavens. You should have watched the mist that went up in the gray<pb
                        n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6610-00000037"/> twilight, from "Roaring River," and
                     faded like a vision in the air. You should have seen the first ray of the sun,
                     as it lighted upon the tops of the mountains. You should have looked away to
                     the east, and seen the sun, like a great torch, hanging for a moment in the
                     tree-tops, and then noted how gloriously he leaped forward into the clear sky.
                     You should have seen the dew-drops, sparkling like diamonds on the grass
                     blades, and heard the wild, free song of the birds in their gleefulness. You
                     should have snuffed the pure air, loaded with the fragrance of flowers, and the
                     freshness gathered from the foliage of the woods. With these things all around
                     you, you should have looked away to the Providence that spread so rich a feast;
                     to the God that made the morning, and all the beautiful things that belong to
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, my great friend and refreshment, as you may say, from the Old
                     Dominion. All through that shower, he had been on our borders in a shanty, on
                     the hither side of Roaring River, waiting for the floods to subside, and now
                     here he was, in all his extreme length, and with that rich, full voice, which,
                     without being loud, could be heard all over the house."</p>
                  <p>Strange reunions—meetings of old friends under curious circumstances, sometimes
                     take place. Years may have fled away, events may have hurried us along,
                     changing us in position, in appearance, in feelings, in temper, in all things.
                     Suddenly an ancient friend is thrown across our path, and our youth, the long,
                     long past, comes rushing with his presence around us. The present vanishes, and
                     we are again among the pleasant memories of the olden time.</p>
                  <p>Some years ago we were at Blosburgh, in Pennsylvania. We went there ostensibly
                     to view the coal mines. The entrance to these mines is midway up a mountain of
                     some fifteen hundred feet in height, along the base of which the Tioga River
                     flows, which is here but a good-sized trout stream, in the summer season. We
                     went up to the entrance of the mines. We saw a great dark hole in the side of
                     the mountain, into which our companions entered, and were lost to sight in its
                     cavernous depths. For ourself, we have no taste for dark places and deep holes
                     in the ground. We never enter a cave. There's something dismal and sepulchral
                     about them. They smell of mortality. We should expect to see skulls grinning at
                     us, and to stumble over dead men's bones. We keep clear of caves. We preferred
                     trout fishing, to groping around in the damps of the mines, away in the
                     carbonized bowels of the hill. We came down to the river, and borrowing a rod
                     and line, started up stream, with a view of fishing down. We travelled a couple
                     of miles along a pleasant path that followed the windings of the river, and
                     then rigged and threw for the trout. They were plenty in those days, and we
                     were having a good time of it all alone in the woods, notwithstanding the
                        affectionate<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6610-00000038"/> attentions of the
                     mosquito and the black-fly, that phlebotomized us after a fashion peculiar to
                     themselves. We were busy hauling in the trout and fighting the mosquitoes, and
                     as we came round a great boulder, bigger than a haystack, that thrust itself
                     from the bank half way across the stream, there we stood face to face with an
                     old friend that we had lost sight of for a dozen years. "Hallo! Harry," said
                     we, "where on earth did <emph>you</emph> come from?" "And from what cloud did
                        <emph>you</emph> drop?" was his reply, as we shook hands most cordially. We
                     sat down upon that old moss-covered boulder, and talked of the days of Old. We
                     were schoolmates in our boyhood. We were students in the same law office, were
                     examined in the same class for admission to the profession, returned from
                     Albany, with our licenses in our pockets, together, and the week after such
                     return we shook hands and parted, swinging out in different directions into the
                     world. For a year or two we heard of him occasionally; then darkness settled
                     down between us, and we heard of him no more till we met in the middle of the
                     Tioga River, at the spot where that big boulder stands so boldly out into the
                     stream, each with a fishing-rod in his hand. The world had gone well with him.
                     He had gathered largely of its treasures. He was a man known on 'Change.</p>
                  <p>We parted the next morning, never to meet again. Consumption laid its withering
                     hand upon him. He crossed the great ocean, in the hope that the genial climate
                     of the South of Europe would bring back health and vigor to his frame. He
                     visited Italy; spent a few months at Rome, and then passed on to Venice. But
                     the grasp of death was upon him, and he turned his feeble steps towards home,
                     in the hope of dying in the midst of his kindred. He died on the ocean; and he
                     now sleeps in a New England churchyard, where his fathers sleep. He was the

                  <head>VI. A CHAPTER FOR THE SABBATH.</head>
                  <p>MY tall friend is gone. Even now, as I write, he is speeding on over the long
                     iron tracks, to the Blue Ridge of the Old Dominion. The round week—seven golden
                     days—he staid with us, finding some rest, we trust; but now all this is of the
                     past. By-gone, so soon! Pictures all, so soon! Oh, the swift certainty of
                     to-morrow; for however we may pause, God has always something for us to do. He,
                     who doth neither slumber nor sleep, how kindly, how safely, he takes us all on
                     through the night, into the beautiful morning!</p>
                  <p>My friend, sir, was in great demand. All our choice arrangements for repose
                     were of small account. And as life flies by now-a-days, perhaps it is well. We
                     should make no long steps now, for there is little time for rest here. Time
                     enough for that—to those who shall attain to the true life—when they shall have
                     shaken off these working garments and put on the white robes; when the lame
                     shall walk, and the blind see, and the deaf hear; when their halting frames
                     shall be clothed anew with strength and with glory, and their palsied tongues
                     find voice in the acclamations of that great host, "which no man can number."
                     Time enough for that, when the night cometh, that no man can work. When from
                     groping through these swift-rolling years, they shall see, at last, face to
                     face, and walk in the light of God for ever! Time enough for repose, in that
                     great time to come, the time beyond all time, the great circle, the round time,
                     when they shall have gone up to dwell for ever with their master and their
                     king, their Saviour and their Redeemer, Jesus Christ the Righteous!</p>
                  <p>But now, oh how swiftly speeds the world! No, it is not the place for rest. "My
                     Father worketh hitherto," said Christ, "and I work." No, it is neither the
                     place nor the time for rest. Nor is it to be found here. Health itself, life
                     itself, subsists only in action, change, accomplishment. This tireless spirit,
                     as it came from God, so in some measure like Him, it scarcely can slumber or
                     sleep, even here.</p>
                  <p>Time has been when, owing chiefly to physical causes, we have loved rather the
                     life of thought and meditation; but the union of both—meditation and action—is
                     the true life, both here and elsewhere. The good deed, the kind word, the
                     helping hand in the right way—and when these are impossible, the bended knee in
                     the silent chamber, the use of that power that "moves the arm that moves the
                        universe<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6610-00000040"/> verse;" these are the
                     agencies—these are the powers that be. To whom these are possible, all else is
                     but wind and ashes.</p>
                  <p>A man may float in deep water, motionless, by looking straight up to Heaven;
                     but he must look out for the heavy seas. In fact, he can float no-where, save
                     in the still water, and at best, it is but floating: balancing, as it were,
                     between life and death. To make headway, he must strike out right and left,
                     pull and push, and reach on continually: and, moreover (to finish this matter),
                     it is mostly your good swimmers only who can float.</p>
                  <p>Make no long stay, Mr. Editor, in any "Saint's Rest"<ref rend="super"

                      you may find here. The world rolls too fast now for long pauses. As in
                     youth the days were long, and in age they seem to take wings for their travel,
                     so the world of to-day, as it quickens and concentrates thought and action,
                     quickens and shortens the minutes, the hours, the days and the weeks, and the
                     round year itself: so that we can look forward to some approximation to that
                     life in which, even to us, "a thousand years may be as one day, and one day as
                     a thousand years."</p>

                  <p>Good-bye, my tall Virginian, and may God prosper you for ever, and make all
                     your days as pure as the sunlight, and as bright. Good-bye—but come back
                     again—will you? Come back in the golden October, and wake us again with your
                     clarion tones. John Knox, as he preached to the assembled royalties of
                     Scotland, could not more have startled our sleepy souls, than did your ringing
                     cadences last Sunday night. Come back, and rouse us from the dull inaction of
                     this hum-drum life. Come back, and leave a few coals of your Southern fire on
                     our Northern altars, and cry aloud to us, "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise
                     from the dead, and Christ shall give thee life."</p>
                  <p>Yours,—</p>
                  <p>"He who doth neither slumber nor sleep, how kindly, how safely, he takes us all
                     through the night into the beautiful morning!"</p>
                  <p>We never think of the good Providence that watches over the world, in the still
                     hours of the night, without connecting with the thought a beautiful little
                     hymn, of which we think Bishop HEBER was the author, although of this we are
                     not certain; a hymn so full of the pure spirit of poetry, as well as devotion,
                     that we venture to give it here: <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Strange linking of memories! Speaking of Bishop HEBER reminds us of an anecdote
                     of the excellent Bishop C——. We were in New York soon after Trinity Church was
                     completed, in company with the lamented JOHN YOUNG, late Governor of this
                     State. We visited the church together. We found, upon entering, a venerable
                     man, who stood near the centre of the great aisle, looking with apparent
                     rapture upon the gorgeous and imposing architecture of the interior of that
                     magnificent structure. It was Bishop C——. The Governor was acquainted with him.
                     After a frank and cordial greeting, the good Bishop remarked, "I have been
                     thinking," said he, "how different our place of worship was when I first became
                     the rector of a parish in what is now my diocese, from this splendid edifice.
                     It was a little building, half school-house and half church, and cost less than
                     five hundred dollars. Yet we were a happy and united people, and, I sometimes
                     think, more purely devotional and pious than we were at a later period, when we
                     worshipped in a vastly more costly church. It always seems to me that pride
                     enters somewhat too largely into the devotional exercises of a place like this;
                     and I think of the lines in one of our beautiful hymns: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Say, shall we worship with costly devotion,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Odors of Eden and offerings divine,</l>
                           <l>Gems from the mountain, pearls from the ocean,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Myrrh from the forest and gold from the mine?</l>
                           <l>Vainly we offer each ample oblation,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Vainly with gifts we his favor secure:</l>
                           <l>Richer by far is the heart's adoration,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was something infinitely impressive in the earnest and solemn, yet simple
                     manner with which the good Bishop repeated those lines. They contained, as he
                     spoke them, a whole sermon—one that went to the heart with far greater force
                     and directness than many we have heard that were vastly more studied and
                     elaborate. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Richer by far is the heart's adoration,</l>

                  <p>Great and glorious truths, all! Infinite goodness could alone have sent them
                     forth to the world, to give comfort and hope to man. What if we be poor and of
                     mean estate? Our hold on heaven is stronger than theirs who dwell in palaces,
                     and are clothed in purple. When misfortune and sorrow gather around us, when
                     desolation comes down upon us like a flood, and destruction sweeps away the
                     little we may have gathered of the world's goods, when we look forward to a
                     helpless age and see no<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6610-00000042"/> promise of
                     provision for its dreary hours, when the heart sinks before the darkness of the
                     future, then comes the soul-cheering truth, fresh from the throne of God, a
                     voice speaking from the cloud that encompasses us, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Richer by far is the heart's adoration,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>"And as life flies by now-a-days, perhaps it is as well that we should make no
                     long stops, for there is little time for rest here."</p>
                  <p>Aye! "March on!" is the order of the universe, now; no halting by the way—no
                     pausing to reckon with the past, or calculate the future. The world is in
                     motion. A rest under the shadow of tall trees, by the bubbling fountain, leaves
                     you behind. The great army passes on, and you are reckoned, as you are in fact,
                     a laggard in the race of life. Look back for only a quarter of a century, and
                     see the mighty stride that the world has taken. Where, then, were the iron
                     roads over which the locomotive now thunders on his mission of
                     civilization—where the telegraph that mocks at time and annihilates space?
                     Hark! there are new sounds breaking the stillness of night, and startling the
                     mountain echoes from their sleep of ages! It is the scream of the
                     steam-whistle, the snort of the iron-horse, the deep rumble of his long train,
                     freighted with human life, rushing with lightning speed, shaking the ground
                     like an earthquake, as it moves along. A new sight is seen on the ocean. It is
                     the tall ship that goes forward when the air is still, and calmness is on the
                     face of the deep—that moves forward in the eye of the wind, forward still in
                     the face of the storm—that turns not from its course for billow or blast. It is
                     the ocean steamer, that makes but a ferriage of seas, that comes and goes over
                     the great deep regardless of wind or storm. These are but types of the mighty
                     progress of civilization within that quarter of a century. Look back again to
                     the scenes of your boyhood. Where are the landmarks that you loved, the
                     pleasant things around which cluster the memories of youth? Where the tall
                     forest tree that was spared when the old woods were swept away? Where the
                     clustered plumtrees, the wild hazles, the willows along the brook, the maples
                     that shaded the spring that came out from among their roots? Gone! all gone!
                     The old school-house and the play-grounds—the path across the fields that led
                     to them—where are they? Gone again, all gone! The friends, the companions of
                     your youth—where are they? A voice comes out of the deep silence of the grave,
                     from the ocean, from the far-off city—from beyond mountain ranges, bearing the
                     solemn answer— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"They are scattered and parted by mountain and wave,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> Where are the high hopes, the lofty aspirations, with which we started in
                     our young career?<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6610-00000043"/> Gone, all gone!
                     wrecked by the hand of disease laid heavily upon us. Wrecked by the hand of
                     death that tore from us the joy of our being and the treasures of our hearts.
                     Wrecked by disappointment in a thousand forms, that beset us in our path of
                     life.</p>
                  <p>Yes, yes, onward and onward is the word. Everything is moving. Childhood passes
                     to youth, youth moves onward to manhood, manhood to old age, and the grave
                     devours them all. If we pause, even to linger by the graves of the loved and
                     the lost to us, the tramp, tramp, of the world is heard passing us. If we fall,
                     its onward tramp is over us as it hurries along in the forward movement. Like a
                     mighty river, the tide of human life, the current of human progress, flows on,
                     pauseless and steady, swelling in volume, moving forever and ever towards
                     eternity. But what of that? Better to float on with the tide, than to pause in
                     the turgid eddies, and stagnant bayous, even though our course be over beetling
                     precipices into the boiling whirlpool beneath them. On the spray of the
                     cataract hangs the rainbow of promise. It is the sign of redemption, the seal
                     to the covenant of God, that he will rescue us from the troubled waters, and
                     take us to his "house not built with hands, eternal in the heavens."</p>
                  <p>"Good-bye."</p>
                  <p>How many emotions cluster around that word! How full of sadness, and to us, how
                     full of sorrow it sounds! It is with us a consecrated word. We heard it once
                     within the year, as we hope never to hear it again. We spoke it on an occasion
                     such as we hope never to speak it again. It was in the chamber of death, at the
                     still hour of night's noon. The curtains to the windows were all closed, the
                     lights were shaded, and we stood in the dim and solemn twilight, with others,
                     around the bed of the dying. The damps of death were on her pale young brow,
                     and coldness was on her lips, as we kissed her for the last time while living.
                     "Good-bye, my daughter," we whispered, and "Good-bye, father," came faintly
                     from her dying lips. We know not if she ever spoke more, but "Good-bye" was the
                     last we ever heard of her sweet voice. We hear that sorrowful word often and
                     often, as we sit alone busy with the memories of the past. We hear it in the
                     silence of night, in the hours of nervous wakefulness, as we lay upon our bed
                     thinking of the loved and the lost to us. We hear it in our dreams, when her
                     sweet face comes back to us, as it was in its loveliness and beauty. We hear it
                     when we sit beside her grave in the cemetery where she sleeps, alone, with no
                     kindred as yet by her side. She was the hope of our life, the prop upon which
                     to lean when age should come upon us, and life should be running to its dregs.
                     The hope and the prop is gone, and we care not how soon we go down to sleep
                     beside our darling, beneath the shadow of the trees in the city of the
                     dead.</p>

                  <head>VII. ROARING RIVER.</head>
                  <p>HOW are you now, my friend? Rejoicing, no doubt, on this first wave of coolness
                     and strength. But how were you in the late solstice? Sitting, as we now do, by
                     fires, morning and evening, it seems like looking far away into the depths of
                     last summer, and yet it is but one short week. Midway of that solstice, came
                     our young friends <emph>Snowdrop</emph> and <emph>Honeysuckle,</emph> from a
                     down-river margin, and with the ease and grace of maidenhood, melted at once,
                     into our quiet ways; took attitudes, at once, all in keeping, and were properly
                     silent and musing for so solemn a time. Pleasant pictures—<emph>Snowdrop and
                        Honeysuckle</emph>—and good for warm weather. But not so our friend
                        <emph>Powerful,</emph> who came with them; he being not at all adapted to
                     such high ranges of the mercury. Too fiery and precipitous. Why, sir, he had
                     the madness to go into argument before he had been ten minutes under our roof;
                     and this, when earth and sky were panting and breathless in that hot blast. And
                     my private opinion is, (I must tell you, <emph>sub rosa,</emph> that I like <hi
                        rend="i"/>Power-<hi rend="i"/>ful, in toto, fire and all, for he is equal to
                     about seventeen of the common young men of these times), but I haven't a doubt
                     that he had been in argument all day. How else, and owing to his plunging
                     nature, and my quick sympathy with it, (for I jump to all humors,) how else
                     could we have tumbled out of that train as we did, while carpet-bags came
                     after, through the windows, and our two large trunks, in the hot haste, slipped
                     fizzing away into the sides of the north, and all the people laughed at our
                     confusion?</p>
                  <p>Let that pass, for the trunks came back the next day, and three days later the
                     cool winds northwesterly. But then, in view of what might happen with
                        <emph>Powerful</emph> in the house, and of what was happening, the hot,
                     white, quivering sunlight pouring down day after day, I issued the following
                     general order: "Remember the weather, my people, and be wise. Propositions are
                     vain, and arguments all out of place. This day avoid controversy and shun
                     disputation. <emph>Argue with no man,</emph> or woman. If you find a sitz-bath,
                     sit down on it, asking no questions, but don't go spying about. Stop every
                     thing that can be stopped, and let us rest. Stop talking, stop thinking, stop
                     eating, stop drinking, stop walking up and down the room; and in fine, retire
                     as far as possible into a <emph>vacuum,</emph> and there remain until the north
                     wind blows again."</p>
                  <p>My next grand proposition (for the general order was scouted all over the
                     house) I brought forward<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6610-00000045"/> as modestly
                     as possible, merely holding it forth, as a stray thought which had occurred to
                     me, to wit: <emph>chairs in Roaring River</emph>—under the bridge, sir. In the
                     shoal water, you know, say about waist deep, and there to sit, making short
                     remarks, and waiting for the wind to blow. The Editor was to be invited, and we
                     were all to form a circle there and talk up ancient events—all in chairs in
                     Roaring River. I say ancient events, for I should know you instantly: you would
                     be to me as an open volume—a folio of rare value—all in chairs in Roaring
                     River. Small Bob would bring us the proper refreshments; sweet milk loaded with
                     ice and one brown cottage loaf, and water from the well, from the old oaken
                     bucket, sitting all around in State editorial—all in chairs in Roaring
                     River.</p>
                  <p>But what strange mistiming of nonsense was all this, sir, when men were
                     dropping dead in the streets of our cities (as the swift lightning soon
                     reported to us), not in twos, and in threes, but in tens and twenties, and in
                     hundreds! And still comes the report from a far Southern city—<emph>two hundred
                        dead, to-day.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>There's a time for work, and a time for play, says the old adage. But a
                     startling question sometimes presents itself, as to whether the world has not
                     outgrown its play-time, leaving us the work only. Certainly there is not much
                     play-time, now, to the people of that plague-smitten city.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Two hundred dead, to-day!</emph> Gone away, that is to say, to try
                     another mode of living; another mode of acting; another mode of thinking. No,
                     not that. For as a man thinketh, so is he. And as a man dies, so he remains.
                     Whatever moral pestilence he dies with, he takes with him. Whatever poisoned
                     garment he has on, is his forever. He can ship it to no foreign market; and if
                     he cries it at auction, no man will buy. Nor will fire burn, or the moth
                     consume it. Like himself, it is immortal.</p>
                  <p>But <emph>move on!</emph> say you; and <emph>move on!</emph> shouts the world.
                        <emph>Get out of the way. We can't stop here over a dead body.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, indeed, but oh my friend, <emph>where</emph> are we going? Where, and under
                     whose orders? Who has the command, in this case? Who is Officer of the Night?
                     for the look-out, just now, is like that of night, rather than the light of
                     day. I don't know, sir, about this onward movement, until we establish quite
                     well what we are about. I must be posted on this, before I make the first step.
                     To cast about, with whatever vigor, or with whatever hopefulness that all will
                     be right by-and-bye, will in nowise modify the ultimate fact; and this
                     ultimatum I must not guess at, but know.</p>
                  <p>For motion, sir, is not life. Momentum is not life. It is a power, or rather it
                     is a result, but it is not life. The iron horse that leaves your city in the
                     early morning and takes his last refreshment this side of Buffalo, somewhere
                     before sundown, has traversed some hundreds of miles; but he has only<pb
                        n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6610-00000046"/> changed places; and this he has done,
                     only by clinging to the rails. Take away his hold upon earth—his grasp from the
                     iron bar—and though his wheels may flash with a whiz, and his pipes sputter and
                     scream to the verge of madness, he will not have moved forward a hair's
                     breadth. A grasshopper shall sit square before his driving-wheel, and laugh at
                     him all the day long.</p>
                  <p>No, sir, 45 miles an hour takes no man nearer to Heaven. If we are to march on,
                     let us know the way, and the country whither we go. We have but one day before
                     us, and by night we must rest somewhere, if possible. It would be sad, after a
                     hard day's work, to find no welcome, no glad face to meet us, no news of home,
                     of rest, of peace, no cheering voice to hail us, through the deepening
                        gloom,—"<emph>All right! This way, my friend! All right!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Not to hear this, but to take our wearied limbs on into still deeper darkness,
                     and be conscious, suddenly, that we are lost—that we have taken the wrong
                     way—this would be sad, it would be terrible. Yours,—.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Chairs in Roaring River,</emph> under the bridge, sir. In the shoal
                     water, you know, say about waist deep, and there to sit, making short remarks,
                     and waiting for the wind to blow. The Editor was to be invited, and we were all
                     to form a circle there, and talk of ancient events—all in chairs in Roaring
                     River—Small Bob would bring us the proper refreshment, sweet milk loaded with
                     ice, and one brown cottage loaf, and water from the well from the old oaken
                     bucket, sitting all around in state editorial, all in chairs in Roaring
                     River."</p>
                  <p>We should not have accepted that invitation. We love rivers. We love to look
                     upon them as they flow on forever, and yet are never wasted We love to inquire
                     how it can be, that their ceaseless current, that always has been and always
                     will be moving away and away towards the ocean, should never be exhausted? To
                     ask of science how they gather their constant, unfailing supply, and why the
                     ocean, into which all these gigantic tributaries pour their mighty floods,
                     never overleaps its bounds? To ask philosophy, by what subtle machinery the
                     far-off fountains that come out from away up among the mountains, are fed with
                     fresh water forever? Why they always bubble up in the same place, and run away
                     in the same channel to make up these great rivers? We like to look upon the
                     bubbles that float along on the surface of the water, and see them burst and
                     vanish away. We like to watch the spray that goes up from the cataract and the
                     turbulent rapids, and the mist that rises from the broad, still current. As the
                     river moves along at our feet, never pausing, finding no resting-place in its
                     ceaseless flow, such, we say, is the tide of human life. The bubbles that float
                     upon its surface are the hopes of man. The spray and the mists are his
                     cherished plans and schemes of life. The bubbles burst, the spray and the mists
                     vanish away, but the river moves on to the ocean.</p>
                  <p>A pleasant place for meditation is "Roaring River," but to sit waist deep in
                     its waters, beneath<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6610-00000047"/> the shadow of the
                     bridge, does not comport with our philosophy. There is romance, doubtless, in
                     the matter, but it is not <emph>our kind</emph> of romance; and hot or cold,
                     sunshine or a cloudy sky, let the mercury range high or hide itself in the
                     bulb, "we'll none of it." If we must needs "sit around in State editorial—all
                     in chairs in Roaring River," we should claim the highest seat, the longest
                     legged chair—one in which we could sit with our feet on the top round, clear of
                     the water. We would not mind being a good deal doubled up, drawn together in a
                     heap like, for the sake of the company and the refreshments, but we should cut
                     the concern, vamose when the water began to come into our boots.</p>
                  <p>"Two hundred dead, to-day."</p>
                  <p>Well, what of that? Remember we speak not for ourself. Ours is not the voice of
                     a disintegrated atom, an individuality. We speak for the world, for aggregated
                     humanity, and we say what of that? Think of the physical suffering that wrung
                     the joints of these "two hundred dead" before the spirit left them. We answer
                     again, what of that? Is physical suffering a new thing under the sun, to
                     startle us by its cry of anguish, and make us to pause by the way-side for its
                     contemplation? Think of the sorrows, the tears that are wrung from the living,
                     the broken hearts, the crushed hopes that followed to the grave these "two
                     hundred dead, to-day." Again we repeat, what of that? Is sorrow a new thing on
                     the earth? Are broken hearts strangers to the world, or crushed hopes a
                     novelty? Talk not to us about physical suffering or mental anguish—what are
                     they to us? we have no time to listen. The bell rings, the steam whistle
                     shrieks, "All aboard!" cries the conductor, and we are off on the train that
                     never returns—the cars that are always running the same way. And herein is the
                     singularity of this railroad of life—there is no return train. The travel is
                     always in one direction. The world is moving, every living thing is whirling
                     with a rush towards the great terminus, and of all the countless millions that
                     have travelled that road, not one has ever returned. Strange fascinations,
                     wonderful attractions must that country have, from which no traveller ever
                     comes back.</p>
                  <p>But there are "two hundred dead to-day," say you. As an individual, we can
                     comprehend the vast amount of suffering, the aggregated anguish that pervades
                     the stricken city. The plague is no respecter of persons. It strikes every
                     where. The rich, the poor, the high, the low, the respected, and the
                     despised—the mother that breathes out her life in the arms of her children, and
                     the forsaken, that dies by the way-side. The pestilence smites at random every
                     where. Here is a gorgeous hearse, followed by a long train of mourners; the
                     dead is going to his rest beneath the shadow of a tall monument in the
                     cemetery. Handle the coffin tenderly, the ashes it contains are precious—jar it
                     not rudely.<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6610-00000048"/> There, is a deal coffin,
                     alone on a rude cart, on its way to the Potter's Field, the resting-place of
                     the desolate. Ask you who goes thus solitary to a nameless grave? The heartless
                     song of the official that sits upon his coffin, answers, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Rattle his bones over the stones,</l>

                     </q> The spirits that once breathed in these human Antipodes, are immortal.
                     They have gone to be judged at the same bar, under the same law, and to stand
                     side by side in the presence of the Judge, who looks straight into the heart,
                     and from whose vision nothing can be hid. What a lesson is here! Take care, oh!
                     rich man, look to it—that the despised pauper, whose dust is in the Potter's
                     Field, is not chosen of God, while you, whose ashes are beneath marble that is
                     inscribed with a lying epitaph, are rejected.</p>

                  <p>The moral leprosy of the soul, if uncured by the "healing waters," clings to it
                     throughout eternity; stripped as it may be of physical atoms, the plague spot
                     remains. The miser who barters salvation for treasure, who sells Heaven for
                     gold, carries with him his thirst for gain, which remains raging and quenchless
                     for ever. The debauchee who defied God, and scorned the restraints of His law,
                     finds in his burning lusts the hell he scoffed at. The murderer looks upon his
                     spectre hand, and sees upon it the redness of the blood he has spilled. His
                     awakened conscience, as he wanders an imponderable shadow in the region of
                     banished souls, is the torment of his eternity. The sin that is unrepented of
                     is a fiery and hissing serpent, coiling around the soul for ever, as the
                     serpents coiled around and crushed the Laocoon. But what of that? For this
                     moral pestilence, there is a cure. For the leprosy of the soul, there is a
                     healing balm. The blood-stains may be washed away, and the spirit of man be
                     re-clothed in a spotless garment. A voice from heaven calls to the leper;
                     speaking from the throne of God to the pestilence stricken, it cries: "Ho!
                     every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money,
                     come ye, buy and eat—buy wine and milk, without money and without price." In
                     these waters there is health. This wine and milk will charm away the
                     pestilence, and cleanse from the mark of the plague. They are free. Wealth
                     cannot purchase them, power cannot grasp them, strength cannot control them,
                     kings cannot command them. The earnest soul that asks will receive them; the
                     earnest seeker will find them. They are at the door of the penitent everywhere.
                     Poverty is no bar, weakness no prevention, obscurity no impediment to the
                        enjoyment<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6610-00000049"/> of them. Strange, then,
                     that men should die of moral pestilence, or pass into eternity with a poisoned
                     garment wrapped around them. That they should turn away from the healing
                     waters; that they should reject the wine and milk so freely offered; that they
                     should be deaf to the call of the helper, to the ten thousand invitations of
                     the Good Physician, urged every day and every hour of a lifetime. Man, only,
                     can be guilty of such madness and folly.</p>
                  <p>It would be sad, after a hard day's travel, to find no welcome, no glad face to
                     meet us, no news of home, of rest, of peace; no cheering voice to hail us
                     through the deepening gloom, "<emph>All right! this way, my friends—all
                        right!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>If we have secured seats in the right car, and our tickets are all regular, we
                        <emph>shall</emph> find a welcome, we <emph>shall</emph> meet glad faces—we
                        <emph>will</emph> find a home, and rest, and peace. When the night comes, a
                     cheering voice will hail us, through the deepening gloom, a kind hand will
                     guide us to our eternal habitation. There is no guess work, no uncertainty
                     about this; it is all fixed as the purposes, immutable as the promises of God.
                     But we must see to it, that we take the right train. The conductor we know. His
                     protection is sure. He will not deceive or forsake us. What he promises he
                     performs. Have no apprehension about that. Lean upon Him, trust Him, follow His
                     direction. He will carry us safely and surely to the end of our journey. When
                     we cross the dark valley of the shadow of death, He will be with us. We shall
                     hear his pleasant voice as time, and the things of time, the world, with its
                     troubles and its sorrows, pass away, welcoming us within the gates of the city
                     of God. There we shall have a place of rest, where weariness can never come
                     where age cannot visit us with its infirmities; where death cannot rob us of
                     our heart's treasures. Care and sorrow cannot enter there. Tears are never shed
                     there. Angels will be around us. The spirits of the loved ones that preceded
                     us, will be around us. There are no summer heats to oppress, no winters cold to
                     chill us, no night of darkness, no day of storms. Calm, and quiet, and peace
                     reign forever there. Years and months, the seasons, days and hours, are all
                     unknown there. Forever is written upon all things.</p>
                  <p>What matter, then, how soon we accomplish our journey? Nay, if we are in the
                     right car, will we not cry to the good conductor, "Faster, faster still, press
                     on the steam, wait not for the night of age, for the going down of the sun;
                     land us safe in the great city at noon, or even in the morning of life?" Why
                     should we tarry by the way? Why sigh as we pass along, and the beautiful things
                     of the world fall behind us, and vanish in the distance? Things more beautiful
                     await us at the end of our journey. Why start we, as gray hairs whiten our
                     heads, the brow becomes wrinkled with age, and stiffness takes hold of our
                     limbs, and the steps become slow and careful? These are but the mile-posts that
                     stand by the wayside, to tell us that our weary journey is drawing to its
                     close.</p>

                  <head>VIII. HOW POEMS LOOK IN PRINT.</head>
                  <p>WE send you, sir, to-day, three maidenly courtesies and a poem. The courtesies
                     you may keep, but the poem we want returned, in large and handsome type, so
                     that we may see how the thing looks in proper attire. It has been in type once,
                     some years ago, but in such a way as to make a very sorry appearance.</p>
                  <p>We all want copies—Snowdrop, Honeysuckle, Powerful, Mrs. Margin—and I can't
                     tell how many distant cousins and friends; including the strong-minded young
                     ladies, who have not yet arrived. Send therefore, as Col. T. used to say, send
                     a <emph>quan</emph>tity, marked "<hi rend="i"/>Country,—care of Small Bob,
                     Roaring River."</p>
                  <p>Our friends being about to return to their home in the mountains, we desire to
                     part fair: and as a last expression suitable for a time of good-byes, we put
                     argument aside, and join hands over this little poem. Here it is: <q>

                  <p>"The courtesies you may keep, but the poem we want returned in large, handsome
                     type, so that we may see how the thing looks in proper attire."</p>
                  <p>In regard to the "courtesies," we can, of course, keep them, and we can return
                     the poem in the manner indicated, but we do not altogether like the manner in
                     which we have been treated in this matter. When we started with our friend
                     "MARGINS," we set out solely with a view of having a little friendly chat with
                     him by the way, which chat we took for granted would be held in honest
                     old-fashioned English prose. We had no idea that we were to be confounded by
                     the use of unknown tongues, or led a dance through the mazes of poetry. Time
                     was when we strung rhymes, and thought that we were Byronic in our
                     versification. We have given up that idea years ago. The occasion of our
                     cutting the society of the muses was this:—We had a good many leisure hours on
                     hand when we commenced the practice of the law. Briefs were not as plenty as
                     blackberries with us, and we undertook to fill up the time between them by
                     literary efforts. We resided in a flourishing village then, which rejoiced in a
                     newspaper published weekly. Through the columns of that paper we poured our
                     effusions for the benefit of the reading world, securely hid, as we supposed,
                     behind a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nom de plume</foreign> selected from the most
                     celebrated names of the olden times. But this is an envious world. It cannot
                     bear to see merit working its way upward. Genius will be hawked at, and if
                     possible brought down to the level of plodding humanity. It was so with us. A
                     very particular friend of ours undertook to criticise our poetry. And he cut,
                     and slashed, and belabored, and ridiculed our effusions and ourself in a manner
                     in no way pleasant to the feelings of a very vain young man. The worst of it
                     was, his criticisms were, in the main, just. He succeeded in satisfying the
                     world, so far as <emph>our</emph> poetry and <emph>his</emph> criticisms were
                     read by it, that we would never become immortal in that line. What may be
                     regarded as still more singular, he satisfied <emph>us</emph> of the same fact.
                        We<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6610-00000052"/> cut the muses, and for twenty
                     odd years have not, save on two or three occasions, undertaken rhyme. Some
                     three or four years ago, we listened to GOUGH, the celebrated and eloquent
                     temperance lecturer. As one of the causes which induced habits of intemperance,
                     he spoke of the convivial suppers sometimes indulged in by young men—feasts
                     where the wine flowed freely, and the song, the story, and the merry jest
                     accompanied the circulation of the bottle. He said he never saw or heard of
                     these convivial feasts without imagining that they were got up by the
                     "gentleman in black" for the purpose of ensnaring victims, and that he always
                     thought he could hear his demon laugh above the bacchanalian revelry, and see
                     the print of his hoof among the broken glass upon the floor. Indeed, he said he
                     always regarded them as dinners given by Satan to his followers, to confirm
                     them in his service, and he could, at such times, almost see him sitting with
                     his horned head, dragon tail, and cloven hoof, at the table, encouraging the
                     revellers in debauchery. From that lecture, we returned to our office, and
                     indited the following. We had never any idea of its publication, and it would
                     not have been given for the edification of the world now, had not our friend
                     "MARGINS" cornered us by his effusion. On him, therefore, rests the
                     responsibility.</p>

                  <head>IX. ISOLATION.</head>
                  <p>SLEEP, oh, beautiful sleep, if thou wert an angel, I would kneel down here and
                     thank thee for this hour of cool repose.</p>
                  <p>So I said or thought this afternoon after waking from dreams and refreshment on
                     the parlor sofa. I had wandered home latish in the day, to find the house
                     closed and desolate. All gone! all but my father, and he asleep in his room—all
                     gone. Of course they were. I had just been to see them off.</p>
                  <p>Well, as you say, what of that? Why, my excellent Editor, you may say "what of
                     that?" as much as you please, but this crawling into your own house, by the
                     well-door or a back cellar window, is a dismal piece of business. Rooms empty
                     and dark, and with that cold smell, into which you go sneezing, and stepping
                     carefully about like a cat, and the servants so quiet and low-toned as though
                     it were Sunday again. Oh, would it were Sunday—the day of days, the glory of
                     the week—the keystone of the arch.</p>
                  <p>Ugh! throw open the windows and give us light, <emph>light!</emph> LIGHT!</p>

                  <p>Ah, sir, I don't ask for Sunday. I am not in the mood for it. No, nor for any
                     day. What can I do with this solemn circumstantiality, this inevitable
                     proceeding, this right foot foremost forever? Give me rather (if I may choose),
                     some cast-off fragment, some rough piece of chaos, not yet fashioned into any
                     respectable day-time, so it be other than this bright, glittering, mocking
                     Monday afternoon, which finds my house desolate, as I have said, and my very
                     particular friend full of travel, and talk, and laughter, a hundred miles away!
                     To go away as I did, so <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vive</foreign> and <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">elate,</foreign> and come back drooping and wiltered to be as
                     a cheese-paring in the face of this dazzling sunshine! Thunders and red
                     lightnings; it seems to me I should like, but this white light, this breezy
                     Monday I <emph>don't</emph> like, and there's no use in talking about it.</p>
                  <p>Such was the perverse mood, sir, which sleep has charmed away.</p>
                  <p>For we have had pleasant days, though they are gone; genial days, and nights
                     all-glorious. Sunrises and sunsets, painted with the hues and tones of the
                     first day. Day-dreams and night-dreams, glad faces, and hearts more glad, and
                     disquisitions, and argumentations solid as the primeval granite. All gone now,
                     but not lost—thank God for that—not lost, but a part of our being, and
                     forever.</p>
                  <p>Backward, looking into these few past weeks, my eye drops upon many pleasant
                     pictures, and as the artists say, <emph>studies,</emph> of a tempting
                     character; and so looking, I behold on one of those most solstitial days, two
                     men, strangers to me, who were walking up our yard, doubtless seeking for what
                     might happen to turn up. One was stoutish, and as you may say, established in
                     all his ways; the other jaunty in both look and carriage, black hair, if I
                     remember aright, with a twist in it, and a decided cock to his hat. The idea,
                     as it recurs in my mind (for it is all dream-like now, in the distance), the
                     memory is, that after shaking myself a little to make sure that I was awake, I
                     showed those gentlemen into our parlor, just about sunset, while a smart crack
                     of thunder was waking up all our northern sky, and that soon after we all took
                     tea and compared notes somewhat, as was proper to men of high consideration. My
                     people, as I remember it, were in white, (my wife, certainly,) and all was
                     cordial and serene. Doubtless there was laughing, and blushing, and pell-mell
                     talking, and a handsome confusion of exchange and interchange, but the picture,
                     as aforesaid, was in its general tone cordial and serene. But it was all like a
                     panorama; for my new friends straightway lighted cigars and departed over
                     Roaring River, and soon after, were wheeling away swiftly into the south. This
                     is one of the pleasant summer pictures in our gallery, and if you, Mr. Editor,
                     ever meet such stout man with a Webster-like build of face and figure, and that
                     other individual, with a twist in his black hair, and hat at an angle—I say,
                     sir—give them my regards.</p>

                  <p>Reminiscences are pleasant, but facts remain. You have pictures, but "it is
                        <emph>not</emph> good for man to be alone." If a man withdraws from the
                     world, and still lives a high, pure life, it is not because he is alone, it is
                     because he is not alone. He is living with God. He is in a Presence, to which
                     the coming in of whatever hosts on earth, or in heaven, add and detract
                     nothing. But this is not isolation.</p>
                  <p>And a child, scarcely as yet conscious of this Presence, save in a remote way
                     (as when with closed eyes, we feel, but do not see the light), will while away
                     hour after hour with something of His handiwork—a streak of sunlight, or a
                     pebble, or a flower. Put it out in the grass, under a rose-bush, and see the
                     thing wonder and philosophize, and laugh, all alone (?) to itself. Not much
                     talking at this time, but what grave exclamations, what wise points of
                     admiration, what profound and questioning looks over a leaf, or a blade of
                     grass! A year or two later, put this curious thing out there again, and it
                     begins to combine and arrange. The pebble, and the grass, and the flower, are
                     worn out. They have talked everything up for the present, and now it says, let
                     us prepare for war, or, if of the gentler sex, for a tea-party! In either case,
                     it is not alone—far from it; nor unhappy—far from it; it is just one bubble of
                     enjoyment. But if you want to hear its reserve force, in full Bedlam
                     exhibition, just put it in a dark closet alone.</p>
                  <p>I never saw but one child that I thought would bear that quietly. It was a
                     papoose from the Florida everglades. Col. Harney had been exploring those
                     recesses, shooting and hanging the Indians never before disturbed in those
                     retreats, and on one of the little grassy islands, that are scattered about in
                     those clear waters, this youngster was found, after a fight, and brought up a
                     prisoner of war, to St. Augustine. He was the gravest piece of humanity that I
                     ever beheld. A week before, it is safe to say, he had never seen a white man,
                     or any of his novelties. Very likely all that he had seen of the world was that
                     one island, with the bright water running up and away from its shores. Always
                     there day and night, running up and away again; always clear and bright and
                     sweet to the taste. This, and the high grass waving far away into the distance,
                     overtopped here and there by a palm, was all the world to him. There, perhaps,
                     he had heard of the Great Spirit, whose are all the islands and the waters, and
                     the red men and white men; and who has said, "vengeance is mine; I will repay."
                     There his mother had crooned wild songs over the little red face, and his
                     father had tumbled him in the grass and taught him the war-whoop. He didn't
                     want any other father or mother. They were good enough for him. They were gone
                     now, and here was everything new and strange. Houses, streets, faces, language,
                     all new, all strange. But nothing surprised him, nothing moved him, nothing
                     would make him laugh, and certainly if his face told a true story, there was
                     nothing to make him fear.<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6610-00000057"/> His keen
                     black eyes were constantly busy noting this thing and that, but in such a
                     blank, sad way, sad, not from its intensity, but from its want of all feeling,
                     as though he saw nothing to his liking. Very nice, very fastidious was he, that
                     nothing would suit his particular humor. Whether, in fact, this cool, blank
                     look, was that of ignorance and stupidity, I know not; or whether he saw
                     continually before him a picture of his father dangling from the fig-tree on
                     his little island home in the everglades. Hanging there all day in the bright
                     sunlight, but so still and speechless. Hanging there all night, staring with
                     dead wide-open eyes, at the white moon and the stars!</p>
                  <p>In any case, that boy seemed to me quite alone in the world.</p>
                  <p>But isolation, literal and absolute, would probably be death; and not merely
                     death of the body, but annihilation of all being. There are lonely beings now
                     in the world, thousands and tens of thousands, who, without leadings of thought
                     and hope from the cloud of witnesses about them, or from the felt presence of
                     God himself, would sink at once into nothingness,—burn out like a candle, body
                     and soul. And there are others of us,—God help us all,—still more lonely and
                     desolate, seeking always for this same isolation, as though in that was the
                     very joy of life. Chalk-marking and laying out the bounds, saying, "That's
                        <emph>mine,</emph>—take care! don't step over there, you are on
                        <emph>my</emph> premises," and so in a general way crying out
                        "<emph>Scat,</emph>" and "<emph>Whee!</emph>" to everything about. The great
                     fact being all the time (as we get to know some day, or die as the fool dieth)
                     that man unassisted, or <emph>independent,</emph> as we say, is but small
                     comfort to himself. And this, because he feels that he is with a stranger; a
                     being with whom, as yet, he has scarcely more than a nodding acquaintance; one
                     who, for aught he knows, may yet turn out a robber and a cut-throat.</p>
                  <p>Am I exaggerating? Not a bit of it. Every man of thought knows this. He bears
                     his own burden; he carries his own secret with him. If he looks within, it is
                     not his whole being at which he looks, for he can see but one thing at a time,
                     and he is manifold in make—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">E Pluribus Unum</foreign>—a
                     sort of United States of being—wheels within wheels—a strange mechanism, the
                     motive power of which is all in double darkness—an infernal machine, which may
                     blow him up, he knows not how soon. No man feels that he is his own master. He
                     cannot wholly guide his own being. Any one who imagines that he has any power
                     of his own over his nature, has fooled himself to believe a lie. It is his
                     nature that guides, and has power over, him. It sways about with him this way
                     and that, and it never rests for one solitary moment of time. It is like a
                     star, whose glimmer is unceasing. You can never look it in the face, for it
                     never will be still, for you to do it. While you look for it here, presto, it
                     is there. While you fancy you are having a fair <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >tête-à-tête,</foreign>
                     <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6610-00000058"/> behold it is in California or the
                     South Seas. While you are bending over it microscopically, it has gone six
                     times around the world, and is back again fresh as ever. Lively, pert,
                     inquisitive, joyous at times, and mourning at times, and at other times puffed
                     with such impudence and deviltry, as hell itself must feed, to give it such an
                     air of royalty and dominion. There is no peace with this strange composition,
                     till a man seeks his Maker, and asks for power over himself, day by day, and
                     night by night, and hour by hour, until he may escape from this wild existence
                     into something pure and rational.</p>
                  <p>And this something pure and rational—this life, as distinguished from
                     death—what is it? It is not motion, as we have said, or momentum. Nor is it
                     isolation, or inertia, or repose in the sense of rest. It is (as far as we may
                     guess) action, needing no repose. It is health after disease, sanity after
                     incipient madness! It is thought, fluent and burning as a star, high above day
                     and night, and change. It is self-possession and strength. It is a part of the
                     glory of God. It is crowned. It is triumphant. It is a living Hallelujah. It is
                     wisdom, and knowledge, and power; and its utterance—the loftiest speech given
                     to men or angels,—"<emph>Glory be to God in the highest! Amen and
                     amen!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>And doubtless this life must be begun here, if begun at all; must be entered
                     upon, if at all, here, in this bustling and changing world, amid eating, and
                     drinking, and working, and dreaming, and strife, and trouble, and pain, and
                     whatever apparent confusion confounded—"for there is no work, nor device, nor
                     knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave;" and life, in its essential elements, is
                     the same in all places and at all times, and, like God himself, is unchangeable
                     and everlasting.</p>
                  <p>Good-night, sir. We have had a long, <emph>lonely</emph> talk. I will go up,
                     now, and seek for more of that sweet oblivion which I found this afternoon, on
                     the parlorsofa. Good-night.</p>
                  <p>Yours,—.</p>
                  <p>Sleep! oh! beautiful sleep, if thou wert an angel, I would kneel down here and
                     worship thee for this hour of cool repose.</p>
                  <p>We worship no such divinity as sleep, angel, or no angel. We are against sleep
                     as an active principle, an entity. We look upon it as a necessity, enforced,
                     thrust upon the world; a thing to be endured with resignation, rather than
                     worshipped as a God. Sleep, indeed! Will anybody tell us what good, what
                     pleasurable thing, what positive emotion, there can be in dull Oblivion—in
                     lying down with closed eyes, the mind a blank, and the physical man utterly
                     prostrate and powerless? Have you a purse? A thief can steal it. Have you a
                     house? The incendiary may burn it over you. Have you an enemy? He may cut your
                     throat, and this same divinity, sleep, say no word against it. Mark, we don't
                     deny the recuperative power of sleep—we<pb n="112-113"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000059"/> confess its utility. When we are weary, sleep is
                     a good thing, a very pleasant thing. But it is all negative, only an absence of
                     weariness, a cessation of pain—nothing more. And as well might a hungry man
                     worship a leg of mutton or a rump steak, because eating it will allay his
                     hunger.</p>
                  <p>But to sleep! to dream! Very pleasant things are dreams, we admit,
                     sometimes—not always. We can't choose our dreams. They come unbidden, and are
                     the subjects of no volition of our own; shadows all, they come and go, and
                     leave no trace, no footprint on the sand, no mark on the wall. We rather like
                     dreams—they are racy; they have no affinities with the sober experience, the
                     hard realities of life. Natural laws are nothing to the dreamer. He laughs at,
                     he spurns their control, and glancing above them, revels in impossibilities.
                     The birds talk with him. Dumb animals converse with him. Even the trees bend
                     their tall heads, and while their leaves are playing with the summer winds,
                     open their queer mouths and speak to him. We had a dream once: we have had
                     many; but this was impressive, peculiar, and left its strange transitions
                     firmly fixed in our memory.</p>
                  <p>It was three years ago. We were out in the woods with a guide, sleeping in a
                     shanty built by ourselves on the banks of the St. Regis Lake, one of those
                     beautiful little sheets of water lying all alone in the forest away up north.
                     Our shanty was built in this wise: In front of the gigantic trunk of a fallen
                     tree, and at some eight feet distance from it, and as many feet from each
                     other, we placed two forked posts. Across these we laid a pole, and from each
                     another pole, to the great log. Others still were laid parallel with these as
                     rafters, and over all was spread bark peeled from the trees around. The sides
                     were built up with boughs, in order to keep off the lateral dampness. The front
                     was open, and directly before the <emph>door,</emph> which, by the way, was the
                     whole broadside of our dwelling, was a <emph>smudge,</emph> or fire built to
                     keep the musquitoes and black flies from devouring us. Our bed was of green
                     boughs. We had travelled far that day, and were hungry and weary when we
                     reached the lake. My guide built the shanty while I caught a string of
                     brook-trout, in a little stream that came laughing and scolding from the hills
                     to lose itself in the waters of the lake. These, with a steak from a deer we
                     had killed, afforded us a hearty supper, and we ate as hungry men in the forest
                     are apt to do. As the darkness closed in upon the world, and while the stars
                     were coming out one after another to hold their watch in the sky, we laid
                     ourselves down on our bed of boughs to sleep. The solemn night voices were all
                     around us; and weary from travel and lethargic from a wildwood feast, we soon
                     passed into slumber.</p>
                  <p>As we slept upon that bed of boughs that night, strange visions passed before
                     us. We were away in a new world, and yet all that we saw was familiar,<pb
                        n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6610-00000060"/> nothing seemed strange to us; we
                     were among beings that we seemed to know; not men and women, but rather the
                     spirits of men and women; not as of those who had died, and whose bodies were
                     mouldering in the grave—they had form, but not substance; shadows that moved
                     and spoke; that seemed formed after the similitude of men and women, but
                     through whose forms the sunlight passed. We possessed all the attributes of
                     humanity, save a real, tangible body. Hands, and limbs, and body, we seemed to
                     possess, palpable to the vision, but not to the touch. Hunger, and cold, and
                     heat, and pain, were things that seemed to us unknown. Space and time were as
                     nothing. We passed at once without effort, like thought, from place to place.
                     We think of scenes far distant from us—memory calls up the stream, the lake,
                     the meadow, the great trees, the cottage, and the garden; we say thought
                     wanders away to such scenes. Well, this seemed to be with us a reality. If we
                     thought of a scene, a locality, hundreds or thousands of miles away, at once we
                     were there.</p>
                  <p>We thought of Rome, of the great St. Peter's, and there we stood, beneath that
                     gigantic temple. We thought of the pyramids, and stood at their base, and
                     talked familiar with the mummies that slept within those granite piles. We
                     thought of Waterloo, and there we stood surveying that mighty conflict. We saw
                     legions of men hurled against legions of men. We heard the roar of the cannon,
                     and the rattle of musketry. We saw the smoke of battle wreathing up from
                     blazing battalions. We saw the flashing of swords, as vast squadrons of
                     horsemen mowed down the flying foe. We heard the groans of the wounded, and the
                     wild shrieks of the dying. We passed unharmed through the conflicting hosts,
                     looking upon the dying and the dead. Wherever we chose to be, at once we were
                     there. How we passed we know not—the fact alone we remember. As our body was
                     intangible, it was unaffected by the elements. Fire would not burn it, water
                     would not drown it, We could walk on the bottom of the ocean with a thousand
                     fathom of water above us. We could plunge into the volcano's seething cauldron.
                     Rocks would not crush us, and precipices, down which we plunged, were harmless
                     as the level plain. Such a being were we, and such were those around us.
                     Shadows, mere intellectualities existing palpably to the vision, having form
                     and comeliness, but unfettered and unconfined by a fleshly body. Of such a
                     body, it seemed to us, we had never heard, save in the wild theories of some
                     metaphysical dreamer. Its existence was a subject of derision, and those who
                     upheld its reality were regarded as idle visionaries, nay, as profane rejecters
                     of philosophical truths.</p>
                  <p>"A change came o'er the spirit of our dream."</p>
                  <p>We were away in the midst of the broad prairies of the West. They lay there as
                     they came from the<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6610-00000061"/> Creator's hand.
                     The eye of civilization had never before looked upon them, and no civilized man
                     had set his foot upon the green grass that vegetated upon their bosom. All
                     around us were vast plains, treeless and shrubless as a shorn meadow. Away off,
                     on the one hand, hanging like a blue dim shadow upon the horizon, was a belt
                     that we knew to be timber; while, on the other, on the very outside boundary of
                     vision, loomed up the gigantic peaks of the Rocky Mountains, moveless and
                     fixed, like sentinels of God, watching the boundless plains beneath them. The
                     tall grass waved like vast fields of grain in the summer winds; rich flowers of
                     the most gorgeous hues sent their wild fragrance abroad on the air, charming
                     the vision by their glory, and entrancing the senses by their sweetness. In all
                     this vast plain we saw no living thing. All around us was silence; vegetation
                     alone seemed to live there—and that grew and flourished in richest and wildest
                     luxuriance. It was like a vast garden, planted and nourished by the hand of
                     nature, unaided, as it was unchecked, by the ingenuity or the industry of man.
                     Suddenly a blight seemed to pass over that vast plain; the flowers faded; the
                     tall grass shrivelled and died; the leaves on the rank weeds rolled together,
                     and were blown away by hot winds that swept over that ocean of land; vegetation
                     withered into a gray and sapless mass, standing where it grew; the streams,
                     that were wont to move in sluggish and tortuous windings, were dried up,
                     leaving channels like the trails of gigantic serpents; the blight of drought
                     was upon all nature about us.</p>
                  <p>As we stood wrapped in contemplation of the immensity around us, a dull heavy
                     sound fell upon our ear, like the rumbling of a thousand carriages over the
                     rough pavement of a far-off city. Turning in the direction whence the sound
                     seemed to come, we saw in the distance vast herds of deer and antelopes, flying
                     at wild speed towards the spot where we stood. Behind these came an army of
                     elks; their stately horns, glancing and waving in the sunlight, seemed like a
                     forest of dead, low, barkless trees. Behind these came thundering down again,
                     millions and millions of buffalo, making the earth tremble with the weight of
                     their rushing and countless hosts. For miles and miles, in width as well as in
                     depth, this vast herd covered the plain, bellowing and roaring in seeming
                     terror at some terrible destruction behind them. Then came vast droves of
                     wolves, panting and howling in immense numbers, with jaws distended and tongues
                     lolling out, like hounds wearied by the chase. None seemed seeking for prey; a
                     mortal terror was upon all; all were fleeing, as it seemed for life, towards
                     the belt of timber land visible in the distance. These vast waves of animal
                     life swept by us; the roar of their countless voices died away like the tempest
                     in its onward flight. Then we saw the reason of their mortal<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000062"/> terror. Away in the distance, was a dense line
                     of dark murky smoke wreathing and twisting heavenward, wrapping earth and sky
                     in its sombre folds. On came the fearful visitation, preceded by a line of fire
                     athwart the whole of that vast plain, flashing and glancing upward as new fuel
                     was grasped by its devouring tongue, and it was hurled onward by the rushing
                     winds. On it came crackling and roaring, like a mighty billow of flame,
                     devouring and overwhelming all things in its terrible career. Onward and onward
                     it came with the speed of the war-horse, and the roar of the tornado. Before it
                     was destruction; in its rear the blackness of desolation. Far as the eye could
                     reach, on the right hand and on the left, it moved in a line of fire, leaving
                     no escape save an onward flight. We stood spell-bound as it approached; that
                     mighty prairie seemed rolled up as it swept along like a vast scroll, while the
                     impenetrable obscurity behind it was like the darkness that was of old on the
                     face of the deep. It approached—it surrounded—it enveloped us within its folds,
                     when——we awoke, and behold it was a <emph>dream!</emph> and "yet not all a
                     dream." The fire we had kindled in front of our shanty had crept along the dry
                     leaves until it reached the foot of a dead fir-tree, among whose thick and
                     withered branches a wild grape-vine had spread its thousand tendrils. That too
                     was dead; the fire had crept up the dry trunk of that dead fir-tree, and having
                     reached the net-work of vines and sapless branches, it burst out into a
                     brilliant flame. When we started from our sleep it was flashing and crackling,
                     and twirling upwards, lighting up forest and lake like a vast torch in the hand
                     of some gigantic demon of the woods.</p>

                  <head>X. D, WITH A DASH TO IT.</head>
                  <p>OH, compositors! oh, proof-readers! and you, oh, printers' devils! if you have
                     anything to do with it, please give us the facts which we send you, as they
                     are. The facts, not imaginations.</p>
                  <p>We admit that words are poor and inexpressive signs, but they are all we have
                     to talk with. And we can approximate somewhat to each other's ideas, by a
                     proper use of words. Usage has attached to them certain meanings and values,
                     and by judgment and care, a man may sometimes say almost the very thing which
                     he has in mind. But, my dear sirs, it is a delicate business. It is walking a
                     very tight rope, and requires the most careful balance and fixedness of
                     purpose. Moreover, it requires a perfect agreement and unity of action. If we
                     say oh, ah, bah, and so forth, then we expect from you the same oh, ah, bah,
                     and so forth. If we say <emph>ex-plum-bum, ex-plum-bum</emph> it is.
                     Ex-bum-plum won't do, or plumbum-ex. No, sirs, give us nothing else but the
                     great fact, EX-PLUM-BUM!</p>
                  <p>If you diverge the slightest from this solemn exactness, you depart, at once,
                     into fictions and all uncertainties. In short, you are in a dangerous way. You
                     don't know—you can't conceive—and no man can know or conceive for you—the
                     long-drawn mischief, to which you give such a heedless beginning. Why, sirs,
                     you disturb the harmony of the world—the moral equilibrium of things. You do
                     not merely stand in the light, you bring down midnight. You "create
                     darkness."</p>
                  <p>This, I grant, is not always the case; for when you merely print
                        <emph>on</emph> for <emph>or,</emph> as in a late paper of ours, a shrewd
                     reader may discover the error; but when you drop whole words, containing the
                     heart of a paragraph, I can scarcely express my astonishment. How you can sleep
                     at night, after putting forth such fragments to the world, it is difficult to
                     say.</p>
                  <p>But to some rules there are exceptions, and although this belongs to nearly the
                     highest ethics, and is, in fact, almost that perfect law to which exceptions
                     are impossible, there is one exception to this rule, and it would rejoice my
                     heart to see it always recognized.</p>
                  <p>A club-mate of mine, who had been living a gay life, as he supposed, discovered
                     his mistake and reformed; and in a letter to a mutual friend, cautioned him not
                     to write any more, "<emph>d, with a dash to it.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>This, sirs, is that exception, which, if always observed in papers and books,
                     would gladden the hearts of thousands upon thousands—this d, with a<pb
                        n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6610-00000064"/> dash to it. Drop it, Mr. Compositor;
                     drop it, proofreader, down with it, cast it out; it is a devil. Don't use d,
                     with a dash to it. It is not gentlemanly, it is not manly, it is not decent. It
                     is no part of a man's language. It is that abominable thing which God hates,
                     and why should not you and I? There is no such blot in the heavens, or on the
                     earth. No bird, or beast, no mountain brook, or cataract, or earthquake, or
                     thunders even, that ever utter that word. It is of the Devil's make and man's
                     adoption; applied to everything hot, cold, wet and dry, head, eyes, and body,
                     and (Heaven forgive us) to the soul itself, while it has no fitness for any one
                     thing or person placed, or living legitimately on this our earth. It belongs to
                     that place prepared for the Devil and his angels. It is proper there. It is
                     there for the place and its people. But you and I, my friend, are not yet
                     sentenced. Thanks be to our Father in Heaven, the blue sky is still "bending
                     over us all." <emph>We</emph> have not yet gone down into darkness and
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>Oh! of all smallest performances under the sun, what a study for a Hogarth, is
                     that of "man, born like a wild ass's colt," calling hastily for the day of
                     judgment, with this d, with a dash to it! What courage! what heroism! what
                     greatness! what a sublimely high purpose! My own life has been so joyous, not
                     to say exultant, that I cannot presume to know how terribly some may be
                     tempted; but I can well imagine that here and there, and more than here and
                     there, in the pressing crowd who are daily moving on to the grave, there may be
                     uplifted hands and trembling aspirations; I can imagine many a sinking heart
                     and weary brain <emph>tempted,</emph> if you please, to cry, "Spare us, Good
                     Lord; Christ, have mercy upon us!"—but to invoke <emph>evil</emph>—to ask for
                     death and perdition, oh! the madness—the madness!</p>
                  <p>Tastes no doubt differ, and to some, d, with a dash to it, may have a pleasant
                     twang, but I would rather have a pistol fired in my hair, than ever hear it, or
                     any of its horrid combinations, and I never heard it even repeated, as from
                     another, in rounding a story or giving a fancied point to an anecdote, that it
                     was not accompanied with a sheep-faced consciousness of having done a very
                     small thing. I never saw a man detected in stealing a leg of mutton, but I
                     should think such a man would have just about such an expression of
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>There are people who think they feel better, sometimes, for "blowing off
                     steam," as they call it. But swearing is not blowing off steam; it is bursting
                     the boiler. Doubtless, as a people, we carry too many pounds to the square
                     inch—let us blow off, by all means, but don't let us suppose that the final
                     cause and end of steam is to "blow up."</p>
                  <p>The truth is, we may, with just as much propriety, just as much kindness, and
                     about the same effect, throw vitriol about among our friends, as to<pb
                        n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6610-00000065"/> foul the pure air of heaven with
                     oaths and blasphemies.</p>
                  <p>Is it not so, Mr. Editor, Mr. Compositor, Mr. Proof-reader? Then let us make it
                     so. Let us down with d, with a dash to it.</p>
                  <p>Its force is weakness—its point is bathos. The world is bad enough, wicked
                     enough, wretched enough, miserable enough; but it is not so bad, or wicked, or
                     wretched, or miserable, as to give any logic or fitness to d, with a dash to
                     it. It is not yet in order.</p>
                  <p>What say you all to giving it the cold shoulder? Eh! What's the vote? Send me,
                     Mr. Editor, the ayes and noes, on the following proposition: Never to
                     print—never to write—never to utter—never to listen to it—never in any way,
                     shape, or manner, open or sly, to use "d, with a dash to it."</p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"If you diverge the slightest from this solemn exactness, you depart at once
                     into fiction, and all uncertainties. In short, you are in a dangerous way. Why,
                     sirs, you disturb the harmony of the world—the moral equilibrium of things; you
                     do not merely stand in the light, you bring down midnight—you create
                     darkness."</p>
                  <p>Just so! We have laughed and scolded and said a good many things, that to some
                     might sound like profane swearing, over this same matter. We have been
                     victimized ourself, dozens of times—made to say all sorts of queer things, by
                     the mere change of a letter, or mistake of a word. We came to our present
                     position entirely green, as to all matters pertaining to the management of a
                     newspaper. We had not, in all our life, had an hour's experience in
                     proof-reading. We have tried our best to improve in this respect, but we still
                     fall very short of perfection. The types make us say a good many things we
                     never dreamed of, and the worst of it is, when they speak, whatever they say,
                     becomes a fixed fact, unchangeable as destiny, standing there impregnable,
                     defiant of all human agency to change it.</p>
                  <p>Not long since, we visited a friend in the country, and in giving an account of
                     our ramblings and the pleasant things we had seen, we undertook to describe his
                     beautiful garden, and in doing so, spoke of a thrifty fig-tree and its fruit.
                     We claim some genius for graphic description, and have always been a little
                     proud of our efforts in that line. Judge then of our mortification, when our
                     attention was called to the fact that we had hung all manner of "PIGS" on the
                     oriental tree in our friend's conservatory, from the little green nucleus from
                     which the blossom had just fallen, to the fully ripe "<emph>pig.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>On another occasion we had been presented with a basket of oranges. Large,
                     ripe, and luscious the fruit was, direct from the sunny South, where it grew.
                     We acknowledged the gift in suitable terms, as all editors who are presented
                     with nice things should. The next day one of those joke-finders, that are
                        permitted<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6610-00000066"/> mitted, for some
                     inscrutable purpose, to pester the world, stalked into our office and gravely
                     inquired about the basket of "<emph>ourangoutangs</emph>" we had been favored
                     with. "Bring us the paper of yesterday!" we thundered to our devil, (not he of
                     the hoof and horns,) who was sitting cross-legged on a stool, studying the
                     programme of a band of negro melodists, who were to give a banjo and bone
                     concert in the evening. The paper was brought, and sure as fate, we had
                     acknowledged the receipt of a basket of most beautiful "OURANGOUTANGS," from
                     our esteemed friend Mr. JOHN SMITH, who had just received a cargo of the same
                     sort, at his old stand on the Hill.</p>
                  <p>A friend of ours, who was formerly connected with the press, as the editor of a
                     country newspaper, relates an amusing anecdote on this subject. He had an old
                     chum, whose name was BULLOCK, and who took to himself a wife one day. Our
                     friend, who attended the wedding, undertook to announce, in a becoming manner,
                     through the columns of his paper, the happy event. In the afternoon of the day
                     on which the announcement was made, Mr. BULLOCK strode into his office, with
                     face blazing, and eyes flashing with indignation, one hand grasping a
                     newspaper, and the other closed up into a compact bunch of bones, like a
                     sledge-hammer—"Look you, Mr. D——," said he, with a voice choking with anger,
                     "by what name am I to be called? Answer me that, you type-setting,
                     quill-driving son of a cylinder press." "Hallo," cried our friend, "what's out,
                     now?" "I want to know what my name is—my NAME, that's what's out," cried the
                     enraged BULLOCK. "Your name? Why BULLOCK, to be sure—Mr. J. D. BULLOCK, M.
                     D.—who ever disputed that?" replied our astonished friend. "Look there," said
                     the excited married man, pointing to the announcement of his own wedding in our
                     friend's paper, and there, sure enough, was the marriage of the beautiful and
                     accomplished Miss AMELIA AGNES So and So, to J. D. BULLCALF, Esquire, M. D.,
                     with an acknowledgment of the receipt of a large slice of the bride's loaf, and
                     a liberal puff for the wedding, which, under all the circumstances, looked
                     mightily like a burlesque. The evident mortification of the editor, and his
                     solemn word of honor that it was purely a mistake, appeased the injured party;
                     but our friend always insisted that he narrowly escaped a personal assault on
                     that occasion.</p>
                  <p>We are getting used to these things, and they do not trouble us as they did
                     once. They are vexatious enough, but they <emph>will</emph> happen. Writers
                     will, through all time, suffer from the inaccuracies of compositors and
                     proof-readers. The best remedy we know of, is contained in the prescription of
                     a medical friend of ours, who is principled against curing the toothache by
                     extracting the troublesome molar. "Doctor," said a suffering patient, with his
                     under jaw in a sling like a broken arm, and one side of his face swollen to the
                     semblance of the moiety of a<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6610-00000067"/>
                     moderately sized pumpkin, "I've got the tooth-ache!" "<emph>Have</emph> you?"
                     said the doctor, calmly. "Yes, I have," replied the patient, "and it's the
                     jumping toothache, too. This infernal grinder kicks like a whole team of
                     mules." "<emph>Does</emph> it?" said the doctor, calm and cold as an iceberg.
                     "Yes, it <emph>does,</emph>" was the answer. "What shall I do for this
                     intolerable agony?" "Grin and bear it, and be thankful that you've got teeth
                     enough in your head to ache," replied the Doctor, as he turned his back on the
                     suffering patient and walked away. So we say to all authors, and our friend,
                     MARGINS, in particular, in view of these occasional typographical blunders,
                     "Grin and bear it," and be thankful for the talent that enables you to furnish
                     a work in which the world sees beauty enough to be marred by a "mistake of the
                     printer."</p>
                  <p>Is it not so, Mr. Editor, Mr. Compositor, Mr. Proof-reader? Then let us make it
                     so. Let us down with d, with a dash to it.</p>
                  <p>It is all very well to <emph>talk</emph> about this downing "with d, with a
                     dash to it." Reform is a pleasant thing to talk about in a quiet way, to think
                     of, and speculate upon. In our closet we may imagine what a wrong thing this or
                     that popular habit may be—how unproductive of good—how pregnant of evil—how
                     easily its folly may be demonstrated, and how readily it will be abandoned by
                     the people when they come to understand it. All theory! all imagination! our
                     dear MARGINS. Strong as we may be in logic in these closet interviews with
                     ourselves, there is one thing wanting, the lack of which annihilates our
                     theories, and dissipates our imaginings like the mists that go up in the early
                     morning, from the cascades and waterfalls of your Roaring River. Go out into
                     the streets, and preach reform in this matter. Take the swearer by the
                     button-hole, and pour your exhortations, your logic, your demonstrations into
                     his ear. Tell him it belittles humanity, and is a sin against God. Prove its
                     folly, its utter uselessness. It's hazarding the great interest of the soul,
                     for that which is more utterly worthless than a mess of pottage. He won't
                     argue, he won't gainsay a word of your excellent admonition. He'll stand like a
                     post until you have exhausted the subject and passed on. Then, as his companion
                     emerges from around the corner, and comes within speaking distance, he'll point
                     you out as one of those reformers (coupling the latter epithet, may be, with an
                     expressive adjective, made up with a "d, with a dash to it") who go about
                     preaching up the necessity of progress in the moral condition of the world, and
                     boring people with their abstract notions of human perfectibility, and
                     thereupon he and his friend will have a laugh over what they are pleased to
                     term your folly in meddling with that which does not concern you, instead of
                     rolling up dollars, by attending to that which does. The thing we lack in our
                     closet theories, in this as in most matters of reform, is the want of practical
                     applicability of those theories to<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6610-00000068"/>
                     the actual condition of the world as it is. We forget how impossible it is to
                     make the people pause, to make human nature pause, in its onward rush, to
                     comprehend us, to <emph>feel</emph> the force of our reasoning, and the
                     justness of our admonitions. We forget that something more is necessary to
                     change, or eradicate a popular habit, than the mere demonstration of its folly.
                     Every body, for more than a thousand years, has been convinced of the folly of
                     profanity, aye, of its wickedness, too. Nobody advocates it. Nobody justifies
                     it; and yet about three out of every five of the people of all Christian
                     nations indulge in this most foolish and wicked habit of using the "d, with a
                     dash to it." It may in some sense be called a Christian habit, and goes hand
                     and hand with the spread of Christianity. And yet against this habit
                     Christianity has been warring always. Always denouncing, always execrating it.
                     It finds no word, or letter of sanction, in all the broad range of the
                     Chrtstian's creed, or the wide reach of Christian duties. How shall we account
                     for this, save by supposing that the great Author of Evil goes along by the
                     side of the evangelists, the missionaries, and scatters his tares wherever he
                     finds good seed taking root, dropping an oath wherever he sees the germ of a
                     prayer, thus sending up to Heaven, with the incense of every pious and holy
                     aspiration, an attendant blasphemy, to mar the joy of angels over a soul
                     redeemed?</p>
                  <p>"The world is bad enough, wicked enough, wretched enough, miserable
                     enough."</p>
                  <p>True, every word most true; and yet, as a whole, it is a good, a marvellously
                     good world. Could we, friend MARGINS, I mean you or I, or any human power,
                     invent one that would, in degrees of perfection, come within a sightless
                     distance of this, which the great Creator has made for us? Would we venture to
                     point to one thing in the great universe of God, whether in the heavens above,
                     or on this earth, and say this is out of place, this is a deformity, this is
                     useless? Would we, in looking over the doings of Providence in the
                     administration of his visible government, and selecting some great national or
                     individual calamity, one that spread ruin and sorrow even over a whole people,
                     venture to affirm that <emph>this</emph> should have been ordered otherwise?
                     Seeming evils there are doubtless—events ordered by God that may bear hard upon
                     us. Sorrow may darken around us; the hopes that we cherished may vanish away,
                     and we may sit down in desolation of spirit, to weep over the loss of things
                     that we loved. But when we see, all around us, the clustering evidences of the
                     boundless benevolence, the infinite goodness of the Power that controls human
                     destiny, would we venture, were the choice given us, to turn aside even the
                     sorrow that fell upon ourselves? Would we take the hazards of marring the great
                     plans of the Infinite Mind, or bend them to square with our own feeble and
                        narrow<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6610-00000069"/> perceptions? When we
                     looked upon the pale, still face of a beloved child, its eyes closed in death,
                     with the wreath encircling its marble brow, placed there by the hand of love to
                     decorate it for the grave, would we call the spirit back, or breathe life again
                     into that moveless corpse? The heart might yearn for its darling, but who would
                     not say, it is God's work, let it be as it is?</p>

                  <head>XI. SEPTEMBER.</head>
                  <p>DEAR EDITOR, we despair. For, of course, it is raining again, (just this once,)
                     after all the late floods, and so we are <emph>not</emph> at No.—Broadway,
                     though we tried hard. We went to the station, where, as you know, it is my way
                     to "take the cars," but just then a long line of black cloud rolled up from the
                     west, a white field rolled out beyond it, and certain heavy cannonades in that
                     quarter indicated the same kind of thunderous Saturday afternoon, which has
                     been repeated now for about six times in succession. And so we came back.</p>
                  <p>Rain, rain, rain! But we are safely housed again, though what with riding home
                     in a whirlwind, my people have a color that will last them into next week.</p>
                  <p>So brilliantly as we were made up, it is almost provoking—almost, I say—not to
                     have made a little figure this afternoon in North Broadway. In the confusion
                     incident to whether we should go, I took cards to show our intent, mounted into
                     the one<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6610-00000070"/> freight car just behind the
                     engine, and came on thundering through smoke and cinders, over Roaring River,
                     while my people came back behind <emph>Red Jacket;</emph> but at Bungtown my
                     courage failed, and I dropped (for there was no other exit) from that lumbering
                     concern, and came straight home again. It's useless, said I, to separate man
                     and wife. They should go together in all things.</p>
                  <p>However, I send the cards: <emph>Mr. Margin, Roaring River; Mrs. Margin,
                        Roaring River, Wild Rose, City.</emph> Having parted with
                        <emph>Snowdrop</emph> and <emph>Honeysuckle,</emph> we take gladly such
                     other blossoms as float our way, and are rejoicing now in the <emph>Wild
                        Rose.</emph> All of one excellent garden, sir, but the world having so many
                     waste places, some must be transplanted to grace other localities. We must be
                     generous.</p>
                  <p>Did I tell you about Wednesday? We were to start that day also. I had said—the
                     last thing over night—"Remember, to-morrow we are to visit the great City
                     Editor."</p>
                  <p>"Will it rain?" said Mrs. Margin.</p>
                  <p>"No,—beautiful night—stars all out, and moonlight too: beautiful night,
                     beautiful! night of nights—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">charmante!</foreign> No, my
                     blossoms; no more storms: go to bed now, and sleep on into the excellent day
                     that is coming."</p>
                  <p>Next morning, opening my clouded eyes, behold the rain and the equinox!</p>
                  <p>I say, sir, we despair. However, what could we expect in September?</p>
                  <p>Oh breezy September, shady September, equinoctial September, September and
                     oysters for ever! The bivalves we can have, though we see no Broadway, no city
                     editor. But if a man has any thing particular to say about September, let him
                     speak quick, for we are already in the latter end.</p>
                  <p>Good-bye, sir, Make our regards to Rosebud and all the house, and all the
                     people about the house, and your neighbors, if you think proper. But don't fail
                     to grasp the great fact, that we started and came back again—that it rained and
                     re-rained—that we tried hard, and failed magnificently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>Burr-rr-rr-urr!</emph> (that's a train on Roaring River.) <emph>Squib!
                        wish-sh-sh-ish!</emph> (that's a flourish.) <emph>Baw! aw-aw-awh!</emph>
                     (that's the blast.) Let them go. Foolish people to be going off in the rain;
                     but let them go. <emph>Tell that conductor, if you see him, that he owes me
                        one,</emph> for I paid through and dropped at <emph>Bung.</emph> The foolish
                     man called out to me to go with him, but it wouldn't do. Rains and thunders in
                     the west, and my people somewhere in the north country behind <emph>Red
                        Jacket;</emph> it wouldn't do, and I told him so.</p>
                  <p>Rain, rain, and again the rain! Are you looking for us, sir? Are you on the
                     house-top seeking for the wave of a white handkerchief? spying into the
                     uttermost north, for some dim sign of Mr. and Mrs. Margin? Hallucinated editor,
                     go down immediately. We are not coming. Go down before you are wet through. Go
                     down, sir, and dine, and enjoy yourself. Have you got any plums, I wonder?
                        My<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6610-00000071"/> people are just now making up
                     for their early dinner, with plums, grapes, and muskmelons—the last about the
                     flattest kind of fruit, according to my digestion. But the plums, sir; oh, the
                     plums! Of all the generous, the bountiful things of the garden, I love the
                     plum-tree with my whole heart. It gives, you perceive, in such a whole-souled
                     way, such a bending fulness. We have but few, compared with our great neighbor,
                     who has his plum in every corner. But our wealth is sufficient—four Bleeckers,
                     two <foreign xml:lang="LAT">magnum bonum,</foreign> and one sugar-plum. It has
                     been very pleasant to feed out among those trees, finishing or beginning a
                     breakfast, or a dinner, or a supper; for the ripe plum is harmless always. I
                     think I am a better man for those plum-trees; at any rate, my digestion is
                     better. Our tropical summer and heavy rains have brought on all the fruits this
                     year, in great luxuriance. Everything is fat and heavy with summer. Our second
                     corn is just now perfect—large, but tender—and rich with sugar. You are not
                     obliged to nibble at it, but may mow it down, as a heifer cuts away the first
                     grass of spring. But the plum is our stand-by. And let me tell you, you can't
                     do much better than to stop under the Bleecker. Not so very aristocratic, but
                        <emph>good.</emph> The egg is a golden dainty, an up-town plum, and the
                     little sugars, to look at, are beauties, but the Bleecker you may eat all day.
                     Our opposite neighbor, who delights in fat cattle and pigs like a
                     butter-barrel, and who is rather cosmopolitan in his ways, walks daily amid his
                     great variety of fruits, tasting, as a wine-bibber his wines—that is, he did,
                     but he is gone now. He stepped in at Bung as I stepped out, and has gone away
                     into the West, taking the <emph>White Rose</emph> with him, (another from our
                     garden,) where they are to plant nearly half a county with plums, grapes,
                     pears, apples, citron, squashes, corn, and potatoes, and to have all manner of
                     men, women, and children running about the lots, planting, sowing, chopping,
                     harvesting, carpentering, masoning, pond-making, prospecting, and churning tons
                     of butter—all which is very well, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>If all our summers are to be</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> which, however, has gone even now while we were looking at it—slipped away
                     in a twinkling—walked off in the night, and forgot to come back again. Ah, if
                     we could surround the beautiful summer days and make them stay with us forever.
                     But they must go; they were only here a little while on leave of absence. We
                     will meet them all again in the day of judgment—all the beautiful days, all the
                     golden days, all the dark days and nights of storm—every one will be there. But
                     now it is good-bye and farewell. And we, Mr. Editor, you and I—stout as you
                     are, and full of blood as my veins are of late—<emph>we</emph> shall soon be
                     saying good-bye and farewell, and to us, plum-time will be over forever.</p>
                  <p>But meanwhile—for this particular moment, at<pb n="138-139"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000072"/> least—we live; and whatever winds Antarctic are
                     now ready, let them come. We are to roll on now, amid cool nights and the
                     checkered days of light and shade. Let us take the downhill of the year
                     cheerily. There is no harm in being braced up a little when the leaves fall.
                     Our front maple has already gone into colors. If this were in mid-summer, how
                     untimely would it seem! This is why I like not a certain deadness in Southern
                     vegetation, at this season. Its effort at being perennial falls short of that
                     brilliant success which we look for, while it has nothing of the dying glories
                     of our Northern autumn. The perennial, in fact, is not altogether suited to our
                     world, or to its prosperous administration. Let us have, rather, our blazing
                     and dashing summers, cooling off through the magnificence of autumn, to the
                     snows and ices of winter. So shall we prosper and gather tone and character,
                     and make headway in the great business of life. So shall we not tarry too long
                     in some happy valley, and grow timid and feeble in the mere joy of
                     existence.</p>
                  <p>After all, it don't rain much, and we <emph>might</emph> have gone. But it's
                     too dark for introductions. No, let them go, all the people.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Oh! oh! oh! oh!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Another train going North. Let them go. <emph>They,</emph> now, are going home.
                     Sensible people. Coming out into the country where are plums, grapes,
                     sickle-pears, pumpkins, and so-forth. Coming home for Sunday. That is sensible,
                     rational. You may always expect something of people who come home for
                     Sunday—the day <emph>royale,</emph> "day of all the week the best." Perhaps we
                     will sing that to-morrow night, as we did in the old times, with a dozen voices
                     surging about through the four parts, not to say five or six, for there were
                     always one or two traversing, and going crosswise; but we made a noise, you may
                     be sure.</p>
                  <p>Go ahead, up train, <emph>home for Sunday!</emph> Carry on! up-train,
                        <emph>home for Sunday.</emph> Pipe away, up-train, and sing it out, through
                     the valley—up the river—over the hills and far-a-way—<emph>home for
                        Sunday!</emph> And you, all aboard there, engineer and fireman, brake-man
                     and conductor, young folks and old folks, inside and outside—<emph>God bless
                        you all</emph>—coming home for Sunday!</p>
                  <p>I think now, Mr. Editor, I will go out to the west piazza, and make a short
                     speech to the plum-trees, and by that time, Saturday will be gone. I must thank
                        <emph>somebody</emph> for the plums.</p>

                     over; a spot of gold lies here and there upon the landscape, while in the

                     oysters forever! The bivalves we can<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6610-00000073"/>
                     have, though we see no Broadway, no city editor. But if a man has any thing
                     particular to say about September, let him speak quick."</p>
                  <p>We have much to say about September, and in its favor, too. It is a good month,
                     a great month, a glorious month. It is the month of dahlias, and of ripe
                     fruits, the seed-time of the year. Out upon oysters! They have a taint of
                     grossness about them. There is nothing spiritual about the "bivalves." Leave
                     them for the long evenings and cold days of winter. But September has its
                     inspirations. We become poetic in September. It is the month of yellow leaves,
                     of purple and crimson foliage, the month of the Katydids, and the Cricket. They
                     pipe clearest when September is young. The tza! tza! of the one is loudest
                     among the hazle bushes, and the chirrup of the other shrillest in the wall.
                     September makes them musical, but the frost comes, and with it the last song of
                     the Katydid. Did you ever, dear MARGINS, indite poetry, perpetrate rhyme, of a
                     September evening, after listening to the little night warbler among the
                     clusters of hazle bushes, or the branches of the small trees? Did you ever ask
                     the insect tattler what Katy really did to make such a stir in the world and
                     give occasion for its everlasting song of "Katy did?" No! Well, <emph>we</emph>

                  </q>
                  <p>The cricket, too, do you remember how in early September, he piped among the
                     stones in the fields,<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6610-00000074"/> and how
                     merrily he sang in the wall? We remember one that chirped in the corner when we
                     sat by our father's fireside. His voice was cheerful, and it was a pleasant
                     thing to listen to his happy song. Father, mother, brothers, sisters were
                     beside us then, and we all talked of the little warbler as a thing that we
                     loved. If he came out upon the hearth, nobody disturbed him. If he wandered
                     over the floor, nobody stepped upon or frightened him. He repaid our kindness
                     by his cheerful music, as each evening he regaled us with a lay. But the
                     corner, and the cricket, and the home of our childhood, are all gone. Decay has
                     removed the one, and the voice of the other is hushed in death—and those who
                     sat by the hearthstone listening with us to that cricket's song, where are
                     they? Father, mother, sisters, brothers, where are they?</p>
                  <p>Of the twelve that composed that circle, six have gone to their rest, and the
                     others have floated out in divers directions on the currents of life.</p>
                  <p>Time! Time! O! the wrecks that lie scattered along thy pathway!</p>
                  <p>But will you tell us, friend MARGINS, why it is that all living things that
                     come out in the September evenings, have glad voices given them? Why is it that
                     when the sun is gone down, and the hum of business is still, when the voice of
                     man is hushed and the winds have retired to their caves, the voice of the
                     insect tribes, low and quiet and solemn, comes abroad upon the air? Why does
                     not silence come down like the curtains of night, and brood in the darkness
                     over us? It is that we may not forget the lessons that nature teaches. The
                     heavens may be darkened by clouds; the face of the moon may be veiled, and the
                     stars may not shine out to remind us; the sound of the winds may be hushed; but
                     the song of the cricket tells us, that life and beauty, and joy, and happiness
                     are rife among the creatures of God. Such will your answer be, and we concede
                     its truth.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! if we could surround the beautiful summer days, and make them stay with us
                     forever!"</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>We</emph> would not do it if we could, indeed we would not. We love the
                     summer, we love its long beautiful days, its broad fields of grain, its rich
                     foliage; we love its haying time, its hoeing time and its ripe harvests. But
                     its hot, burning days, its noxious vapors, its deadly malaria, its fevers, its
                     cholera and cholera morbus, we do not like. We love the autumn, with its
                     ripened fruits, its corn huskings, its potato digging, its fat deer, and the
                     music of the hounds on the mountains. We love the flaunting robes, all flaming
                     in crimson and yellow, and green and deep brown that it throws over the
                     hill-sides, dressing them in beauty like an eastern Houri for the bridal. We
                     love the winter, with its social evenings, its pure white robe of snow. We love
                     the jingle of its merry sleigh-bells. We love to hear the hissing of the north
                     wind, as it whirls around<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6610-00000075"/> the
                     corners, and over the house-tops and along the streets, looking into the
                     crevices of the windows, and peering under the doors, as we sit with our
                     friends around us, and the coals burning cheerfully in the grate. We can laugh
                     at the north winds, and cry, ha! ha! at the driving snow.</p>
                  <p>We love the spring, with its opening buds, its growing foliage, and its early
                     flowers. We love the beautiful green fields, and the sweet breath of its south
                     wind, that comes to fan us, loaded with the fragrance of the meadows. We love
                     the glad song of the early birds, and to see them building their nests in the
                     branches of the trees. We love to hear the shrill call of the quail from his
                     perch upon the fence-stake, and the song of the catbird, or the brown thrush,
                     as he sits upon the topmost branch of the shade-tree in the pasture, swaying in
                     the breeze as he sings. We love to see the young things, the lambs, the pigs,
                     the calves, the colts, and the little children, all in their places, joyful and
                     happy, frisking and playing and running hither and yon, in their gleesomeness,
                     full of the spirit of life, and fun and frolicking, as if there was to be no
                     storm, no equinox, no bleak fall days or pinching cold of winter. We love the
                     spring. We love summer, and autumn, and winter. We love all the seasons and all
                     the months. We love the days of the months. They are not all bright, and
                     glorious, and sunny, and we love them the more because they are not so. <q>
                        <l>"Some days <emph>must</emph> be dark and dreary."</l>
                     </q> The seasons are the types of human life, and the days are types also. Mark
                     this, friend MARGINS; in human destiny there are bright days, and dark days;
                     days of sunshine, and days of storm. There is spring, and summer, and autumn,
                     and winter. But mark again. <emph>We</emph> have but one set of seasons. Spring
                     will never return to us, and when the winter of life comes, its chill will
                     leave us only at death, and its ice be thawed away only in the grave. But what
                     of that? There is another country, where there are no dark days, no equinoxes,
                     no storms, no winter winds, where spring is perpetual. Are we bound to it? <q>
                        <l>"Let us take the down-hill of the year cheerily."</l>
                     </q> Change the word "year" to "life," and you will have brought out the great
                     leading principle of the true philosophy of living. "Take the down-hill of
                        <emph>life</emph> cheerily," is your only true wisdom. You and I, friend
                     MARGINS, have at least ceased to be young. And however we may deny being old,
                     yet so much we will yield for the argument's sake. And, moreover, we cannot
                     stand still. We are moving. White hairs are gathering upon our heads, and
                     wrinkles are invading the corners of our eyes. These are mile-stones on our
                     journey of life. It will do no good to count them—to try to eradicate them is
                     folly. We must march on. We are on the top of the hill at best, and our way
                     henceforth is downward. Well, be it so, and what then? "Take the<pb n="146-147"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000076"/> down-hill of life cheerily." No murmuring at the
                     descent. Millions upon millions have gone before us. There are flowers along
                     the pathway, down-hill as it is. Hope blooms by the way—inhale its fragrance
                     and gather its blossoms. Cheerily! cheerily! cries our guide. Let us follow in
                     his footsteps, submit to his guidance, and all will be well. The way may be
                     rough—he will lead us where we will not stumble nor plunge headlong down the
                     precipices that tower above fathomless depths. The way may be dark. Cheerily!
                     cheerily! sounds from the darkness, and light bursts upon our path. Yes, yes,
                     cheerily is the word.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps we will sing that to-morrow night as we did in the old times, with a
                     dozen voices surging about, through the four parts, not to say five or six, for
                     there were always one or two traversing or going crosswise, but we made a noise
                     you may be sure."</p>
                  <p>There is something about this that awakens memory. The clouds of the past are
                     lifting, and old scenes are rising in the perspective. We are young again. A
                     quarter of a century has been obliterated from the number of our years, and we
                     are on our way to the old brown, weather-beaten school-house, near the clear
                     cold stream that flows along through Pleasant Valley, away out in old Steuben.
                     Blessings on that beautiful valley, and that clear, cold stream. We have caught
                     strings of the speckled trout from its deep eddies, and upon its ripples, and
                     under the old logs that lay across it. But we are on our way to that
                     weather-beaten school-house. It is a clear, frosty night. The stars are
                     glistening like bright gems in the sky, and the moonbeams sparkle like
                     diamonds, in their cold brilliancy on the snow. The oak-trees, that retain
                     their dead and withered foliage, cast their shadows like clouds, on the
                     unbroken crust on the meadows that skirt the road. There is stillness all
                     around us. The night voices are all frozen into silence, but there is nothing
                     sad or solemn in the cold, calm hush of a winter's night. We are on our way to
                     the "singing school." We remember the tall, lathy "singing master," with his
                     earnest and solemn face, his long hair parted on his forehead, and combed
                     straight and sleek over his coat collar and resting on his shoulders. He is
                     before us now, with his long, bony hand and long fingers, and his mahogany
                     pitch-pipe. His nasal fa! sol! la! as he gives the "pitch" to his class, is
                     sounding in our ear. He was a devotional man, and his faith in the saving
                     efficacy of psalmody was perfect. Among all the tunes taught in his school, Old
                     Hundred was his especial favorite. True, he indulged in Mear, Amsterdam, Lenox,
                     China, Greenfield, Coronation, and others of the same centenarian character,
                     but Old Hundred was his weakness, his idol, his great tune of tunes. It was his
                     first, his last, his midst and without end. It was the first given out in the
                     evening; it was sung in the centre minutes of the school, and was sure to be
                     the last at<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6610-00000077"/> its close. And that
                     class, merry, happy, laughter-loving young people, were they all, full of
                     mischief, frolic and fun, The more the simple-minded teacher loved and
                     venerated his old favorite tune, the more they murdered it by their discords.
                     Bass, tenor, treble, and counter, were sure to be playing at cross purposes.
                     Labor as he would, the bass would be too low and the tenor too high; the treble
                     would push along like a locomotive, while the counter would drag its slow
                     length away behind, all filling the musical ear with the most horrible compound
                     of discordant sounds.</p>
                  <p>The good teacher has gone to his long rest. The old weather-beaten school-house
                     has passed away. The free trout stream that went laughing and scolding over the
                     clean pebbles, on its crooked path towards the lake, has been harnessed to a
                     great water-wheel and made to grind corn. That class, too, is all
                     scattered—some are on the ocean—some in the far Western States—some beyond the
                     Rocky Mountains, and some dwell in the city of the dead. We remember their
                     happy faces, as they were that last winter that we spent at the old homestead.
                     They are before us now, and we see them as they were gathered in the singing
                     school, worrying the good "singing master," with their mischievous discords.
                     Shadows all, creatures of fancy, hallucinations, memories only.</p>
                  <p>We visited the old homestead the last summer. It passed into the hands of
                     strangers years ago. We inquired for the bright-eyed, romping girl, the beauty
                     of the class, and we found her sitting in matronly composure in the shadow of a
                     cherry-tree in front of her dwelling, fat and of rotund proportions, smoking a
                     pipe that was none of the cleanest. She had cattle, and sheep, and grain, and
                     pigs, and may be, money out on interest; but the vision of the singing school
                     had vanished away. Time! Time! The wrecks that are scattered along thy
                     pathway!</p>

                  <head>XII. OCTOBER.</head>
                  <p>HEAVEN seems to come very near to us this morning. It is picture-day
                     everywhere. Overhead, the blue, and the blue only; and below, in the soft air,
                     scarcely a single wave of motion. A mile distant on the islands, a line of
                     white, some hundreds of feet high, runs through the valley, and along the edge
                     of this snowy embankment stand tall pines in bright green. Within those white
                     curtains may be seen other forms, faintly outlined and ghost-like; and
                     underneath the front rank, and nearer by, on plateaus of rock, smaller forest
                     trees, rich in crimson and royal colors.</p>
                  <p>The golden tint is in the air. This is why the shadows on the grass have not
                     the sharp outline which of late they had in September, but rather the softness
                     as of shadows by moonlight. Sound itself seems muffled, and comes gently to the
                     ear. Without thought as to the why of it, people speak low and in kind tones.
                     Every one strolls about leisurely, saying, in a quiet way, "Beautiful—great!"
                     No one hurries to enjoy the day. There is no feeling that it is soon to pass
                     away; we <emph>know</emph> that, but incline to think, notwithstanding, that
                     now we are to have, always, days just like this, soft, rich, dreamy, and
                     brimming with a quiet joy. We laugh at anybody who didn't know beforehand that
                     we were going to have just such fine, glorious weather. Of course! isn't it
                     October, my hearty? and hasn't it rained enough, in all conscience? However,
                     let us pause over it, and take it down slowly, as the boys do the pippins in
                     the orchard.</p>
                  <p>A gala-day, a picture-day, artistic, beautiful. Only a little while ago we had
                     the sharp sour winds and the rains—day after day, the wind and the rain. Those
                     were the sneezing times, the coughing times, the tooth-ache and the face-ache
                     times. It was hard to look upon the world then, as other than a very wet and
                     cold affair. Now we counterpoise in the calm, the repose, the pomp of
                     October.</p>
                  <p>To-day, all things put on glory. Pureness, and beauty, and glory. These grow up
                     together always; the one from the other. Pureness and then beauty, and then the
                     crown of glory which God places with his own hand on every perfected life. It
                     is the water made wine, by the miracle of death. For death is not the Divine
                     order of things, but life. Not pain and trouble, not sinning and shame, not
                     repentance and prayer, not struggle and labor,—but peace and joy, acclamation
                     and hallelujahs,—the water made wine. Some excellent, well-meaning<pb
                        n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6610-00000079"/> ing people think it the reverse of
                     this—to wit: the wine made water. But, oh, no! God does not offer his children
                     any such cup of dilution, but the fulness, (think of this, oh lame, and halt,
                     and blind, and deaf, ailing and struggling and starving world, ponder well the
                     promise,) <emph>the fulness of life.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>One cannot well say, to-day,—"Be not angry with us forever." We revolt at this,
                     as unkind, unthankful. Surely not to-day, not to-day is He angry with us. Where
                     is it written? Let me see the handwriting, the autograph of the Most High.
                     Where is it written that He is angry with us? Not in the blue up there! Not in
                     the little white clouds which just now are forming from the morning mist,—not
                     in the rich fruits of the earth,—not in this air tempered to the most exquisite
                     finish of strength and enjoyment,—not in this soft white light,—not in the
                     hearts of His people, for wherever this morning you find any weakest servant of
                     His, you will find thanksgiving and praise, and a full measure at that, pressed
                     down and running over, a well of waters springing up into everlasting life. Ah,
                     if we could hear the utterance of their hearts, would it not be, "Thou, Thou
                     art the King of Glory, O Christ! Thou, who art the everlasting Son of the
                     Father. Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty of thy Glory."</p>
                  <p>But these are all God's pure creations, and restorations, without sin, without
                     responsibility. Looking beyond them,—into our own hearts, when not in accord
                     with the true and the right,—into the actions of men,—into whatever will live
                     and bear record always, we then perceive the need of that petition, and the
                     deeper we study the responsibilities of life, the greater the need and the more
                     terrible the significance of those words,—"Be not angry with us forever."</p>
                  <p>Of late—within a very few years—life has become cheap. Our life, I mean, and
                     not that of cattle and brute things. I do not know it to be true, but it seems
                     to me that cases of sudden death (apart from external violence) are much more
                     frequent than we have ever known before. Of course, there must be a cause for
                     this. We live more upon stimulants than upon healthy nutriment. The stimulants
                     of swift travel, of luxuries of eating and drinking, of music and parade and
                     dress, of appetites, mental and moral, sharpened to indigestible consequences.
                     These we live upon, mostly, and the first child born of this life is unchecked
                     self-indulgence—pleasure—the having a satisfactory to-day, anyhow, and without
                     regard to to-morrow. All this becomes, in the aggregate, a passion so
                     overwhelming as to entirely overlook the very instrument by which whatever
                     pleasure is received, namely: the life itself. Whether we shall so become
                     accustomed to living faster than our fathers as finally to reach a certain
                     poise and equilibrium, a clearness for giddiness, and strength for mere animal
                     spirits; whether we shall arrive at stability and speed combined, I am not
                        shrewd<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6610-00000080"/> enough to guess; but no
                     one will deny that, just now, we are continually blowing up, or running off the
                     track, or knifeing, or clubbing, or shooting somebody, because something
                     unpleasant has happened. If we can show some sort of reason for taking a
                     neighbor's life, it is counted sufficient; especially if we can make out that
                     others in like circumstances would have been tempted to do the same. If it is
                     natural, it must be right. In such cases, juries acquit, judges pardon, and
                     editors applaud. At this rate, where, in the way of whirlwinds, are we to bring
                     up?</p>
                  <p>A few days since a young girl in a distant city shot her betrayer, and the
                        <title>Register,</title> commenting upon the facts, as they are reported,
                     says, "<emph>She served him right.</emph>" It is probable that most of your
                     readers appreciated the spirit in which you said it, but, you will excuse me
                     for going out of my beat, to show you how it looks to us here in the country.
                     Let us talk it over, in a quiet way.</p>
                  <p>And first, let me ask <emph>who</emph> has come down from Heaven to say that a
                     ball through the brain is good and right for the seducer? Not any angel,—not
                     Jesus of Nazareth—not the Holy Ghost. Nor is there any message left on record
                     anywhere to that effect. The sentiment therefore must be of human origin.
                     Accordingly, in the same article in the <title>Register,</title> we find a law
                     proclaimed, higher than any of God's laws, and this higher law is supposed to
                     rule in this case. This, of course, you do not put forth as anything new, for
                     there can be nothing new in morals. At any rate, it is not new. It is so common
                     that it may be called, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par excellence,</foreign> "the
                     common law" of the world. It is the convenient law of human passion. It is the
                     law of sin. It is exceedingly popular, and carries a high hand in the affairs
                     of the world. But it is something new to hear of it as being good and right.
                     If, in this case in hand, there is anything that makes it seem right, it is
                     probably some element of partial justice, to which we can say "amen" and pass
                     on, without further investigation.</p>
                  <p>One of God's laws commands that we "forgive others, as we ourselves hope to be
                     forgiven." Now there may be existences, there may be groups of worlds peopled
                     with beings of whom such a requirement never has been made, because
                     unnecessary, inasmuch as they themselves need no forgiveness. Such a people
                     fulfilling all law, we can imagine, may have certain judicial authority, over
                     any intruders that may come among them of a lower order, or over any of their
                     own number, who may be transgressors. At first thought this would seem likely,
                     but looking deeper into the matter, we perceive that they would not be fit
                     judges of matters beyond their own experience. It would be necessary to find
                     some one who had been tempted with all manner of evil, and yet remained
                     upright, and so maintained perfect clearness of perception and judgment as to
                     what is right and what wrong. If such<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6610-00000081"
                     /> an one could be found, it would be perfectly safe to vest in him all
                     judicial authority.</p>
                  <p>Our case is different. We are all violators of law—State's prison birds, every
                     man of us—and for us to set up judgment is to set up farce. Farce in fact, but
                     tragedy of the bloodiest kind in its results. All we can properly do, is to
                     change the venue to another world, and meanwhile keep the peace as well as we
                     can, and wait until we can all come into court together. And while we wait,
                     this precept of forgiveness is all we have to live upon. It is literally our
                     meat and drink. It is not only (through mediation) divinely right, but it is
                     the highest policy, the wisest expediency that can possibly be devised. Without
                     it, the world would go to pieces before sunset. It is absolutely all that keeps
                     us alive. For we are all, as we say, in the same boat. People on board ship, in
                     a storm, and with the prospect of wreck before them, are, for the most part,
                     exceedingly kind and forgiving. (I speak of men, not devils.) All differences
                     are overlooked—pistols laid aside, as not at all pertinent to the matter—and
                     every man bears a hand to avert the calamity.</p>
                  <p>But scattered about as we are in the world, and in diverse ways of occupation,
                     we forget the common danger,—the lee shore and the rocks—and become hard and
                     judicial. We set up higher laws, and walk about with an assured emphasis.</p>
                  <p>As I am not addressing you especially, Mr. Editor, but only throwing out a word
                     against the popular drift, will you permit me to talk on a little further? It
                     is refreshing, sometimes, to get into commonplace.</p>
                  <p>You may ask,—(I am putting up an imaginary editor)—"Do you not see the great
                     moral force of punishment? Of justice satisfied? Of the fearful retribution
                     which must follow transgression?"</p>
                  <p>Yes—I see that—and more. I see—murder. I see that as long as reputable papers
                     and warm-hearted men cry "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">bravo,</foreign>" the use of
                     the knife and pistol will become exceedingly facile and convenient. I see a
                     time ahead, when if this continues, no man will dare to step into the street,
                     until he has well pondered whether in his breakfast, or in his prayers, or in
                     the cut of his coat, he has suited his opposite neighbor, who stands ready with
                     a loaded pistol to blow his brains out, unless he is strictly orthodox in all
                     these matters. Kind Heaven forbid that I should compare these cases—I am
                     speaking of tendencies and results.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, you admit that the law (human law) may regard this act of the
                     betrayed girl, as crime. This, abstractly, is of no moment. Men differ in
                     opinion as to crime, but crime is not one thing today and another to-morrow;
                     one thing to me, and another to you. Facts are not disturbed or even modified
                     by opinion or by human law. We take side views, cross views, wrong views, and
                        <emph>always partial</emph> views, but in all this, we cast no shadow upon
                     the white glory of truth. The shadows all<pb n="158-159"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000082"/> fall the other way. Human action and thought are
                     of course to be judged by facts, not opinions; truth, not guesses or
                     approximations. In this only rests the safety and stability of all of God's
                     creations.</p>
                  <p>There is trouble enough in the world, however bright it may look to you and me.
                     Men are daily going mad by looking too long into these depths. It is scarcely
                     possible to look down upon punishment, without being smitten and blasted by its
                     near approach. We come back, singed and blackened with its smoke and fire. We
                     take within us something of the spirit of the place. It is better, as it is how
                     much pleasanter, to stay in Heaven's sunlight, where there is a way to meet
                     every trouble and calamity that can happen to man (short of madness), and that
                     is, not with submission only, but thankfulness that God is caring for us in
                     that special manner. We know then that He is close by. He is taking things in
                     hand for us; managing and ordering our affairs, which, whether we knew it or
                     not, were undoubtedly in a ruinous way. To resent this and fly in the face of
                     Heaven with pistols, &amp;c.,—oh, this serves no one right, nor is it right in
                     itself.</p>
                  <p>If it <emph>is,</emph> let us begin the work of death, right and left. It has
                     been quoted as proof of God's omnipotence, as shown in his power over his own
                     holy attributes, that He does not at once punish all transgression, or (as this
                     would be, in effect) drop the world from His hand, as a worthless creation.
                     Carry ry out the purpose of serving everybody right today, and the sun and moon
                     would look down to-night upon a dead world. In the fulness of time, this will
                     come, but let us not hasten the day.</p>
                  <p>But you will perhaps press the question close home upon me—"Did you not, as to
                     that leaden ball which took the life of the seducer, say in your inmost heart,
                     and with all your heart, that it served him right?"</p>
                  <p>Well, Mr. Editor, suppose I say <emph>yes,</emph> and suppose all the world
                     says "yes,"—every man, woman and child on the face of the earth—what has that
                     to do with it? Suppose the vote were taken to-day, and the mingling
                        <emph>ayes</emph> of all the living hosts were to rise together, might there
                     not possibly be one feeble voice heard thrilling through the uproar, one
                     heart-broken child of sorrow, struggling through tears and agony to drown this
                     mistaken kindness? And might not this solitary "<emph>No</emph>" from a heart
                     humbled and broken before God, be more likely to go up into Heaven than all the
                     noisy affirmations that would go clamoring about the world? And if some one in
                     Heaven were taking an account of the transaction, might it not read something
                     like this—"Vote taken this morning on the earth, as to a question of right and
                     justice. Messengers report that all the world voted aye, but nothing was heard
                     here save one feeble 'No,' from a penitent child. The question is lost."</p>
                  <p>"But," say you," let us take the world as we find<pb n="160-161"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000083"/> it. We are not Gods. You have talked over a long
                     string of moralities, which nobody denies, and for which no one is the wiser.
                     Let us have something practical. What is your reply?"</p>
                  <p>It is this, that I have not the remotest idea of what is right, in such a case.
                     I see no good result in such a terrible conclusion. Another crime is added,
                     which in nowise mends the matter. Another cause for sorrow, and the long, long
                     nights of trembling and fear; of misgiving and doubt, of horrors piled up
                     breaker-like in tossing confusion. I see the vista of life darkened and
                     storm-troubled, in which shadows and lightnings play in fellowship. I hear
                     voices in that gloom, as of people going about, saying "<emph>Served him right,
                        served him right!</emph>" I see no light there, no landscape of peace, no
                     glory of October. It is winter thereaway and night! Oh, thou Christ, who art
                     the joy of the world, stay with us always, and be our noon-day of light
                     forever!</p>
                  <p>No, I can't take upon myself to know what is right as a just punishment for
                     another or for myself; nor am I required to puzzle my brain about it. But if
                     there is any highway of escape, any ransom, tell me about that. I came into the
                     world only a few years ago, and can't make out to see very far, as yet, or very
                     clearly. The confusion is great; the light and shade intermingle, and cheat the
                     eye continually with false distances, and false bearings, and false magnitudes.
                     Only one thing seems tolerably bly plain—that light and darkness are
                     diverse—that you can't make one out of the other—that you may as well expect a
                     lamb from a wild-cat, as good from evil. They won't breed together. They won't
                     live together. They go contrary ways, though they meet often, and always to
                     clash, and part, and come together again, fighting to the last gasp. One or the
                     other must go to the wall, some day. This, I believe, is getting to be the
                     general opinion. We can't live so forever. Patience will be worn out,
                     forbearance exhausted, and there will be a general uprising of all souls that
                     have ever lived from Adam down, and a universal prayer and shout will go up to
                     Heaven from men, angels, and devils, that the combatants be parted, and sent,
                     each to some prepared place, with such a gulf and high walls between, as will
                     keep them forever asunder.</p>
                  <p>With a view to this, God has long ago set apart a special day—the last of this
                     administration—when, without doubt, and without contingency, everybody will be
                     "served right.'</p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"However, let us pause over it and take it down slowly, as the boys do the
                     pippins in the orchard."</p>
                  <p>There are memories that come clustering about these "boys," these "pippins,"
                     and the "orchard." Do you remember the old Cider Mill, friend MARGINS<pb
                        n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6610-00000084"/> GINS, and the old horse as he
                     travelled round and round, moving with a slow and dignified tread, "hitched" to
                     the long lever that turned the wooden mill that crushed the apples into
                     pummice? Do you remember the great "cheese" in its bandage of straw beneath the
                     press, and how, when the great screws were turned in the massive gallows-shaped
                     frame, the rich juice of the apple came gushing out and running into the great
                     tub placed to receive it? Do you remember how, with a straw, the urchins, as
                     they came along on their way home from school, filled themselves with sweet
                     cider from the bung of the barrel? Do you remember how in the long winter
                     nights you sat around the fire-place wherein logs were blazing, and how the
                     pitcher of cider and the platter of doughnuts were placed upon the old cherry
                     table that sat out in the middle of the kitchen, and how you helped yourself to
                     the cider and the doughnuts, and how happy each one was as he sat with his
                     pewter mug of cider in one hand and a doughnut in the other before that
                     old-fashioned kitchen fire-place? Those were pleasant times. But they are
                     memories now. And then the apple parings, or "bees," as they were called, when
                     the young men and maidens came together to pare apples, and talk and laugh and
                     play old-fashioned plays, and say soft things to one another and eat pumpkin
                     pies, and be happy after the fashion of the country people when you and I were
                     young. Primitive times those were, friend MARGINS, and our proud daughters and
                     city dames would turn up their noses hugely were they to be present at an
                     old-fashioned apple-bee, such as they used to have out in old Steuben when the
                     country was new, and the fashions were primitive.</p>
                  <p>We remember, when we were young, there was a favorite tree in our father's
                     orchard which bore choice winter apples. It was called the big tree, because it
                     was the largest in the orchard. The fruit of this tree was always left until
                     the last, and was gathered with great care. There was a worthless fellow living
                     in the neighborhood who one year coveted a portion of the fruit on the "big
                     tree," and was not deterred from its acquisition by the divine commandment,
                     "thou shalt not steal." A quantity of the apples disappeared one night, and the
                     tracks of whoever stole them had a strange resemblance to those made by the
                     heelless boots of our dishonest neighbor. There were two inseparable friends on
                     the old homestead in those early days; the one a "colored gentleman," by the
                     name of Shadrach, who came to our father's possession in payment for a debt,
                     and who ran away regularly two or three times a year, and then as regularly ran
                     back again, just as his master began to indulge the hope that he had got rid of
                     him for good. The other was a great dog, half mastiff and half bull, of a noble
                     presence and a fearless courage. "Drive" and "Shadrach" were inseparable. They
                     worked and played together, slept together in the same loft,<pb n="164-165"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000085"/> and Shadrach never ate a meal while the dog
                     lived, at least at home, without sharing it with his canine friend. He would
                     talk with Drive for hours when they were alone, and although the dog didn't say
                     much himself, yet Shadrach said a good many things, and laid down and argued
                     out a great many queer propositions, against which Drive uttered not a word of
                     dissent.</p>
                  <p>One chilly night in October, Shadrach and Drive had been out along the
                     cornfields on an unsuccessful coon hunt. On their return the dog dashed off
                     through the orchard, and in a minute or two commenced barking, and Shadrach of
                     course supposed he had treed a coon on one of the fruit-trees. Now, Shadrach
                     had an abiding faith in spiritual manifestations, and stood in mortal fear of
                     "the gentleman in black," and all manner of spooks in general. Upon arriving at
                     the "big tree" by the foot of which Drive sat, and looking up among the
                     branches, he saw there in the darkness a great black object, with something
                     which seemed like a winding sheet in its hand. Shadrach's hair began to uncurl
                     as he looked, and hallooing "seek him" to Drive, broke like a quarter nag for
                     the house. He bolted breathlessly into the kitchen, exclaiming, "Massa, Massa!
                     Drive got de debble in de big apple-tree!" "What is that, you woolly-pated
                     rhinoceros?" replied his master. "Drive got de debble treed on de big
                     apple-tree!" repeated the negro. A torch was lighted, and upon going into the
                     orchard, there sat our thievish neighbor among the branches, with a bag half
                     filled with the coveted fruit. Our father said not a word to him, but after
                     giving Shadrach certain directions, returned quietly to the house. Old Shadrach
                     laid his jacket down by the root of the apple-tree, and ordering Drive to watch
                     it, said to the occupant of the tree, "Look hea, you brack tief, you come down,
                     and Drive eat you head off sartain. Ugly dog dat. Eat a white tief up like a
                     coon, sure. Roost up dare like turkey, yah! yah!" Shadrach went to his loft,
                     and laid himself quietly away. When the day broke, there was the thief in the
                     tree, and there was Drive watching him. When the sun rose they were there. The
                     negro gave Drive his breakfast, and left him his jacket and the man in the tree
                     to watch. Our father and the "boys," of whom we were one, went to husking corn
                     in the orchard. Ten o'clock came, and there was the dog at the roots, and the
                     man perched among the branches of the "big apple-tree." The horn sounded for
                     dinner, and when we returned the two were there still. The thief called
                     beseeching to our father to allow him to come down. "Well," was the reply, "why
                     don't you come down?" "This infernal dog will eat me up if I do," said the
                     thief. "Very likely," was the calm rejoinder, and we went on husking the corn.
                     Once or twice the occupant of the apple-tree, after coaxing and flattering the
                     dog, attempted to descend, but Drive's ivory warned him of his peril, and<pb
                        n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6610-00000086"/> he went back to his perch. There
                     never was another human being in such ecstasies all the day as was that negro.
                     "Yah! yah!" he would break out in an uncontrollable cachinnation, and then roll
                     and halloo, and yah! yah! among the corn-stalks, until you could hear him a
                     mile. The sun went down behind the hills, and there still was the thief and the
                     dog. We all went in to supper, and in the twilight of the evening, in pity to
                     the famished and frightened culprit, the dog was withdrawn, and he was
                     permitted to slink away home. He never stole apples again, or anything else
                     from our father, while Drive and old Shadrach remained on the farm.</p>
                  <p>"A few days since, a young girl in a distant city shot her betrayer, and the
                        <title>Register,</title> commenting upon the facts, as they are reported,
                     says, 'She served him right.'"</p>
                  <p>We read one day in a Western paper that a man had secured, by the seducer's
                     arts, the affections of a confiding and inexperienced girl; that he had tempted
                     her to leave her home and those whom she loved, and who loved her; that,
                     confiding in his promises, and leaning upon his faith, she had gone with him to
                     a distant city, where he was to make her his wife. That, delaying under various
                     pretexts the performance of his vows, he succeeded in robbing her of her
                     virtue, and then left her desolate and penniless, unprotected and alone, in a
                     strange city. That when she sought him out, and claimed the performance of his
                     plighted word, he threw her from him in scorn, like a worthless weed, away.
                     That in her despair, and smarting under her matchless wrongs, she smote him to
                     death at her feet. Upon reading this account of the gigantic wickedness, the
                     iron cruelty of her betrayer, we said, and we say again, "She served him
                     right;" and herein it will be seen that we struck a chord that roused up the
                     latent energies of our friend MARGINS, and brought forth his inward might.</p>
                  <p>We spoke of human nature as God made it. We spoke of man as he is, exercising
                     the attributes of humanity; of human instincts and sympathies, and passions, as
                     they are. We took the heart of man as it came from the hands of Deity,
                     fashioned as He fashioned it, quick with all its natural yearnings and finite
                     pulsations. We spoke of right and wrong, as human judgment views them; of
                     retribution weighed in human scales, and, measuring the infliction of the
                     punishment in this isolated case by the vastness of the wrong committed, we
                     said that the act which swept the seducer from among the living, "served him
                     right."</p>
                  <p>The murderer who is taken with the blood of innocence fresh upon his hand, is
                     doomed by the law to death, and through the agency of the gallows or the axe he
                     is launched into eternity. Does anybody say that the law does not "serve him
                     right?" Who preaches forgiveness to the law? Who talks to the law about
                     exercising the attributes of Deity? Or requires it to leave the punishment of
                     the murderer<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6610-00000087"/> derer to God? Who asks
                     the law to uncoil itself from around its victim, and let him go forth to slay
                     anew? Nobody. Well, why does the law hang the murderer, the traitor to his
                     country, the incendiary who fires your dwelling in which your little ones are
                     sleeping? What is the principle of the thing, the philosophy of this matter?
                     "Serves him right" is the maxim underlaying all penal codes—"Serves him right"
                     is the authority, the great fundamental truth whereon is based all human, aye,
                     and divine systems, too, of rewards and punishments. It is useless to argue the
                     propriety or policy of the death penalty now. Wiser men than we are, friend
                     MARGINS, have been arguing that question for a good many hundred years, and
                     have not settled it yet. "Serves him right," says the judge, as he did when the
                     argument commenced. "Serves him right," says the executioner, as he brandishes
                     his axe. "Serves him right," says the law, as the head of the culprit falls.
                     Mark, the act which the law thus performs is one of retribution, based upon the
                     crime of the culprit. It is justice, weighing out punishment for wrong,
                     adjusting the degree of the one to the enormity of the other. Nobody blames the
                     law for inflicting death, or the officers who are the ministers of the law. In
                     the case of the murderer, the law affixes the penalty, and appoints the method
                     of its enforcement. It is legal justice, but based upon a higher principle of
                     natural justice. True, one object of the penal code which affixes the death
                     penalty, is to protect society from the repetition of outrage, and some have
                     claimed that another object of punishment was the reformation of the culprit,
                     but we never knew the morals of a man to be improved by hanging, or having his
                     head cut off.</p>
                  <p>Well, we assume that the law when it takes the life of the murderer, "Serves
                     him right," deals out to him a just measure of punishment. Do you agree with us
                     in this, friend MARGINS? Yes! Then we have advanced one step in the
                     argument.</p>
                  <p>Now remember that the law, and the judge, and the executioner are but
                     instruments wielded by justice to do an act of retribution. It is not always
                     right to kill a man because the law sanctions the act. The word of an absolute
                     monarch is the law of his dominions, yet when he says an honest man shall die,
                     and strikes off his head, it is not right. It cannot be said of the sentence
                     and the sufferer, "It served him right." The law doomed the martyrs to the
                     flames, but it did not "serve them right." Why? Because there was no great
                     moral wrong, commensurate with the magnitude of the punishment, committed, to
                     give vitality to the right and power of the law to take life. The great
                     ingredient of crime was wanting. We give these illustrations for the purpose of
                     showing that it is not the might of the law that makes it right. The murderer
                     is deserving of death independently of human laws. Is the culprit who slays at
                     midnight and hides his<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6610-00000088"/> victim, the
                     less deserving of punishment because his crime cannot be proven in a court of
                     justice? Is he any the less guilty because he has concealed his crime from the
                     clear knowledge of the world, and is he therefore the less deserving of
                     punishment?</p>
                  <p>In the dark annals of iniquity there can be no crime of a deeper dye than that
                     of him who coils himself in the confidence, nestles in the warm affections of a
                     trusting girl, and under the solemn promise of marriage, robs her of more than
                     life, and then leaves her to the cold scorn of the world, to wander, hopeless
                     and companionless, through long desolate years, to find a grave of infamy and
                     sorrow at last. Think of the mother's heart crushed, and the father's anguish.
                     Such a man commits more than murder. He kills the body by a lingering agony,
                     and destroys the soul. Had he slain his victim at once, you and I, friend
                     MARGINS, would have said, while we looked upon her moveless corpse, and his
                     hand red with her blood, "this man shall die." We would have handed him over to
                     the law, to the judge and the executioner, as the ministers of a just
                     retribution, and bid them spare not. When the sentence that doomed him to death
                     had been executed, we should have said, "served him right." Aye, in looking
                     upon his great crime, and the gallows upon which he was hanging, with the last
                     pulsation of life choked out of him, looking upon only these two great facts,
                     and without a thought of the process which suspended him there, we would
                     say—"This is a just measure of retribution." "It serves him right." But here
                     was a crime greater than a simple murder—a crime which inflicts a lingering
                     death, and destroys a soul, and when we remember the gigantic wickedness of the
                     destroyer, and see him struck down even by a felon blow, will we not still say,
                     "served him right?" Remember, we are speaking now only of <emph>his</emph>
                     deserts—of a just measure of retribution so far as <emph>he</emph> is
                     concerned, neither more nor less. If he points to the wound that is killing
                     him, and claims our sympathy as a wronged man, as suffering a penalty beyond
                     the measure of his deserts, we might be moved to pity for his fate, but when we
                     looked upon the desolate and crushed victim of his heartless villany, every
                     instinct of our nature would still say—"served him right." Were he standing on
                     the verge of the precipice that towers above the boiling eddies of Niagara,
                     with the cry of his victim mingling with the roar of the waters, as she
                     struggled to pull him down, when we saw him reeling to his fall, we might, in
                     mercy, reach forth a hand to save him, but if before we could do so he should
                     disappear over the beetling cliffs, while we might be shocked at his terrible
                     doom, we should still say—"served him right." And what matters it whether this
                     retribution is measured out by the law, or by the hand of the individual
                     wronged, we mean so far as the <emph>wrong-doer</emph> is concerned?</p>
                  <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6610-00000089"/>
                  <p>Now we beseech you, friend MARGINS, to understand us. We could say to his
                     victim and his slayer, "You are all wrong; you have broken the law; you have
                     violated the social compact; you have transgressed against the commandment of
                     God." In short, friend MARGINS, we could repeat to her your excellent sermon
                     and endorse it all, and yet say as between her and her seducer alone, "she
                     served him right." Think you, that her seducer, when he stands before the
                     throne of eternal justice, will be heard, when he complains of the wrong
                        <emph>he</emph> has suffered? Wrong there is doubtless, sin to be answered
                     for, but it will not be wrong against the villain seducer, the destroyer of
                     innocence, not against him. The sin is against God and his law, and when this
                     controversy between the seducer and his victim shall be settled in Heaven's
                     chancery, the verdict as between the two will be, "served him right."</p>

                  <head>XIII. NELLY.</head>
                  <p>DEAR EDITOR, have you not a young Bob, or Dick or Tom, to come up and play with
                     our Nelly? If, you have, send him up, and we will return him to you in the
                     spring, fat and strong with corned beef and country air. We want a companion
                     for Nelly, lest she should become philosophical and grand. She has been with us
                     but a few weeks, but is already rather didactic, and asking questions quite
                     impossible to answer. I think some of writing a profound treatise on life,
                     beginning with Nelly as a foundation, and coming up into mature years with the
                     child as a continual reference and standard of values.</p>
                  <p>I imagine it would be seen (as Macaulay says in the opening of his great
                     history, <emph>it will be seen—it will be seen),</emph> that notwithstanding
                     what St. Paul says of putting away childish things—children are mostly in the
                     right, and that for many of us to walk back instead of onward, would be the
                     wiser course. It certainly is a beautiful arrangement that the world is being
                     constantly supplied with new beginners<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6610-00000090"
                     /> ners, creatures direct from God, and that so perpetual newness and freshness
                     is continually kept up.</p>
                  <p>We talk of ADAM and EVE as having been, before the fall, in a very happy
                     condition; but one thing they missed—they were never children. They never rode
                     horse on a stick, or went to bed with a doll. If they had begun life, little by
                     little, line upon line, seeing, and hearing, and thinking, and acting slowly,
                     and in a small way, but experimentally always, as do their children, and if,
                     like them, they had tumbled down stairs, seen stars on the ice, burned their
                     fingers, and in thousands of ways stumbled and bruised themselves upon certain
                     physical laws, hard thumping evidences of order and sequence, would they, oh my
                     excellent editor, would they have eaten the apple? And may not the order of
                     Providence, in their history, have been to show not merely that all creatures
                     must rely wholly upon him absolutely and unconditionally as their life and
                     strength, but that this life and strength must be that of slow and gradual
                     accumulation; that, in short, we must toddle before we can walk?</p>
                  <p>And however sad may have been the giving up of that Eden, it was the place
                     where the apple grew. It had its temptation, and what more have we? Day by day
                     thousands are born into life, who, if they stay for any time, must be led out,
                     with whatever kindness and whatever words of hope and love, by the same hand,
                     from the garden of childhood into the cold and dark contrasts of struggling
                     life. The gates are forever opening and closing upon the little ones, and just
                     in proportion as they have deeply felt the joy and beauty of their first days,
                     and the strife and temptation of the days beyond, will they go forth with
                     saddened faces and with careful steps. Thanks be to God, there is ONE who has
                     been before them, and who knows the way right well.</p>
                  <p>A flower is a pretty thing with its color and softness, and its modest
                     joyfulness of expression; so may be a picture, better than whatever piece of
                     inanimate nature, but when you have the flower and picture embodied in flesh
                     and blood, walking and running about, talking, laughing, singing little songs
                     and hymns and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">glorias</foreign> all in a mix,
                     questioning, wondering, and rejoicing always, or on its knees talking with the
                     Unseen, telling Him some little trouble and asking for guidance and help—then
                     you have a little piece of Heaven upon earth; a young sprout of intelligence
                     fresh from God himself, placed here to grow up into strength and beauty, and at
                     last, under His care, to return to Him in His own home; accepted, restored,
                     saved it may be as by fire, but crowned now with eternal glory.</p>
                  <p>Have you never, Mr. Editor, in the dead of night, with some little Nelly lying
                     close by, fast asleep with a doll on either side, and her hair floating over
                     her face, have you never felt the insane desire to have some burglar enter the
                     room, so that you<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6610-00000091"/> might shatter him
                     into ten thousand fragments? Have you never felt the power which Nelly would
                     give to the right arm which would hurl him down the hall-stairs and smash the
                     wash-bowl on his preposterous brain? And would it be all because Nelly is so
                     helpless? So we say, but that is not all. It is because she is pure, and no
                     breath of harm must come to her. We act, in such cases, in God's behalf. The
                     angels, perhaps, are with us, those who behold the face of the Father. They—it
                     may be—give the strength, or the heart's blood. We take care of these little
                     ones, as the Israelites did of the ark of the covenant. Let nothing profane
                     come here—no rude hand, or word, or thought, for it is holy ground. This is why
                     a man may think or speak evil in a temple of worship, or whatever holiest
                     moment or place, but not before a little child, not before one of God's pure
                     witnesses.</p>
                  <p>NELLY and I are getting slowly acquainted. Yesterday, being rainy, she was busy
                     for a long time putting my hair in papers, after which she advised a walk on
                     the piazza, to give a <emph>set</emph> to the curls, as that, she said, was the
                     way they did out West. At night some of the papers were examined, but not
                     looking well, she recommended me to keep them on all night, which accordingly I
                     did, and got up this morning with a headache. But the whole thing, my dear
                     editor, was a most melancholy failure. Such was yesterday. To-day she is
                     writing—something important, no doubt—with a sharp stick which she is
                     continually dipping in my inkstand. Her great distress—when she has any
                     distress—is in the b-a-ba, k-e-r ker, line—as in making e-a-r-t-h into <hi
                        rend="i"/>urth, the philosophy of which is too deep for her. How much
                     falsehood is hinted in this and the like orthographical lies, or how much faith
                     in the necessity of believing such monstrous absurdities, would be a new
                     question to discuss. But these light troubles are soon over. Five minutes after
                     such a tribulation, she will be swinging violently in the great rocker, with
                     both dolls in her arms, to whom she pours forth songs with a die-away
                     sentimentality and occasional cracked voice <emph>applomb,</emph> that is
                     sometimes very exciting.</p>
                  <p>Oh, my kind Editor, the world is safe as long as children are born into it. If
                     that arrangement should ever cease, if men and women should spring up, or be
                     dropped down ready-made, we might as well give up at once. There would be such
                     a panic and stampede as the world has never seen. Something approaching to this
                     is unfortunately taking place in these latter days; children are not permitted
                     to be children, but with fearful precocity are made up rapidly into men and
                     women. This is the way you have in town. But the cities—let us be thankful—do
                     not contain everybody. There is a connection with God and Heaven still kept up,
                     through the country and country life. Herein is the safety of the world, and of
                     government, and the perpetuity of good institutions—that you cannot<pb
                        n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6610-00000092"/> wall in the country, you cannot pave
                     the lakes, and the prairies, and the rivers; you cannot shut out the blue sky
                     and the stars, you cannot fence in the mountains, you cannot bowl out the salt
                     sea, and make streets and build palaces there. God reserves to Himself all
                     these, and permits to those who like them, the self-confidence of streets and
                     common councils, saying, however, that except He keep the city, the watchman
                     watcheth but in vain.</p>
                  <p>The time must come, Mr. Editor, when we shall perceive that much of our crazy
                     life here, is merely exclamatory—that it is demonstrative of not much more than
                     noise and general dissatisfaction—a continual running up of wrong stairs—an
                     incessant shouting as to views and prospects—one crying <emph>lo here!</emph>
                     another, <emph>lo there!</emph> the great sight consisting, perhaps, in some
                     splendid fog-bank, glittering in borrowed light, and itself continually
                     shifting and passing away. When we shall be willing to come down to simple
                     statements—such as that little Nelly has more life and wisdom than the
                     telegraph can report in a thousand years—we shall get along better. When we
                     shall perceive and carry it out, as we say (but that is not quite enough; we
                     must carry it out, and bring it in, travel with it, work with it, eat and drink
                     with it, and go to bed and get up with it), that the intellect is nearly as
                     much a mere instrument as the body, and of no use save as an instrument; that,
                     with all its glorification, it never creates, but only finds out (invents) what
                     God had before created, and to which He alone gives form and life; we shall
                     become more quiet (shall we not?) and return again to children and
                     principles.</p>
                  <p>But that day is not our day, and before it arrives, the world will doubtless
                     continue to try what virtue there is in stones and mortar, and iron and
                     lightning, and all other aggrandizing physical and mental forces, to an extent
                     quite beyond our wildest conjecture. To-day (in this movement) we have the
                     dinner, and the dollar, and the lightning train: generous and magnanimous, but
                     extravagant—and material to the back-bone. When the good day comes, it will be
                     (as far as human agencies are permitted), through the proper training of
                     children, as nearest to God and the true life.</p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"Have you not a young BOB, or DICK, or TOM, to come up and play with our
                     NELLY?"</p>
                  <p>No. We have no young BOB, or DICK, or TOM, to do any such thing; we have no
                     little boys of that name. We have no <emph>little</emph> children at all; we
                     wish we had a half a dozen of them, if they would always remain so. We love
                     little children. One of our neighbors has a pure artless little girl that we
                     borrow occasionally, when we feel sad, or out of sorts with the world, and her
                     pleasant voice and childish prattle, as she sits beside us, always drive<pb
                        n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6610-00000093"/> away melancholy, and make us
                     cheerful again. We love little boys and girls. We love their frank,
                     straightforward simplicity, their honesty. They seem like fresh things, pure
                     from the hand of God, unspoiled by contact with the corruptions and the
                     wickedness of the world. What a pleasant place this Earth would be, if grown
                     men and women, with their learning, their gathered experience, their matured
                     intellect, their wisdom, could retain the honest frankness, the freshness, the
                     purity of heart and the sincerity of childhood! It would be a place then that
                     one might be loath to leave. We do not undertake to impeach the wisdom of
                     Deity. We <emph>know</emph> we are all wrong, but the thought will sometimes
                     steal into our mind, that it would have been better had man been created with
                     less natural proclivities towards evil. That the world would have been happier,
                     and human destiny loftier, had man been so constituted that it would not have
                     been his tendency, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">prima facie,</foreign> as the
                     lawyers say, to sin; had a nature been given him that would have led him
                     through the instincts with which he was endowed, to choose good rather than
                     evil.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! my kind editor, the world is safe as long as children are born into
                     it."</p>
                  <p>We deny this, as an abstract proposition. We deny it as a practical truth. We
                     hold it as an absurdity in theory, as well as fact. The past history of the
                     world demonstrates its fallacy. Why, when has the world been "safe," we should
                     like to know? We have its history for seven thousand years, or thereabouts, and
                     it has never been in a substantially safe condition for an hour. Society has
                     never been safe. Civilization has never been safe. The people have never been
                     safe. Human rights have never been safe. Religion has never been safe. Nothing
                     that pertains to the full intellectual or moral stature of manhood has been
                     safe. The great earth has been overwhelmed by a flood. Geologists tell us, and
                     astronomers endorse what they say, that it has, at some period of its
                     existence, been run into by a comet; and how do we know that even now, away off
                     millions upon millions of miles distant, some wandering meteor in outer space
                     is not on its way to knock this our planet into a universal smash? But you mean
                     the intellectual, the moral world. No matter, even in that view the world has
                     never been safe since ADAM and EVE were created and placed in the Garden of
                     Eden. By the way, that was a beautiful allegory of the first man and woman, and
                     the Garden of Eden. It was humanity devoid of sin—living intelligences that had
                     done no evil. They were supremely happy, because they were good. The Garden of
                     Eden, with all its beautiful productions, its flowers, its fruits, its
                     fountains and running streams, its shady groves, its green lawns and its
                     singing-birds, was the human heart overflowing with contentment and joy, before
                     wickedness invaded it, to poison its<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6610-00000094"/>
                     future, to sow remorse, and sorrow, and strife, where virtue and peace only had
                     before thriven.</p>
                  <p>But the world was in danger, even while ADAM and EVE were in the garden of
                     Eden. There was danger that EVE would eat the forbidden fruit, and then tempt
                     ADAM to his fall. That danger was realized, and they were thrust forth into the
                     outer world. Was there less danger there? Was there no danger that CAIN should
                     become a murderer, or that ABEL should be slain? Pass along down to the time of
                     NOAH. Was there no danger that the world should become so corrupt that God
                     would destroy it in His wrath? Was there no danger, when there could be found
                     among all the millions of living men and women of the world, but one family
                     worth saving from the destruction which the Deity had denounced against the
                     human race? Was there no danger at a later period, that a time would come when
                     the only just man in all the world, the only one that was without a fault,
                     without one stain of sin, one that was pure as Heaven is pure, should be
                     betrayed, and crucified between thieves on the cross? Further along still, was
                     there no danger when moral and intellectual darkness hung like a pall over
                     Europe, when the religion of the cross had degenerated into a senseless
                     mummery, when its high and holy precepts were perverted to the uses of
                     oppression, when profligacy characterized the priest-hood, and a brutalizing
                     bigotry possessed the laity, was there no danger that the world should have
                     gone back to the darkness of idolatry, and the degradation of heathenism? Was
                     there no danger that civilization should have been extinguished, that human
                     liberty should have become an obsolete term, and human rights have been
                     obliterated from the vocabulary of the world? Was there no danger that the
                     light of science should have been put out, and the fountains of knowledge that
                     have since gushed so gloriously, irrigating and fertilizing these latter days,
                     have remained sealed forever? Coming down nearer to the present, was there no
                     danger when infidelity spread over Europe like a consuming fire? When France,
                     then the strongest and the greatest, the most elegant and refined nation in the
                     world, bloated with infidelity, and teeming with unspeakable corruption, in the
                     great legislative convocation of her statesmen decreed that "there was no God,
                     and that death was an eternal sleep?" Is there no danger now, to-day, that the
                     world, in the pride of its fancied progress towards perfectibility, shall
                     forget, in the glory of the present, the mighty sequence of the future? Is
                     religion safe? Are human rights safe? Are governmental institutions safe? Are
                     the public morals of the world safe? If the world is safe, why is it that every
                     philosopher, great and small, whether of science, morality, government, or of
                     religion, are tinkering it, driving a rivet here, and soldering up a crack
                     there, polishing this rusty spot, and placing a strengthening brace in that
                     weak place—all patching, and mending, and<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000095"/> hammering at it forever? No! No! The world is
                     not safe, never has been safe, and never will be safe for an hour. And yet,
                     from the time that ADAM and EVE went forth from the garden of Eden, children
                     have been born into the world. Every day, every hour, every second of time
                     there are new intelligences, fresh from the hand of Deity, added to the
                     aggregated intellectuality of the world. New souls are thrown forward on the
                     wing, to perch for a little while in this world, and rest at last
                        <emph>somewhere</emph> in eternity. Childhood, we admit, is an institution
                     that exercises a conservative influence over the world, but the power of
                     rendering the world "<emph>safe</emph>" is a task too gigantic for its
                     accomplishment.</p>
                  <p>"We talk of ADAM and EVE as having been, before the fall, in a very happy
                     condition; but one thing they missed—they were never children."</p>
                  <p>True. We never thought of that. ADAM never played marbles. He never played
                     "hokey." He never drove a tandem of boys with a string. He never skated on a
                     pond or played "ball," or rode down hill on a hand-sleigh. And EVE, she never
                     made a playhouse; she never took tea with another little girl from the little
                     tea-table set out with the toy tea things; she never rolled a hoop or jumped a
                     rope, or pieced a baby quilt, or dressed a doll. They never played "blind man's
                     buff," or "pussy wants a corner," or "hurly burly," or any of the games with
                     which childhood disports itself. How blank their age must have been, wherein no
                     memories of early youth came welling up in their hearts, no visions of
                     childhood floating back from the long past, no mother's voice chanting a
                     lullaby to the ear of fancy in the still hours of the night, no father's words
                     of kindness speaking from the grave in the church-yard where he sleeps! ADAM
                     and EVE, and they alone of all the countless millions of men and women that
                     have ever lived, had no childhood.</p>

                  <head>XIV. DREAMS.</head>
                  <p>"WELL," said I to my wife, "there is nothing new under the sun, even in
                     dreams."</p>
                  <p>A few mornings since, as we sat at breakfast, I had recounted to that lady and
                     our Nelly a curious dream, which had occupied me through part of the night, the
                     novelty of which was, that at a large family dinner I was charmingly surprised
                     by hearing the whole party <emph>chant</emph> a grace before taking seats at
                     the table. The thing was unique, as well as <emph>grace</emph>-ful, and so
                     transparently proper, that I wondered it had never occurred to me before.</p>
                  <p>Well, sir, as the gentle people say, what do you think? I find, to-night, in a
                     letter from Mr. Charles Taylor, published in the <title>Tribune,</title> that
                     chanting of grace before meat is actually practised at this very day among the
                     Chinese; and it's not unlikely, my dear Editor, though I grieve to say it,
                     destroying, unmercifully as it does, the originality of the most exquisite
                     night-thought which I ever had—I say it is quite probable that those
                     shaven-headed, pig-tailed chop-stickers, have been doing it for thousands sands
                     of years. So much for trying to dream something new.</p>
                  <p>However, it was new to me, as a new star to an astronomer. I am quite confident
                     the thought had never entered my brain before, unless, indeed, it had crept in
                     slyly and taken a place in some remote corner, without waking my consciousness.
                     Is this possible, Mr. Editor? Is it not an absurdity? Can we be taken
                     possession of by thoughts and mental processes, without being a party to the
                     transaction? as, after leaving our hall door open all day, we may be surprised
                     by an interloper at midnight, who hasn't so much as turned a key or raised a
                     window to effect an entrance. Are we to be confronted by ghosts, who claim an
                     acquaintance, a place in our house, and a seat at our table, whom we never saw
                     in the flesh, and all upon the villanous plea that they had a nice time, one
                     day, in our cellar or garret? Heaven only knows what vividness, what terrible
                     meaning may one day gleam upon us from thoughts light as air, which we play
                     with, or toss from the mind as trifles and things of no account, or from that
                     daily crowd to which we open all our doors and windows, and would take off the
                     roof from our house, if necessary, to let them in. Must we not be amused and
                     diverted? Are we not to have a good time, I ask you? Is not this the object of
                     life—the be-all and the end-all—that we should have a good time; and have it
                     right away,<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6610-00000097"/> to-day, because we are a
                     fast people, and wide awake?</p>
                  <p>Any one who follows up the line of these suggestions without a cold shudder,
                     must have a cool brain and high expectations. No doubt, there are thousands in
                     the world who would gladly be excused, if it were possible, from this
                     mysterious life, as being too weighty, too solemn, too terrible in its possible
                     conclusions.</p>
                  <p>The process of thought—the way it acts—the place where it lives—the <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">quo modo</foreign> of its first pulsation, as a living
                     thing—something which a moment ago was not, had no place in the universe (to
                     me), and now is—has begun life—has character and meaning, and a length of days
                     which is eternal—will always be with me, whether I choose, or do not
                     choose—which I cannot burn, or bury (beyond resurrection), which I can give to
                     another, but must keep always the stereotype from which it was first
                     printed—which, in fact, is now, not a thing external to me, as my coat or my
                     body even; but a part of myself the destruction of which never can take place,
                     trifling as it may be, without involving the destruction of my whole being, so
                     that if <emph>that</emph> die, then I die with it—all this, not so much from
                     its mystery as from its plainness, its demonstrative horror, and its reach into
                     the infinite and the absolute, I dare not discuss. Nor would I sully, with my
                     tame conjecture, the starry grandeur of this topic—its beauty of possible
                     result—its fellowship of glory with the Father of Spirits.</p>
                  <p>But it is easy to <emph>imagine</emph> that the perception of this truth in all
                     its bearings would Christianize the world in a moment, so that for the first
                     time since men have gone abroad in the world, there would be a universal pause
                     among all nations, and kindred, and tongues—the noisy business of life would
                     cease, and there would be heard in the crowded city, and upon the seas, and in
                     the valleys, and upon the mountains, only the voice of prayer and praise and
                     supplication to the Most High. Something like this is doubtless imagined by
                     those who hold that the intellectual and the moral necessarily carry with them
                     the Christian influence; whose faith is, that to see, is to believe; to know,
                     is to adopt and to act. But this broad way of suggestion, looking apparently
                     into the darkest mystery of our being, is closed (not far down) by an iron
                     door, whose bolts and bars yield only to the touch of God himself. The palpable
                     sight of Hell and Heaven, the darkness and the light, the confusion and the
                     order, the woe unutterable, and the peace which passeth all understanding,
                     would offer no barrier or inducement to the soul which chooses to be guided by
                     its own will, and to be its own God. This must be; i. e. it must be that the
                     intuitions of this life as to the next, however feeble, are, in the main,
                     correct. One cannot imagine what Heaven is in its extent, but he can imagine,
                     and does imagine, and that truly, whether<pb n="190-191"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000098"/> ther it would suit him. Therefore it is that all
                     philosophy, all morality, all science, all churches and ministries, all
                     struggle and labor and prayer, are dead as ashes for all purposes of an
                     hereafter, unless given to Christ, who alone, as he created the world out of
                     nothing, can give to these feeble beginnings for him who seeks them, honor and
                     glory and immortality. To every child of Adam, who goes daily and always to
                     Him, and asks, believing, Christ says, <emph>Let there be light!</emph> and in
                     a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, a new creation is made for him, holy
                     angels are sent down to him, and all agencies of trouble, and sorrow, and
                     struggle, and doubt, and fear, and temptation, and all powers and
                     principalities resident on high,—are enlisted henceforth in his behalf; his
                     name is at once written down in the book of life, and a white robe is made
                     ready for him, and a seat set apart for him in the starry courts,—so that now
                     there is no more death to that soul,—it has entered already into life
                     everlasting.</p>
                  <p>But we were talking, Mr. Editor, of dreams. I trust, sir, that you are still in
                     practice. The magnificent specimen you gave us last summer, proves you a
                     splendid dreamer. After editing, all day, the recreation of dreams, the wide
                     area, the ease of accomplishment, the might Olympian of that nodding land, must
                     be especially refreshing. Or do you merely repeat and worry over things already
                     done, thoughts already stale, and pictures beautiful in the making, but now to
                     the mind only so much paint and canvas? Do you find yourself pulling at the
                     same oar at night, which you pulled in the morning? Lifting trout again, or
                     dropping a two-pounder, just as you have him almost in hand? Do you fall into
                     Crooked Lake, now-a-days? Do you have sunrises at midnight? Do you see great
                     wonders and marvels, bright and glorious, all in the darkness of your chamber?
                     Do you travel before you have so much as thought of your trowsers, and see all
                     the strange lands and stranger people? To whom, also, you make speeches and
                     wind up always with "America and the Albany <emph>Register</emph> forever?" Do
                     you edit in Chinese and Persian, and chat pleasantly with the Czar, as to how
                     he likes the war?</p>
                  <p>To take a meat supper, quite late, with pickles and old cheese, and in due time
                     have what you may call—the consequences, is one way of dreaming, but dreadfully
                     common. To have faces about the bed-side grinning and expanding and multiplying
                     into hundreds is more artistic, but has the same kind of vulgar unpleasantness.
                     It is not enjoyable.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the most common, but full of character and import, is that kind of
                     bewilderment which may be called the dream difficult. To be always striving at
                     impossible things and saying to yourself "it's all fudge, it's no kind of use,"
                     but still to go on grasping and pulling again at this intangible something,
                     which, all fudge as it is, quite refuses to be pulled or grasped. To go about a
                     room in the dark<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6610-00000099"/> involving and
                     revolving, searching for a doorhandle. To feel for matches which, when you find
                     them, refuse to go off, and at last, when they do, to wait through long
                     palpitating hours until the full blaze of light pierces the room before you
                     dare put naked eyes afloat in the air. To have a consciousness that the
                     shutters in strict propriety ought to be closed, as your room is on the ground
                     floor and opens into all out-doors. Then, of a sudden, to be patiently busy
                     (though it is a midsummer night) sweeping the snow off the piazza, and saying
                     to yourself "I have now swept away exactly six inches, and if it snows all
                     night I shall know directly in the morning that there is a foot of snow,"—then,
                     on your return, to undertake the shutters, which doing quickly, a sleigh with
                     four horses heavily apparelled with bells goes by on the jump, but as you knew
                     before that you were dreaming, you smile, and immediately detect it all as a
                     deception, "it is merely the sound of your breath in your left nostril; if you
                     listen one way it's like a trumpet but another way, it's like a bell." As you
                     stand by the window and discuss this, your father, or some friend who occupies
                     the next room, comes to the door, and asks, in a soft voice, "what is it you
                     are talking about so much." To this, you reply, in the same soft way, "that you
                     are very sorry, but positively you did not think you had opened your lips to
                     say any thing, in short, you had said nothing at all, and your friend must have
                     imagined it; the night was dark and the wind was noisy, it was easy to be
                     deceived, and any-way it was of no consequence, as it was all a dream."</p>
                  <p>The sleeping thought, my dear Editor, (I have done with the dream—the above is
                     an exact copy of one as far as remembered,) I say the sleeping thought tells
                     even better what we are, (<emph>hidden away in the possibilities</emph> of this
                     human nature, which, waking or sleeping, is one always,) than the waking
                     thought. It tells fearfully, but unerringly, and, as I believe, truly. If a man
                     desires not to wrestle with perpetual night-mare in the life to come, let him
                     look well to his dreams, while he has them. For dream-time will soon be over
                     with us, and we shall stand, then, in the broad, unfettered, unsleeping life,
                     with no cloak to cover, no indigestions to father the sins of the heart, and
                     what we carry with us, will be our companion and keep-sake forever. I look upon
                     the dream as my better angel, who shows me, now and then, gleams of the very
                     Hell itself, that I may decide now, whether I will make that my home hereafter,
                     whether it will be pleasant to be a part of that dark confusion. But now, it is
                     morning—thank God, it is still to-day—it is the light of the sun that crowns
                     these heavens—it is still the world of dreams.</p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"'Well,' said I to my wife, 'there is nothing new under the sun, even in
                     dreams.'"</p>
                  <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6610-00000100"/>
                  <p>We shall not undertake to follow you, friend MARGINS, in your metaphysical
                     dissertation on dreams. Your theory as far as we, being of unsophisticated and
                     plain understanding, can comprehend it, may be all right; we shall neither
                     dispute nor endorse it, but the fact asserted above, we deny. We insist that
                     there <emph>is</emph> something "new in dreams." We remember one dream of our
                     own, that, by its perfect distinctness as well as its comicality, made a deep
                     impression upon our mind, and it remains fixed in our memory. There was such a
                     seeming reality about it, such vividness and clearness in all things, that were
                     it not utterly opposed to all our experience in life, and the knowledge of its
                     impossibility, we should almost doubt whether in truth it were not sober fact
                     instead of a vision of the night. In order that we may be understood, we must
                     be permitted to describe a certain locality as it was long ago, and as the
                     recollection of our boyhood paints it, for it is "the spot that we were born
                     in." It is all changed now, and has been for many years. And who with white
                     hairs upon his head can say that the scenes of his childhood are not changed?
                     That the ancient landmarks have not been removed? That the things that memory
                     calls up from the long past, the trees, the stumps, the plum-trees, the cattle
                     and sheep in the pasture behind the house, the meadow behind the barn, and the
                     old house and barn themselves, and the fences, are all there still? Go back,
                     our dear MARGINS, to the place of your nativity, with all your young memories
                     clinging around your heart, and note how sadness will creep over you, and how
                     the tear will start, as you miss the things that you remember and loved so
                     well.</p>
                  <p>Our father's farm lay out at the head of the Crooked Lake, in the pleasant
                     valley that stretches away westward from that beautiful sheet of water. The
                     land rose with a gentle slope from the pebbly beach, and a broad meadow lay
                     between the shore and the old farm-house, which stood some fifty rods from the
                     Lake. Midway between the house and the Lake, a spring of the coldest and purest
                     water came gushing up, around which stood a cluster of some half dozen maples
                     that had been left when the old forest was cleared away. The long arms of these
                     ancient trees lovingly entwined, and the thick foliage that covered them in the
                     summer-time, made a dense cool shade all around the spring, and its waters
                     being soft, it was the place where the washing for the family during the warm
                     season was always done.</p>
                  <p>There was an elderly woman, who with her half-idiot son, lived in a log house
                     on a corner of the farm, a kind of dependent upon, and was chiefly supported by
                     the family. We remember "Aunt PEGGY," as she was always called, and "Silly
                     DICK," well. They were never for an hour separated. Wherever the mother went,
                     there was sure to be her idiot son. We have no recollection of<pb n="196-197"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000101"/> ever seeing them apart. If "Aunt PEGGY" was at
                     work in the house, DICK would be sitting on the door-sill if it was
                     summer-time, or if it was winter, in the corner waiting, and watching patiently
                     till the work was done and his mother should go home. Among the few words that
                     he was able to learn, that of "mother" was most frequently on his lips. He was
                     a gentle, harmless creature, always obedient and affectionate, leaning upon his
                     mother for protection with the perfect confidence of childhood, though in
                     stature and strength almost a man. The affections and care of Aunt PEGGY were
                     all centered upon Silly DICK, and her mother's instincts clung the closer to
                     him because of his imbecility. Poor DICK and his mother have been dead many,
                     many years. He died on a Tuesday, and on the following Monday she was laid in a
                     grave by his side. The only tie that remained, the last link that bound her to
                     life was broken, and she died from very grief for the loss of her idiot
                     son.</p>
                  <p>Aunt PEGGY used to do the washing for the family down by "the Spring," in the
                     summer-time, under the shade of the maples. Silly DICK would bring water for
                     her from the spring, and see to the fire under the kettles, and lay around on
                     the grass watching his mother, when he could not be useful in aiding her
                     labors. They seem to be present to us now as we remember them in our childhood,
                     she humming a simple tune, or singing some nursery song or ballad, and he under
                     the shadow of the trees, talking in his silly way to the birds among the
                     branches, or to himself, as he lay stretched at length upon the grass, or
                     looking at his own face reflected from the bottom of the spring, and wondering,
                     perhaps, who it was that was always watching him from away down in the water.
                     Those old maples, that old farm-house, that meadow with all the old things we
                     remember so well, are all gone. A flourishing village, with hundreds of houses,
                     and stores, and small gardens, and streets, cover what was then the meadow, and
                     that spring itself is conducted under ground to the lake. This great change has
                     been going on for a quarter of a century, and it is only by groping among the
                     memories of our boyhood, that we can recall the spot in its primitive beauty,
                     and as it was long, long ago.</p>
                  <p>Well, not many years back, as we were sleeping upon our bed here in this great
                     city, we dreamed a dream. "We were a boy again," and in the meadow at the head
                     of Crooked Lake as it was of old. There was the farm-house, and our father and
                     mother, sisters and brothers. There was the path down through the meadow; there
                     were the old maples, with their summer foliage, all bright and green, and there
                     was the spring itself, its crystal waters bubbling up and flowing in a little
                     rivulet over the sand and pebbles to the Lake. There lay the Lake, sleeping in
                     calmness and beauty. There were the forest-covered hills on the right hand and
                     on the left, there the high promontories<pb n="198-199"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000102"/> around which the smooth waters seemed to creep
                     and hide themselves. And last of all, there was Aunt PEGGY by the spring
                     washing, and Silly DICK was on the grass watching and talking to the birds that
                     were hopping about, and singing and twittering in the branches above him. The
                     vision was all perfect; not a feature, not a tint was wanting. We saw and felt
                     as of old, as if thirty years of our life had been obliterated, and nothing of
                     its cares or trials, its struggles or hard experience, remained. Everything on
                     this side of our boyhood was clean wiped out. The scene had not to us even the
                     charm of novelty. The sun was shining bright and warm in the sky, and it seemed
                     pleasant to be under the shadow of those old maples, as a refuge from his
                     rays.</p>
                  <p>Darkness gathered away down on the Lake; a dense black cloud seemed to come up
                     out of the water, and from behind the high promontories, not rising slowly and
                     majestically like thundercaps from behind mountains, but heaving and swelling
                     and rolling at first like the billows of ocean, and then rising in dense
                     columns towards the sky, wreathing and swirling, and twisting upward like the
                     smoke that goes up from a burning building in the night, but infinitely blacker
                     and deeper, and extending all across the eastern sky. Red lightnings flashed
                     upward and downward, and crosswise, and every way, trailing like fiery serpents
                     across the face of the cloud. Wild geese and ducks, and eagles, and osprays,
                     came sweeping in flocks, and screaming in mortal terror to the westward over
                     us. A mist gathered in the air, and though it was noon-day, yet a shadowy and
                     spectral twilight gathered around us. An immense ball of fire shot like a
                     blazing comet across the sky from the approaching darkness. The thunder growled
                     with horrible intenseness, shaking the very earth to its centre. To us all this
                     war of the elements seemed neither strange nor terrible. We had no idea of
                     danger, no apprehension of harm. Not so, however, with the poor washerwoman;
                     but one idea seemed to have a place in her mind, and that was that the day of
                     judgment had come, at a time when she least expected it. She tried to pray, but
                     every prayer ended with "The house that Jack built." She essayed to sing a
                     hymn, but every effort ended in Yankee Doodle. Try as she might, exert all her
                     powers, aided by the mortal terror that was upon her, every verse would end in
                     Yankee Doodle. Every strain, however devotional in the beginning, was sure to
                     close with Yankee Doodle, till in utter hopelessness her hands dropped by her
                     side, and in a voice choked by the agony of despair, she cried, "Lord help us,
                     my poor boy, what kind of a song will that be to sing in Heaven?" To us who
                     felt no sense of danger, there was something so infinitely ludicrous in the
                     poor woman's astonishment and dismay, that we could not restrain our
                     risibility, and "What in the name of all that's funny are you laughing at now?"
                     said our wife, starting up in<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6610-00000103"/>
                     amazement at the vehemence of our cachinnations, scattering the dream, and the
                     tempest, and the meadow, the old maples, and the spring, and poor Aunt PEGGY,
                     and Silly DICK, like visions of the night, as they all were.</p>

                  <head>XV. THE BRIGHT MORNING—AND JULY.</head>
                  <p>THE day has gone by. Like the amen to prayer, comes the night. The night, too,
                     has gone, now, and like the smile of God comes the morning.</p>
                  <p>The sun is riding high in the heavens, but finds me loitering and dreamy. The
                     intense vitality of this July day,—the richness of this beautiful morning, only
                     make me shrink within myself—paralyzing instead of strengthening; prostrating,
                     not uplifting. I am thinking, too, of a brighter day than this—a purer glory.
                     Oh thou kind Heaven, forgive me if I dream too much, and act too little for
                     that pure day,—that golden morning of which every sunrise here is a
                     prophecy—every noon-day, a witness and proof! For it is not far away from
                     earth, where the sun shines on forever. It is almost as though one might stand
                     on some mountain top and reach up a hand into the living waves where sunrise
                     and sunset meet and clasp each other, destroying night.</p>
                  <p>How still it is, to-day! Soft as mezzotints, and as motionless on the grass lie
                     the shadows of the<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6610-00000104"/> maples, spotted
                     with the light. One might think that Nature, all clad with the glory of God,
                     had suddenly ceased to breathe, and were waiting the announcement of something
                     new to be. But it is not that. The announcement has been made already. Death
                     has been busy again, (he who parts the day and the night, so that they meet no
                     more, have no more fellowship, one with the other,) he has been busy again, and
                     has taken one more of our young friends. The swift lightning brought us the
                     news, last night, and to-day the world is changed. It is not the same world it
                     was yesterday. She, who is gone, is not a part of it, to-day. She is living
                     yet; the pulses of her being, in whatever wonderful way God has provided for
                     her, are beating yet, and will live on forever—but not to our sight. And what
                     have <emph>we</emph> had to do with this matter—this new life to her—this
                     change, beyond which, and in which, is no change; we, who in times past, have
                     been near her, for so many bright days, so many evenings made glad with the
                     music and joy of youth? Oh, it will not do to turn away from this question, for
                     it comes home to us, now, and it will come home to us again, in the day of
                     judgment. If through all her bright or clouded days here upon earth, we have
                     been pleading with God to prepare her for something purer, brighter, holier—if
                     we have sought mightily, and as for our own souls, that Jesus Christ, the
                     righteous, would come down and make her His child, and number her with those
                     who shall sit with him in glory—doubtless it is all written down in heaven, and
                     will keep well—the ink will not fade—the print of that record will be bright,
                     even in the great day of account.</p>
                  <p>If we have <emph>not</emph> done this, it is too late now. We may go to our
                     closets and bend low before the Infinite Majesty—we may know that God is
                     there—as leaning in the dark on the arm of a friend, whom we see not; we may
                     feel the touch, and know that Jesus is there, ready to save to the uttermost,
                        <emph>the living,</emph>—ready to hear and answer petitions for the
                        <emph>living,</emph> for whatever other child of our heart may not yet be on
                     the road to Heaven,—but we can ask nothing more for Susie,—she is gone.</p>
                  <p>At such a time we pause in our routine, and take new bearings and stand-points.
                     Life becomes touched with a higher value, and we ask as to this question of
                     values, what kind of currency passes in Heaven, what exchange rules there—what
                     transactions are going on there,—what is the fashion of life there, and what
                     the speech and apparel of that High Court. In this way, God calls to us, the
                     angels call to us, the friends gone before call to us, the whole world, and the
                     brute and inanimate things of God, cry aloud to us. The sunshine playing in
                     spots under the trees, becomes purer, brighter, more like a thing of life
                     itself; as though it would plead with us, and win us away from the world and
                     its noisy doings. "Look at me," it says—as we stop musing under the maples—"and
                     see how pure and<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6610-00000105"/> bright I am, doing
                     only the will of God, for He sends me and gives me wings to travel with, and
                     all the strength I need. Oh, come away from the world, my friend, and busy
                     yourself with something handsome, something worthy of yourself and your
                     Creator."</p>
                  <p>At such times, also, a passage, say a sentence from a book, some forgotten
                     author, or forgotten prayer, will enter and quite take possession of the mind,
                     driving out all other thought with its incessant repetition, like the face of a
                     child whom we love, pressing, importunate, not to be refused.</p>
                  <p>Within the last ten years my father and myself have visited occasionally an old
                     homestead near New Haven, of which now nothing is left save a small new stone
                     house, standing however on the old ground, and with the same hills and meadows
                     about it, which were there when it was my father's home—the home of his
                     childhood. Our object is, sometimes, to stop at the old place, or to make a few
                     inquiries among the neighbors, and sometimes merely to take one more look, as
                     we pass by; for there are none that know us there now—not one. If they remember
                     us at all, it is probably only as the strange old gentleman and his son, who
                     sometimes stop and ask questions about people who lived there sixty or seventy
                     years ago—and who cares about such people? Why, they are all dead, mostly. So
                     my father says. There is scarcely a man or woman in all New Haven who remembers
                     him. "All gone," says my father, "all gone—every one of them that I used to
                     know."</p>
                  <p>What attraction there is to him in this solitary ride I can hardly say, but
                     perhaps he likes it <emph>best,</emph> that he is not interrupted in his
                     meditations thereabouts, by friends on the look-out. It suits him, perhaps,
                     that they do <emph>not</emph> come crowding about the carriage, and urging him
                     to stop and stay with them. What are they to him, or he to them? They are not
                     of the same generation.</p>
                  <p>On our last pilgrimage, only one summer ago, we stopped, as usual, at the Park
                     House by the College Green, and after the usual questioning, were recognized by
                     the landlord, who always makes amends for not knowing us, by extraordinary
                     civilities, after making us out. We have, usually, the front first floor rooms,
                     and if in season, the landlord always remembers my father's partiality for the
                     dragon oysters, and supplies us three times a day. Early on the morning after
                     our last arrival, we started for our drive. My father was urgent for a
                     one-horse wagon, and I as urgent for an open double carriage and driver, and so
                     we started in a roomy barouche, with the top thrown back, and a trusty driver,
                     who had driven a coach, as he told us, for more than twenty-five years.</p>
                  <p>To my mind, it was a beautiful arrangement, and my father, I saw plainly, was
                     soon of the same opinion. There was room to point his cane in all<pb
                        n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6610-00000106"/> directions, and entire comfort as to
                     cushions and back. A charming arrangement!</p>
                  <p>In this satisfactory manner, we slowly bowled through the streets, my father
                     marking for me, as we passed, all the places of note, and here and there
                     questioning the driver, who sat high up in the air, as to occasional novelties,
                     which were of late date, and consequently of small significance. "All
                     changed—all changed," said my father, after touching up the driver with his
                     cane, as to some new structure, which was built perhaps six months before.
                     "Here," he continued, turning to me, "on this corner was the old church, where
                     we came to meeting. I see nothing of it now," said he, looking very hard at a
                     plain house which stood there, as if he thought something might be left, "I see
                     nothing of it,—but here, sir, we came and heard the great Dr. Edwards more than
                     sixty, yes, seventy years ago. And here," he continued, as we rolled out into
                     the country and passed the creek, "here is the ground where my father planted
                     his cannon and drove back the British. I was on the hill with my mother, where
                     we had retired in the night. We staid in a barn up there, till the troubles
                     were over,—all the women and children gathered together there, for days and
                     nights, living as we could on what we had caught up in haste, as we left our
                     homes. There your aunt was born, shook into the world by the roar of cannon on
                     the plains. It was a hard time, sir, a hard time."</p>
                  <p>"Up this road," he continued, "a mile or more, lived a man whom I remember as
                     Uncle Joe Ball, who came down to the old house twice a week, always, to shave
                     my father. The Tories in the neighborhood threatened Uncle Joe severely, to
                     which he replied that as long as Captain M. needed a barber <emph>he</emph>
                     (Uncle Joe) should attend to him, and if they, the rascally Tories, would give
                     him half as good a breakfast as he always got at the old Captain's, he would
                     shave them, too."</p>
                  <p>We made no stop, this time, at the homestead. Perhaps we had frightened them
                     too much, years ago. On that occasion, I being an invalid and lagging behind,
                     my father walked swiftly in at the front door, and by a side-door passed on
                     through a sitting-room, startling several women who were there, and still moved
                     on without let or pause, to a back kitchen, where he threw his cloak on the
                     floor, and exclaimed to all who might be concerned in the declaration, "The
                     very spot where I was born!" This was his first and last remark. Looking for a
                     moment at the frightened people with exceeding severity, as though they had
                     scarcely a right to appear on the face of the earth, and with his great cloak,
                     which I replaced on his shoulders, swinging in the wind, my father immediately
                     marched out again, by a rear door, and has never entered the house since. I
                     returned a moment to apologize, and learned that they bear our name, but knew
                     nothing about us. The event of that morning they doubt<pb n="208-209"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000107"/> less remember, as we do hurricanes, as something
                     fearful, but (providentially) rare.</p>
                  <p>At this time, as I said, we made no halt, save for a look, but a mile or
                     thereabouts further south, my father stopped the carriage, and directed my
                     attention to a small two-story building, probably now used as a corn-house. "I
                     remember it well," said he, "for there was where we first came to school. I was
                     a mere child, for it is at least seventy years ago, but I remember it well,
                     because the house was once struck by lightning, and none of us hurt, not one.
                     But I remember it better from another circumstance. It was kept by a
                     school-mistress. I shall never forget that place, or that school-mistress,"
                     said my father, looking at me with a smile, "for every morning and evening she
                     prayed for us, closing, always, with this petition,—<emph>that we might all
                        meet again in the bright morning of the Resurrection.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>As we drove on into the city, my father leaned back, for the first time, in the
                     carriage, and exclaimed, (quoting from one of his own poems—the originality of
                     which we afterwards discussed,)</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Loud strikes the clock of Time!</emph> This, sir, is probably the last
                     drive that we shall ever have together to the old homestead."</p>
                  <p>I hope, Mr. Editor, that I have not wearied you with these personal matters. It
                     is that petition of the school-mistress, which has been haunting me to-day.
                     That is the child's face which has been before me all the morning. It was said
                     seventy years ago, or thereabouts, and doubtless it has been said many
                     thousands of years ago, but it is good yet, is it not? It will never become old
                     or tiresome. As time piles up the years and hurries them off into the past,
                     this old-fashioned petition will become brighter and brighter by repetition,
                     and for all the years that remain to this rolling world. And long after we, my
                     dear Editor, have stepped aside from this swift procession—when we have written
                     our last Margins, and all this beautiful arrangement for sunrise and sunset
                     shall have floated away from us, as a dream and a mist, there will still be
                     thousands, and thousands, and ten times thousands, evermore looking up, and
                     uttering, by day and by night, through all the round world, that sweet
                        petition—<emph>that we may all</emph>—<emph>all meet in the bright morning
                        of the Resurrection.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yours,——.</p>
                  <p>"THE INTENSE VITALITY OF THIS JULY DAY."</p>
                  <p>Speaking of July, reminds one of "Independence," and that again of
                     celebrations, of the booming of great guns, the fizzing of fire-crackers, of
                     rockets skiving through the heavens at night, and all the paraphernalia
                     belonging to the commemoration of the birth-day of a great nation. We have done
                     one thing in our day to tell of. What few<pb n="210-211"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000108"/> living Editors, we venture to say, or lawyers
                     either, for that matter have ever done. We once delivered an oration in a
                     state's prison, on a Fourth of July, and our audience consisted only of the
                     convicts and their keepers. Most people in this State, legislators and
                     tax-payers especially, have heard of the Clinton prison, an establishment away
                     up in Clinton County, right in the woods, literally at the end of the road. It
                     consists of a great pile of stone buildings surrounded by palisades, inclosing
                     some dozen or more acres, inside of which is a bed of iron ore, which is
                     wrought by the convicts. This ore is raised and separated at an expense of some
                     five dollars, or thereabouts, per ton, and sold at something like four dollars,
                     leaving a clear profit of about one dollar to the State—out of pocket. However
                     this may be, the State has for the last ten or more years been looking for the
                     "good time coming," when the Clinton prison would sustain itself without the
                     aid of taxation, and the treasury, and that same good time is in prospect
                     still.</p>
                  <p>Four years ago we were out among the Chataugay woods, tramping over the hills
                     and along the streams, floating over the lakes and climbing the mountains, and
                     playing the savage among the Adirondacks for a fortnight. We had a nice time
                     among the game. We shot all the deer we desired to, and caught as many trout as
                     we pleased. We killed a wild cat and a fisher, and squirrels and rabbits not a
                     few. We floated over those beautiful lakes that lay there all alone in the
                     woods, rowing around their rocky shores, talking with the old forest spirits
                     and weird things that had not yet been frightened away by the tramp and the
                     roar and onward rush of civilization.</p>
                  <p>Beautiful, aye, most beautiful are those northern lakes, lying among the
                     mountains and surrounded by the ancient forest, just as they were placed there
                     by the command of God. Especially beautiful are the Saranacs, and Round Lake,
                     and Tupper's Lake, studded with picturesque islands, some treeless and
                     shrubless, mere brown moss-covered rocks, great boulders rising up out of the
                     deep water. Others are covered with solemn old primeval trees, against which
                     the woodman's axe has never been swung. Romantic bays steal around and are
                     hidden behind high promontories. Fragmentary rocks in some places are piled up
                     like a ruined wall along the banks, while at others a sandy beach stretches
                     back to the alders and scrubby trees that line the shore. A beautiful river is
                     the Racquet, coming down from among the mountains with a deep and quiet
                     current, save where occasional rapids occur, when it dashes madly along,
                     foaming and eddying, and whirling round, among, and over the rocks, and roaring
                     onward for a little way, and then settling down again into calmness and a
                     dignified flow.</p>
                  <p>We returned, or as our guide termed it, "came out," from our forest wanderings
                     at the Clinton prison, on the afternoon of the third of July. We<pb n="212-213"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000109"/> accepted the invitation of the Agent to spend a
                     day or two with him. In the evening the good old chaplain called upon us, and
                     stated that the convicts were to have a prison holiday and an extra dinner on
                     the morrow, and requested us to give them an oration. We prepared one during
                     the night, and delivered it on the Fourth, in the presence of some three
                     hundred or more convicts and their keepers, in the chapel of the prison. It was
                     a new thing to talk about liberty, and progress, and social order, the glories
                     of a free government and the advance of civilization to men whose view was
                     circumscribed by the palisades of the prison, who were slaves to the State in
                     the hands of their keepers, and with whom freedom of word or action was a
                     memory only. When we rose from the chaplain's desk to address them and looked
                     upon the faces before us, every one of which wore a settled melancholy, a
                     sorrowful, almost hopeless expression, an indescribable feeling of sadness
                     overpowered us, and we had to sit down to wipe away the tears that obscured the
                     pages of the manuscript before us. We had addressed a good many audiences in
                     our day, but never one like that. We saw, before we had spoken a word, the big
                     tears coursing down the cheeks of those with whose hearts memory was
                     busy—memory that brought their little ones around them, with their childish
                     prattle and innocent faces, from whom their crimes had banished them, and no
                     doubt conscience was doing its work. No man ever had an audience that listened
                     with a more earnest attention to his words, than did those three hundred
                     convicts to ours, and the memory of that Fourth of July oration, in a State's
                     prison, will remain with us always.</p>
                  <p>"So my father says. There is scarcely a man or woman in all New Haven who
                     remembers him." "All gone," says my father, "all gone, every one of them that I
                     used to know."</p>
                  <p>Herein is one of the mysteries of being. We see those who started with us in
                     life dropping away, falling like the Autumn leaves around us, the circle
                     growing smaller and smaller, the weak and the strong falling alike, and if we
                     are spared only a few years longer, we too can say of the companions of our
                     youth, "they are gone, all gone." We remember a Scotchman, a neighbor of our
                     father's, who was a middle-aged man, when we were a boy. He left his native
                     village in Scotland before attaining his majority, and came to this country in
                     pursuit of fortune. His industry and frugality secured that, and after the
                     lapse of near half a century, he was seized with a longing to go back to the
                     scenes of his childhood, to look once more upon the things he loved so well,
                     and which memory had treasured so fondly in his heart. He was absent some three
                     or four months, and we met him here in the city on his return. He was an old
                     man, numbering nearly or quite three-score years and ten, but vigorous and
                     hearty as an ordinary one of fifty. We<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6610-00000110"
                     /> inquired of the friends he expected to find, and deep sadness gathered on
                     his features as he answered, "I found only their graves. None knew me. I was a
                     stranger alike to the memory and traditions of my kindred."</p>
                  <p>There is small philosophy in pausing to inquire why <emph>we</emph> are spared.
                     The mystery of this everlasting change, this dropping into, and dropping out of
                     life, is a matter upon which we may speculate, but one that we cannot solve.
                     This we know, that busy and successful as death is, and has always been, in
                     recruiting his ranks, the great army of the living goes on increasing always.
                     Being born, is a prerequisite to death, and although it be a fixed fact that it
                     is appointed unto all men once to die, yet it is an equally certain thing, that
                     more men have been born into the world than have died. When one, or a hundred,
                     or a thousand, disappear from among the living, one, or a hundred, or a
                     thousand, together with a few extra numbers, step into their places, and it is
                     doubtless a fact that there are more people in the world to-day than there were
                     yesterday, or at any previous period, and there will be more to-morrow than
                     there are to-day. The number of living men and women is increasing, and has
                     been, we have no doubt, since the ark rested on Ararat, and that number will go
                     on increasing until——when? The world is not full of people yet, by a long
                     shot.</p>
                  <p>"We have usually the front first floor rooms, and if in season, the landlord
                     always remembers my father's partiality for the Dragon oysters, and supplies us
                     three times a day."</p>
                  <p>Do you think, our friend MARGINS, that the Landlord of the "Park House by the
                     College Green," could be induced to extend his civilities in this respect to a
                     new customer? Would the editor of the <title>Register</title> be likely to be
                     treated to those same Dragon oysters? If so, we shall be likely to patronize
                     the "Park House by the College Green," for we confess that of all the delicate
                     morsels a fresh Dragon oyster right from his oozy bed, is our weakness; we hold
                     him to be the prince of the bivalves; not the largest, certainly, nor the
                     fattest, but he is the sweetest, the one that is just right to a dot. We have
                     small respect for the college or institutions of learning of New Haven—not that
                     we would speak in dispraise of them. They may all be, and doubtless are, well
                     enough in their way. They have doubtless sent out many men who have made a
                     noise in the world, and there may be many more like them to follow; but there
                     are a hundred other places where great men are manufactured, where colleges and
                     institutions of learning abound; but New Haven alone can boast of the genuine,
                     unadulterated Dragon oyster, and this great fact is its crowning glory. It is
                     the Dragon oyster that links New Haven to history, and makes it immortal. Ask
                     of a Virginian where New Haven is, and he will tell you it is where they have
                     the Dragon<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6610-00000111"/> oyster fresh every
                     day—ask him its principal attraction, and he'll answer the Dragon oyster—ask
                     him its principal production, its chief article of manufacture, he'll tell you
                     the Dragon oyster; and his mouth will moisten, and his eyes dilate while he
                     sums up his geographical knowledge of the locality in the great fact, THE
                     DRAGON OYSTER.</p>

                  <head>XVI. THE DINNER, AND GOOD-BYE—DECEMBER.</head>
                  <p>NOW that we have dined, Mr. Editor, let us shake hands, and part.</p>
                  <p>Some years ago on the Kaatskills, I wrote a little poem about the country near
                        <hi rend="i"/>Stratford-on-Avon. In that, I discoursed, very much to my
                     satisfaction, of <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"The journeying hills that wind away</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Slowly, as to a passing-bell;</l>
                           <l>Like friends who say good-bye, yet stay,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">And still repeat—good-bye—Farewell.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That was very proper for Ould England, but don't let <emph>us,</emph> Mr.
                     Editor, copy after such nonsense. For it is time, sir, to have done with
                     Margins. Unless we stop soon, your readers will think that we have set up for
                     an institution, "most tolerable, and not to be endured." The year, too, draws
                     to a close, and it's hardly worth while to carry over the old year's talk into
                     the new. I am, as you know, a little slow, at best, although you have waked me
                     some, (I rise, now, perhaps an hour earlier, than<pb n="218-219"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000112"/> when we began our discussions:) But I need all
                     the helps of appositeness and picked time of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >entrée.</foreign> Now that we are to part, it will not be taken in any
                     begging sense, if I confess myself <emph>behind the times,—not</emph> up with
                     the rising generation. Not that I care exceedingly about this. Probably not. If
                     there is any one body in the round world, or say any two or three, (counting in
                     my wife and Nelly,) who carry their days along with more high content than do
                     we in this quiet up-country, I should like to make their acquaintance. So that
                     it is not, you perceive, that <emph>we</emph> care as to being not quite so
                     enterprising as the world that dashes by us,—but that others do. Mrs. Dash, I
                     suspect, has a feeling in this matter—so have other neighbors, and so, perhaps,
                     have you and your readers. People well out at sea, and under full sail, don't
                     care to be straining their hearing, to please some idler on the shore, who is
                     shouting to them through a trumpet.</p>
                  <p>And now, sir, if only that dinner deals kindly with you, I shall be more than
                     content. It was <emph>the</emph> dinner to which you were invited, six months
                     ago, and now that it is accomplished, I see no occasion for further talk. Six
                     months ago, we were to dine. The six months have gone, and we <emph>have</emph>
                     dined. That is to say, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Quod erat demonstrandum, et
                        demonstratus est.</foreign> What's the use of margins, when we have found
                     the text, the very heart of the matter?</p>
                  <p>The talk, then, was of peas, young onions, and spring chickens; but we can't
                     bring June up into mid-winter. You must be content, sir, with having had a
                     Christmas dinner. I flatter myself, however, that we did a fair thing in the
                     way of onions,—the boiled and the pickled;—and the chickens had
                        <emph>been</emph> spring chickens, which, I take it, satisfies the
                     conscience, the moral sense, as to that matter. If a chicken has been young in
                     its day, what more can you expect? Oh, my Editor, in this age of progress, when
                     there's a chance of attaining to the full cackle, the perfected crow, it's
                     quite ridiculous to expect that spring chickens are <emph>always</emph> to
                     continue and remain spring chickens!</p>
                  <p>How did you rest, Hammond? Did you go through without landing? Did
                        <emph>Roaring River</emph> trouble you? "All in the solemn midnight," (not
                     centuries ago—but this same last night, Dec. 27th-28th, now gone past, and at
                     this moment hanging some where, all cold and dark and starry, on its way over
                     the lakes and the prairies,) did there come up any ghosts of dinner—nice things
                     that ought to be quiet,—tit-bits, that wouldn't be kind to you?</p>
                  <p>One thing is certain—the <emph>fire-water</emph> we did not have, nor the
                        <emph>Claret,</emph> nor the <emph>Sauterne,</emph> nor the <emph>Old
                        Port,</emph> nor the <emph>Heisdick.</emph> We did <emph>not</emph> find the
                     key to the hall-closet.</p>
                  <p>Of course, sir, it would be highly improper for me to speak of the
                     pre-arrangements for this dinner. It would scarcely be fair to Mrs. Margin. For
                     instance, it would never do for me to say, that the last six weeks, more or
                     less, have been and<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6610-00000113"/> gone chiefly as
                     antecedents to this event—that we began to smell onions and scolloped oysters
                     (I think) in November—that the draft in the parlor chimney though powerful, was
                     the wrong way—that I placed there an old-fashioned Franklin grate, which from
                     its look of high satisfaction I was anxious should have a good time, and which
                     itself evidently had its whole heart in the matter, burning and smoking in the
                     most generous manner, straight into the room—that I talked with it, and argued,
                     and theorized, and threatened, for days and nights—fired it up this way, and
                     that way, tried it with the north wind, with the south wind, with a powerful
                     west wind, and found all winds alike to it, the honest old Franklin taking all,
                     and giving nothing back to the chimney—that finding, at last, a combination of
                     flues, such as no decent stove could submit to, and after working hard all day,
                     carefully noting the smallest hints, the slightest coquetry of agreement,
                     filling and opening, and again filling and opening certain dark and sooty
                     chambers, that same old stove suddenly put on a bright and complaisant face,
                     smiled through all its brass headings, and drew to a charm!</p>
                  <p>This, sir, would never do to mention out of the family. I will only remark,
                     therefore, that having established that chimney communication, we held it with
                     a firm hand, so that a perpetual flame went up those ancient flues, to the hour
                     of your arrival.</p>
                  <p>So, also, as to apparel, especially <emph>boots,</emph> of which I found an
                     elegant pair, which have been on my feet three times, I believe, in the last
                     five years. Some weeks ago (to be forehanded), I pulled my astonished feet into
                     those boots, and perhaps the happiest moment of my life, was when I pulled them
                     out again. However, I keep them safe. I lay them up choice. They will be good
                     for exercise in stormy days, when we can't get out doors. I have made a
                     calculation, that if I begin to pull them on right away after breakfast, I
                     shall just be able to get dinner, when it will be time to begin immediately at
                     getting them off again. This will fill up the whole day with vigorous exercise,
                     and be excellent for the arms and chest. Any tendency of blood to the head, can
                     be kept down by cold applications.</p>
                  <p>They were put aside, therefore, as useful in that view, but not for a holiday.
                     For the struggle with those boots, sir, opened my eyes, as to the folly of all
                     such vain and windy endeavor; and when the fitness, the simplicity of
                        <emph>shoes</emph> presented itself, I was at once a better and a stronger
                     man. Having conquered the glistening temptation of boots, other troubles were
                     light as air; so that since that day, and the establishment of the upward
                     current in the parlor chimney, the whole house has been a-blaze with the
                     liveliest satisfaction, up to the breezy moment when you and yours stepped in
                     at our front door.</p>
                  <p>But, oh my dear Editor, my commentator, and<pb n="222-223"

                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alter ego</foreign> of the Margins, you perceive that
                     all this is entirely a private matter. Exclusively, sir, exclusively. It is due
                     to myself—it is due to my wife—and I think, too, that even Nelly might have a
                     feeling in this matter—a nice and delicate sense of the proper, that you should
                        <emph>not so much as dream</emph> that anything of the kind has taken place.
                     I say, therefore, <emph>nothing about it.</emph>

                     that we have dined, and supped, and slept, and breakfasted, while the wheels
                     are still rolling that carry you home, and the white breath of that fire-horse
                     goes up into the gold of sunrise, we send after you this last greeting and
                     farewell.</p>
                  <p>With the day, especially the early morning, are light, and strength, and hope.
                     With the night, are darkness and dreams, prophecies and mysteries. I like,
                     always, to shake parting hands in the morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Addio,</foreign> sir, and take our best up-country
                     regards to all your household. Especially my wife's and Nelly's, I trust you
                     will keep in your choicest remembrance. And as you travel down to that last
                     hour to which we all journey on together, may you and yours prosper
                     continually; may you greet many another Christmas; and with the same firm step
                     with which you just now crossed the high bridge over <emph>Roaring
                        River,</emph> may you walk on into the mornings of many, and happy, New
                     Years to come.</p>
                  <p>Yours,—.</p>
                  <p>"Now that we have dined, Mr. Editor, let us shake hands and part."</p>
                  <p>Don't say that, friend MARGINS, don't say it. Parting is a hard word, indeed it
                     is. Have you so many friends, that you can throw off even one without a feeling
                     of loneliness about the heart? We know that modern friendships, those formed
                     when white hairs are gathering on the head, are not like those of our early
                     years—at all events, they are less easily formed, and herein is a curious
                     matter pertaining to human character. It is more difficult to form friendships
                     as we grow old. We become cautious; we weigh character carefully; we start at
                     any inconsistency, any weakness, that we entirely overlook in an old friend,
                     and close up our hearts against that confidence which in our youth we so freely
                     entertained. No matter how many of our old companions may fall from around us,
                     no matter how we may see ourselves, year by year, isolated, contact with the
                     world, a practical knowledge of its insincerity, its hollowness, and its
                     vanities too, make us shrink from filling the void which death has created, by
                     new intimacies. Besides, we become cold and frigid in our natures. Icicles form
                     around our heart, and the hot tears, over the graves of our early friends, will
                     not melt them away. We should cherish the friendships of our youth the more,
                     because it is so difficult to form new ones, and we should prize a new one,
                     formed at our years, as a<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6610-00000115"/> diamond
                     set around with rubies; as gold that had passed the refiner's ordeal.</p>
                  <p>Say that we shall cease our discussions, if you please; that this is the last
                     of the MARGINS. Retire to enjoy the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">otium cum
                        dignitate</foreign> of your literary labors, but don't say, "let us shake
                     hands and part," don't say it.</p>
                  <p>"And the chickens had <emph>been</emph> spring chickens, which, I take it,
                     satisfies the conscience, the moral sense, as to that matter. If a chicken has
                     been young in its day, what more can you expect? Oh! my Editor, in this age of
                     progress, when there is a chance of attaining the full cackle, the perfected
                     crow,—it's quite ridiculous to expect that spring chickens are
                        <emph>always</emph> to continue and remain <emph>spring</emph>
                     chickens."</p>
                  <p>Precisely so—the theory looks plausible, and so far as the argument goes, we
                     cannot gainsay it. But it won't stand the test of fact: and how many of the ten
                     thousand theories originated by human wisdom will stand that test? The world
                     once believed that this little earth was the great centre of created things.
                     That it was a vast plain stretching out every way, consisting of oceans and dry
                     land, lakes, mountains and seas, rivers and islands. That when a man started to
                     go west, west he might go forever, until he came to the outer edge, the jumping
                     off place, if any edge there was. That the sun travelled round the earth by
                     day, and the moon by night, and that all the stars were only shining things set
                     up in the sky for ornament. This theory was a great thing for human pride, and
                     the men of those times had a great opinion of themselves and their mighty
                     world. No wonder that "there were giants in those days." But the demonstrations
                     of science knocked this proud theory into fragments. Great ships swung out upon
                     the ocean, and sailed away westward, and sailed on, traversing unknown seas.
                     Onward they went, westward and westward still, until one day they made their
                     appearance in the East, returning to the harbor they had left. People still
                     insisted that the earth was flat; but there stood the fact, of a voyage always
                     in one direction, straight-forward, that terminated where it began. Here was a
                     practical demonstration, a solitary fact that scattered the logic and the
                     learning of ages, and a great theory that had stood as truth for centuries, to
                     the winds. It proved that this earth was not flat, but round. Science again
                     applied its cold demonstrations of fact to our planetary system, and proved
                     that this mighty earth was a wonderfully small matter in the great visible
                     universe of God, that it travelled round the sun as a sort of tender only, and
                     that the little stars that twinkled away up in the sky, were glorious worlds,
                     to whose vast magnitude this earth is in comparison as a grasshopper to the
                     mastodon.</p>
                  <p>And now, friend MARGINS, let us test your theory in regard to spring
                     chickens—and remember we are discussing a theory, not a dinner, and especially
                     not the "Christmas dinner," for that was all<pb n="226-227"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000116"/> that an epicure could ask, to say nothing of the
                     generous hospitality, the pleasant conversation with which it was seasoned. Ask
                     a "diner out" who has a taste for that choicest of delicacies, the spring
                     chicken, if he is contented with the argument that he should feed upon an
                     antiquated rooster, because it had at some remote period been a spring chicken?
                     Every tooth in his head would cry out against such a forced conclusion. Reason
                     with him as you might—pile Pelion upon Ossa and Ossa upon Olympus, in the way
                     of theoretical demonstration, still his aching jaws, that had in vain essayed
                     to masticate the muscles and ligaments of the venerable game-cock, and his
                     sense of taste that had detected no delicacy of flavor, would, by the simple
                     application of palpable facts, demolish your learning and your logic. No, sir,
                     a spring chicken is <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sui generis.</foreign> It never
                     exceeds a partridge in size. When it "attains the full cackle, the perfected
                     crow," as a spring chicken it ceases to have an existence; call it a fowl, a
                     hen, a rooster, anything you please, but it is not a spring chicken. It may be,
                     and I affirm it is, a good and edible thing, but a spring chicken it is not. It
                     has not the delicate flavor, the juicy tenderness—in short, the perfection of
                     all that is pleasant to the palate, that belongs to the spring chicken.</p>
                  <p>"One thing is certain, the fire-water we did not have, nor the
                        <emph>Claret,</emph> nor the <emph>Sauterne,</emph> nor the <emph>old
                        Port,</emph> nor the Heid-sick; we did not find the key to the
                     hall-closet."</p>
                  <p>And therein we insist upon it we were right. Will you tell us, friend MARGINS,
                     why it is, that rational men, who can reason accurately from cause to effect,
                     should indulge in this same fire-water? Why they will insist that they cannot
                     be jolly, without invoking to their aid the wine-God, or the still more
                     dangerous potentate, King Alcohol? If you will look over our pleasant
                     correspondence you will find, somewhere in the back numbers, this expression in
                     regard to ourselves:</p>
                  <p>"Wine floored us once, and only once, and then 'twas by treachery. Under the
                     influence of repentance and soda-water, we cut its acquaintance forever."</p>
                  <p>We have smiled over the memory of that occasion more than once, notwithstanding
                     certain twinges of conscience, which tempered our propensity to laughter, for
                     be it known to you, friend MARGINS, that there is "a mirthful sadness as well
                     as tears of joy."</p>
                  <p>We had just finished our term of study required as an antecedent to being
                     admitted to practice at the bar (we mean, of course, as a lawyer); and as the
                     court was in session in New York, went there for the purpose of passing the
                     ordeal of an examination preparatory to obtaining a license to put "Attorney at
                     Law" at the end of our name. It was of a January day when we, with some forty
                     or fifty others, were examined, and cold enough to satisfy the conscience of a
                     Laplander. Much as we<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6610-00000117"/> had dreaded
                     the examination, and diligently as we had applied ourself to be prepared for
                     it, it finally turned out to be a very commonplace affair, the principal object
                     of which seemed to be, to occupy the time until a supper to the examiners, at
                     what in those days was a celebrated restaurant's in the neighborhood of the
                     City Hall, could be prepared. When that event was announced the examination, of
                     course, terminated, and we were all pronounced uncommonly learned young men, in
                     every branch of legal science; and as the supper was excellent, we may be said
                     to have graduated with great honor. We are green enough, mercy knows, now, but
                     were much more verdant then. The greater part of our long clerkship of seven
                     years had been spent in the rural districts where Champagne was a mere rumor,
                     an ideality, a thing to hear spoken of by travelled gentlemen; besides, our
                     finances, if such cheer had been plenty, would have been a barrier between us
                     and indulgence.</p>
                  <p>Beside us at the table sat one that might have been called, in modern parlance,
                     a fast young man; so fast, indeed, that he ran himself out of constitution, out
                     of health, and into the grave at last, before he was thirty years of age. He
                     was the son of wealthy parents, highly educated, and of brilliant mind. But a
                     career of dissipation squandered one of the noblest intellects that God ever
                     gave to his creatures, and made his mother's head white, and her brow wrinkled
                     long before their time, and the memory of his last hours, when the drunkard's
                     delirium was upon him, broke her heart, and she sank childless into the grave.
                     He sat beside us at the supper-table. Upon him wine had small effect. Inured to
                     its use, his brain seemed almost proof against indulgence, however copious his
                     libations. The Champagne was choice, and we remember well that it was pleasant
                     to the taste. Our neighbor drank and urged us to drink, descanting all the time
                     upon its harmless nature, and we were foolish enough to drink one glass to his
                     two, during the sitting. We had a jolly time of it; just such a time as lays up
                     repentance and humiliation, and self-abasement, when the <emph>sober</emph>
                     second thought calls up the follies of the past. We were entirely regular, so
                     long as we remained at table, and in the equable atmosphere of the room, but
                     when we got out into the piercing cold outside, all at once the lights seemed
                     to be dancing a quadrille with the houses, and the streets with their lamps
                     seemed to go up in a long vista towards the sky. Everything seemed in motion.
                     The buildings got out into the middle of the streets. The Old City Hall was
                     turning a somersault, and the horses and carts, and carriages seemed to be all
                     standing straight up on end, or going perpendicularly up towards the stars,
                     that were dodging about in a manner that was a sight to behold. The side-walks
                     were steep, very steep, and it was an up-hill business to travel upon them. We
                     remember catching around a lamp-post that<pb n="230-231"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000118"/> was hurrying up Broadway, on a two-forty gait,
                     just as the glass came down in a crash around us, a friend of ours having
                     thrown his hickory cane at it to stop the runaway. At that instant, a kind
                     gentleman, who belonged to the night watch, introduced himself to our
                     acquaintance. What the subject of his remarks was we do not remember, but when
                        <emph>he</emph> said watch-house, <emph>we</emph> said "a carriage, Western
                     Hotel, call in the morning, all right, go ahead." The rest is a blank. We awoke
                     in the morning about ten o'clock, in our own room at our hotel, with ten
                     thousand bees humming and swarming in our head, temples throbbing with pain,
                     and a deep sense of shame in our heart. That night's experience satisfied
                        <emph>us.</emph> If we cannot be jolly without a recourse to artificial
                     stimulants, we have made up our mind to "go mourning all our days." It is a bad
                     thing, a dangerous thing, to trifle with this "fire-water." Better play with
                     the forked lightning, better grapple with the locomotive when he comes crashing
                     and thundering along, screaming and roaring with the voice of the arch-fiend,
                     and hurling forward with the speed of the wind, his ponderous train.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Well, friend MARGINS, if part we must, so be it. To us, at least, our season of
                     communion, brief though it be, has been pleasant. We shall look back upon it as
                     one of the green spots of a life that has been to some extent a barren one.
                     There are many desolate places along which its course has been, and few flowers
                     have bloomed by the wayside. But "addio" be it, and God bless you and all those
                     that you love. May health and strength return to you, may no sorrow cast its
                     dark shadow around you. May your life be a long and a happy one, and may your
                     last hour be the happiest of all, by reason of "the faith that leans upon
                     God."</p>

                  <head>I. CANANDAIGUA—PENN YAN—CROOKED LAKE—BATH—HORNELLSVILLE.</head>
                  <p>I AM at Canandaigua, certainly one of the most beautiful country towns in the
                     State. The scenery about it is not grand or sublime; there are no rugged
                     mountains rearing their tall heads to the clouds, frowning in eternal
                     barrenness upon majestic rivers sweeping around their base, or lakes sleeping
                     in quiet valleys below them; there are no waterfalls rushing down from the
                     hills in foaming cascades, or winding in deep ravines among old primeval woods;
                     but there is that which is better. There are rich farms spread out all around,
                     far as the eye can reach, fields of grain waving in the summer breeze, meadows
                     covered with rich grass ready for the mower, and pastures in which flocks and
                     herds are feeding; fine farm-houses hid away among the tall trees and
                     shrubbery, and barns filled with the products of agriculture, are in view. On
                     the south is a beautiful lake winding away around low promontories, with
                     cultivated fields or patches of green<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6610-00000121"
                     /> woods stretching away from the beach. Such is the scenery around
                     Canandaigua. There are pleasant drives in every direction. The road that winds
                     along the shore of the lake will afford a delightful ride of a summer morning
                     or evening, and the other avenues leading away into the country are scarcely
                     less pleasant. Everywhere are the evidences of wealth, of progress, and of
                     civilization. Fine horses, fine cattle and sheep, and rich harvests, are
                     constantly in view. These things are around Canandaigua, outside of the
                     village, within range of a walk or a drive. But the village itself affords a
                     greater display of quiet beauty and taste than I have seen elsewhere. The
                     houses are massive and elegant, surrounded by large and tastefully laid out
                     grounds and gardens, decorated with the rarest flowers, and the richest
                     shrubbery. There are "solid men," as Daniel Webster would say, in
                     Canandaigua—"solid" in intelligence and social qualities, in moral and
                     political influence, and solid in dollars. Men who live for something beyond
                     the mere accumulation of wealth; who will leave behind them a monument in the
                     taste with which they have adorned the spots they occupy. These beautiful
                     residences, the grounds decorated with rare shrubbery, and abounding in the
                     richest fruits; these gardens, sending abroad upon the air the fragrance of
                     flowers that charm the vision by their beauty, and entrance the senses by their
                     sweetness, are better than railroad stocks or vast investments in the funds, to
                     leave as a monument when one dies. The tree one plants, survives him; the
                     grapevine remains when the hand that plants it is cold; the rose-bush blossoms
                     when he who placed it in the garden is alone in the quiet house of death; and
                     while the tree bears its fruit, the grape-vine its rich clusters, or the rose
                     its sweet blossoms, his name will remain connected with them, as if chiselled
                     in marble. I remember that in one of the old towns of New England, I was
                     conversing with a lady who is not unknown to fame, when she pointed to some
                     elms that stood on the lawn in front of her dwelling, and said, "these trees
                     were planted by my grandfather," and then pointing to some venerable pear-trees
                     that hung with then unripe fruit, said, "those were planted by the original
                     proprietor of these grounds, of whom my grandfather purchased them." The name
                     she gave I have forgotten, but it was associated with the old pear-trees, and
                     had been for more than a hundred years. And so it will be with the trees and
                     shrubbery of these beautiful grounds. They will preserve the memory of those
                     who placed them where they stand, and for generations be a monument to their
                     virtues and their name.</p>
                  <p>From an observatory on the top of one of the most splendid dwellings in the
                     village, I had a view of the country around. The glass was slightly stained, of
                     the windows through which I looked, and it gave a mellowness to the picture
                     that was<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6610-00000122"/> exceedingly beautiful. I
                     have never been in Italy; I know about an Italian sunset only from descriptions
                     by tourists and from paintings by masters of the art, but if an Italian sunset
                     exceeds in beauty the prospect that was before me, as I looked from that
                     observatory, it is then beautiful indeed. The lake, the farms and avenues lined
                     with trees in the distance, the village residences, the gardens and grounds
                     near by, and the delightful walks and trees, and rich fruits and flowers
                     immediately beneath and around me, formed a landscape which, seen in the mellow
                     light afforded by the stained glass of the windows through which I looked, no
                     painter could transfer to canvas, or Italy excel.</p>
                  <p>I dined with the owner of this residence and his excellent lady, in the true
                     style of Scotch hospitality. They were among the pioneers of what years ago was
                     known as the Genesee Country. They have seen the ancient forests standing on
                     the site of Canandaigua, and stretching away to the great lakes, and they have
                     watched the progress of that war which civilization makes upon the old primeval
                     things, sweeping away the woods and spreading out broad farms, planting
                     churches and school-houses, and building up cities and towns. They heard the
                     first blast of the stage coachman's horn, on the great stage route through the
                     centre of the State, and they heard its dying echoes as it was succeeded by the
                     scream of the steam-whistle and the snort of the iron horse. They shared the
                     trials and hardships incident to the settlement of a new country, and in their
                     declining years they are reaping a rich harvest, as the reward of their
                     perseverance and energy. May they be long spared to enjoy the fruits of their
                     labors; and when their appointed time shall come, may they pass away quietly
                     and calmly as the last lingering stars pass from the twilight of morning into
                     the brightness of the perfect day.</p>
                  <p>As we were walking in the garden after dinner, among the beautiful and rare
                     flowers and shrubbery, I said to the excellent lady of the mansion, "It seems
                     to me that you are blessed, certainly not beyond your deserts, but beyond the
                     ordinary lot of the people of this world. You have wealth, and you have the
                     taste to use and enjoy it. You have this beautiful mansion, and these
                     delightful grounds, these flowers, these fruit and shade trees, these pleasant
                     walks, and all that can make life pleasant. You have health, and spirits to
                     enjoy it all. While I, who have all the love for all these things, have neither
                     house nor grounds, can cultivate no shrubbery or flowers. My life is a long
                     struggle for bread."</p>
                  <p>"My friend," she replied, and a shade of sadness came over her countenance as
                     she spoke, "we do not differ so much from you. We have no children to bestow
                     our affections upon. You have. Would you exchange them for all that you have
                     seen here? They are your garden."</p>
                  <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6610-00000123"/>
                  <p>And I thought of the cherished flower that death had so recently plucked from
                     the garden of my home, and how I missed its perfume, and that I would give all
                     the treasures of earth, were they mine, to look upon the sweet blossom
                     again.</p>
                  <p>There is, at Canandaigua, one of the finest hotels in the country. It is
                     spacious and new. The rooms are large and airy, and furnished with great taste
                     and neatness. In no hotel have I found more care or attention paid to the
                     comfort and convenience, and even the luxury of the guests. To those who love
                     quiet, who would be away from the bustle and noise of a city, who have no taste
                     for the excitement of the watering-places or fashionable resorts, Canandaigua
                     offers peculiar inducements to tempt a stay. The hotel, I repeat, is among the
                     very best in the State. The country around is charming, the drives delightful.
                     Everything that can add to the luxury of quiet and repose during the heat of
                     summer, is to be found here.</p>
                  <p>I am at Penn Yan, the county seat of Yates County, a neat and prosperous
                     village in one of the smallest, but richest counties of the State. The farms
                     around it are productive, admirably managed, and the farmers are rich. In no
                     part of the State has there been a more rapid progress in improvement and
                     wealth made. It is a pleasant thing to see the great fields of grain, of wheat
                     just ready for the harvest, of barley ripening for the sickle, of oats yet in
                     their coat of green, and corn even with the fences, just in the gorgeous livery
                     of a thrifty growth. Time was when Penn Yan by no means enjoyed the best name
                     in the world for morals. It was once emphatically a hard place, a place of
                     horse trading, horse racing, card playing, of drinking, and the other
                     proclivities which go to make up an evil reputation. But all these things
                     belong to the past, and Penn Yan is now as distinguished for its public virtue,
                     its high tone of public morals, as it was, in days long gone by, for its evil
                     practices. Churches and school-houses, and the persevering effort and example
                     of good men, have wrought an utter revolution in its moral character. Its vices
                     have been forsaken, its evil practices abandoned. The bad men who stained its
                     reputation with their evil courses, have passed away, or forsaken their bad
                     ways. Penn Yan is a sober village, full of enterprise, energy and industry,
                     where the right tone of morals prevails.</p>
                  <p>In sight of Penn Yan is the Crooked Lake. This beautiful sheet of water has, to
                     me, a thousand charms, and as I look upon it a rush of pleasant memories come
                     clustering around my heart. I was reared upon its banks; I have floated a
                     thousand times upon its surface, and bathed and fished in its waters; I have
                     caught hundreds of salmon trout out in the deep water, and thousands of
                        yellow<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6610-00000124"/> perch and sunfish along
                     the shore, or on the points of the bars, where the equatic weeds grow thick and
                     luxuriant, like a cane-brake or a wild meadow away down in the water. I
                     remember when my father's log house stood at the head of the lake, some forty
                     rods back from the shore, with a gentle slope of meadow to the water's edge.
                     Great maples that had been spared when the old forest trees were swept away,
                     stood a few rods apart in that meadow, spreading abroad their leafy arms, and
                     rising in the summer time like pyramids of green towards the sky. Midway from
                     the door to the lake was a cluster of some half dozen of these beautiful trees,
                     from among the roots of which a cold pure spring came gushing up, and ran in a
                     little brooklet over a bed of pebbles to the lake. It was a new country then.
                     No highway or road extended beyond my father's clearing. He lived eight miles
                     from a mill, and the same distance from a store or a physician. But all this is
                     changed now. Where then was that meadow, and fields full of stumps, or old
                     primeval woods, is now a thriving village of some fifteen hundred busy people.
                     All the ancient landmarks have been removed. Civilization, in its onward
                     progress, has swept everything that then was to oblivion. The old maples are
                     gone, the clustering plum trees, the tall sycamores, the hickory, the butternut
                     and the wild cherry trees are all gone. That beautiful spring is in the cellar
                     of a village store. The house that "I was born in" is gone, and its place
                     occupied by a pleasant village residence.</p>
                  <p>This was a beautiful sheet of water long years ago, when there were few
                     clearings along its shores, and it is a beautiful sheet of water still. The
                     forest that grew in dense luxuriance to the water's edge, by its gigantic
                     growth indicated the strength of the soil. Where that forest stood, are now
                     rich farms, giving back wealth to the descendants of the hardy pioneers that
                     swept it away. The scenery around this lake is most beautiful—not like that of
                     Lake George, where rocks and mountains are piled up in stately barrenness,
                     opposing their bald heads to the storm, or hiding their summits in the mists of
                     heaven. The scenery of Lake George is grand, sublime; but is the grandeur of
                     sterility, the sublimity of desolation. Civilization can never beautify or
                     adorn its rugged acclivities; agriculture cannot thrust its sickle into ripened
                     grain, nor the ploughshare penetrate the granite soil that surrounds it. It may
                     be a resort for the traveller in the summer months, to enjoy the freshness of
                     the mountain air, and the coolness of the mountain breeze, but civilization
                     cannot winter there.</p>
                  <p>The scenery about this lake is of a different character. It speaks of wealth,
                     of comfort, of intelligence, of civilization and progress. The farms that
                     stretch away in gentle acclivity from the shore are rich in agricultural
                     products, great fields of wheat, just passing into yellow ripeness, waving<pb
                        n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6610-00000125"/> like an ocean in a gentle breeze.
                     Meadows, which are now being shorn by the mowers—acres upon acres of oats and
                     corn, now in their richest robe of luxurious green—pastures where flocks and
                     herds are grazing. Painted houses and great barns, patches of woodland left to
                     supply fuel, and timber for fences and building. These make up the landscape
                     that skirts the Crooked Lake. There is no lack of secluded bays or shaded
                     nooks, into which the little row-boat may glide, nor rugged promontories
                     covered with stately trees, beneath the shadow of which one may luxuriate, safe
                     from the noonday heat, and refreshed by the cool breeze that sweeps over the
                     water. Midway between Penn Yan and the head of the lake is Bluff Point, around
                     the base of which the lake sweeps, and which forms a peninsula, separating the
                     east from the west branch of the lake. This point, as it is called, is a hill
                     of some thousand feet in height, rising with a steep acclivity, but cultivated
                     to the water's edge. On the top it is comparatively level, and presenting for
                     some eight or ten miles a beautiful farming country. At the highest elevation
                     stands a pleasant farm house, overlooking the lake and all the country round.
                     Seen from the water, it stands out in bold relief against the sky, like some
                     ancient castle of the barons of old. From Penn Yan to this dwelling, is a
                     pleasant ride of some ten or twelve miles over a plank road most of the way.
                     When there, the traveller will have a view worth a day's ride to look upon. He
                     will be far above the surrounding country. On three sides of him will be the
                     lake with the beautiful scenery that skirts it. To the East he will overlook a
                     country of forest and farms for miles and miles, within which he will see two
                     or three smaller lakes; to the north he will see Penn Yan, and the rich
                     agricultural district that surrounds it, and beyond, the Seneca Lake. Away to
                     the south he will be charmed by the beautiful valley that stretches away from
                     the head of the lake, and is lost among the hills that hem in the valley of the
                     Conhocton; while to the west his eye will wander over a country more wild and
                     rugged, but still rich and beautiful. No traveller should leave Penn Yan
                     without visiting Bluff Point. Nor should he fail to take a passage over the
                     lake in the pleasant little steamer Steuben. In Captain John Greig he will find
                     an intelligent and courteous gentleman—one who loves his boat and the lake he
                     navigates, and the country and the people round it; who loves to point out the
                     beauties of the scenery, and hear the tourist respond to his own enthusiasm. He
                     is, as I said, an intelligent man, not profoundly educated in scholastic lore,
                     but one who has read and thought a vast deal. Talk about the birds, and you
                     will find him an ornothologist. He will show you his collection of birds,
                     prepared in a superior manner by himself. Among these he will point out to you
                     a loon or northern diver, taken on a hook upon a night line in more than a
                     hundred feet of water.<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6610-00000126"/> Talk about
                     the fishes, and you will find him deeply conversant with piscatory lore. Talk
                     of the animals that, when the country was wild, frequented the forests in this
                     portion of the country, and you will find him at home on the subject. In
                     whatever relates to nature, and the living things of nature, he is learned as
                     careful reading and study can make a man of his years.</p>
                  <p>I go up the Lake with him to-morrow, and shall write you again. I go to visit
                     the old scenes of my boyhood. Though everything is changed, though the old land
                     marks that I loved are all gone, yet I love to linger around the spot where my
                     early youth was spent, and call up visions of scenes long, long past. I love to
                     call back the brave old trees, the fields, the fences, the stumps, the gushing
                     spring, and brushing away the houses and the streets, place them as they stood
                     of old. I love to call up the old maples that stood in the meadow between the
                     old log house and the lake, in all their ancient verdure, and talk with the
                     unseen spirits that people their green foliage. I love to tear away the store
                     houses, the docks, and the great high wall that usurp the place of the little
                     bay at the northwest corner of the lake, that shot landward beneath the
                     spreading arms of the ancient elms and oaks, up whose great trunks the wild
                     grape-vine climbed, and creeping out along the branches, covered them with its
                     tendrils like a net work, and spread out its broad green leaves like a thatched
                     roof, shutting out the light of the sun. And yet it is a sad thing to visit
                     these old places and see the mighty change that has come over them.</p>
                  <p>I am on the Crooked Lake, a passenger in the pleasant little steamer Steuben,
                     under the command of Captain JOHN GREIG, of whom I have spoken before. All that
                     I said of him then was true, all that I said of the scenery around this lake is
                     true, unless it be that I have failed to do it justice. I said I was reared
                     upon the banks of this lake, and that as I looked upon its pure clear water,
                     and upon the hills, the gentle slopes, the valleys and the streams that come to
                     it wandering away from the country, a crowd of sad, but pleasant memories come
                     clustering around my heart. It is not now as it was then. Everything is
                     changed. The old forests are gone, the tall pines, the majestic oaks, the
                     maples, the sycamores, the gigantic elms, the lofty lindens, the wild cherry
                     and the butternut trees, old primeval things all, are gone. Let me describe it
                     to you as my memory paints it, before civilization had robbed it of its ancient
                     beauty, as it lay here in the midst of the wilderness, sleeping alone. Let us
                     look upon it as it was years and years ago, when I was a boy. We will talk with
                     the old settlers, the pioneers that first made war upon the forests that stood
                     in primitive solitude about it. They were the vanguard of civilization,<pb
                        n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6610-00000127"/> and changed by their labor that
                     great wilderness into fruitful fields. True, they have all passed away, dropped
                     into honored graves, but we will call their spirits around us, and they will
                     tell us of the times of old, of the scenes of the early settlements, of their
                     struggles and hardships. They can tell us many a story connected with this lake
                     that has lain here so long unappreciated and unhonored. We will not look upon
                     the beautiful farms, the villages that now are found upon its shores. We will
                     people the fields with the old forest trees, and brush away the houses and
                     barns. We will take away the fences, and remove all these evidences of
                     civilization. Where the flocks and herds are feeding in rich pastures, we will
                     replace the deer and bear, and the other wild animals that roamed there before
                     the woodman's axe frightened them away, or the hunter's rifle doomed them to
                     destruction. We will do as I did more than thirty years ago, when there were
                     but few clearings along the shore, go a voyage around the lake in a canoe made
                     from the trunk of a gigantic pine. I earned my first five dollars by that
                     voyage. I was hired by two English gentlemen to row them round the lake. They
                     were kindhearted men, for when they saw, boy that I was, that I was weary, they
                     relieved me in turn from the oars. We were four days in making the circuit of
                     the lake, but the guinea they paid me made me richer than I have ever been
                     since.</p>
                  <p>At the northwest corner of the lake was a beauti ful little bay, stretching
                     landward some five or six rods by two or three in width. Above it the branches
                     of tall oaks and elms were interwined, and the wild grapes that crept up their
                     great trunks, spread their net-work all over the tops of the trees, and made
                     with their broad leaves an arbor through the arches of which the sun never
                     shone. The water of this little bay was clear as crystal, and the white pebbles
                     on the bottom, some three or four feet down in the water, were as visible as
                     though nothing but air was above them. At the head of the bay, a cold spring
                     that came gushing up at a few rods distant, entered. From this little bay I
                     have caught, first and last, hundreds of speckled trout weighing from half of a
                     pound to three or four times that weight. But it is all filled up now—stores
                     and shops, and a street, and docks, and a great high wall occupy the place of
                     that little bay, and those old elms and oaks, and that spring, have all
                     disappeared. I killed my first deer as he stooped his head to drink of the
                     water of that little bay. I had watched him from my hiding-place for an hour,
                     as he came browsing along the side of the hill. Just as the sun was going down,
                     he stepped from the thick bushes on to the pebbly beach, and after looking all
                     around him, and snuffing the air, he stepped confidently into the water to
                     slake his thirst. My rifle was upon him, the ball that sped from it penetrated
                     his brain, and he fell dead. Further south, stood a tall sycamore, the roots of
                     which were laved<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6610-00000128"/> by the water; upon
                     the dead branches, near the top of which, was a favorite perch for the
                     fish-hawk, as he watched for his prey. Occasionally a bald eagle would alight
                     there to plume himself, and watch for the wild ducks that frequented the lake.
                     Further south still, were a few acres of low marshy ground, where the main
                     inlet entered, where the musk-rats built their houses, and the mink and the
                     otter stole along the margin in pursuit of prey. The inlet took its rise some
                     seven or eight miles up the valley, in a multitude of large springs, and it was
                     full of the speckled trout. Let us pause here, and call up some of the old
                     settlers, whose farms extended from this "big creek," as it was called, which
                     flowed along through the centre of the valley, back to the hills. Judge BAKER,
                     I believe, was the first white man who stuck his stake in that valley, and
                     commenced the war against the ancient forests, that has been carried on ever
                     since with such relentless vigor. His farm is now in possession of his son, and
                     a most beautiful one it is—rich in all that belongs to agriculture, and
                     cultivated to a charm.</p>
                  <p>JUDGE BAKER was a most remarkable man, strong in physical strength, one
                     calculated to endure the hardships of a new country, but stronger still in
                     native, vigorous, common sense. I remember him well. In his latter years, when
                     his early industry had relieved him from the necessity to labor, he was a
                     reading man, and was always a thoughtful one. He was the first who explored
                     that region with a view to settling there. He came from Pennsylvania up the
                     valley of the Conhocton, and reaching the place where the village of Bath now
                     stands, struck off through the valley towards the head of this lake. The forest
                     around the lake was exceedingly dense, and before reaching it he climbed into a
                     high tree, to take a look about him. He was not aware of its proximity, and
                     when he had reached the topmost branches of the tree, there it lay within fifty
                     rods of him, its waters calm and still, unruffled by a wave or a ripple. Two
                     Indians were paddling their canoe along the shore, going down the lake, while
                     several deer were feeding among the grass and water lilies that grew about the
                     mouth of the inlet. I have listened often and often to the old man's
                     description of this beautiful sheet of water, as he then saw it for the first
                     time. How he descended from his perch on the tall old elm, and worked his way
                     to the pebbly beach, and how calm and still it was, how the tall forest trees
                     cast their shadows out over the water as the sun was sinking in the west. How
                     solemn and moveless the hills stood around. How the trout leaped in their
                     gleesomeness from the surface, and schools of the yellow perch made the water
                     boil in spots around. How he shot a deer that was feeding along the margin; how
                     gently but gloomily the night shadows gathered around him; how the fireflies
                     flashed their little torches in the darkness<pb n="252-253"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000129"/> ness; how he slept on his bed of boughs, in a
                     brush shanty built by himself; how gloriously the sun came up in the morning
                     over the eastern hills, casting his brightness on the rippling waters, and
                     making them glisten in the sunlight, like a sheet of fire. I remember, as I
                     heard him describe the scene, how I thought I should like to have been with him
                     on his exploring tour that time, and looked upon the lake as it lay there all
                     alone, surrounded only by those old forests, and navigated only by the wild men
                     of the woods. It would have been a thing to remember always.</p>
                  <p>My father came there some years later, but while the lake was still surrounded
                     almost entirely by woods. True, there were at long intervals clearings along
                     the shore. But its primitive wildness was gone. Civilization began to develop
                     itself there as long ago as I can remember, and I could only watch its progress
                     as it moved forward.</p>
                  <p>My father had become security for a friend in the loan of money, and to
                     indemnify himself from loss, had taken a mortgage upon a negro, (slavery
                     existed then in this State.) The debt fell upon my father, and he became the
                     owner of a man. Old Shadrach was a Virginian by nature, but an African by
                     birth, having been imported in his infancy. He had a mortal fear of snakes and
                     toads, and he could be frightened into anything by the threat of putting a
                     snake or a toad in his bed. I call him old, because he was between forty and
                     fifty at my earliest recollection, and of course became older before he died.
                     Old Shadrach ran away regularly two or three times a year. He would stay away
                     sometimes a fortnight, sometimes a month, and on two or three occasions so long
                     that my father began to congratulate himself upon being rid of him entirely.
                     But some morning old Shadrach would come crawling out from the hay mow, and
                     promise "massa" that he would never run away again as long as he lived.
                     Shadrach, as I said, stood in mortal fear of snakes. He was one day fishing in
                     a canoe on the lake, and drew up what he took to be a rattlesnake. He dropped
                     his pole in horror and leaped overboard, yelling and screaming for help as if a
                     thousand Indians were scalping him. He could swim like a duck, and he struck
                     out, screaming in horror at every pull. Upon reaching the shore he broke like a
                     quarter-horse for the house. My father, who was at a short distance, hurried
                     up, to know the reason of the outcry. "Massa," cried Shadrach in all the
                     earnestness of terror, "de lake is full of rattlesnakes." "Get out, you
                     woolly-pated rhinoceros," replied my father, "who ever heard of rattlesnakes in
                     the water?" My father went out in another canoe to the one in which Shadrach
                     had been fishing, and upon securing the pole, which was floating about, found
                     that Shadrach had hooked a great eel, a fish by no means common in the lake.
                     But Shadrach regarding it as belonging to the family of<pb n="254-255"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000130"/> snakes, never trusted himself alone after that
                     on the water.</p>
                  <p>Let us pass along down on the eastern shore, close along under the hill. The
                     land is rugged here, the hill rising in steep acclivity several hundred feet.
                     It is early morning. See how the sunlight first rests upon the hills on the
                     western side of the lake. Remember it is all woods there; see the shadow
                     retreating in a long line down the side of the hill; see, it has reached the
                     water. It is ten o'clock, and we are still in the shade. We are five miles from
                     the head of the lake, in a beautiful little bay under the lee of "Welles'
                     Point." The clearing that we see, is that of Dr. Welles, the father of the Hon.
                     Henry Welles, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court. Dr. Welles was one of the
                     pioneers of the region along the lake. He was a man of energy and learning, and
                     of infinite usefulness in the early settlement of the country. This is the only
                     clearing in sight, save that from which we started. (We are speaking of times
                     "long ago.") His log house stands back from the bay in which our canoe is
                     floating. I have, when a child, accompanied my father and mother on a visit to
                     Dr. Welles—not in a carriage, along a pleasant road skirted by green fields,
                     but in a canoe or skiff; my mother seated in the stern with a trolling line in
                     her hand, with the hook a hundred feet or more behind her; myself seated in the
                     bow and my father rowing ing. I have travelled that way more than once,
                     listening to the songs that my father and mother sang as we sailed along, and
                     have seen her draw in many a trout on the way. Good old times those, when the
                     men in that region "chopped down and chopped up" acres and acres of woods; when
                     they "sheared their own fleece and wore it." Let us rest in this little bay and
                     talk of the times of old, when everything was wild and natural, before
                     steamboats came ploughing their way through these waters, or the scream of the
                     steam-whistle was heard.</p>
                  <p>Dr. WELLES was the first settler within miles of this locality. He came from
                     Columbia county, in the summer of 17—, cleared a few acres, and put up a log
                     house, and the next summer brought his family to reside here. Boards were
                     scarce in those days. When he built his house he had enough for the roof and
                     the floors, but not for the doors. When his family took possession, they hung
                     blankets at the opening for doors, and the family for several nights slept on
                     beds made up on the floor. The Doctor brought with him a negro slave, who
                     rejoiced in the distinguished cognomen of Scipio Africanus, which by such
                     liberties as white people take with the names of colored persons, was stripped
                     of its euphony, and reduced to simple Sip. Old Sip, with the rest, had his bed
                     in a corner. One morning it was discovered that his face was paler, and his
                     hair straighter than common, his great white<pb n="256-257"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000131"/> eyes had a bolder prominence. His hand trembled
                     like that of a man who had indulged in a debauch over night, and his words were
                     tremulous and incoherent. Something was evidently wrong with Sip. Nobody knew
                     of his having been sick; he had made no complaint, he had uttered no groan, he
                     had lain abed after the others were stirring, with the blanket drawn partly
                     over his head, leaving only his great eyes glistening the more brightly in
                     contrast with the ebony of his skin. The Doctor roused him from his bed, got
                     him up on end, questioned and cross-questioned him, but could get nothing
                     coherent from him, and it was not till a strong application of old Jamaica,
                     that Sip's recollection came back, and enabled him to tell his story. He was
                     laying awake long after the others had gone to sleep, when, as he affirmed, a
                     great black animal pushed aside the blanket that hung in the place of a door,
                     and walked around to the beds that were ranged on the floor, paused a moment at
                     Sip's bed, and then walked leisurely out. There were two things confirmatory of
                     Sip's story. First, he was frightened by something as near out of his wits as
                     it was possible for a human being to be; and secondly, there was found on the
                     boards of the floor several tracks resembling those made by a bear, when his
                     foot is wet with dew, and the bottom of it covered with earth. Whatever the
                     truth of the matter may have been, the Doctor believed the assertion of Sip,
                     and the collateral evidence of the tracks, and always supposed that a bear had
                     invaded the privacy of his dwelling that night. This anecdote I had from Judge
                     WELLES, who is not a man to indulge in fictions.</p>
                  <p>It was a common thing for the deer to swim the lake in the summer time, and
                     many were taken by the Doctor's family by pursuing them with a canoe in the
                     water. On one occasion, a deer, as was supposed, was seen swimming across the
                     lake, from the west, towards the eastern shore, and a daughter of the Doctor,
                     who subsequently was the wife, and is now the widow of the late General GEO.
                     McCLURE, together with Sip, put out in a canoe in pursuit. Away off in the
                     forest, among the new settlements, young ladies are more courageous than they
                     are in the cities, and come to understand woodcraft, and love the wild sports
                     of the forest and lake almost as well as their brothers do. I have seen those
                     who could fire a rifle with the precision of a marksman, who could row a skiff
                     or paddle a canoe with the best, who were successful anglers for the speckled
                     trout, and could take the salmon trout with a trolling line on the lake. And
                     yet, they lacked nothing of the natural refinement and innate modesty that
                     belong to the true woman. I said the daughter of Doctor Welles and Sip started
                     in pursuit of the deer that was swimming the lake. He swam but slowly, and they
                     easily overtook him. The young lady was in the stern of the canoe, and Sip was
                     in the bow. As they approached the game, Sip's eyes<pb n="258-259"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000132"/> began to open with astonishment. "Golla,
                     Missus," he cried, "dat deer am black—my! he ain't got no horns, he ain't got
                     no long ears, nudder." As they approached nearer, Sip's paddle was suspended,
                     and his teeth began to chatter—"Dat no deer, dat de debil," he shouted, as he
                     tumbled over in the bottom of the canoe in utter affright. But whatever it was,
                     the canoe was close upon it, and then it turned to give battle. It was a huge
                     bear, and such a set of ivory as it showed was a sight to see. In the
                     astonishment of the moment, the canoe had floated within reach of the now
                     furious animal, and he threw his great paw up on the bow. "Let go dat," cried
                     Sip, as, with a last effort of despair, he struck a furious blow with his
                     paddle. The bear caught the oar with his paw, and hurled it to a distance in
                     the water, but his hold of the canoe was loosed, and by a skilful movement, the
                     young lady sent it beyond his reach. A spare paddle was in the canoe, and the
                     way Sip and she pulled for the shore, was astonishing. They arrived in time for
                     the Doctor to return with his gun and axe, and dispatch the animal before he
                     reached the shore. See those stately old elms on the point, how they tower up
                     towards the sky, stretching abroad their leafy arms in dalliance with the
                     summer winds, and casting their morning shadows away out on the water. They
                     grew there from the seed planted by the hand of nature, and where they stand
                     others as gigantic have grown, till weakened by decay or riven by the
                     lightning, the storm hurled them to the ground, to rot where they fell. In the
                     times of old the deer crouched in the heat of noon in their shade. The elk may
                     have browsed upon the tender plants beneath them, or the bear clambered up
                     their great trunks. But they are gone now, and the willow, and smaller
                     shrubbery planted by the hand of man, occupy their place. Strange that those
                     stately old elms should have been removed to give place to trees of a lower
                     dignity, and a meaner growth. Strange that when civilization sweeps away the
                     old forests, it does not leave more of the ancient monarchs of the woods
                     standing where they grew, as memorials of its triumphs over nature, and as
                     witnesses of the achievements of human strength and labor.</p>
                  <p>Let us pass on down the lake. I must remind you that we have swept away these
                     fields, and houses, and barns. We have restored the forest in its primitive
                     grandeur. We have banished the horses, and cattle, and sheep, and have called
                     back the wild animals that belonged here in the times of old. Five miles below
                     "Welles' Point" we enter another little bay or cove, formed by a point of land
                     running far out into the lake. I was here more than thirty years ago. It was
                     all wild then, all woods. There was neither farm-house nor clearing in sight.
                     On the voyage round the lake with the two Englishmen, as before mentioned, we
                     rowed silently round this point, and saw a noble<pb n="260-261"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000133"/> deer swimming out from the shore, as if starting
                     across the lake. He had antlers like a stag, and when we came in sight, he
                     wheeled towards the shore with the snort of a war-horse. The Englishmen had a
                     rifle along, and as he was almost at the shore, one of them fired upon and
                     killed him. He was a noble animal. We dined upon venison that day, and a more
                     delicious meal I have never tasted, though it was cooked in a primitive way, by
                     a fire built on the shore of the lake. From this little bay let us cross over
                     to Bluff Point. We are opposite to it now. See how it looms up towards the sky,
                     covered with a dense forest. The top of that hill is the highest land in sight,
                     by hundreds of feet. It is no mountain peak, piercing, in stately barrenness,
                     the heavens, but a rounded promontory, rising on three sides from the water,
                     and seems to us, as we look upon it, like a great island in the midst of the
                     lake. It seems close by us, and yet to reach its base we must row a mile and a
                     half. See how the "West Branch" winds around, and seems to hide away behind and
                     among the hills. Look away off towards Penn Yan. There, too, the lake seems to
                     steal around behind high promontories, to lose itself in the forest of great
                     trees. It was a beautiful view from this point "long ago," and it is beautiful
                     still. Then it was romantic and wild, as nature made it, with all the old
                     things standing round, as she placed them when she threw this earth finished
                     from her hands. Now it is robbed of its ancient dress, and decorated by the
                     ingenuity, the labor, and the industry of man. Fields are where forests stood,
                     and the things that civilization gathers around it, make up the landscape.
                     Which is the more beautiful, I leave others to determine. For myself, I love
                     nature in her old primitive garments, and I love civilization with her smiling,
                     though painted face. I love the old woods, and I love the fields. I love the
                     wild things, and I love the tame things too. All I bargain for is to leave me
                     the birds, the happy, the free, the sweet-voiced birds. You may sweep away the
                     forests. It is best that they should be removed. It is necessary for the
                     progress, and to meet the necessities of humanity. Launch your steam boats upon
                     lake and river, and send forth your iron horse, thundering along the valleys,
                     spread out your farms, push back the woods with the fields, build your cities
                     and towns, destroy the deer and the wild animals that must perish with the
                     forests, but leave me the birds, the happy singing-birds, and I am content.</p>
                  <p>We will now row westward, around the base of Bluff Point, six miles to the head
                     of the West Branch. On both sides of the branch the hills rise with greater or
                     less acclivity, but nowhere so steep as to prevent cultivation. At the head of
                     the branch is a beautiful valley stretching away to the northwest, through the
                     centre of which winds a small stream alive with the speckled trout. Pines,<pb
                        n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6610-00000134"/> and elms, and oaks, with the wild
                     cherry, butternut and maple trees, constitute the principal growth of timber.
                     Remember we are speaking still of "long, long ago." There is a neat village
                     here now surrounded by rich farms. It was all forest when I passed a night on
                     the banks here on my first voyage round the lake. We will pass along south
                     again on our return to the head of the lake. The hill on the west side of the
                     lake and the rising grounds for miles were covered with a forest of pines.
                     Highgrowing stately trees, like the masts of a tall ship. No axe had as yet
                     marred their beauty, and they stood here clothed in fadeless green, and
                     murmuring softly and solemnly as the breeze stirred in their foliage. This
                     forest of pines has been swept away, and you see fields of grain and pastures,
                     and meadows where they stood.</p>
                  <p>We pass along to Ingersoll's Point, three miles from the head of the lake. We
                     will land here, and see how this point of land was formed. We go a few rods on
                     the main land, and we enter a ravine or gulf as it is called. The hill-side is
                     steep, but we walk on a level, straight into the hill. A little stream goes
                     laughing along over the smooth stones. It is tranquil and pleasant now,
                     good-humored and gay; but when the snows are melting and the spring freshets
                     come, it is a mad and a mighty torrent, roaring and foaming down the gorge,
                     vast in volume and resistless in power. The rocks begin to rise on either hand
                     higher and higher, and as we advance a perpendicular wall of slate rock rises
                     on either side to the height of a hundred feet. Before us now the little stream
                     trickles with a gentle voice down the shelving rocks, from away up towards the
                     top of the hill, leaping from ledge to ledge. Our progress is stayed here,
                     unless we choose to climb where a false step or a slip on the smooth rock would
                     send us skiving in the gulf below. It is a goodly sight when the "stream is
                     up," to see how it cascades down from the plain above into the gorge below,
                     rushing, and tumbling, and roaring in white foam over the beetling rocks.
                     "Ingersoll's Point," and the acres of flat land stretching out into the lake,
                     were made by the earth excavated from the hillside by the stream when its back
                     was up.</p>
                  <p>Captain GREIG is in his element to-day. He has a pic-nic party on board from
                     Penn Yan, and they dine here on "Ingersoll's Point." He has a company of a
                     hundred "fair women and brave men," married and single, all cheerful and happy.
                     They have a band on board, and quadrilles, and waltzes, and polkas occupy the
                     young people, while the elders look on, and like myself, think of the times
                     when they were young, when they "went out a gypseying," and were merry in the
                     dance. The dinner was spread on "the point," under the shadows of the brave old
                     elms and on the green grass beneath their spreading branches. Towards evening
                     all were on board again, and the steamer started out on<pb n="264-265"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000135"/> her return voyage. As the sun went down we swept
                     across the head of the lake, in view of the pleasant village of Hammondsport,
                     and then headed away for Penn Yan. The darkness came down calmly and stilly.
                     The winds were hushed, not a ripple was on the water save the long wake in the
                     rear of the boat. It was a pleasant thing to hear the echoes that came back
                     from the hills, returning with a mellow harmony the music of the band; and it
                     was pleasanter still to look upon the happy faces of the young people as they
                     glided about in the mazes of the dance, or chatted in the fulness of their
                     glee. That was an evening to be remembered, the return of that party from their
                     pic-nic on "Ingersoll's Point."</p>
                  <p>I bid good-bye to the Crooked Lake with regret. I could linger here for months,
                     busy with old memories and scenes of the "long, long ago"—scenes that like our
                     youth belong to the returnless past, to be recalled only in fancy, that can
                     come back to us only in dreams of the night.</p>
                  <p>I am at Bath, the county seat of Steuben. This is another beautiful village,
                     nestling quietly among the hills of the Southern tier. It was among the early
                     settlements of what was once called the Western Country. It was located by
                     CHARLES WILLIAMSON, the first proprietor of several millions of acres, known as
                     the Pultney estate. A pleasant farm that—one that might afford an industrious
                     man, who exercised a proper degree of economy, a good living, and enable him to
                     portion off with a fair number of acres a reasonably large family of children.
                     It was not so valuable when Sir WILLIAM PULTNEY became the proprietor as it is
                     now, as it passed into his hands, as I have heard, for something like a
                     shilling an acre.</p>
                  <p>Bath is a pleasant and a thriving village, remarkable for its neatness and
                     healthful location. On the East is a high mountain, rising in steep acclivity
                     some eight or nine hundred feet, whose rugged sides can never be cultivated,
                     and along whose base the Conhocton river flows. In the early times, before the
                     Erie Canal was built, Bath was the outlet to market for the grain of a broad
                     sweep of country. It was regarded as the head of navigation, and was to be the
                     site of a great city. You will not of course suppose that great ships visited
                     its port, or even the periogues, formerly so common on the waters of the great
                     West. There was but one direction to navigation from Bath, and that was down
                     stream. Arks were built of pine planks, which would carry some thousand or
                     fifteen hundred bushels. They were queer-shaped craft, not very well calculated
                     to stand a rough sea, but they were made water-tight, and cost from $75 to $100
                     each. These were floated to the storehouses that stood down by the river,
                        and<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6610-00000136"/> when the spring freshets
                     came, the grain was turned into them in bulk, and covered from the rain; with a
                     pilot, and a hand at each long oar that projected away out at bow and stern,
                     started with their freight on a returnless voyage towards the Chesapeake Bay.
                     Their course was down the Conhocton to the Chemung river, down that river to
                     the Susquehanna, and down that noble river to tide water. These frail vessels
                     did not always reach their destination. About one out of ten emptied its
                     contents in the river as it was dashed against some unknown obstruction, or was
                     stranded on the shore through the unskilfulness of its pilot. Thousands upon
                     thousands of bushels of grain found their way to market through this precarious
                     channel, and Bath was looming up, when the canals were built and its glory
                     departed. The ark of the Conhocton passed into history, the rats took
                     possession of the storehouses, board after board fell from their sides, the
                     roofs caved in, the beams rotted away; at length what was left of them tumbled
                     to ruin, and the place where they stood is now a meadow where the mower swings
                     his scythe, unconscious that he treads on historical ground. The course of
                     trade from Bath for more than a quarter of a century, has been to the North,
                     through the Seneca and Crooked Lake, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals to
                     Montezuma, and then on the Erie Canal to the Hudson, and so to New York. It is
                     now changing again, not to the ancient channel of the river, but to the New
                     York and Erie Railroad, and so to New York by that great thoroughfare.</p>
                  <p>The mountains about Bath were famous, years ago, for deer, and I have spent
                     many an exciting hour in the chase after them. It was a pleasant thing to start
                     for the hills while the light was just breaking in the East, while a few stars
                     glimmered faintly in the sky, and the grayness of twilight lingered in the
                     valleys. To feel the grass crisp with frost beneath your footfall, and see the
                     mist rising from the river, and creeping up the sides of the hills. It was a
                     pleasant thing to stand on the brow of that high green hill over against the
                     village, just as the sun was coming up from his restingplace, and see how he
                     threw his early light on the tops of the hills on the east and west; to mark
                     how the shadow retreated from their sides down towards the valley, and when he
                     rose above the forest trees, how gloriously he started on his course. It was
                     pleasant to look upon the clustered houses away down below you, and watch how
                     the smoke came up from chimney after chimney, and went wreathing upward towards
                     the sky. It was a pleasant thing to look upon the farms, the fields, and watch
                     the flocks of sheep as they started from the fold, wending, in the early
                     morning, in a long line towards their pasture, and the cows gathering around
                     the place of their milching. It was a pleasant thing to look upon that little
                     lake, sleeping so quietly just<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6610-00000137"/> east
                     of the village, and afar off to the north the Crooked Lake, stretching away and
                     hiding itself among the highlands that surround it. All this I have looked upon
                     more than once, while a pair of noble stag hounds were crouched at my feet,
                     impatient for the chase. Turning from the pleasant landscape beneath me, I
                     would strike into the woods. The forest extended back unbroken for miles then,
                     and when I had passed a short distance from the brow of the hill, I would lay
                     on the dogs. Glad enough they would be for the freedom to hunt. Far off in the
                     woods, perhaps, the voice of the staunch old hound would be heard, deep and
                     long drawn out. After a moment it would be heard again. The interval between
                     his baying would become shorter and shorter, until the voice of both dogs would
                     break out in a fierce and continuous cry, and then I would know that the game
                     was up and away.</p>
                  <p>I need not tell you of the music there is in the voice of a pair of stag-hounds
                     in the deep forests of a still morning. How it echoes among the mountains, and
                     swells up from the valleys; how it comes like a bugle from the forest dells,
                     and glancing away upwards, seems to fill the whole air with its joyous notes.
                     Now the sound of the chase grows fainter and fainter, as it recedes, until it
                     is lost in the distance, and the low voice of the morning breeze, whispering
                     among the forest trees, alone is heard. Again faint and far off is heard the
                     music of the chase, swelling up, and then dying away, like the sound of a flute
                     in the distance, when the night air is still—clearer and more distinct it comes
                     as the dogs course over some distant ridge. Now it is loud and joyous, making
                     the woods vocal with the melody of voices. Again the music dies away as the
                     dogs plunge into some hollow way until it seems to come up like the faint voice
                     of an echo from some leafy dell. Again it swells louder and fiercer, as the
                     chase, changing its direction, sweeps up the valley towards you. Louder and
                     louder grows the music. You hear the measured bounds of the deer as he goes
                     crashing on his way to the river, fleeing from the destruction that is howling
                     on his trail. He passes beyond the range of your rifle, in his frightened
                     course, and the dogs rush by you, running breast high on his track, and your
                     Tally Ho! gives fresh impulse to their speed, and a fiercer and more joyous
                     strain to their music. You hear in the distance the sharp crack of a rifle,
                     that comes echoing up from the valley beneath you. In a few minutes the music
                     of the hounds is still, and you know that your friend stationed at the river
                     has secured his game.</p>
                  <p>The public buildings and the best residences of Bath are fronting its beautiful
                     square of some six or eight acres. In the centre of the square "long ago,"
                     stood a tall pine that for years was known as the "liberty tree." It was left
                     when the old forest was swept away, and stood there solitary and alone<pb
                        n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6610-00000138"/> for nearly a quarter of a century.
                     But it faded in seeming sorrow over the fate of its companions, that had been
                     so ruthlessly destroyed. Its green branches died, one after another, till a
                     bare trunk with leafless arms stretching out, as if in hopeless and barren
                     desolation, was all that was left of that once stately monarch of the woods. It
                     was at last hurled to the earth by the strong winds, and the place of the
                     "liberty tree" was vacant.</p>
                  <p>I studied law in this pleasant village, under one whom I can never cease to
                     respect. He resides here still, an honored, and justly honored citizen. A sore
                     affliction has recently jarred among his heartstrings. May the wound that was
                     inflicted be healed by the affectionate kindness of those that remain to
                     comfort him, and may he find consolation in the memories that come up from the
                     graves of the good, who pass away in the pride and strength of their early
                     manhood.</p>
                  <p>There are "solid men" in Bath, too, as well as in Canandaigua. Men who, by
                     their indomitable energy, have risen from comparative poverty to great wealth.
                     Who started in life with only strong hands and stout hearts, but who have
                     mastered fortune. Men who are still in the vigor, the strong time of life, and
                     who can reckon their dollars by hundreds of thousands. The old settlers, the
                     pioneers of Bath, are all gone. Many of them I knew "long ago." The tombstones
                     that stand in the quiet grave-yard, that record their virtues, bear no lying
                     epitaphs, nor lines of bitter irony respecting their worth.</p>
                  <p>I said I studied law in Bath. Let me relate an anecdote connected with the
                     first suit I ever had the honor of appearing in as counsel. My friend, H. W.
                     ROGERS, now of Buffalo, was my fellow-student then, and he will pardon me for
                     relating the triumphs of the genius of two young men who were seeking
                     distinction under some difficulties. A worthless scamp had been arrested for
                     some misdemeanor—assault and battery, I believe—and being too poor to employ
                     other counsel, applied to my friend ROGERS and myself to defend him, promising
                     to pay us a small fee for assisting him in his trouble.</p>
                  <p>We readily undertook his defence, promising ourselves no light harvest of
                     reputation from our first effort at forensic eloquence. A jury was summoned,
                     and three magistrates sat in solemn judgment to hear the evidence against our
                     unfortunate client. We had a day to prepare, and the speeches with which we
                     intended to astonish the court, and confound the jury, were profoundly studied
                     and reflected upon. Well, the evidence was closed, and, as was arranged
                     beforehand, I rose to address the jury, and my friend was to follow. I got as
                     far as "Gentlemen of the Jury," and there I stuck, like a pig in the fence. Not
                     another sentence of my great speech could I utter, to save me. At length, in
                     despair, I told the jury, "that as I was to be followed by my elder and abler
                     associate, I would occupy<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6610-00000139"/> cupy no
                     more of their time," and sat down in perfect confusion and shame. Friend Rogers
                     then rose to deliver his maiden speech. He, too, got as far as "Gentlemen of
                     the Jury," and there <emph>he</emph> stuck, as I had done before him. There was
                     no use in trying to go on. The great speech was gone, not a word of it could he
                     catch, not a sentence could he bring to mind. He was in a hopeless dilemma, but
                     he extricated himself by saying to the jury that "the case had been so ably
                     summed up by the counsel that had preceded him, that he felt it unnecessary to
                     add a word to the argument," and he sat down with the big drops standing on his
                     forehead. We were laughed at <emph>some,</emph> by those who gathered to hear
                     our maiden efforts. The best of the joke was, that friend HARRY was several
                     years in finding out that he had perpetrated a good thing at my expense.</p>
                  <p>There were formerly many excellent trout streams around Bath. Spalding's run,
                     Neal's creek, the Campbelltown creek, the Michigan creek, the Twelve-mile
                     creek, and Townsend's run, and many other pleasant streams that came down from
                     the hills were famous in their day: That was before sawmills and high dams, and
                     the other utilitarian devices of civilization poisoned the waters, or the
                     multitude of anglers had destroyed their speckled inhabitants. Just below Bath,
                     within a mile of the village, is Lake Salubria, a beautiful little sheet of
                     water of some two or three hundred acres. It has neither inlet nor outlet above
                     ground, but its waters are clear and pure. I was one of three or four that
                     "long ago" put a hundred or more brook trout that we caught in the Townsend run
                     with a net, alive into this lake. I remember the day well. We rigged a half
                     hogshead with water on a lumber wagon and started for the run. We waded around
                     in the water, and punching with long poles under the old logs and caverned
                     banks, and having secured over a hundred, started for home. The heavens
                     gathered blackness, and one of the severest storms I have ever known overtook
                     us. The lightning flashed and the thunders rolled through the heavens, and the
                     rain came rushing from the clouds in a deluge upon us. My Panama hat hung like
                     an elephant's ears about my shoulders, and my very boots were filled with the
                     drenching rain. We persevered, notwithstanding the storm, and got our hundred
                     trout, all alive and active, into Lake Salubria. They did not, however,
                     multiply as we hoped they would. For years one would hear occasionally of a
                     great trout being caught in the lake, till at last they were all gone. They
                     lacked the ripples and the running water. They lived to be old, and then died
                     without progeny, "making no sign."</p>
                  <p>I am at Hornellsville, where the Buffalo and New York Railroad forms a junction
                     with the<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6610-00000140"/> New York and Erie, in the
                     valley of the Canisteo. Steuben is my native county, and I am at home among its
                     high hills and beautiful valleys. Thirty years ago this town was a hamlet. A
                     store, a wood tavern, a dwelling house or two, made up the village, and a
                     solitary stage coach bore the only visitors, and constituted the only means of
                     conveyance to and from its sequestered location. In the winter an army of
                     lumbermen swarmed in the forests around, and the sound of the axe and the
                     crashing of the tall pines as they thundered to the ground, broke the frozen
                     silence of the woods. When the spring freshets came, the raftsmen started on
                     their long journey down towards the Susquehanna, and away to the broad
                     Chesapeake, and when they departed, Hornellsville was alone for the balance of
                     the season. But now it has its brick blocks, its long streets, its tall
                     steeples, its machine shops, its factories, and its mills, and the hum of
                     business and the clank of machinery is everywhere heard. Long trains of cars,
                     drawn by the iron horse, are rushing along almost hourly; the old stage-coach,
                     with its fat driver, is gone, and the sound of his horn will be heard there
                     never again. Broad farms are spread out in the valley, and the fields are
                     creeping up the sides of the hill. Blessings on the valley of the Canisteo;
                     blessings on the streams that come down from the mountains in which I have so
                     often, in days that are past, angled for the speckled trout. Blessings on the
                     pine-clad hills over which I have hunted the wild deer, and whose echoes I have
                     so often wakened by the thrilling music of my hounds. Those brave old hills are
                     here yet, covered with their summer foliage—defying by their steepness the
                     farmer's plough, and laughing at what here I call the desolation of
                     civilization. Fields may be green in the valleys, and flocks and herds may eat
                     lazily of the rich pastures, but the rugged sides of these hills will remain
                     unchanged. The tall pines may fall victims to the lumberman's axe, but the
                     sides of these hills as they rise in steep acclivity towards the sky, will
                     always, when the summer smiles, wear their garments of green in spite of human
                     progress, and the wasting of the beauties of natural scenery that marks its
                     career. Let me tell you a hunting anecdote. I was, many years ago, on a hunting
                     excursion with my old friend Andrew Helmer (as staunch a woodman as ever
                     "sighted a rifle") on the hills that skirt this beautiful valley. We were
                     driving the ridges, as it is termed. From the logway at the brow of the hill,
                     down which the pine logs were rolled, a timber road ran straight back, into
                     what was then a forest of many miles in extent. In this road we stationed
                     ourselves some sixty rods apart, but in plain sight of each other. There were
                     two runways for the deer, one of which was beyond him and which he was to
                     watch, and the other on the opposite side of me, which I was to take care of.
                     Having taken our positions, a boy<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6610-00000141"/>
                     was sent into the woods to lay on the dogs. In a short time we heard the cry of
                     the hounds—the game took a turn over a distant ridge—the hounds in hot
                     pursuit—and their music was a pleasant thing to hear in that calm autumnal
                     morning. In a short time the deer swept round the base of a hill, and instead
                     of taking to the usual runway, dashed forward between Helmer and myself. The
                     woods were thick, and we could only judge of his whereabouts, by his measured
                     bounds and the crash of the brush, as he sped in his terror from the cry that
                     was close behind him. I knew that he could be seen only as he crossed the
                     timber road, and what was done for his destruction must be done quickly. I
                     stepped into the middle of the narrow road, and raised my rifle to my shoulder.
                     As I did so, there stood Helmer with his rifle poised and pointed straight at
                     me, and it seemed to me that I could look into the barrel, away down to the
                     ball, which, if it should chance to miss the deer, would stand a smart chance
                     of hitting me. I knew Helmer too well to doubt of his taking the chances of
                     firing whether he hit me, or I hit him, or we both hit the deer. A large pine
                     stood invitingly close by the road—I lost no time in getting behind it, but as
                     the deer came crashing up to the road, I leaned out, and as he leaped across,
                     fired and dodged back. Helmer's rifle answered to mine like an echo, and the
                     deer fell in the edge of the brush, dead; but one ball struck him, and that I
                     claimed. Helmer claimed it as his, and though I never gave up the point, yet
                     truth compels me to admit there were two slight circumstances in his favor.

                  <head>II. NIAGARA—PORTAGE—WELLSVILLE—COUDERSPORT.</head>
                  <p>I AM here in sight of old Niagara, and within the sound of its thundering
                     voice. I have never before seen this exhibition of grandeur spread out here, to
                     humble the pride of man, and show forth the power and majesty of God. I look
                     for the first time upon this stupendous panorama, so full of all that is grand
                     and glorious, all that is beautiful and sublime. Here is the drainage of more
                     than 150,000 square miles of the great lakes, those inland seas that lay out
                     West and North, the hundred rivers and streams that come into them from the
                     hills and broad plains, and the thousand springs that bubble up away down in
                     their silent depths—all these "mighty waters" are concentrated into a narrow
                     gorge of less than half a mile in width, and, impelled by a resistless hand,
                     they go boiling and heaving, roaring and struggling, like some gigantic monster
                     in his wrath and agony, rushing forward in their matchless power, to plunge in
                     wild fury down beetling cliffs into the returnless depths below. The voice of
                     the cataract is never silent. In summer and winter, in the brightness of
                     noonday and the darkness of midnight, its roar is on the air. When the great
                     flood subsided, from the time when the dove brought back the olive branch, and
                     the raven went forth on his solitary and returnless flight—when the Ark rested
                     on Ararat, it was heard, shaking the earth with its roar; and the sound that
                     then startled the wilderness will be heard till the crack of doom—that mighty
                     flood will roll on, over the shelving rocks and down the stupendous precipice,
                     till the time appointed for the earth's destruction shall come. I have stood on
                     the brow of that precipice, and looked upon the rushing waters as they were
                     hurled into the deep abyss; I have stood at its base, and looked upward at the
                     beetling cliffs, and seen that flood as it seemed to me rushing in appalling
                     grandeur from the sky—around me was the mist and the spray, and arching above
                     me was the rainbow, glowing in prismatic brightness, like that which spans the
                     rear of the retiring storm. I have looked upon the cataract in the calmness of
                     a clear night, and seen the stars as they stole out one after another from the
                     deep vault of the sky, as if to watch its eternal flow. The voices that
                     elsewhere break the stillness of nocturnal repose are here forever silent, as
                     if awed by the sublimity of its power. But one sound is heard, deep, solemn,
                     and ceaseless—never changing, never losing its intensity. When the storm rages,
                     it is heard<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6610-00000143"/> above the storm. When
                     the winds rave and the tornado sweeps by, it is heard above the winds, and the
                     wild fury of the tornado. 'Tis the voice of the Cataract!</p>
                  <p>But who shall describe Niagara? Let it flow on in its majesty, till man shall
                     conquer its fury, and make it subservient to his will; till he shall "lay his
                     hand upon its mane" and tame it into subjection; till human genius shall chain
                     it to the great water-wheel, and make it a motor to endless machinery—grind
                     corn to satisfy human hunger, and throw the shuttle and spin. Unless some new
                     discovery shall render valueless water-falls as motors, even Niagara will, in
                     the course of human progress, one day be compelled to become utilitarian, and
                     perform an active part in the great drama of life.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing in regard to Niagara that strikes. It can have no rival.
                     Saratoga may become antiquated—the sea-shore a resort only for invalids.
                     Fashions may change in regard to pleasure resorts. Rival locations may compete
                     by opposing attractions. But Niagara can have no rival. The flood will sweep on
                     over the precipice, the waters will boil and foam, they will struggle and heave
                     down the rapids, rushing on forever, and the roar of the cataract will be there
                     through all time. Its deep, thundering voice of power, will be heard in its
                     solemn intensity; its ceaseless sermon of the majesty, the omnipotence of God,
                     will be preached while the waters flow, and stupendous precipices confine them
                     within the changeless gorge. In all the world there is but one Niagara, and all
                     the world will visit the mighty show. You may build up a city there, you may
                     make long streets, and line them with houses, and crowd them with people; you
                     may rob it of its wild scenery, and strip it of the things that nature spread
                     out all around it, you may construct canals and erect machinery, but still the
                     great cataract will be there, and the world will travel hundreds and thousands
                     of miles to see it. They will go to the brow of the precipice to look down, and
                     to the base of the precipice to look up. They will involve themselves in the
                     mist and the spray for the sake of gazing upon the rainbow that is above them.
                     They will ramble on Goat Island by moonlight listening to the roar of the
                     waters, or enjoy its cool and pleasant shades at noon-day. You may roll your
                     great water-wheels in their ceaseless rounds; you may harness your machinery
                     and set your great hammers in motion; your hundred strong hands may hurl the
                     ponderous sledge against the ringing anvil; you may set your ten thousand puny
                     machinists at pounding the iron and driving the spikes, make all the noise you
                     can, and the roar of the cataract will drown it all.</p>
                  <p>I am at Portage, and a wild place it is too—Niagara in minature. I am standing
                     on the high<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6610-00000144"/> bridge. A train of cars
                     has just rushed by me away up in the sky, higher than the top of the tallest
                     forest tree, two hundred and fifty feet above the surface of the water below.
                     Think of a train of cars thundering through the air, higher than the
                     weathercock on the loftiest steeple, hurled forward at a speed of forty miles
                     to the hour. It passes within six feet of me, there is a blast of wind, a
                     rushing, roaring sound, and the train is gone—it vanishes around a point of the
                     forest, and while I stand in mute astonishment, the snort of the iron horse is
                     heard miles away. But the bridge remains firm; there is no swaying or yielding;
                     a slight tremor, and the deep rumble, is all that tells you you are not on the
                     solid ground. The genius of man has conquered the "great gulf" that intervened
                     between the perpendicular precipices, and you pass in security over the mighty
                     chasm, as on a level plain. Just below the bridge, the river leaps down a
                     precipice of sixty feet. Further down, but in sight, it leaps down again some
                     eighty feet; and lower still, it plunges again down a precipice of the same
                     depth. You will remember that the surface above these falls is level. You look
                     down from the bridge, and your companion in the gorge below looks like a boy,
                     and you wonder why the lady that is on his arm is not in pantaletts and kilts;
                     that a child so small should dress like a woman, and carry a parasol, surprises
                     you. Pass down to the lower falls, take your stand by a dwarfed cedar that
                     grows out from the rocks and shoots upward, and look over the cliff into the
                     fearful depths below. You are nearly five hundred feet above the level of the
                     water, and there is nothing but air between you and the boiling stream. You can
                     plunge down from that dizzy height, if you will, and rest in quiet beneath the
                     wave. There will a voice whisper in your ear to take the fearful leap. Beware
                     of the tempter and stand back, for there's a fascination in the whirling
                     waters, and your brain may yield to its power. <q>

                  <p>I am at Wellsville, a village in Allegany county, on the Erie Railroad, and on
                     the borders of the State of New York. It is situated on the Genesee river,
                     which here is a comparatively small stream. It is the lumber depôt for a broad
                     sweep of country. Boards and plank are piled up here in vast quantities,
                     waiting transportation to the east, and long<pb n="284-285"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000145"/> lines of teams are drawing more from the country
                     beyond. I counted twelve loaded wagons pass the door of the public house where
                     I am stopping, within half an hour. I have been here, too, years since, when
                     there was not an acre cleared for miles below this, towards the north; when it
                     was all wilderness from a few miles south of Angelica, away to the southern and
                     eastern slope of this portion of the Allegany mountains. I once came with a
                     party of fishermen, among whom was SAMME FITZHUGH, Esq., of Livingston county,
                     a man known for many years through all the Genesee country, for his social
                     qualities, and his skill and science as a sportsman. He has gone to his rest
                     now. We left Angelica on the occasion spoken of, and went up the Genesee to
                     where Philipsburgh now stands. There was a dam there which had been constructed
                     years before, in connection with which a mill and fulling mill had been built;
                     but the mill had been burned down, and the place deserted. There was no one
                     living within several miles of it. We followed the river for some three or four
                     miles above where Wellsville now stands, and then camped down for the night. In
                     the morning we started down the stream again; our object was in part to examine
                     the timber land, which one of our party had bought, or was about buying, and in
                     part to have a good time with the trout in the river. It was no trick, then, to
                     take trout in the Genesee river weighing from a quarter of a pound to a pound
                     and a half, beautiful yellow-finned finned fellows. The country was wild enough
                     then; I have never seen it since until now, and can hardly believe, as I look
                     upon it, that it is the same locality that I saw then, covered with gigantic
                     pine trees, and away beyond civilization. I have been wondering, as I heard the
                     cars passing, what we would have thought, as we lay in our blankets, sleeping
                     on boughs that night that we "camped out," away off here in the woods "long
                     ago," had we heard the scream of the steam-whistle, and the roar of a train of
                     cars coming thundering along the gorges of the mountains, as they now do,
                     startling the sleeping echoes, and chasing slumber from our eyes. I've a notion
                     we should have stared <emph>some.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am at Coudersport, the county seat of Potter county, in the State of
                     Pennsylvania. I have crossed the high ridge that separates the waters of the
                     Genesee from those of the Allegany. This is a sequestered little place,
                     nestling among the hills, on one of the remote branches of the Allegany. The
                     people here have a semi-weekly mail, and some of them take a weekly paper, but
                     not many. They are engaged in building a very large court-house for so small a
                     place, and upon inquiry I find it is built mainly by taxes levied upon the
                     immense tracts of non-resident lands of the county. I say mainly by such taxes,
                     because, although the tax purports to be<pb n="286-287"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000146"/> general and equal upon all lands according to
                     their value, yet a shrewd assessor, who knows the resident from the
                     non-resident owners, can so discriminate as to lay the burden upon the
                     shoulders of those who own immense tracts and live at a distance. This, it
                     strikes me, is no bad way of providing means to erect good public buildings,
                     without burdening, to a very serious extent, those who are encountering the
                     difficulties incident to the settlement of a new country.</p>
                  <p>We leave Coudersport <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for the
                     Sinnemahoning, a river that has its source in the same range of highlands with
                     the Genesee and the Allegany. This ought, "upon principle," to be the highest
                     land east of the Mississippi. It can be proved to be so by a very simple, and
                     apparently conclusive course of argument. The Genesee river rises here, and
                     flows off north to Lake Ontario, and so through the noble St. Lawrence to the
                     ocean. The Allegany flows west and south, and is the remotest eastern and
                     northern branch of the Ohio, that finds its way to the ocean by the Gulf of
                     Mexico, while the Sinnemahoning reaches "the great deep" through the Chesapeake
                     Bay. But high as this region is—and it is high enough and cold enough for all
                     practical purposes—it is by no means the highest region of the Alleganies.</p>

                  <p>I AM on the Champlain, in the steamer <hi rend="i"/>America. She is a staunch
                     and beautiful boat, under the command of Captains Flagg and Mayo, two as
                     intelligent and gentlemanly commanders as can be found on the American
                     waters—men who understand their business thoroughly, and whose attention and
                     politeness to their passengers are worthy of all imitation. This steamer is a
                     most staunch one, furnished with great elegance and care, and she goes
                     ploughing on her way with a steadiness and speed rarely equalled. I write this
                     in a state-room, while the boat is in motion, and you may judge of the quiet
                     way in which we move along.</p>
                  <p>I have been for hours on the deck of the boat, watching by the moonlight the
                     changing scenery along the shore. On the one hand are the mountains of Essex
                     looming up dark and shadowy, their<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6610-00000147"/>
                     bare heads glistening in the moonlight, and the forests along their base and up
                     their rugged sides resting in sombre blackness like a shroud, save where here
                     and there some bluff and bare rock shines out midway up the mountain. Away off
                     on the right are the Green Mountains, standing out in bold relief against the
                     sky, upon which the starry covering appears to rest, or behind which it seems
                     to hide itself. Away off in front of the vessel are islands, seeming with their
                     green trees like gigantic war vessels floating darkly on the Lake. While behind
                     is a long stream of light, where the moon-beams are thrown back by the
                     agitation of the waters. By the way, why is it that nobody praises Champlain?
                     Why have tourists neglected to chronicle the charming scenery around it? To my
                     notion, it is one of the most beautiful sheets of water in the world.</p>
                  <p>There are a thousand romantic bays, that steal landward around jutting
                     promontories, lying in the deep shadow-like entrances to immense caverns; a
                     hundred beautiful islands; green fields stretching away to the base of the
                     hills, tall precipices rising in ragged and beetling cliffs right up from the
                     deep waters, upon the tops of which stand old primeval trees, like sentinels
                     upon the battlements of some ancient castle. As we ploughed along in view of
                     Ticonderoga and Crown Point, the chimneys of the ruined fortifications stood up
                     in solemn stillness, while Mount Defiance, on the top of which Burgoyne goyne
                     planted his cannon, looked grimly down upon the desolation and decay beneath
                     it. Did you ever try to call up the ghosts of the dead men whose names history
                     has linked to the ruins upon which you may be looking, and locating them in
                     imagination, as history locates them—make them do again the deeds that gave
                     them immortality? While I sat on the deck of the steamer as we passed the ruins
                     on these points, I saw in imagination the little army of Ethan Allen, emerging
                     from the forest on the Vermont side of the Lake; I saw them crossing the narrow
                     channel from point to point; not a word was spoken, not an oar splashed in the
                     water, not a sound disturbed the stillness. I saw their muskets lowered, lest
                     the sheen of the moonlight from their bright barrels or from their bayonets,
                     might attract the notice of their enemies. I saw them as they landed
                     noiselessly upon the beach and formed into columns for attack. I looked away to
                     the fort. The ruins were gone. The fortification stood there in its strength. I
                     saw the cannon as they were ranged along the top of the walls looking
                     threateningly over the waters. I saw the sentinels as they marched back and
                     forth, unsuspicious of danger. I read their thoughts as they tramped their
                     lonely rounds. Their hearts were away across the ocean to their homes in their
                     native land. Parents, brothers, sisters, perchance their little children were
                     about them, and I could see the tears gather in their eyes while memory was
                     bringing loved faces around them.<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6610-00000148"/>
                     Suddenly a tumult, a wild cry of alarm, a shout of triumph broke the stillness
                     of the night, as Allen and his sturdy followers came plunging over the walls
                     into the very heart of the fort. Resistance was in vain. The surprise was
                     complete, and with the firing of but four or five guns and the death of two
                     soldiers the stronghold of the English was lost and won. I saw the astonished
                     Briton when the surrender of his post was demanded in the name of the "Great
                     Jehovah and the Continental Congress." I saw him as he stood in his <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">deshabille</foreign> surrendering his sword to the
                     conquerors, and the stars and stripes as they were run up to float in the night
                     winds, and while the shout and hurrah of victory echoed among the mountains and
                     went floating over the Lake, the vision melted away. The dead men went back to
                     their graves, the ruins as they have stood for fifty years, battling with time,
                     resumed their solemn shape, and desolation and decay again came over the place
                     where brave men fought and bled and died.</p>
                  <p>I am at Burlington, the largest and most flourishing town in Vermont. It is not
                     a city. Vermont <emph>has</emph> but one city, and that of the smallest. This
                     is her only port. She lays away from the Ocean, inland, and the Champlain,
                     until recently, was her only outlet to the markets of the great cities. This is
                     a most beautiful town, situated on an elevated plain, overlooking the lake.
                     From the College green you look away over the water, on the one hand, and
                     beautiful rural scenery on the other. There are many pleasant situations, fine
                     gardens, and splendid residences in Burlington; and there are many "solid men"
                     here, too; solid in wealth, in business capacity, and in the hospitalities that
                     adorn life. Looking out on the lake, you see many beautiful Islands,
                     conspicuous among which is one on which stands the light-house, some three
                     miles from the main shore. On the left of this, and midway between it and
                     another beautiful Island, a solitary rock lifts its sharp head, some
                     twenty-five feet from the surface, remaining there always, treeless and
                     shrubless, all alone, throwing back the waves when the winds sweep over the
                     waters, and moveless and solemn when the moon looks down on the still surface
                     of the lake. Further off, still, are two small Islands, covered with tall
                     trees, that seem to rise right up from the water. No brush, no water-grass, no
                     sandy shore surround them; but they appear to go straight up from the deep
                     water, and in the distance, with a haze in the atmosphere, look like great
                     war-vessels with a press of black canvass spread from invisible masts.
                     Burlington is a busy place. I see far out on the lake two steamers, coming in
                     opposite directions towards the docks, and I hear the roar of a steam-whistle
                     off to the South, as a train of cars comes thundering in from<pb n="292-293"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000149"/> Boston, while another iron horse is rushing with
                     a ponderous train from Rouse's Point. Here and there, all over the lake, as far
                     as the eye can reach, are seen the white sails of smaller craft, moving in
                     every direction; some up the lake, some down, and some beating across, all
                     seeming bent on progress towards or from a market.</p>
                  <p>Burlington must be a most delightful summer residence. The air is so pure, so
                     bracing, the drives so pleasant in every direction; the scenery around so
                     enchanting, that I wonder it is not preferred by everybody to the crowded and
                     cramped-up places of fashionable resort.</p>
                  <p>There is good lake fishing at Burlington. In the early morning before the sun
                     had come up over the eastern hills, I went out with a boatman on the water; I
                     saw the first rays of the morning as they lighted on the peaks of Essex. I saw
                     them chase the shadow down the sides of the mountains, and I saw them when they
                     first glanced across the surface of the lake, making it shine like molten
                     silver as the fresh morning breeze swept over it. I hauled in some three or
                     four noble fish on my way to the light-house Island, and as many more on my
                     return, on a trolling line of three hundred feet in length. It was a glorious
                     morning; the breeze was so fresh and the air so bracing, that I was tempted to
                     shout and hurrah with gladness, as I floated over the water. It made me young
                     again. The spirit of boyhood came over me, and I felt as of old, before gray
                     hairs had gathered upon my head, or stiffness had seized upon my joints. A
                     beautiful and a pleasant town is Burlington. The lake that lays spread out
                     before it is beautiful. Its mornings are glorious, its summer breezes bracing,
                     exhilarating, healthful; everything around it is beautiful, heavenly in the
                     summer time, and between you and I when I become rich, I shall have a country
                     seat somewhere in the neighborhood of the College parks, with my fine horses
                     and carriage, my boats on the lake, my rowers dressed after the latest sailor
                     fashion, strong-armed, and skilful in the use of the oar. I shall have my
                     trolling lines, and all the apparatus for fishing in perfection, and every
                     morning while the last stars are shining dimly in the sky, struggling with the
                     morning beams, while the grayness of twilight lingers in the valleys, I'll be
                     out on the water, to welcome the rising day, and haul in the bass, the pike,
                     and the pickerel. Towards evening, I'll ride round the country, and at night
                     gather my friends around me and be jolly, (not with wine or strong drink. I
                     have parted company with them.) Won't we, my friend, have a good time when I
                     get rich?</p>
                  <p>I am at Keeseville, a pleasant and thriving village, five miles from the Lake,
                     on the Au Sable River. Immense quantities of nails and bar-iron are made on
                     this stream, at, and within a few miles<pb n="294-295"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000150"/> of Keeseville. There is a capital water-power
                     here, which is fully occupied. The water-wheel travels its ceaseless rounds.
                     The bellows are puffing, the fires are blazing, and the gigantic rollers are in
                     motion. The nail-making machines are constantly at work, day and night—the
                     clank of machinery is mingling with the roar of the waters. It is a hot day,
                     and great drops of sweat are chasing each other down the cheeks of the stalwart
                     operatives, as they handle the blazing iron, drawing it at a white heat,
                     sparkling and throwing off scintillations from the furnaces, and passing it
                     through the great rollers, or lifting the melted ore from its bed of fire, and
                     placing it beneath the gigantic pressing machine which converts it into blooms.
                     This operation requires strength of muscle, as well as of constitution, and
                     powers of endurance. It requires some skill, too, and a raw hand would make
                     small progress, till experience has taught him wisdom.</p>
                  <p>It is a pleasant thing to see one of these great workshops in the night time.
                     The glare of the forges, the intense light of the chunks of iron as they came
                     at a white heat from the blazing furnace, to see them pass through the immense
                     rollers as they are formed into fitness for nail-making, coming out from the
                     pressing machine longer and longer, increasing in length, stretching out and
                     running along the floor like fiery serpents, while the stalwart operatives
                     handle them with iron tongs, as if they were harmless things.</p>
                  <p>The Gorge is some two miles below Keeseville—one of the greatest curiosities of
                     this country. The river goes roaring, and plunging, and cascading, more than a
                     mile, through a chasm some thirty feet wide, on either side of which the rocks
                     rise in perpendicular precipices from one to two hundred feet in height. On the
                     top of these ledges you may stand, on the very verge of these great high walls,
                     and look away down upon the boiling waters as they go surging and roaring on
                     their way. This chasm does not seem to have been worn out by the river in its
                     everlasting flow, but to have been made by the parting of the hills. The rocks
                     on one side are counterparts of the rocks on the other, as if pulled apart.
                     Rock matches rock, and shape is fitted to shape. An indentation on the one
                     side, is matched by a prominence on the other, and you can see plainly that if
                     the river could be withdrawn, and the chasm pressed together, the two sides
                     would fit like the halves of an apple that had been cleft by the blade of a
                     knife. Above Keeseville are evidences that a lake once covered what is now a
                     beautiful valley, stretching away for miles to the southwest, and through which
                     the Au Sable now flows. Where now are rich farms, was once the bottom of this
                     lake, and fishes sported above the fields that are now rich meadows, or covered
                     with grain. Some mighty power, centuries upon centuries ago, struggling in the
                     remote depths of the earth, upheaved these hills, till the surface parted<pb
                        n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6610-00000151"/> ed, leaving this Gorge, through
                     which the pent-up waters rushed, emptying the lake of its contents, and giving
                     its foundations to the world as a place for man to beautify, over which the
                     ploughshare should pass, and his flocks and herds feed.</p>
                  <p>Some three miles west of Keeseville is Halleck's Hill, standing on which, and
                     looking to the north, you see, not a rugged mountain scenery, where giant
                     ranges stretch away, and tall peaks lift their bald heads to the clouds. There
                     is no desolation, no wild and rocky sterility, but a beautiful, level plain, a
                     valley reaching away for miles, rich in agricultural products, and teeming with
                     the evidences of wealth and civilization. Away off to the right is the
                     Champlain. The spires of Plattsburgh may be seen in the distance, seeming to
                     rise like white pillars from the depths of a belt of forest, while in front of
                     them can be viewed the spot where was fought the naval battle of Lake
                     Champlain, in the last war. The beautiful landscape before me is the valley of
                     the little Au Sable. It was settled by Quakers, men of peace, who till the
                     ground in quiet, and never go up to the wars with weapons of destruction in
                     their hands. The spot where these peaceful people, startled by the booming
                     cannon, went up and stood to view the conflict on the Lake, when MCDONOUGH and
                     DOWNIE fought against each other, is near me. These men of peace were patriots.
                     They loved their country, and while from principle they refrained from the
                     shedding of human blood, yet their hearts and their prayers were with their
                     countrymen, against their country's foes. When the smoke of the battle floated
                     away, and the triumph of American arms was manifest, there went up a shout of
                     gladness, a loud hurrah from these honest Quakers, which showed that the "old
                     man" was strong within them.</p>
                  <p>In plain view from where I stand is the little Island on which the killed in
                     that memorable battle were buried. There, in the midst of the lake, side by
                     side in amity, rest the bones of those who struggled against each other on that
                     day of mortal strife. Death is a queller of animosities, and the hands that
                     struck at each other in life are quiet enough in the grave. Brave men are
                     sleeping on that little island. It should be regarded as consecrated ground,
                     and a tall monument should be erected to their memory. It should be made to
                     speak of the noble daring of the men who perilled and lost their lives for
                     their country. There are no rich men buried there. No titled men. They were the
                     sailors, men who stood by the great guns, and whose breasts were bared to the
                     foe. They were what the world calls common men, and who, had they survived the
                     battle, would have lived and died without fame; but they are just the men who
                     win victories, and bring fame to commodores and generals, and upon whose
                     bravery hangs the result of battles. Over these bones of these brave men buried
                     here, these poor men, these sailors, these "common men,"<pb n="298-299"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000152"/> should be erected what will save them from
                     desecration, and tell to the far-off generations how stoutly they fought, and
                     how bravely they fell in the cause of their country.</p>
                  <p>I am at the AU SABLE FORKS, a small town in extent but great in respect to the
                     business done in the way of manufacturing iron. The ROGERS' have their
                     principal forges and nail factories here. Almost every man is an operative, or
                     connected with the business of iron-making in some way. You meet the coal man
                     with his face blackened by coal dust, and you meet the bloomer, (not those of
                     the short gowns and pantaletts), but those who handle the blazing iron, covered
                     with the dust and rust of the forge. You meet the teamster with his short pipe
                     and California hat, and you admire his independence as he sits upon his load of
                     nails or blooms, or bars of iron, sending the smoke from his tobacco-pipe
                     wreathing gracefully upward, and his voice has a cheerful ring as he cries "gee
                     whoa" to his sober team. You meet the lumberman, with his bushy beard and long
                     whiskers, with his axe on his shoulder, and his great boots on the outside of
                     his pantaloons. He is just from the woods in the far interior, where he has
                     been making war upon the pine forest trees, hurling them to the earth, shaping
                     them into logs, and transporting them in rafts down the rivers and over the
                     rapids and falls, to the mills. His labors are over until the fall snows come
                     again. He will work in the harvest fields, or fish or hunt till then, when he
                     will dive again into the forest, to winter in his cold shantee, and make war on
                     the old pine trees. Of these lumbermen's shantees I shall tell you more
                     hereafter. They are a great feature in the Chateaugay, the Saranac, and the
                     Raquette woods. You meet the miner, covered with the debris of the ore, among
                     which he delves away down in the bowels of the earth; a man who spends twenty
                     out of the twenty-four hours in darkness, either that of the night or that of
                     the mines into which the daylight never looks. Everybody in this little town is
                     busy.</p>
                  <p>I am on the elevated plain between the Au Sable and the Saranac rivers. A broad
                     sweep of country, bare of timber, yet without fields or houses. Here is a tract
                     of thousands of acres, that of old was covered with great pine trees and other
                     timber of a large growth. First the lumberman attacked and swept away the
                     pines—then the charcoal men swept away the other large trees, and last of all
                     the fire went rushing and roaring over this plain completing the desolation,
                     leaving blackness and utter lifelessness behind it. No living thing, whether
                     animal or vegetable, remained on its tract. The fire had extinguished or driven
                     them all away. An old resident told me of the "great burning," as he<pb
                        n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6610-00000153"/> termed it, of this plain. "It was,"
                     said he, "of a hot September morning, the wind blew fresh and strong from the
                     west. Somehow the fire got out from the coal pits, on the western border of the
                     plain, among the dry tree-tops and dead limbs, and brush, and spread out
                     sideways, and every way for miles. By-and-bye as the wind rose to a gale, it
                     started on its career across the plain. It was a glorious as well as a fearful
                     sight, to see it leaping forward and upward, swirling and flashing onward,
                     crackling and roaring like thunder, and sending the smoke in dark and dense
                     columns, curling, and wreathing, and rolling towards the sky. The deer and
                     other wild beasts fled wildly and madly before it, towards the mountains, or
                     across the cleared fields of the valley. Fortunately there were no people
                     inhabiting this plain, and the few that chanced to be along the road, fled to
                     the settlement below. It was a grand sight that burning, a thing that is to be
                     seen but once in a man's lifetime."</p>
                  <p>The view from this plain is a magnificent one, if we regard as such only wild
                     and desolate grandeur, where no sign of civilization crosses the vision. On the
                     south and east, lofty peaks loom up towards the sky. The highest and boldest of
                     them all, is the baldfaced mountain, the head of which stands glistening in the
                     sunlight, like the white locks of some ancient giant. Away off beyond this, dim
                     and hazy against the sky, are the peaks of the Adiron-dacks, Mount Marcy, and
                     Mount Seward, the loftiest est of these, while on every side, peaks of a lower
                     stature, mountains of less notable height, bound the vision. It is a goodly
                     thing to pause here of a clear morning, and look upon the things around you,
                     standing as they do in everlasting silence just where God placed them, and no
                     land mark of civilization, no cottage or field, to tell of the destruction to
                     natural things, which marks human progress. I love these old mountain ranges,
                     and the Lakes that lay sleeping under their shadows, and the streams that wind
                     around their base.</p>
                  <p>I am at Franklin Falls, a little village some eighteen miles from the AU SABLE
                     Forks. It is situated on the Saranac River. There is a fall in this stream
                     here, of some thirty feet, across which a dam has been thrown, and the water
                     has been made to operate one of the largest and finest saw-mills in the State,
                     a mill capable of turning out some forty thousand feet of lumber per day. There
                     is here a large tavern house for so small a place, which is well kept, a larger
                     store, and a score or more small but neat cottages clustered around them. Two
                     years ago the present summer, this little town, with the mill and everything in
                     the shape of a building, every out-house, shed, and fence, was clean wiped out.
                     A "fire in the woods" came sweeping down from the southwest, driven forward<pb
                        n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6610-00000154"/> ward by the gale, hurled onward by
                     the strong winds in resistless fury. In an hour it had passed on, leaving in
                     its track only smouldering ruins and the blackness of desolation. Every vestige
                     of houses, mills, great lumber piles, stables, barns, everything that would
                     burn had been given to destruction, and the villagers were grouped about
                     congratulating each other on their own fortunate escape from a terrible fate.
                     But enterprise has conquered the desolation, and a better mill, a better store,
                     better hotel and better houses, now stand where those that were swept away by
                     the fire stood. These fires in the woods are fearful things in this section of
                     the State. You will remember that this was, of old, a lumber region, or rather
                     there were thousands and hundreds of thousands of pine trees scattered all over
                     the woods. These have been mostly chopped away, and their dead branches, dried
                     tops and foliage, as they lay where they fell, make rich food for the flames.
                     The foliage of the spruce and hemlock, green though it be, is combustible, and
                     when a fire chances to get loose, and the winds are on the wing, the flames
                     move forward with a speed and power which nothing can resist. I witnessed one
                     of these fires in the woods years ago. It was in the night-time, and I was
                     floating on the waters of Tupper's Lake. It came rushing and roaring around the
                     base of a mountain, flashing and leaping upward and sideways, and every way, as
                     the wind impelled it onward, or in gustful eddies laterally among the
                     combustible materials in its reach. For a few minutes it would dash forward
                     before the wind, and then seem to pause as if for breath, the flames going
                     straight up among the foliage of the fir-trees, like gigantic torches. Again it
                     would leap forward as the wind returned, pushing the flames in long streams
                     onward among the branches, like the fiery tongues of great serpents. The
                     surface of the lake was lighted up like the day, and its waters was the barrier
                     at last, against the progress of the fire. When it reached the lake, it died
                     gradually away, and when I awoke in the morning, a track of blackness a quarter
                     of a mile in width, trees standing up in charred and leafless desolation, and
                     here and there smoking logs and chunks among which the burning lingered, marked
                     the track of this "fire in the woods."</p>
                  <p>I am at the Saranac Lake, at the "Saranac House," kept for the accommodation of
                     sportsmen in the summer, and lumbermen in the winter. This is a decent,
                     respectable country tavern, standing literally at the end of the road, and kept
                     by pleasant and obliging people. It is on a beautiful little bay, of some
                     hundred acres, at the north end of the lake. All around are the old woods, the
                     ancient forest standing as it grew, and as it has stood for thousands of
                     years.</p>
                  <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6610-00000155"/>
                  <p>The shores of this bay are bold and rocky, save a few acres at the head of it,
                     where the inlet enters. Here the pond lilies spread their great round leaves
                     over the surface, and the brilliant yellow and white blossoms shine out like
                     stars of silver or gold, on the water. We arrived here a little after sundown,
                     while the glad songs of the day were being hushed, and the night voices were
                     coming abroad on the air. High above all was the music of the frogs, that was
                     kept up all the long night, making the woods and lakes vocal with their deep
                     sepulchral notes. By the way, I have seen frogs in my day, that might claim to
                     be sizeable animals, but I have seen nowhere else this kind of amphibia at all
                     comparable in dimensions to those of the Lower Saranac. Great plump green
                     fellows, that would weigh a pound or two, and thousands of them, having voices
                     deeper and louder than that of the bassoon or the brazen serpent; and when they
                     strike up together, the whole air is full of sound. The leaves of the pond
                     lilies are the largest I have ever seen, some of them being full a foot in
                     diameter. On one of these great leaves, some patriarch frog will seat himself
                     towards night, with his great round leaden eyes protruding from his head, his
                     long limbs gathered under him, his wide mouth stretched in a changeless
                     grimace, and as the twilight gathers, he will inflate his ponderous and pouched
                     jaws like a bellows, and send forth sounds that would astonish the puny
                     froglings of the marshes of the Hudson son. There is a peculiarity about the
                     melody of the frogs here, that I never noticed before. For a little while all
                     will be still, save the shrill note of the little peeper close along the shore.
                     Then from his leaf, away out on the lake, some deep-mouthed croaker will bellow
                     out, while from every direction, voice after voice will fall in, until as it
                     were a solid roar fills the air. Gradually this will die away and for a minute
                     or two all will be still, and this succession of sound and silence goes on
                     until the sun lights up the day again.</p>
                  <p>Directly opposite the Saranac House, and across a low ridge, through the forest
                     a half mile or more, is a little lake say of two thousand acres, which is a
                     perfect gem. Its waters are clear and cold, the banks, save a little patch at
                     the south, bold and bluff, the hills rising gradually from the water's-edge,
                     little bays stealing around and hiding behind rocky points, laying there in
                     eternal shadow; as a whole it is one of those beautiful little sheets of water,
                     which is the more charming because the eye can take in at once all its
                     delightful scenery. As we rowed around it, we saw on a natural meadow of some
                     three or four acres, two noble deer feeding. We paddled silently to within
                     eight or ten rods of them, when they seemed to scent us. They raised their
                     heads and looked all around, but as we were perfectly moveless at the time,
                     they did not seem to notice us; still, they were alarmed and uneasy, evidently
                     satisfied that there was danger somewhere<pb n="306-307"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000156"/> where. At length we rose up in the boat, and
                     shouted, and it would have done you good to see how they hoisted their white
                     flags, and with what prodigious bounds they went snorting and scampering
                     away.</p>
                  <p>I am at Round Lake, ten miles from the Saranac House, on my way to the Raquette
                     River, Tupper's Lake, and the wild regions that lay around the sources of Bog
                     River. We left Martin's this morning, in a little water-craft, made of thin
                     cedar boards, and which weighs perhaps a hundred and twenty pounds. This little
                     boat, light as it seems, and tottlish and unsteady as it may be when unloaded,
                     will carry four persons, and a reasonable amount of baggage, with perfect
                     safety, over these beautiful waters. These rivers and lakes are the highways,
                     the turnpikes, the railroads of these high and wild regions, and these little
                     boats are the carriages, the stage coaches, and the cars, in which everybody
                     must travel. You start from the head of the Lower Saranac, and with a few
                     carrying places, over which the sturdy boatman trudges with his boat on his
                     back, you go a circle of a hundred miles in diameter; you traverse the Lower
                     Saranac, Round Lake and the Upper Saranac; you cross the "Indian carrying
                     place" of a mile, along a pleasant and beaten path through the woods. Then you
                     launch again, on a series of ponds and down Stony Brook, to the Raquette River,
                     and then up or down that beautiful water-course, as your fancy dictates, to the
                     lakes beyond; you meet every little while a boatman, returning from a journey
                     to the woods, alone or with passengers who have been on a sporting trip among
                     the lakes and forest streams. The rowers rest a moment on their oars, kindly
                     greetings are passed, news of the sports and from the outside world are
                     exchanged, and each passes on his way. A turn in the river, or an island in the
                     lake, hides him from your view, and you are alone again.</p>
                  <p>While we were packing our traps in our boat at Martin's in the morning, an
                     incident occurred which occasioned some amusement, at whose expense I will not
                     now say. The shore where the boat was landed was bold, going down steep into
                     the water. The bow of the little craft lay upon the bank, and the stern on the
                     water some four feet in depth. The party were all in the house save one who
                     stepped into the boat for the purpose of placing a small pail of butter under
                     the stern seat. His weight tipped the bow clear of the land, and the boat
                     started out on the water. Turning to see what the difficulty was, and
                     forgetting for a moment the care necessary to steady the craft beneath him, he
                     lost his balance, the boat glided out from under him, and he went down like a
                     great frog, head foremost into the water, and came up in five feet depth, wet
                     as a<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6610-00000157"/> drowned rat. Fortunately the
                     water was not cold, and what was better, nobody happened to see him as he
                     crawled out upon the shore, every hair of his head and every thread of his
                     garments dripping like an eave-trough. It was a goodly sight to see him there,
                     shaking himself like a Newfoundland water-dog, or standing up straight and
                     stiff, to let the water run off from his saturated garments. When the discovery
                     of the facts was made, a hearty laugh was indulged in at his expense, and
                     countless were the jokes to which he was subjected. Do you ask who it was that
                     took this involuntary plunge into the Saranac? Sir, there are questions which
                     people, though they possess all the knowledge necessary to the solution of
                     them, do not like to answer, and this is one of them. All I choose to say is,
                     he was a man of about five feet nine in height, somewhat rotund in shape, of
                     fourteen stone and a little over in weight, and somewhat given to grayness
                     about the head. Perhaps you may know him. If you do, you will confer a special
                     favor on me by saying nothing about the matter.</p>
                  <p>I am at Tupper's Lake, a sheet of water which I assert has no peer in beauty in
                     this country. It is some ten miles in length, and varying from one to three
                     miles in width. Its waters are pure and cold, though less transparent than some
                     of the lakes in this region. This is owing, probably, to the iron ore, which
                     doubtless underlays and which we know abounds around it. At the foot of the
                     lake, a few rods from the bank, the ore crops out on the surface, and you can
                     easily trace it from an eighth to a quarter of a mile. The ore appears to be
                     very rich, and from the indications on the surface, extensive. I have no doubt
                     that long years hence, maybe centuries, this and other rich mines of iron,
                     known to exist in this now wild locality, will give employment to thousands of
                     men, and send out their portion of metal to meet the immense and always growing
                     demand for iron, required by the operations of civilization. The great features
                     of Tupper's Lake, those which give it its principal charm, are its islands and
                     bays. These are the most charming imaginable, always remembering that we leave
                     out of view civilization, regarding only wildness, solitude, and primitive
                     grandeur. These bays stealing around behind jutting and craggy promontories,
                     winding away in the deep shadow of forest and mountain, they lay there
                     unrippled almost by a breeze, always. Floating into one of these, you are hid
                     from a view of the lake; above you is only the sky, while the tall trees, and
                     hills that surround them, limit the vision, as though you were in the bottom of
                     a great bowl, and could look only upward. The islands are of various size and
                     appearance. Here a bare rock, an immense boulder, lifts its brown and
                     moss-covered head,<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6610-00000158"/> right up from the
                     deep water, standing all solitary and alone, with no tree, shrub, grass or
                     vegetable thing growing upon it. There one, maybe, of a few rods only in
                     circumference, covered with fir trees and pines, standing clothed in
                     everlasting green, with no rocks visible to the eye. Then again, there are
                     others containing maybe hundreds of acres, covered with timber, among which
                     great boulders, larger than haystacks, stand, with here and there precipices
                     rising straight up, fifty or sixty feet, gray and gloomy, while occasionally a
                     bare rocky peak rises above even the tree-tops. As you float by one of these
                     islands, and see the great boulders, the walls, and rocky peaks, struggling as
                     it were for mastery with the forest growth above and around them, you can
                     hardly divest yourself of the idea that you are looking upon some gigantic
                     ruins of the olden times. The crumbling walls, the decaying and deserted
                     battlements of ancient castles, and strongholds built by people of a rude and
                     vanished age, when physical force, and strong arms, conquest and plunder, were
                     the great landmarks of the times. You can almost mark the spot where the lofty
                     towers stood, where the ponderous gates swung upon massive hinges; where were
                     drawbridge and moat, and you think how impregnable the sturdy old Baronet was
                     in his stronghold against everything but Time. And then you think how that same
                     Time demolishes the strongest and proudest works of man, how it topples down
                     castle and hold, how it sweeps away at last, by its strong, slow, but sure
                     process, the most massive works of human energy.</p>
                  <p>There are two settlers on the shores of this lake; the one at the outlet, and
                     the other near the head of the lake. The first, a fisherman and hunter, who has
                     some two or three acres cleared, raising simply vegetables for his family,
                     taking the world easy, as most frontier men do, seldom sweating from hard
                     labor, or tired by real work. The other is a lumberman, energetic and
                     industrious, has small taste for hunting or fishing, or any of the wild sports
                     of the forest or lake. He has some forty acres cleared, a good log-house for
                     his family, and another of larger dimensions, fitted up with tiers of berths
                     all around, like the cabins of the large steamboats, but not by any means with
                     the same degree of elegance. Here, during the Winter months, and until late in
                     the Spring, an army of lumbermen congregate, occupying this as their sleeping
                     apartment, and boarding with the hardy settler in this wilderness. This family
                     is eight miles from a neighbor, some fifty miles from a doctor, the same
                     distance from a church or school-house, and you will readily see that whatever
                     pleasure there may be in isolation, they enjoy it to the full. Speaking of
                     school-houses reminds me of a matter that I omitted to mention in a former
                     letter, a thing that I "booked for discussion" on my way, but forgot to mention
                     it in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Between the AU SABLE FORKS and FRANKLIN<pb n="312-313"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000159"/> FALLS, as I said to you, is a high region of
                     country, cold and uninviting for agricultural purposes, desolate by nature as a
                     place of residence, but covered with a large growth of timber. This timber is a
                     mine of wealth to the manufacturers of iron, furnishing them with charcoal for
                     their furnaces and forges. Occasionally you come to a city, almost, of
                     coal-pits. Hundreds upon hundreds of them clustered around. Some smoking in the
                     slow progress of combustion, some just covered, and some just being piled ready
                     for covering, and some already burned, from which sooty, and
                        <emph>charred</emph> men, I had almost said, are raking away the coals, and
                     loading them for the forges. As a matter of fact, it requires people, to chop
                     the wood, build and burn the pits, and carry away the coals; and they are to be
                     found in plenty, in log-houses along the road. As a corollary from these facts,
                     it follows that children will be born to them. And you will see the sturdy,
                     knotty, and hardy-looking little wilderness-born chaps, swarming in what you
                     and I might consider inverse ratio, so far as numbers are concerned, to any
                     apparent necessity for their presence, or provision for their support. Now, in
                     this country, as a general thing, wherever you find a dozen children, you will
                     find a school-mistress and a school-house. These three institutions seem to be
                     inseparable, growing along up together, and it is a glorious thing that it
                     should be so. It develops the native energy of the American character, and
                     brings forth its inward might. Well, some three or four miles south of FRANKLIN
                     FALLS, in the "coal formation," as geologists would say, stood a log-house.
                     There were some fifteen or twenty barefooted, healthy-looking boys and girls,
                     playing and scampering, and shouting around the door, and I wondered at the
                     evidences of a prolific reproductiveness, which seemed to characterize whoever
                     inhabited it. While we were some distance from it, however, I heard a loud
                     rapping on the window-sash, and the little ones disappeared with a rush into
                     the house. That sound was too full of old memories, recollections of long ago,
                     not to explain the problem that had puzzled me. That log-house standing there
                     all alone in that little clearing, was a school-house, a "seminary of
                     learning," a small branch of a great system, that has thrown and is throwing
                     this country forward, with a rush of progress such as finds no parallel in the
                     world's history. As we passed it, the door stood open, and I took an
                     observation of the inmates. There was the plain but neatly dressed mistress,
                     with her clean calico dress and black apron, her white neckerchief over her
                     shoulders, and crossed gracefully over her bosom; her hair combed modestly and
                     smoothly from her forehead, and fastened in a knot on the back of her head,
                     standing with book in hand, and a class of little girls before her, about
                     hearing them read. One chubby little fellow, of say eight or nine years of age,
                     was standing by himself in the middle of the<pb n="314-315"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000160"/> floor, with a paper cap on his head, his
                     pantaloons rolled half-way to his knees, his legs and feet bare, and the fore
                     finger of his right hand in his mouth, and his face down in a
                     ludicrous-sheepish, and shame-faced fashion. There was no mistaking
                        <emph>his</emph> position. He was undergoing punishment for some sin against
                     the laws of the school, demonstrating the great truth that reaches all the way
                     from the cradle to the grave, that the way of the transgressor is hard. There
                     was something so old-fashioned, so familiar to me in all this, that I was
                     tempted to laugh and cry at the same time, as the present and past stood out so
                     palpably before me.</p>
                  <p>Do not think me capable of ridiculing these primitive people, or primitive
                     schools. They are too important, too essential to the prosperity and progress
                     of this country, in my estimation, for that. I remember with feelings of
                     profound veneration the log school-house of my own boyhood days. It was the
                     foundation of the small progress I have made in life. The teachings begun in
                     these log school-houses have given direction to, and roused the latent energies
                     of many a great and good man of our country, whose names have passed into the
                     history of these States, who will live in the world's memory when thousands of
                     graduates of the Colleges and Universities will have perished. Blessings on
                     that log school-house in the Saranac Woods, on its schoolmistress, and the
                     little children, whose "young ideas" she was teaching "how to shoot."</p>
                  <p>We leave Tupper's Lake by a direct road to go up the Bog River, to the ponds
                     and lakes towards its source. There are beautiful trout in this lake, and
                     abundance of them. We did not care to take them, for we could not get them out
                     to the settlements, and we had more of the brook and river trout than we knew
                     what to do with. We saw some taken by the settler at the lower end of the lake,
                     weighing from eight to twelve pounds. These he salts for winter use, though he
                     can take them at all times. The trolling season is nearly over, and but few can
                     now be taken in that way. They are caught now by what is called deep fishing.
                     Buoys are made in water from fifty to one hundred feet in depth, where the fish
                     are baited. Long strips of bark are peeled and tied together, to make a sort of
                     cable, to one end of which a stone is fastened as an anchor, and at the other a
                     piece of light wood is made fast, and left to float on the water. About this,
                     chub, shiners, and suckers, cut into small pieces, are thrown for a day or two,
                     and then the fisherman goes out in his boat, fastens to his buoy, drops his
                     long line and great hook, baited with a minnow, and naturally draws in the six,
                     eight, and ten pounders, that have been fattening on the fish he has been
                     furnishing them.</p>
                  <p>I am at the upper falls of Bog River. This large stream, but small river, forms
                     the inlet to Tupper's<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6610-00000161"/> Lake, and
                     comes down from a plateau some sixty feet above it, in three cascades over
                     shelving rocks, of about twenty feet each, and shoots off in a powerful current
                     far out into the lake. Across this current, where it enters the lake, and in
                     the eddies formed by it, are great places to throw for the river trout. They
                     may be caught in great quantities and of a large size, and their play is
                     beautiful. They are, however, at this time, caught both larger, and if possible
                     faster, by trolling, with a minnow for bait, back and forth, a few rods from
                     the shore, across the current. Beautiful yellow or orange-bellied fellows, of
                     from one to three pounds in weight, and their activity and strength is
                     exceedingly exciting to those who have a taste for that method of taking them.
                     For myself, I love the fly or grasshopper, or even the vulgar angle-worm, best;
                     and when I can use them, neither deep fishing for ten-pounders, nor trolling,
                     will tempt me to forsake them.</p>
                  <p>Our boatmen carried our boat and what a Hoosier would call our plunder, from
                     the lake, a few rods up a steep ascent, and launched it on the river, above the
                     falls. For some three or four miles above, the river flows in a deep and
                     tortuous channel, with but a light current. We then entered a region of
                     boulders, lying in mid-channel, around which the currents wound, and went
                     twisting and eddying away. Here I threw my fly, by way of experiment, and found
                     the trout abundant. Some half a mile further on, we came to a rapid, half a
                     mile in extent, around which the boat had to be carried. And I may say here,
                     that during the day we encountered nine rapids, of greater or less extent,
                     around which our little vessel had to be transported. These carrying places
                     where, however, short, and as we had two boatmen, occasioned but little trouble
                     or delay, and afforded rather a relief from the fixed posture which we had to
                     assume in the boat. There has been a vast amount of lumbering done on and in
                     the neighborhood of this stream the last winter. Twenty thousand logs have
                     floated down it, to the lake below, during the Spring freshets, and there are a
                     vast many lying scattered along the banks, which must await the Spring freshets
                     of next year. On each of the falls (and there are seven of them) dams have been
                     built, to hold back the water, until all is ready, when the flood-gates are
                     opened, and the mighty rush of waters carries everything before it. We could
                     see the mark of the flood, six or eight feet above the present level, on the
                     trees along the bank, and the water is yet greatly above low-water mark. I can
                     imagine with what tremendous force the river goes thundering through the narrow
                     gorges, and down the rocks among the great boulders fixed as mountains in the
                     channel; and the wonder is, how even the great logs can withstand its mighty
                     power, and not be splintered into shreds, among the gigantic obstructions
                     against which they are hurled. The shanties of the lumbermen are seen every few
                     miles along the banks, and they constitute<pb n="318-319"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000162"/> stitute a great feature of this region. They are
                     built of long logs, covered with shingles split from the pines and spruce.
                     Tiers of berths are built one above another, on each side, and across the ends,
                     save where you enter the door. In the centre is a rude fire-place of stone, but
                     without a chimney, while a hole in the roof is left for the escape of the
                     smoke. In some of them are immense cooking stoves, instead of fireplaces.</p>
                  <p>The bed of the hardy lumbermen was of hemlock, or spruce boughs, or of hay or
                     straw, and here they managed to live comfortably, according to their notions,
                     through the cold winters, though the chill winds whistled through a hundred
                     openings, and the snow drifted in through the crevices. These shanties are
                     deserted now, and they stand there tenantless, with most of the tools remaining
                     which were used by the lumbermen during the winter. These tools are entirely
                     safe from plunderers, for there is a sort of faith among woodmen, that is a
                     surer protection than bolts and bars. We entered one of these shantees, the
                     door of which was on the latch. There, in the centre, stood a great stove, with
                     the utensils for cooking upon and around it. In one corner was piled up axes,
                     crowbars, log chains, iron dogs. On a shelf was a cask of vinegar, and another
                     that smelled mightily like whiskey, a great pile of codfish, and bread hard and
                     dry enough to answer for cannon balls, pewter dishes, knives and forks,
                     selected for strength rather than elegance, and on a little shelf in the
                     corner, a pack of cards, so soiled and greasy, that one could safely bet they
                     had been through ten thousand games of "Old Sledge." The whiskey and the cards
                     brought out a strong characteristic of the lumbermen of these woods in bold
                     relief, while the hundred black stubs of pipes, and the codfish, added a sort
                     of commentary to the card and whiskey text. And yet, probably there was neither
                     a confirmed drunkard nor a gambler among them all. They drank whiskey upon
                     principle, and played cards, and smoked, and eat codfish by way of giving
                     relish to the "rye." I remember an eccentric old gentleman, who was a member of
                     the Legislature for two or three sessions some years ago, from one of the
                     down-river counties. He was a jolly, pleasant, companionable, and withal, an
                     intelligent man—but he had three weaknesses in rather a remarkable degree.
                     These weaknesses were a game of whist, a gin sling, and a cigar. He could
                     indulge in his favorite game from eve till dawn, provided the gin was good, and
                     the cigars all right. He would play, and drink, and smoke with a zest that
                     defied weariness or desire for sleep, and yet he was never intoxicated, and
                     never staked a cent on the cards. He claimed to be a temperate man, and was
                     principled against drunkenness and gambling. He would, however, stow away more
                     gin, and smoke more cigars of a night, and go to bed soberer, than any two men
                     I ever happened to know. He used to say he loved to drink because it made<pb
                        n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6610-00000163"/> him relish a cigar so, and he loved
                     to smoke because it made him so dry. It is, doubtless, so with the lumbermen of
                     this region. They like to drink, because it makes them relish their pipes, and
                     they like to smoke, because it makes them so dry.</p>
                  <p>We have mastered all the rapids and falls, and are now in smooth water, and
                     shall be until we reach a series of nameless ponds, lying between us and Mud
                     Lake. We have seen several deer on the route thus far, since we left Tupper's
                     Lake, but there are no grasses or food for them along the river, and our
                     meeting with them has been entirely accidental. It is said we are now entering
                     upon a portion of the river that affords abundance of pasture for them, and
                     that we shall have a sight at a great many on our passage up.</p>
                  <p>I am on the banks of one of the small lakes, the outlet of which goes to help
                     to make up Bog River. These ponds or little lakes are without names, so far as
                     I can learn. They have some, but not all of the beauties of the waters further
                     north. They are in part bordered by marshes, and they lack the bold and
                     striking outline of rocky bluff and hillside, nor have they the charming bays
                     that steal around, as it were, from the broad lake, to sleep in the shadow of
                     the forest trees. We are very near the "top of the house" here, and though we
                     can see in the distance mountain peaks going up towards the sky, yet there are
                     no ranges, no highlands, as distinguished from these peaks in sight. We must
                     now be some four or five hundred feet above Tupper's Lake, and a single rise of
                     some fifty feet in all, around roaring rapids, will bring us to the upper
                     level, beyond which there is in this direction no higher plain, no more
                     elevated river or lake.</p>
                  <p>After leaving the upper falls, the river flowed with a sluggish current through
                     broad marshes, where the wild grasses skirted the shore, and the broad leaves
                     of the pond lilies covered the water. We saw abundance of deer feeding upon
                     these aquatic pastures. I was exceedingly amused by one of these animals, a
                     noble buck. In many places the channel is narrow, and exceedingly crooked,
                     turning suddenly around wooded points. Soon after leaving the upper falls, the
                     oars were unshipped, and the paddles only used, that when we came upon these
                     deer pastures, we might not frighten the animals by the noise of rowing. As we
                     rounded noiselessly one of these short elbows, we came suddenly upon a large
                     deer, that was feeding only some four or five rods from us. He was standing
                     with his nose and a part of his head, including his eyes, for the moment under
                     water, apparently trying to loosen the stem of a pond lily from the bottom, the
                     water being a foot or more in depth. These stems are of the same pithy and<pb
                        n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6610-00000164"/> fibrous character as a cabbage
                     stalk, rough and knotty like it, and when loosened at the roots, will float on
                     the water. The deer are fond of these lily stalks, and you will see fragments
                     of half-eaten stems floating in the ponds and eddies where they grow. We were
                     perfectly silent and motionless, as we saw him feeding so near us; not a hand
                     was moved. He raised his head carelessly from the water, and as his eye fell
                     upon us, he straightened himself up, then throwing forward his ears, looked in
                     utter astonishment upon us, as if saying to himself, "What, in the name of all
                     that is wonderful, is that?" Presently he hoisted his tail, snorted in
                     amazement, and trotted a few rods towards the shore, looking with arched neck
                     at us over his shoulder. Still, as we did not move, his curiosity seemed to
                     overcome his terror, and he stopped, and turning towards us, stood gazing with
                     a peculiar intensity of look at us. He would stamp with his foot, and whistle,
                     as if to arouse us from our fixed and motionless attitude, if we were living
                     things. Presently we swung our hats and shouted, and he was off like the wind.
                     The discharge of my rifle, and the whistling of the ball near him, added vigor
                     to his terror, and new wings to his flight, and he plunged madly into the thick
                     brush along the margin of the river, and went crashing and snorting up the
                     mountain.</p>
                  <p>I am now on the banks of a small lake, the principal source of the west branch
                     of Bog River. We are shanteeing here in the old woods, in a house made of bark
                     peeled from the trees around us, composed of a single room, with the whole
                     gable end for a door, and just large enough to accommodate two men if disposed
                     of horizontally, and laid along lengthwise on a bed of boughs rolled up like
                     sacks of potatoes in their blankets. Before it are blazing logs, for the nights
                     are cool, and were it not so, the smoke and the flame are needed to keep off
                     the mosquitoes, that in these woods and around these lakes have each a
                     proboscis that an elephant might envy, and they have a mighty insinuating way
                     with them too. Our boatmen lay wrapped in their blankets in the open air, with
                     their feet to fire and their heads resting on blocks of wood for a pillow, and
                     it would do you good to see how soundly they sleep and to hear them snore. From
                     out in the forest comes the solemn hooting of the owl, and the wild voice of
                     some solitary night bird floats upon the ear, while at long intervals the
                     clarion voice of the loon comes clear and musical from the lake. The hoarse and
                     guttural bass of the frogs comes roaring deep, sonorous and solemn, from among
                     the pond lilies that grow along the shore, and yet with all these noises
                     sounding on the ear, you feel an impression of silence, and you are soothed
                     into a desire for repose. With the air full of noises, you sink away into
                     slumber, and in the<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6610-00000165"/> morning awake
                     fully refreshed, the weariness of the previous day all gone, and you feel a
                     degree of buoyancy of spirit and limb, which no night's rest in the city can
                     give you.</p>
                  <p>The pure bracing air of this high region has an effect upon the system which it
                     is impossible to describe. Such at least is its effect upon me. You feel as you
                     inhale it in the morning, an exhilaration, a hilarity that tempts you to shout
                     aloud, hurrah, sing, and be jolly as everything around you seems to be. I have
                     seen people while under the influence of Champagne, cut strange capers, and
                     perform most ridiculous antics, and the mountain air of these wild regions so
                     pure, so bracing, so full of freshness, so deliciously sweet, that though rigid
                     in your observance of the temperance creed, you become almost drunken with
                     excitement, as if you had been worshipping at the shrine of Bacchus.</p>
                  <p>We saw a great many deer yesterday, caught all the trout we wanted, and we can
                     see the deer this morning feeding on the shore over and across the lake. We
                     intended to stay a week in this region, laying around in a loose promiscuous
                     way, fishing as we needed the trout, and knocking over a deer when we needed
                     venison, telling stories, and hearing them told, of life in the woods,
                     indulging in fact or fiction, in fact, being jolly in a natural way outside of
                     civilization, away from books and newspapers, away from highways and the
                     thoroughfares of life, away from the thunders of railroads and the roar of the
                     steam whistle, outside of paved streets, outside of green fields, and outside
                     of the fences, untrammeled by the conventional proprieties of life, to be wild
                     men in fact away off in the old woods, renouncing for a time the guardianship
                     of the laws, the companionship of the world, alone with nature and the wild
                     things with which God has peopled the forests, the lakes and streams. I have
                     thus far written only in the singular number, and have in this, as it strikes
                     me now for the first time, done wrong. There is with me an intelligent
                     gentleman, who is a keen sportsman, one who relishes a tramp in the woods, who
                     loves to throw the fly, and be among the deer, to hear the forest sounds, and
                     look upon the wild scenery of nature, as much as I do myself; and I have been
                     indebted to him, all the way, for pleasant conversation and "interesting
                     debate" on many subjects besides woodcraft. His skill in all that pertains to
                     the sports of the wilderness, is quite equal to my own. I may as well say here,
                     that I do not excel in any branch of woodcraft. I can throw the fly with only a
                     medium skill, and am not remarkably successful with a baited hook. I am no
                     great shot with the rifle. What I love most is to float along the romantic
                     shores of these secluded lakes, to glide into their shadowy bays, be rowed down
                     or up the secluded little rivers that have flowed here in everlasting solitude
                     through the old forests, and around the base of<pb n="326-327"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000166"/> these mountains. I love to commune with the
                     primeval things all around me, to go back in imagination, to the time when this
                     vast Continent was one great wilderness, hid away here across oceans by the
                     Creator, given to the possession of wild men and wild things, till in his own
                     good time he should open it up to the knowledge of the world, making it the
                     field of a regenerated and renewed civilization; where the great principles of
                     human freedom could be planted in a virgin soil, and man's capability for
                     progress be fully developed. This must have been a glorious hunting ground for
                     the Indian, and admirable residences, too, for his brother the beaver. There
                     was no need of these latter building dams to accommodate themselves with still
                     water. The lakes and ponds spread all over the country, were prepared for them;
                     and when they and the wild men of the woods lived in amity, before the greed of
                     the white man had set a value upon their fur, and tempted the cupidity of the
                     Indian to contrive their slaughter, the beaver must have had a good time of it
                     here among these waters. And yet these industrious and provident animals were
                     not entirely satisfied with the natural ponds and lakes alone. There are
                     occasional localities pointed out along the streams where there are
                     unmistakable evidences still existing that they had in the olden times their
                     dams. There are, too, water-ways, narrow channels across low marshy grounds,
                     from one pond to another, that are called by the woodmen men "Beaver Canals,"
                     which, it is said, are the works of the beaver. These "Canals" are some three
                     or four feet wide, the water with scarcely a perceptible current, and in some
                     none at all, winding across the marshes, skirted by tall grass or flags, and
                     you feel almost certain that they are not natural water-courses. You can easily
                     persuade yourself that they are the work of art, have been excavated for the
                     purpose of opening a convenient passage way, and the many muskrats that are
                     seen constantly swimming to and fro in them prove that they are still regarded
                     as highways of travel. There is one across a neck of land on the Racquette
                     River, just above a noted locality known as the "driftwood." This "Canal" is
                     some quarter of a mile in length, leading from the river to a body of water
                     containing probably three thousand acres, known as Isham's Pond. This pond
                     connects with, and is on the same level with the river, and the "Canal" across
                     the Isthmus saves a journey of some four or five miles round. It is from four
                     to six or eight feet in width, through a dense forest of lowland timber. The
                     water is about two feet in depth, though the excavation, if excavation it be,
                     is from four to six feet in depth. We passed through this canal with our boat.
                     There was scarcely a perceptible current. Whether it is the work of the beaver,
                     hundreds of years ago, or a natural canal, I do not undertake to say, but to me
                     it appeared like an artificial channel, made for convenience of
                        communication<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6610-00000167"/> munication between
                     the river and pond, and our boatmen seemed to have no doubt on the subject.</p>
                  <p>I have thus far given you the romance of a journey into these woods, the sports
                     that abound here, the abundance of trout and deer, the beauty of the lakes and
                     rivers, the romantic and wild scenery which you will find spread out all around
                     you. It is, in sober truth, a charming region to visit, for the purpose of
                     whiling away a fortnight or a month. But—and what a pity it is that this
                     disjunctive should always steal in, standing forever in the way of fulness of
                     enjoyment, obstructing our pleasures, and casting a shadow on what should be
                     all brightness, all sunlight, all glory. Yet so it is, there is a BUT in this
                     case, and at this season of the year, during the month of June, the freshest,
                     greenest, brightest, loveliest, most glorious of all the months, when the birds
                     are merriest, the forest foliage most beautiful, the air balmiest, and all
                     nature is clothed in its gayest garments, decked with its sweetest smiles,
                        <emph>the black fly</emph> greedy for blood, hungry, relentless in cruelty,
                     swarm in millions around you, and spite of your most active exertions, your
                     most ingenious devices subject you, especially if your skin is thinner than
                     that of the rhinoceros, to a protracted torment, to which crucifixion would
                     almost seem a positive pleasure. I am a reasonably courageous and persevering
                     man in pursuit of pleasure in the woods. I can bear a great deal of positive
                     hardship, labor, for which, were it encountered for hire, a very large "pile"
                     would have to be paid. I have before now been hungry and cold, I have fought
                     the musquito and the midget, been out in the rain and the chill winds, in
                     pursuit of game. I have tramped in hot days long miles over mountains,
                     stumbling over boulders and among tangle-brush, weary and dripping with
                     perspiration. I have encountered the black fly before in these same woods and
                     in the same beautiful month of June without a thought of surrendering, but I
                     never, and the oldest hunter of these woods never encountered them in such
                     myriads, absolute swarms, as they have appeared the present season. I have been
                     compelled to surrender, acknowledge myself vanquished. I said we intended to
                     stay here a week. We came here last evening and we start for home this morning,
                     absolutely driven from the woods by the BLACK FLY, a little insect not larger
                     than the head of a pin, but with teeth like a tiger's. If I live to get out to
                     the settlements, a problem the solution of which the next two days will solve,
                     if there is enough of me left to make it an object worth preserving, I'll tell
                     you in my next all about it. If I should be clean eaten up, a catastrophe by no
                     means improbable, do not charge it to the panthers or the wolves, lay no blame
                     upon the bears or any of the beasts of prey, but to the BLACK FLY. In that
                     unhappy event, my last injunction is: KEEP OUT OF THE SARANAC WOODS IN THE
                     MONTH OF JUNE.</p>

                  <p>WE have witnessed the same phenomenon three times during the present month.
                     Once we were on the St. Lawrence, along the island that lays opposite Cape
                     Vincent. Once we were on Lake Champlain, opposite Burlington; and once sitting
                     on a venerable, moss-covered boulder overlooking a beautiful meadow just by the
                     village of Lenox, in the State of Massachusetts. It is a glorious thing, the
                     rising of the sun of a calm, clear summer morning. At Cape Vincent we rose
                     while the larger stars were yet shining faintly in the firmament, and the moon
                     was still visible in the sky. The morning was warm and still, the river
                     unruffled, and we started with an early waterman in a row-boat from the dock,
                     to troll for the pickerel, bass or muscalange, if they choose to make the
                     acquaintance of our baited hook. We heard the first<pb n="334-335"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000170"/> morning song of the wild bird, and saw the last
                     star vanish in depths of the sky. We saw the light grow brighter and brighter
                     in the east, as the twilight faded into day. We had just hooked a famous
                     pickerel, and were drawing him in on a line 250 feet in length, as the sun came
                     up over the eastern hill in all the brightness of his glory. It was a splendid
                     thing to look upon, and so was the pickerel that had our hook in his jaw. The
                     sun blazed along the surface of the water, dazzling the eye by his sheen, and
                     the pickerel floundered in his astonishment, while we looked first upon the one
                     and then upon the other, rejoicing in the double favor that was granted us, and
                     thinking <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"How happy could we be with either,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> We admired the sunrise, and hauled in on the pickerel. We made prey of the
                     fish, and let the sun go on in his course.</p>
                  <p>At Burlington, we were out on the lake alone in a skiff by the time the first
                     rays of the sun illumined the Eastern horizon. It was a calm, beautiful
                     morning, the air was balmy and full of invigorating freshness. A light breeze
                     rippled the surface of the water, as we rowed out from the shore to watch the
                     departure of the darkness, and see the lighting up of the world by the sun, as
                     he came up from his resting place. We saw how he first gave his rays to glow on
                     the tops of the mountains away off in Essex, while in the valleys at their base
                     the grayness of twilight still lingered. We saw the sunlight chasing the
                     shadows down the sides of the mountains, and we looked upon the sun as he
                     seemed to hang for a moment, like a great torch among the trees that stood out
                     on the eastern summits against the sky, and then how he rose above them to go
                     forth on his course, like a charioteer of old, with his steeds of fire. He
                     seemed to rejoice in the greatness of his strength as he leaped clear of the
                     hills and mounted aloft in the sky. The darkness vanished from before him, and
                     the moon and stars hid themselves from the glory of his presence. We
                     breakfasted on a yellow bass that morning, which was but one of a half-dozen we
                     caught before the sun was clear of the tree-tops.</p>
                  <p>At Lenox, among the mountains of the Old Bay State, we saw the sun rise again.
                     Lenox is a sweet spot, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. Beautiful farms
                     are spread out all around the town. Beautiful roads, lined on either side by
                     the sugar maple; beautiful streams and beautiful lakes are within range of a
                     morning walk, or an evening drive. It has pleasant fields and shady groves in
                     sight, and deep ravines where the grass grows to the edge of the soft-toned
                     brooklet, as it sings faintly over the smooth pebbles, and the deep shadows of
                     the arching trees cool the heat of noon. We rose, as at Cape Vincent and
                     Burlington, while the twilight yet hovered over the fields and town. We saw the
                     thin mist rising from the meadows, and creeping up<pb n="336-337"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000171"/> the sides of the hills, hiding their shadowy
                     verdure, and making them look like the fair face of a maiden shining dimly in
                     its beauty through a veil of gauze. We heard the wild matin songs as they broke
                     in their gladness from the stillness of night, and watched the swallows as they
                     started from the barns and chimneys on their arrowy flight. We heard the first
                     note of the meadow-lark, as he flew from his night perch, and the last song of
                     the whip-poor-will, as he folded his wings to rest for the day. We sat for half
                     an hour on a venerable boulder that over-looked a meadow. On our right, at a
                     few rods distance, was a half-grown elm, on the topmost branch of which sat a
                     brown thrush, singing his morning song, and swaying gracefully in the breeze
                     while he sang. On our left was a thorn bush, among the thick branches of which
                     the catbird mocked the brown thrush, while over against us, perched upon a
                     fence stake, was a quail, whistling in his clear and silvery notes to his mate,
                     as she brooded in her fondness over her treasured nest.</p>
                  <p>'Twas a pleasant thing to watch the departure of the night shadows, to hear the
                     voices of the morning breaking into harmony, and look upon the sun as he came
                     up from behind the eastern hills. It seemed to us that the gladness grew in
                     intensity, and that a new song burst forth as he came into view. The brown
                     thrush sang with a clearer voice, and the catbird in his thorn bush mocked with
                     fresh vigor, while the bob-o-link darted up from the meadowgrass grass with a
                     freer bound, and while he shook the dew-drops from his wing, and balanced
                     himself gracefully in the air, sang with a prolonged lay, and a gladder
                     energy.</p>
                  <p>Sunrise in the country is a glorious sight, a vision infinitely more pleasant
                     than those which visit the pillow of the sluggard while indulging in his
                     morning sleep. Go out into the country among the mountains, or among the
                     fields, where everything is fresh, where the dew-drops glisten on the grass, or
                     sparkle on the forest leaves—where the morning breeze comes to you fragrant
                     from the meadows or the foliage of the old woods. Look upon the stars as they
                     depart from the sky, and upon the sun as he comes up from his bed of darkness.
                     It is a glorious exhibition, and open for all. It can be seen without money,
                     and enjoyed without price. Go into the country and see the sun rise.</p>

                  <head>B. THE "SAINTS' REST."</head>
                  <p>YOU need not take down your map and look for the location of "The Saints'
                     Rest." It is not laid down on the map. You need not look into your gazetteer.
                     It is not in the gazetteer. You need not inquire of the oldest inhabitant about
                     its locality, for he has never heard of it. It is not the place that good
                     people have been looking for, for ages, the place where Christian people hope
                     to repose when earth, with its cares and sorrows, shall have passed away. And
                     yet "The Saints' Rest" is a veritable locality. It occupies a place in the
                     world, and is not inaptly named. First let me tell you how we got here, and who
                     I mean by <emph>we,</emph> for I am not alone.</p>
                  <p>At Coudersport we took a lumber wagon, and packing our movables, consisting of
                     provisions, fishing tackle, and a rifle, took to the woods, over a road such as
                        <emph>you</emph> have probably never travelled. Great bags stuffed with hay,
                     as compactly as they could be, and laid in the bottom of the box, constituted
                     our seats. I said we took to the woods and we went up and up for hours, towards
                     the top of a range of hills that seemed to have no summit, over a road that was
                     good, at least for dyspeptics, if jolting over roots and topling down into deep
                     holes is beneficial. Once in two or three miles we would come to a clearing of
                     a few acres, with a log-house, or may be two or three near each other,
                     composing a little settlement surrounded by a dense and sombre forest of great
                     hemlocks, from the limbs of which the lichens hung, and above which mountain
                     peaks went looming up towards the sky.</p>
                  <p>Towards four o'clock we came in sight of a little settlement of three or four
                     families, the entire of whose clearings may have amounted to a hundred and
                     fifty acres. A log house for each family, and two or three barns, constituted
                     all the buildings in sight. The day had been excessively warm and sultry. The
                     tree frogs were piping all along the road; the leaves on the trees as they
                     stirred in the sluggish breeze, lifted their leaves fan-like to the sun, making
                     the tree-top shine all over like silver. As the day advanced, clouds came
                     flying over in solemn procession from the southwest, indicating that a storm
                     was on the march. As we entered this little clearing dark and heavy clouds came
                     heaving solemnly up over the western hills, the low growl of the thunder was
                     heard in the distance, faint flashes of lightning glanced across the sky, while
                     around us was the gloomy stillness that precedes a summer storm. We were some
                     dozen miles from the "The Saints'<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6610-00000173"/>
                     Rest," seven or eight of which lay through woods without a house. We applied at
                     one of the houses in sight, and were accommodated for the night. We had got
                     ourselves and our team comfortably housed, and the storm came on. It was a
                     goodly sight to see the rain come down as it did then, as if the clouds had
                     been torn asunder to empty their contents at once in a rushing flood upon the
                     earth. It was a goodly sight to see the lightning, flashing and streaking, in a
                     ragged, zig-zag from the clouds down to the forest-covered hills, and it was a
                     goodly sound to hear the sudden boom of the thunder as it burst like artillery
                     upon the ear, and went rolling and dying away among the mountains. In an hour
                     the rain was over, and the bow of promise hung arching upon the rear of the
                     storm. In the morning we breakfasted with our entertainer, compensated him for
                     his trouble as far as money could do, and grateful for his kindness, took up
                     our journey again for the "Saints' Rest." You may judge of the quality of the
                     road when I tell you we were some seven hours in going less than a dozen miles.
                     We passed over a high range, and went singing and jolting, whistling and
                     laughing down towards the Sinnemahoning, in the pleasant valley of which is the
                     "Saints' Rest." Our last mile or two lay along a stream that came down from the
                     hills, beautifully clear and cold, and I left my companions with the promise to
                     procure a mess of fish for our dinners. I redeemed that pledge, for within two
                     hours of their arrival at the "Saints' Rest," I was there with a basket
                     literally full, of as beautiful speckled trout as an epicure would wish to
                     see.</p>
                  <p>And now you ask who compose the <emph>we,</emph> of which I have been speaking,
                     for you are aware that in these letters I indulge in no editorial plurals.
                     Well, first and foremost, there is the Dominie, a pleasant and a Christian man,
                     one who, while he never forgets the dignity of his high calling, is neither a
                     zealot nor a bigot. He is a man of varied reading and ripe scholarship, full of
                     pleasant anecdote, and of a cheerful wit. He is no ascetic, moving along
                     through the world with a brow of solemn severity, who "will not smile though
                     Nestor swears the joke is laughable." Then there is the dominie's wife, a
                     cheerful-hearted, pleasant and accomplished lady. Then there is my friend the
                     lawyer, a man whose weakness is a pleasant trout stream, a rod and fly—one who
                     takes to the water like a duck, as if he were amphibious, who, with rod in
                     hand, will stalk boldly into the stream, and throw the fly with the water
                     rippling around his knee-pans, defying all the spirits of neuralgia, rheumatism
                     and lumbago; a man, too, of giant sympathies, and a big heart. And then, there
                     is his wife, who sings like a bird, and loves nature with the strong affection
                     of a devotee—a most sensible and excellent woman, younger than the dominie's
                     wife, and less serious, perhaps, as if fitting for a lawyer's lady. Then
                        there<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6610-00000174"/> is my own wife, of whom it
                     does not become me to speak, save that we started in life together before
                     either had numbered twenty years, and have walked quietly and peacefully
                     through many dark days and sore trials, to the present time, and no repining or
                     unkind word has she spoken, to me at least. Here, then, we are, six of us, at
                     the "Saints' Rest," in the sequestered valley of the Sinnemahoning, and here we
                     propose to stay for a week. By the way, shortly after I left the wagon, and
                     while the ladies were talking about the wild animals that belong in these old
                     forests, a fine deer stepped from the covert of the woods, on the other side of
                     the river, into an open space on the bank, and having gazed for a moment upon
                     them, hoisted his white flag and bounded away. It was a pleasant and a new
                     sight to them. They described, with enthusiasm, his symmetry of form, and his
                     graceful movements, as he bounded into the forest.</p>
                  <p>To you, who profess only a love for brick houses and paved thoroughfares, who
                     prefer the long vista of a street, with the rumbling of carriages and a moving
                     panorama of sidewalks covered with people, to tall mountains and old forests,
                     and streams and fields, there would be nothing inviting here. Every locality
                     has its legends and every place its history, and why should not this quiet spot
                     have its history and its legends, too? The "Saints' Rest" has its history as
                     well as the largest city. It is only a clearing of some five-and-twenty acres,
                     having a house of the composite order of architecture, being a log house and a
                     frame one conjoined. My friend, the lawyer who is with me, a year or two since
                     furnished its owner with the means of building an addition to his log-house, to
                     accommodate him and his friends on their fishing excursions to the valley of
                     the Sinnemahoning. While he and his male companions came, without their wives,
                     it was called the "Sinners' Home." Last season they brought their wives, and so
                     glowing were their descriptions of its charms, that the old name was expunged,
                     and it was christened the "Saints' Rest'."</p>
                  <p>We are here, six of us, as I told you in my last, in one of the most primitive
                     and secluded spots in the world. In front of the door runs the Sinnemahoning, a
                     most pleasant little river, on its way to the noble Susquehanna. In the still
                     night, and in the early morning, you hear its gentle song as it flows along in
                     ripples over the smooth stones. To the right, a mountain peak runs upward
                     towards the sky to the height of some fifteen hundred or two thousand feet,
                     covered with gigantic hemlocks to the summit. In front is a mountain range,
                     regular in form, extending north and south, which forms the eastern barrier to
                     the narrow valley of the Sinnemahoning, rising to the height of fifteen hundred
                     feet, with a steep acclivity, covered with dark evergreens, the mountain birch,
                     and gnarled maples to the top. To the left, the valley stretching away<pb
                        n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6610-00000175"/> to the north, and from among the
                     arching trees, that reach their long arms out over the water, and the dense
                     willows that grow thick and luxuriant along the shore, the river comes quietly
                     out as from a cavern, and is lost to the view in its solemn shades. In the rear
                     of the house is another mountain, lifting its sombre head to the clouds, to the
                     left of which a little stream comes down through a mountain gorge, while on the
                     right is a pleasant valley reaching away up between the hills, where the old
                     forest stands in all its primeval grandeur, and through the centre of which a
                     cold stream carries its tribute to the river, in sight of the "Saints' Rest."
                     Here, then, in this bowl, this valley, surrounded by high mountains, is the
                     "Saints' Rest." Pleasant fields are around the house. A foot-bridge consisting
                     of the long trunk of a great pine, hewn on one side, spans the river, beneath
                     which the water spreads out still, placid and lake-like. Just below, there is a
                     ripple where the river goes singing along over the smooth stones, swirling away
                     under caverned banks, and then hiding itself in deep eddies among the piled-up
                     drift wood that bridges it when the water is low. The owner of this spot has
                     been here some nineteen years, and is one of nature's nobility, an honest and a
                     Christian man. He is the owner of a hundred and fifty acres of land, and was
                     the first man that ventured into this wild region as a settler. He is an
                     Irishman. He came from Philadelphia at that early day as an agent for a large
                     land owner. He erected for his principal a dam across the river, and a
                     log-mill. The dam is standing where it was built, and the log-mill is there but
                     it has gone to ruin—the rafters decayed, and the roof fallen in—the water-way
                     has become filled up, and willows and alders grow around the doors, and reach
                     their arms in at the windows, and hang them over the logs that formed the outer
                     walls of the mill, hiding what remains of the structure from view, as if to
                     conceal the decay and desolation that has settled down upon it.</p>
                  <p>I have been exceedingly interested in hearing his excellent and simple-minded
                     wife recount the scenes through which she passed in the first years of her
                     residence here. On one occasion she took her infant in her arms and went out to
                     where her husband was engaged in chopping down the trees. Let me tell you her
                     story as she told it to me, in her own simple language. "I was lonesome," she
                     said, "in the house, and I took Lizzie" (her daughter, now a wife and mother)
                     "in my arms, and went out to where my husband was at work. She was a little
                     baby then, but a few weeks old, and I wrapped her in a shawl to keep the wind
                     from blowing upon her. When I came out to where my husband was, I told him I'd
                     help pick up the brush, and he told me to lay Lizzie down by the side of a
                     stump. She was asleep, and I wrapped her up carefully and laid her down among
                     the bushes, and went to<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6610-00000176"/> gathering up
                     the brush and piling them in heaps. My husband was cutting down a large tree at
                     a little distance, and I went up to where he was. I asked him which way the
                     tree would fall, and he pointed in a direction different from where my baby
                     lay. I stood by him, seeing the chips fly as he swung his axe, and watched the
                     tree as it began to reel to its fall like a drunken man. It began to shake at
                     the top as if in great trouble, swayed for a moment this way and that, and then
                     started, slowly at first, right towards where my baby lay. You can't tell what
                     my feelings were. My heart swelled with horror almost to bursting as the tree
                     went reeling to its fall. I screamed in agony as it went sweeping along through
                     the air, and, wild with terror, thrust my fingers into my ears to shut out the
                     death-scream of my child, and ran like a crazy woman into the woods. My husband
                     ran to where my baby lay, and was there almost as soon as the tree touched the
                     ground. There by the side of the stump, with the broken and crushed limbs all
                     around it, lay my baby unharmed. He turned and ran after me into the woods,
                     hallooing to me to stop and come back, and that LIZZIE wasn't hurt. That was a
                     glad voice to me, and the words went to my heart at first like a dream. I
                     stopped for a moment to listen again. 'LIZZIE is safe,' cried my husband, 'come
                     back.' I couldn't yet fully understand the meaning of what he said. 'LIZZIE is
                     safe' seemed to be sounding all around me. It came down like a voice from the
                     sky, and upward like a voice from the earth. The great trees all around me all
                     seemed to have voices of gladness, and all seemed to say 'LIZZIE is safe.'
                     'Come back,' I heard my husband say again, 'LIZZIE aint hurt;' and everything
                     around me seemed full of happy laughter and great joy. I stopped and listened
                     in bewilderment, and as I did so, 'LIZZIE is safe' was anywhere, above, below
                     and around me, everything cried 'LIZZIE is safe.' My husband came up to me and
                     took me by the hand, and said kindly, 'Don't be frightened, LIZZIE isn't hurt;'
                     and then a trembling came over me, and my strength seemed to be all gone. In a
                     moment I was better, and when my mind took in the sense of my husband's words,
                     I thanked God with a full heart that he had turned a great sorrow from me. I
                     went with my husband to where I left my baby, and there lay the little thing,
                     hid away among the broken limbs of the great hemlock, and the bent and tangled
                     bushes, like MOSES among the rushes, fast asleep. The great hemlock had, in its
                     fall, struck the stump by the side of which LIZZIE lay, and glanced off on the
                     other side; but its limbs, broken and ragged, had been forced into the ground
                     all around her, and it was a wonder and a great mercy that she was not
                     crushed.</p>
                  <p>"I took her up and went home and laid her in her cradle, and then knelt down
                     and thanked the great and good God, that takes care of his creatures, even<pb
                        n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6610-00000177"/> in the deep forests, and the lone
                     woods. I've passed through many sorrows, and I never wept as long at once as I
                     did then, but it wasn't with grief. I was very happy. My heart was very light,
                     but I couldn't laugh. It seemed as though joy like mine could only speak in a
                     low hushed voice, and be seen only in tears. Lizzie has been a kind, good girl,
                     all her life, and I often tell her how lonely and sorrowful my life would have
                     been, had she been crushed to death by that great tree felled by her father's
                     hands."</p>
                  <p>We arrived here of a Saturday afternoon, and it being ascertained that one of
                     our number was a clergyman, the good lady of the house urged him to preach to
                     the settlers on the coming Sabbath. To this he cheerfully consented, and word
                     was sent to all the families on the Sinnemahoning, some six or seven in all. On
                     the morrow they came in, husbands, wives, and little children, to hear what was
                     not often permitted them in their wilderness home—the preaching of the gospel,
                     and to mingle in the public worship of God on the day of his appointment. The
                     number was small, but I have never seen a more attentive and seemingly devout
                     audience. When the service was over, they gathered around the excellent
                     dominie, shook him cordially and gratefully by the hand, and then departed
                     quietly and cheerfully to their homes. Blessings on these good people that have
                     made their homes away out here in these narrow and secluded valleys, beneath
                     the shadow of these tall mountains, and amid the gloom and seclusion of these
                     ancient forests.</p>
                  <p>I have been here a week, and have as yet seen no man or woman, save those who
                     came with me, who belongs outside of this sequestered valley. I have seen no
                     team passing along the road, no traveller winding his way to some remoter spot,
                     or to some settlement further in the wilderness. I have, however, seen the mail
                     boy that comes to this neighborhood once a week on horseback. The post-office
                     is about a mile from us, and is "the last of the series." The post-boy delivers
                     his collapsed mail bags to the post-master, feeds his weary nag, and then turns
                     back towards home. There is no post-office beyond this, on this side of the
                     mountains. There are fifteen voters in the town, and the quarterly receipts at
                     the post-office, I understand, average about seventy-five cents per
                     quarter.</p>
                  <p>I love this lonely region—I could dally here for weeks among the hills, and
                     forests, and streams. I hear the old sounds that were familiar to me in my
                     boyhood, and see the things that I have not seen since my early youth. In the
                     evening, so delightfully cool, we sit on the foot-bridge, and listen to the old
                     owls away up on the sides of the mountain, talking to each other among the old
                     hemlock trees. "Hoo! hoo! hooho!" says one on the right. "Hoo! hoo! hooho!"
                     says another on the left, and "Hoo! hoo! hooho!" says a third among the<pb
                        n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6610-00000178"/> branches of a great tree near us,
                     and their solemn voices come out on the night air, like those of the wood
                     demons, as if inquiring who it is that invade their territory and profane their
                     ancient sanctuaries by human footsteps, and the voice of civilization. Along
                     the stream the frogs croak, and the peepers send their shrill voices from among
                     the grass in the damp and marshy places. The raccoon calls from the margin of
                     the woods along the clearing, and is answered from away off in the forest. The
                     fire-flies flash their tiny torches along the meadow, and over the still
                     waters. The voice of the river is heard away below us, as it flows over the
                     riffles, singing as it dances over the smooth stones, in a ceaseless chaunt,
                     and the wind murmurs softly among the thick foliage of the trees. Then, when we
                     have listened to all these forest sounds, so ancient and so primitive, we lift
                     up our own voices in song. I said in a former letter, that we had with us a
                     lady (the lawyer's wife) who could "sing like a bird," and it was a pleasant
                     thing to hear her sweet clear voice swell out on the night air, full and
                     melodious, and to note how the other sounds ceased as echo prolonged the
                     strains, as if enraptured by the new and pleasant music.</p>
                  <p>We have many romantic spots to resort to in the heat of noon, where we talk
                     over the things of the outside world in a quiet way, as we sit around on the
                     green knolls or the trunks of the fallen trees. There is a little island near
                     the foot-bridge, covered with great trees, from which the underbrush has been
                     cleared away, so that the ground is covered with a delightful grassy verdure.
                     Above, the arms of the trees are lovingly intertwined, their thick foliage
                     shutting out the sunshine, and making a shade beneath, delightfully cool and
                     sweet, while the rippling waters are murmuring all around. This is one of our
                     favorite resorts when the sun is high; and were all those that we love—our
                     children, and our heart companions—around us, it would be hard to part from the
                     charming spot. As we were sitting on the foot-bridge I spoke of, on the Sunday
                     evening after our arrival here, the inquiry arose as to how many trout would be
                     required for a breakfast for all. We settled upon thirty, as the number that
                     could be safely regarded as a full supply—being five to each person—and I
                     promised to procure them in time. I can never sleep late in the morning outside
                     of a city or large town. I know not why it is, but in the country I am always
                     awake by the earliest dawn. It was so here—I was wide awake before the
                     day-break, and as I lay listening to the ceaseless sound of the river, I heard
                     the first song of the first bird of the morning. I rose and dressed myself, and
                     long before the sun had thrown a ray upon the mountain, I was ready with my rod
                     and basket, to redeem my promise of the night before. I could have caught the
                     requisite supply of trout within sight of the house, but I chose to have a
                     ramble, as well as a pleasant time with the fish before<pb n="352-353"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000179"/> breakfast, and I started off up the stream that
                     came down through the valley I spoke of in a former letter. A pathway led up
                     the valley, which I followed for a mile. I have written so much about the music
                     of the woods, that it may well have become tiresome, but I venture to still say
                     that it seemed to me I never heard the songs and sounds so full, so varied, so
                     gleeful and so happy, as they appeared to me then. On every side, and from
                     everywhere came the voices of wild things, some loud and boisterous, some
                     solemn and deep, some hoarse and guttural, and others clear and shrill, but all
                     blending in nature's harmony, and all full of gladness and joy. There is no
                     sorrowful sound among the voices that one hears in the woods—sounds of terror
                     there may be; the thunders roll through the sky, or burst in startling peals,
                     the tornado sweeps by in its wrath and majesty, the tempest roars in its
                     power—all these speak of the mighty strength and power of God, but there is in
                     the whole range of natural voices that one hears in the wilderness, no accent
                     of sorrow, no note of grief.</p>
                  <p>A mile up this valley I came to a clearing of some half dozen acres, which,
                     however, was without a possessor. The fences were all gone, the roof of the
                     log-house had fallen in, the chimney had fallen down, and blackberry bushes
                     clogged up the door, while the rank weeds grew where once was the floor. The
                     settler that made this clearing, had abandoned it long ago. The wilderness was
                     too lonesome for him. His wife pined for her kindred, and after two or three
                     years of solitude and trial, he departed leaving this cleared spot in the
                     forest as the only memorial of his former presence. As he left it so it
                     remains, excepting such decay and desolation as comes with time, and, as is
                     sure to be written, upon what is abandoned by the care of man. I sat down by
                     what was once the door-yard of this primitive dwelling—a spring of pure cold
                     water came bubbling up at my feet, and ran away in a little brooklet, to the
                     large stream that I heard in the distance. The sun was just beginning to
                     illumine with his first rays the peaks around. The thin mist was stealing
                     slowly up the sides of the mountains, while around me still lingered deep
                     shadow, and the grayness of the morning twilight. I sat here for half an hour
                     watching the sunlight chasing the shadow in a long line down the mountain
                     sides, and listening to the sounds that were coming from the woods around. From
                     within the old walls of the old log-house, among the rank weeds and broken
                     timbers, a porcupine came stealing out, and unconscious of my presence wandered
                     all around me, seemingly looking for grass-hoppers, and insects or worms that
                     were chilled by the night-damps. He came to the little brook, within a rod of
                     me, and drank; I remained perfectly still, and he wandered carelessly away into
                     the woods, never discovering that the thing he took for a stump by the spring,
                     was a man.</p>
                  <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6610-00000180"/>
                  <p>I rigged my fishing apparatus and struck through the woods to the stream that I
                     heard, and which flows towards and empties into the Sinnemahoning, within a few
                     rods of the "Saints' Rest." My hook had scarcely touched the water when it was
                     seized by a trout. I found no difficulty in supplying the promised number. I
                     had caught thirty in fishing less than that number of rods, and that after
                     rejecting all the small ones. I added eight to the number, and then returned by
                     the path along the valley, and by which I had entered the forest. I was back
                     while all my companions were yet sleeping soundly in their beds. I said I hear
                     again old sounds that were familiar to me in my boyhood. They are the cow-bells
                     in the woods, and the sheep-bells along the fences; the woodman's axe, as he
                     battles with the forest, and the crash of the trees as they come thundering to
                     the ground; the cackling of fowls in the barn-yards, and the loud baying of the
                     house dog, as some new sound stirs in the forest—all these are like household
                     words to me, but they belong to the "long, long ago."</p>
                  <p>It is a curious thing to watch the growth of a region that is young and wild—to
                     see it change from a wilderness into a fruitful and populous country—to look
                     upon the march of civilization, as it moves along with a slow and toilsome
                     progress, sweeping away the old things of Nature, and spreading out all around
                     the things that pertain to its dominion. Some bold-hearted adventurer marches
                     into the woods, with his axe on one shoulder and his rifle on the other, and
                     falls to chopping down the great trees. Presently there is a spot in the
                     forest, on which the sun shines down bright and clear. The logs and brush are
                     burned up, and a field of grain waves in the summer winds. After a little will
                     be seen a log-house, and a woman sitting on the door-sill with a brood of
                     tough, hardy little ones, tumbling and frolicking about her. You will hear the
                     blows of an axe, as the settler battles with the tall forest trees, and you
                     will hear them through the day crashing and thundering to the ground. You will
                     hear the barking of a house-dog, the cackling of fowls, and the quacking of the
                     ducks and geese. You will hear the loud ding-dong of the cow-bell in the woods,
                     and the tinkling of the sheep-bells along the fences. These are new sounds in
                     the forest, and the old woods may know by them that their time is come. Away
                     off, perhaps miles away, another hardy settler puts up his cabin, and makes war
                     on the ancient forest trees. Year after year the woods are pushed back by the
                     fences. Fields spread out wider and wider, until settlement meets settlement,
                     and the old primeval things have vanished away. Painted houses have succeeded
                     the log-cabins. Flocks and herds, feeding in rich pastures, are everywhere
                     seen. The sound of the woodman's axe, and the crash of the falling timber, is
                     still. The burning fallows, sending their dense columns of smoke, wreathing and
                     curling towards the sky, are things that have<pb n="356"
                        xml:id="VAC6610-00000181"/> ceased to be, for the old woods have been swept
                     away. The ding-dong of the cow-bells and the tinkling of the sheep-bells are no
                     longer heard. Stage-coaches are rolling along the highways, or an engine
                     dragging with lightning speed a train of cars, loaded with human freight, goes
                     thundering along the valleys. Villages and great farms, and school-houses, and
                     church-spires, are everywhere seen, filling up the view that once swept over a
                     boundless forest. Civilization has settled down with its train of concomitants,
                     and the things of old have vanished from its presence.</p>
                  <p>As it has been elsewhere, so will it one day be here. Farms will be spread out
                     in these valleys, fields will creep up the sides of the hills. These streams
                     that have rolled, during the long forever of the past, in untrammelled freedom,
                     roaring and surging in the spring and autumn freshets, and flowing pleasantly
                     and quietly in the summer months, will be harnessed into the service of man—be
                     chained to the revolving wheel, and made to grind corn, or throw the shuttle
                     and spin. True, these tall mountains will stand here in all their solemn
                     grandeur as they now do, but these broad forests that they now overlook will be
                     gone. The great trees that give a sombre beauty to their steep acclivities or
                     crown their lofty summits, will pass into the structure of human dwellings, or
                     edifices erected by human labor.</p>
