THE SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER.   CHAPTER I.  A GLANCE AT NAPOLEON'S CAREER-VICTOR BERTHEtR-THi TWO VILLAINS. I love, contemplating-apart ; From all his honmicidal glory, The traits that soften to our heart, Napoleon's glory!           [CAMPBELL.   NAPOLEON BONEPARTE! is there a name * corded in the history of nations, that will send a thrill of deep admiration, mingled with regret and sorrow, to the heart of the one who reads his story, or muses upon his brilliant career! Born of humble parents, with only a common education, yet with a high spirit and strong mind, we find him, when only six- teen, a second lieutenant in a regiment of artillery, from which he was immedi. ately promoted to the rank of first lieu- tenant in the corps quartered at Valence. At twenty-two, we find the brave young Corsican a captain of artillery, and, in Paris, witnessing the terrible insurrec- I tions of the 22nd of June and 10th of August, with the calm firmness of an old  and experienced warrior. At the seige of Toulon, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of artillery, and as the principal commander on that dread- tfultday, which finally closed in the Tvi   '   tory of the French, he displayed so much courage and decision, that he was im- mediately promoted to the rank of Chief of Battalion, and'appointed to hold that rank in the army of Italy. From this time, we behold the star of the young Napoleon rising with a clear and steady, yet brilliant light, and propa- ising to out-shine all others in point of glory and 'splendpr. Soon we find him the commander of the troops in Paris, and, a short time after, the husband, of the Countess Josephine, widow of the Viscount de Beauharnols. With her, he received the chief command of the Ital. ian armies, though be was' scarcely twenty-six years of age; and now, the brilliant career of the youthful general, who has since filled the world with a fame that can never die, seemed fully begun. With courage, ambition, porse- 'verance, and energy, and a determineia  [tion to conque or die, what wonder that    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6822-00000003"/> the daring commander soon bore the proud banner of a conqueror? The bat- tle of Montenotte,'and the terrible pass- ge of the bridge of Lodi, soon appear upon the page of history, and after the grand victories of Arcola, Rivoli, and Mondovi, the brilliant campaign of the young hero and his army, in Egypt, is before us. Our pen would gladly dwell upon the splendid victories of Alexan- dria,lthe battle of the Pyramids, and the erowning glory of Aboukir, but these are too well known to the intelligent reader, to admit of more than a passing allusion. After his return from Egypt, we find him chosen First Consul of France-and,  immediately after this promotioh, fol- lows the splendid victory of Marengo, and on the 18th of May, 1804, we behold the youthful general, now but thirty-four years of age, with the diadem of the na- tion upon his brow, and known and ac- knowledged as the, EMrPEoR OF THE EBENCH I It is with events in the life of a man like this, that our story will have most to do. In a time li4e this, stirring, thrilling and romantic, the plot of our romance is laid-and, gentle reader, in its pages you will find many a scene worthy of the thrilling season froiu whichl they are delineated. The 10th of June, 1800, five days before the battle of Ma- rengo, is the time when the first scenes of our story are. brought forward. and a few of the characters who are to act in the scenes of the succeeding pages, intro- duced to the reader. The sun was just setting beneath the western horizon, and casting its last beams softly upon the French camp, gil- ding the picturesque tents with a bright tinge of gold. An air of calmness, un- usual to such scenes, seemed to pervade the landscape-and, as the last rays of the sun gleamed over it, jt was indeed   a picture for an artist. For the Back ground, the quiet, tasteful village of Ivrea presented itself-aiid even beyond that, the pointed peaks of the far distant Alps were darkly outlined against the elear blue sky. On the left, the dark waters of the Po glistened in the bright beams of the setting sun-and, on the right, the semicircle of tents, forming a deeply interesting scene, greeted the eye. On the green sward before the tents, re- clined the soldiers, some lying at full length upon the ground, half-asleep, some, 'leaning earelessly upon their guns, smok-. ing and chatting familiarly together, and others walking leisurely about, in groups or couples, conversing upon what would be the probable result of the next battle with the Austrians. The whole army knew that a fierce contest was soon to be engaged in-and with the true spirit of the French soldier, most of them thought as little as possiblef the future, and gave themselves Uo the rest and a creation of the present. But not so with Napoleon. He sat alone in the tent appropriated for his comfort, his thoughts bent entirely upon the future. The head quarters of Melas4 the Austrian commander, were now fixed at Alexandria, and Napoleon feared that  hisintention might be to move for the 'e- sing, cross that river, and by seizing J Milan, open a communication with Aus- tria in that direction; or, by marching to the right, and falling back on Genoa, overwhelm Suebet, and take a position, the right of which might be covered by that city, while the sea was open for sup- plies and provisions, and their flank pro- tected by the British squadron. Either of these movements might be attended with alarming consequences; and Na- poleon, fearing lest the Austrians should yet be victorions, was even now rumina- ting upon the expediency of removing /*   his army nearr to Alexandria, that 1W might lb sure the enemy could not leave' the town'without his knowledge. He knew his soldiers would be willing to0 comply with any measures that he mighti propose; and'he was about to call in one of his aids-de-camp, to confer with him: respecting the expediency of the matter, when the curtain of the tent was raised, and one of the sentinels 'on guard ap-i peared, and bowing gracefully to his, general said- 'There is a young man who has just arrived here, who wishes to see your ex- cellency.' ' Is he French, Austrian, or what?' asked Napoleon. 'Prench. your excellency,' returned the soldier. R*edmit him,' said the general, in a quick, impatient tone, while the fingers of his hand almost' unconsciously grasp- ed the hilt of the dagger thatO was con- ,ealed in his bosom. His suspicions Wvere aroused-he had but little doubt that the stranger was a spy, sent by the Austrians'to ascertain the power and strength of the French army, before trusting themselves to meet them on the open field. But he knew that if it was so, he could detect him. and he feared not to charge him with his suspicions, should the appearance of the stranger tend in any way to confirm them. The guard disappeared, and, in a moment after, the curtain was again raised, and the stranger was admitted into the pres- ence of Napoleon. The man who now stood before the general, was indeed a noble specimen of a man. He was young-his age could not have been more than twenty, and might have been leCs. His form was tall, and of the most perfect symmetry, and though' his limbs were rather-slight and delicate, sti1 he looked like one who   was possessed of strength, activity, and not a little endurance. His chest was full, and remarkably well-shaped, indica- ting strength and power, and his form seemed to possess all the requisites of a good soldier. His face was handsome- decidedly so. As he entered the pres- ence of the general,'he had removed his cap, and the fine intellectual contour of the head, and the noble forehead, were now plainly visible. His hair was jet black, curled around his head in short, crisp curls, which gave him an elegant, graceful air, and added much to 'his otherwise excellent appearance. The brow, which they shaded, was broad, full, and swelling, and its noble outline gave conclusive evidence that the heart with- in would scorn an action that was not truly noble. But that eye-our pen cannot describe it-only those who have witnessed eyes like it, can have an idea of its fascinating power. It was of mid- "ght blackness-but a diamond's bril- liancy could not vie with it in flashing brightness. Evergy, spirit, nobleness, patriotism, and devoted love of the high and truly noble, were all expressed in the burning flash of that brilliant dark eye. It spoke volumes for the soul with- in-and for the heart that beat beneath' that rougli peasant's dress. The lips of the young man were Curved with energy, decision, and spirit, and but confirmed the character that shone in the flash of' the clear dark eyes: As he entered the tent and bowed gracefully to the general, a smile of fascinating sweetness played&amp; around his finely cut lips, rendering his appearance altogether irresistable. The ,suspicions of Napoleon vanished in an instant.. 'General Napoleon Bonaparte, I be- lieve,' said the youth, in a richt deep voice, and again bowing to the general. That is my name,' answered Bona-    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6822-00000004"/> parte, with his characteristic brevity of manner, 'and now that you know my name, you would oblige me by telling me yours, and also your errand.' 'With pleasure,' answered the young man, throwing himself into a seat, and drawing his handkerchieft over his heat- edbrow. 'My name,' he continued, 'is Victor Berthier, and I am a peasant of Ardelle, a village in the southern part of France. I have often heard of you, your army, and your splendid victories, and I burned to be with you to fight for you and France, and win fame and glory on the field of battle. I am ambitious- I desire honor and glory, and the sol- dierks life is the life by which I would win it. I came, on foot, from Ardelle, to join your army, and fight with you against the Austrians. I am determined to win my way ol promotion, by my own merits, and, if you receive me as one of your soldiers, you will not find me back- ward in time of danger. ' Nobly spoken ' exclaimed Napoleon, his keen gray eyes lighting up with an expression of pleasure, unusual to thom, while that fascinating smile, which irra- diated his countenance only when some- hing occurred which was unusually pleasing to him, played over his Strongly marked features. 'You are welcome, my noble young fellow,' continued the general, extending his hand frankly to Victor Berthier, ' your countenance tells ine that your words come from the heart. Henceforth, you may consider yourself one of the soldiers of Napoleon's army.'  'You shall not have cause to rue the d ;y when you extended this hearty wel- r ome to Victor Berthier,' returned the oung man, with a grateful smile. 'I new you would soon see that I Twas (rnest in what I said, for if I have heard 'ightly, you are no despicable judge of (t aracter by appearance.   '.A villain need not attempt to con- ceal his true character from ME,' said Napoleon, with a slight touch of pardon- able pride in his tone, 'and a truly noble soul, likeyours, by no means escape my observation. You are welcome Victor Berthier-and, before many hours have passed, your plain peasant's costume shall be exchanged for the splendid uni-  form of the French army. And if you are faithful, brave, and devoted, you may be assured that your ambition will yet be gratified, and you will be' promoted to a high rank in the army. Are you a good shot?' 'I have been called far the best marks- man in the region of Ardelle, and many of the oldest hunters have acknowledged that I can far excell them with almost- any weapon ' 'I will give your skill a trial,' said the general, rising and taking up a beautiful- ly ornamented SWiss rifle from the table, and signing to Victor to follow him from the tent. The young man arose, and a moment after, the peasant and the gen- eral stood together beneath the blue canopy of'Heaven. '.Here, Berthier, said Napoleon, plac- ing the well loaded rifle in the hands of Victor, 'firethis at that bird,' pointing to one who was flying high above their heads, swiftly cutting the air in the di- rection of the Austrian army's camp, at Alexandria, 'and,' continued the general, 'if you bring it down, I will consider it as a harbinger of a splendid victory over the Austrians, in the direction of whose camp you observe it is flying. If you fail, I shall think it a forerunner of our defeat, Fire steady young man!' Victor raised the rifle, and, with an arm whose nerves'were perfectly 'calm and still, he aimed in the direction of the swiftly flying bird. An instant, and he had fired-the birdjtopped in its   'course-its wings fell powerless against. its sides, and it fell DEAD at the feet of Victor Berthier I 'Hurra that was well done ' chorus- ed the soldiers who stood around, and three hearty cheers were given for the brave young man. The eyes of Napo- leon gleamed with undisguised pleasure. 'My brave young man,' said he, tak- up the dead bird, which lay upon the ground at the feet of Victor, 'this ac- tion has decided, in my mind, that the star of victory is again to shine bright upon us, and the Austrian shall' yet bow again to Napoleon. Victor Berthier, you have shown yourself a skillful marks- man, and your proud dark eye and noble forehead, tell'me that you will be brave and faithful. Victor Berthier, I appoint you First Lieutenant in the 6th Regi- ment of Artillery. Be firm and faithful, and honor yourself and your country, and higher promotion is in store for you.' F Long life and happiness to Lieuten- ant Berthier,' shouted the soldiers, 'may he never draw his sword without cause, or sheath it without honor!' 'General Bonaparte,' said Victor, fall- ing upon his knees, and fervently clasp- ing the hand of Napoleon, 'I cannot thank you sufficiently for this.' 'I wish no thanks,' interrupted the general, with an impatient gesture, and raising the young man from his kneel- ing posture. ' Do your duty, you can- not express your thanks 'in a way more ( acceptable to me, or more beneficial to yourself. 'Captain Leiser,' he continu- ed, turning to an officer who stood near, 'conduct Lieutenant Berthier to his quarters, and then join me again here. Lieutenant Bert4ier, you will be pleased to follow Captain Leiser.' The young man bent his dark eyes upon the general with a glance in which love, admiration and gratitude were   blended; and then turned to follow the captain. Napole6n gazed after them for a moment, and then entered his tent, very well pleased with what had just transpired. Many of the soldiers i had witnessed the scene between the general and the young peasant, and, to most of them, it was a scene that brought only emotions of pleasure to their hearts. A new sol- dier had been added to their army, and one whom they felt well satisfied, would prove' himself worthy of the favor in which Napoleon seemed already to re- gard him. But there were two of them, who had stood not far from Napoleon during the scene, who did not seem so well pleased as the others. One was a tall, well form- ed soldier, who might have been twenty- five or twenty-eight years of age, or pdr- haps older. His eyes and hair were black as those of Berthier, and his form, though considerably larger, was as ele- gant and symmetrical, yet in no other respect did he resemble the young lieu- tenant. Indeed, he seemed the very op- posite of the young peasant in other characteristics; for, though his face was one which most'people would have called decidedly handsome, still there was in his appearance none of that noble beauty which stamped Victor Berthier as a truly noble man. His dark eye had in its strangely brilliant flash an expression that would have caused most people to shrink from him, and his lips, though finely cut, were curved with such a sar- donic smile that it destroyed all their beauty. The brow, which was now sha- ded by the handsome military cap, had none of the noble outlines that charac- terised young Berthier. Though ex- pressive of determination and a proud. spirit, still the seal of all conquering IN- TELLECT 'as not stamped upon it, and    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6822-00000005"/> without that no countenance can be truly beautiful. He was dressed in the cos- tume of a second lieutenant, in all the gay style of the French uniform. His companion who, likewise, seemed displeased at the favor with which Ber- thier was received, was a man not so tall by several inches as the firit mentioned one, nor so elegantly and symmetrically formed. He was probably of about the same age as his companion, though his countenance was far from being as hand- some. Eis eyes were grey, small, pierc- ing, and with a cunning, evil expression, that would not prepossess a stranger in his favor. His hair was of a reddish brown, and out closely to his head, giv- ing him the appearance of 4 convict just escaped from Botany Bay. His thin lips were curved with a scornful, sarcas- tic smile, and the whole expression of the countenance was such as would cause the observer to think that the soul with- in/him was steeped in crime. Well, Delaney, what do you think of that?' asked the one in the!eutenant's uniform of his companion, as they walk- ed away arm-in-arm, after Napoleon and Victor Berthier had separated. 'I am not well pleased with it; young Berthier is one whom I used to know, and hate, too. He is from the very vil- lage from which I am; Ardelle, in the South of France. I used to knew him when a boy, and he was always cracked up as being so confoundedly good, so' handsome, and pretended to know every thing, that I was always thrown in the shade, and Victor Berthier carried off i the prize for every thing-at school as well as all other places. He always ap- peared to stand in my way--and I hated him, and determined to revenge myself upon him in the future. One day he publicly insulted,and I burned to avenge the affront immediately. That night, as   I was going home, I waylaid him, stay bed him, and left him for dead. I then left Ardelle, supposing that my worse enemy was no more. But there I was mistaken-for I soon learned that the wounds I gave him, though severe, were not mortal, and that he had recruited.- Of course it would not do for me to re- turn to Ardelle, and so I wandered about for two years, until I fell in with Napo- leon's army, in which I enlisted. My countenance has changed so much, that Berthier could not possitly recognize me-therefore I shall have no fears on that score. I never expected to see him here, and been received by the general with a favor that I never saw him give to a stranger before. First Lieutenant of a regiment of artillery I and so soon! But we'll see, Master Victor; this is not always to last: my revenge, though once foiled, shall not be again--I will make sure work next time! Ah, Lieut. d'Elsey, this pert young chap shall not be the general's favorite long! I'll soon fix him!: 'Your sentiments in respect to young Berthier are precisely like mine,' re- turned d'Elsey, in a: tone of ill-concealed satisfaction, 'though my enmity to him does not arise from the same cause.- Had not he came forward, just at this unlucky time, I should have been ap- pointed first lieutenant, and the promo- tion to that post is whatAI have been looking forward to with anxious hopes for some time. Now, to have my expec- tations crushed and disappointed, when Mhey would h've been so soon realized, and all by a beardless youth, too, whose principal qualification seems to be that he can fire a riflelpretty steadily-this is too much. From this moment ,'m in- fluence is against Victor Berthier. I will ruin him if possible, by artfully working upon Napoleon's suspicions:-   if this cannot be-I will have his heart's blood! Have I your assistance in this matter, Delaney 2' 'I will do anything to revenge myself upon Victor Berthier!' returned the villain, with an energy that showed he was in earnest. 'Then we understand each other 2' 'Perfectly.' 'But we must leave this subject for   the present, for there is the drum beating to quarters. I shall have more to say upon the matter to-morrow.' And the two villains separated, each to his different quarters, to dream over their meditated revenge. Look for a moment, Victor Berthier ' There is a threatening cloud lowering over the bright star of thy destiny I    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6822-00000006"/> CHAPTER II. THE PLOT--NAPOLEON AND   THE TWO VILLAINS.--THEIR   PLANS  FOILED.-THE THREAT OF REVENGE. "Shall mortal hand, with murder gory, Cause its brother's blood to flow ' Sun of Heaven! arrayed in glory Rise-forbid-avert the blow.' [Translated from the great Tragedy of Medea, by Campbell.   THE sun arose bright and cloudless on the morning of the 11th of Jun, and as soon as the life-giving beams gladdens the re-awakened earth with her golden radiance, Victor Berthier left the tent where he had passed the night, to gaze upon the first morning scene which he had witnessed beneath the fair and sun- ny skies of classic Italy. With a heart beating high in his bosom, and a mind full of bright and glorious hopes for the future, which his imagination painted in colors as bright as the glorious land- scape around him, he ascended a small elevation at but a short distance from the camp, to view the fair scene spread out around him. It was indeed beauti- ful-sunrise in lovely, glorious Italy I To one like Victor Berthier, an ar- dent admirer of the beauties-of. nature, thescene spread out before him awas of the most sublime beauty. The morning couch fi om which the sun arose to bright- en the earth beneath, was of every varie ty of shade and color, from the palest blue and purest white, to the brightest   crimson, and richest purple. On the left, the waters of the Po were sparkling and flashing in the sunrays, and on the right, the tents of the army formed a pecturesque and expressive scene.- Above, the cloudless vault of Heaven, of the richest and deepest blue, was the only visible canopy, and beneath, the soft emerald carpet of Nature's weaving, spotted with fair wild flowers of every shape and hue, was spread out in varied beauty. Above, beneath, and around, all was characteristic of fair and sunny Italy-that classic land of beauty! 'As Victor Berthier gazed upon the scene spread out before him, and com- pared it with his own bright and cloud- less prospects, he felt that he had never before been so supremely happy. He again renewed his determination to win f the love and confidence of the great gen- eral, by his bravery and faithfulness, and to open his own way to fame and -, glory, by fully deserving whatever praise t might be bestowed upon him. Victor t Berthier was ambitious, in the full sense   of the word, and he had determined to win, on the battle-field, a name that should never die. 'Yes,' soliquized he, gazing down upon the camp below him, 'THERE is the man, to whom, and my own bravery, I must owe my future fame and glory. I will fight bravely-he will raise me to power and influence. And how joyful will my poor nlother be, when I return home to her arms, covered with honor and glory, to spend the remainder of my days in peace and quiet!  And sweet little Olise, too, how she will welcome her brother babk to our village home again, after his long absence! And how anx- iously theywill watch for tidings of the absent son and brother, and when they learn how I am rising in fame and glory, they will be happy!' And is there no other, Victor, in thy native village, besides thy mother and sister, who claim a portion. of thy heart? No fair young maiden, whose bright eyes have fired thy soul with an ardent pas- sion? None: the altar of thy heart is yet pure and unsullied by the breath of love; thy spirit has not yet bowed to it? magic power, or felt its all-controlling influence. The charms of beauty and wit have been lost upon thee; ambition is the only ardent passion which thou hast ever experienced. As Victor stood musing upon his fu- ture prospects, the sound of voices sud- a denly interrupted his meditation, and he was about leaving the spot, when he a heard his own name spoken by one of the t persons, and, almost unconscious of what c he wag doing, he hesitated and listened. t A   cluster of bushes hid the speakers t from  sight, and prevented them from,  observing him, though ie could plainly t hear every word that was spoken. He a listened eagerly, and the fire in his dark   e eye became strangely bright as the words t of the speakers fell upon his ear. 'I don't know exactly how we are to - destroy the young fellow's credit with , the general,' said the voice of a person, whom the reader will recognize as De- lancy, for Napoleon is the most perfect reader of character that I ever saw. It would be a very difficult task to attempt to deceive him-yet I believe it may be done; at least, I shall try it. And if this does not succeed, as I said before I shall have his heart's blood!' 'We must be expeditious in the mat- ter,' returned his companion, who was no other than Lieutenant d'Elsey,' for Ber- thier has been received very favorably by Napoleon, and I cannot disguise the fact that he is just such a character as will win the entire confidence and affection of the general, and soon too. You are from Ardelle, and know all his early history. You can testify that he has born a very bad character there-that he is cunning and deceitful, and his prin- cipal object in coming here, is to learn the strength of, our army, and get some- what acquainted with our plans for the future, and then report all to the Aus- trians. In a word, you can represent to him that you have understood, from un- doubted authority, that Victor Berthier, whom his too hasty partiality has al- ready raised to the post of lieutenant, is a SPY.' 'Your plan is a capital one, Lieuten- ant d'Elsey,' exclaimed Delaney, in a tone of exultation, 'for nothing will so quickly rouse the anger of Napoleon, as the suspicion that one of his men is treacherous. Once get the general to believe that Berthier has any , such in- tentions, and he need mot hope for favor any longer.'  ' And I think it will not be very diffi- cult to persuade the general that Ber-    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6822-00000007"/> thier is a spy; for, yqu know, upon such - an accusation, he judges more hastily, a and often more unjustly than on one of e less inpoltance. He will forgive-any- thing quicker than any approach to a treachery.' ' That's true enough,' returned Delan- 1 Afby--btut he has already taken a fancy  t youing Berthier, that 1 am somewhat m afraid that my story, however artfully I i may tell it, will not suffice to convince i him that his young favorite is in reality 1 a spy. My word alone will not do, I e shall need some one to confirm it.' 'And that you shall have,' exclaimed i d'Elsy, energetically. 'We will agree, c before speaking to the general upon the ( subject, exactly what kind of a story to i tell, and, if he wishes evidence, you can refer him to me. I will repeat the same story that yow have done, and he cannot doubt but that it is true.' ' That is a good idea,' said Delaney, 'and I think will succeed. Ah, young Berthier, you will not be the general's favorite long!' ' And if we want more evidence than that,' continued D'Elsey, 'I think it can be procured. There are already several young fellows in the different divisions, whose only'chance of promotion, at pre- sent, lay in their being appointed to the  post of first lieutenant of the 6th regi- ment of artillery, which post you will recollect, was the only one vacant. Each one expected to get it, and now that young Berthier had stepped in and car- ried off. the prize, each one of them would do anything to get him out of the way, andrevenge himself upon him.- Though I should have got the appoint- ment, without doubt there were several others who saw in the vacant post a chance of promotion, and each one ,of those would be glad enough to get Ber- thier out of the way. There's Chatillon,   Alvinzi and Savary, in the 6th regiment, and I don't know how many in the oth- er regiments.' 'Well, but how are these to aid us' asked Delaney, thoughtfully. L Why, man, don't you see V' impatient- ly returned d'Elsey, 'this is the way I  think we may get them to aid us. We will first ascertain, to a certainty, how many would be likely to think as we do in regard to the subject, and then let them into the whole plot, with the strict- est charge of cautiousness and secresy. I know we can trust Chatillon and Sav- ary-and I think we can Alvinzi. We can all agree together upon what kind of a stoiy to tell Napoleon, and then if he wishes more evidence, we can bring them forward. Our stories respecting Berthier being all alike-as we will take care that they shall be-the general can- not doubt the truth of our statements.' 'Capital!' exclaimed Delaney. The fellow can't possibly escape. We'll get him down from his fine station in the good opinion of the general, as quickly and as easily as he got there.' 'That we will,' returned d'Elsey ex- ultingly. 'But this business must be commenced soon-this very day, if pos- sible, that young Berthier may not have time to ingratiate himself too far into Napoleon's favor.' ,'Then we had best go and sound the others upon the matter immediately.' 'I am assured that Chatillon, Alvinzi  ad Savary will join us against the Lieu- tenant. But it will be best to be cau- tious even with them, and ascertain their - true sentiments respecting Berthier, be- fore we allow them to know anything of I our plot.' I  ' That is true. You take care of the dissatisfied ones in the 6th regiment, and - I will pick out the others, wherever they 1 are to be found. You need not fear for   my discretion, Lieutenant d'Elsey-I am cautious and cunning and can carry on the plot to perfection.' 'But as to the story we are' all to tell the general respecting Berthier-how are we to agree about that?' '0, we will meet again after we have sounded the others, and all debate to- gether upon the matter. Come, let's to the camp.' 'Dastardly villains!' muttered Victor to himself, as the two scoundrels walked away towards the camp, not suspecting that their conversation had all been over- heard by the subject of it. 'I would have your lives for this!' he continued5 his eyes flashing fire, and his whole frame quivering with strong excitement, 'but they are too low and ignoble, for me to stoop to stain my hands with your blood! But you shall not destroy my favor with the general; he knows too much of hu- man nature to be thusdeceived I And, if I am not mistaken, he would know by your very look that you were base, cow- ardly villains! You would frame the lowest and basest of falsehoods to destroy my good name-and, not satisfied with that, would enlist others in the hellish plot, that you might not stand in any danger of failing in your demoniac pur- pose! But truth willfoil you; I fear not your machinations. But,' he con- tinued, now speaking more to himself that to the villiaus who had just passed from his sight behind a large cluster of trees, 'it will be best to say nothing of 'this to the general now, for he will find it out soon enough. He will not listen to their base fabrications, Ifeel satisfied. And if he seems to believe them, I can step forward and confront them with the truth that I overheard all their plans but this very morning, and I know' the guilty villains will'not be able to bear up beneath my bold accusiation. Their 9       * ,    countenances will betray them--and the quick-sighted Napoleon will not fail to observe it.' And with a heart but little less light than when he had ascended, the youth- ful lieutenant descended the eminence, and leisurely wended his way to the camp again. Though he could notshake off a kind of an'xiety that still preyed upon his spirits, he felt but little fears for the issue of the plot; he trusted in Napoleon's penetration of character, and his own innocence as regarded any treacherous intentions. He' had come to join the army for the very reason which he had given Napoleon-to fight for France, and win fame and glory on the field of battle! It was near the Middle of the after- noon, that Napoleon again sat alone in his tent, his thoughts fixed upon the probable issue of their approaching bat- tle with the Austrians. He had deci- ded to remove his camp on the morrow to Voglhera, which would be nearer Al- exandria, and preparations were even now making to that effect. Victor Ber- thier, the young lieutenant, had shown himself a good dnd efficient assistant during these preparations, and the good opinion Napoleon had first formed of him, was by no means lessened. 'There is a soldier without who de- sires to see your excellency,' said a guard respectfully, as be raised the curtain of the tent within which sat the general. 'Who.?' asked Napoleon, iinpatient- ly. 'One Delaney, of the second division, returned the guard. And his business?' 'I know not, but should judge from his manner that it was something quite important.' Admit him,' was the careless reply of the general, and in a moment more,    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6822-00000008"/> the guard disappeared, and Delaney, all smiles and bows, entered the tent.- Though Napoleon had never particular- ly noticed the countenance of this vil- lain, he felt assured, at the first glance, that he was a man a3 devoid of honor, as Victor Berthier was the soul of it.- His impression of the character of the man, from his appearance, was by no means favorable to the scheming villain, and he felt assured that he had come for no good purpose. 'You will be pleased to name your errand as quickly and briefly as possi- ble, Monsieur Delaney,' said the general, in the short, business like manner which characterized him, while he fixed his clear, searching eyes upon the counte- nance of the villain before him. 'I come, your excellency,' replied De- lancy, in a bland musical voice, 'to speak to you of one Victor Berthier, who was admitted with considerable favor into the army yesterday afternoon.' ' Ha ' quickly exclaimed Napoleon, 'what of him?' ' He is a sry, your excellency P 'Thou liest 1' cried the general, start- ing from his seat and fixing his flashing eyes angrily upon Delancy, 'Victor BIerthier is the soul of honor 1' I trust your excellency will not be angry with me for speaking, the truth, humbly returned Delancy, 'for I know what I speak is the truth.' Prove it then!' cried the thoroughly aroused general. 'Prove that Victor Berthier is a spy, and the moment you succeed in doing it, to my' satisfaction, that moment shall be his last I Quick man, tell your story quickly 1' continued the general, with anjimpatient stamp of his fot, ' I have no time to waste in idle words '    . * 'Well, then, to be brief,' said Delan- cy, assuming an air of the humblest de-   votion and submission; 'I was born and nurtured in the same village witi Victor Berthier--Ardelle, in the south of France-and knew him from his child- hood, to thd time when I joined your army, About Isix months since. The character he always bore in Ardelle was that of the most artful and practiced de- ceiver that could be found. A stranger would place the most unbounded confi- dence in him, and think him one of the noblest of men, until he ascertained that his trust was sadly misplaced, and was moit certainly betrayed. Even your ex- cellency, though a capital judge of char- acter, has been deceived by this consum- 'mate villain.' 'Is this all you have to say?' asked Napoleon with a gesture of impatience. 'It is not,' promptly rep!ed Delaney. 'A few moments sinccone of my friends from Ardelle drove up to the camp and handed me this letter. It speaks for it- self. If your excellency will be pleased to read it, you will not need. more e '- dence, I think to convince you of the true character of Victor Berthier. I thought it best to inform you of matters immediately, that you might bring te. young villain to justice before he would be able to do mnch more mischief.' 'You were VERY considerate,' said Napoleon with a scornful curl of his fine- ly cut lips, as he took the letter which Delancy extended to him, and carelessly unfolded it. The general glanced his eye over it, and read the following lines, written in a bold, dashing, manly hand: 'Dear friend Delancy: Last Tuesday morning, that villainous young rascal, Victor Berthier, who has long been re- garded as the worst and most degraded character in the village, left Ardelle, and, as Ia few hours after learned, for the French army in which you are en- listed, cpmmanded by General Napoleon s    Bonaparte. I learned further, that his errand was that of a sPY, and that he in- tended to ascertain as near as possible the numbers and strength of the French army, as well as their principal plans for the future, and then report all to Melas, the Austrian commander. As I knew his character so well, and his facilities for deceiving even the most practiced reader of human nature, I thought it quite probable that I had been reliably informed respecting his villainous inten- tions, and considered it best to inform you of the facts immediately, that you might communicate them to the general, and perhaps save the army from the se- rious effects of his villainy. You had best inform the general immediately, and have the rascally Berthier taken care of. But do not send him back here again, 'as the whole village are rejoicing that we have at last got rid of him, and they would not be at all pleased should he return again. Hoping that you will heed the information herein given, and profit by it, I hasten to subscribe my- self, yours, in friendship, A. LECARD, Governor of Ardelle.' 'That is not sufficient evidence,' said Napoleon, casting the base forgery from him, where is the messenger who car- ried the letter?' 'He-he has returned home,' stam- mered Delancy, scarcely knowing what to reply 'to this question of the general. 'I would like to have more evidence on this subject,' said Napoleon, 'for I still believe this young man to be just what he seems to be, a noble and faith- ful young fellow. .If he is a spy, he shall  be punished as one; if he is, not, he shall not be punished upon mere sus- picion, and a ffttlo proof like this, which I consider as very doubtful information, and not to be relied on in a matter of   life and death. Can you bring forward more evidence, Monsieur Delaney?' 'I can, your .excellency,' was the re- ply of the villain, as he arose from hi seat and stepped' carelessly to the doe of the tent. He spoke a few words t, some person without, and then returner. followed by Elsey, his confederate i. wickedness. The latter bowed with th. grace of a finished courtier, to the genm eral, and then, with an easy, elegant airv stood silently awaiting the commandi of Napoleon.  ' You are Lieutenant d'Elsey, are you not?' asked the general, fixing his keen gray eyes upon the dark, yet handsome countenance of the man before him. 'That is my name, your excellency,' was the reply. ' And you are from Ardelle ' ques- tioned Napoleon. 'I am, your excellency. 'And once knew Victor Berthier ' Aye, and do now,' replied d'Elsey. 'What is the character he has gener- ally born in Ardelle,' questioned the general. ' That of one of the most consummate villains that ever breathed,' returned d'Elsey, energetically, 'I do not be- lieve there ever lived another person who has mastered the art of deceiving so perfectly. His fine appearance, elegant manners, and good address, always be- speak for him a warm reception among those who know not his character. Is it not strange that your excellency should have been deeeived? There are but very few who can penetrate such a mask of deceit as the countenance of Victor Bbrthier.' 'I should think,' said Napoleon, with a sarcastic smile, 'by your account ot him, that young Berthier was equal, i point of deceit and wickedness, to a d' mon of the infernal regions.'    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6822-00000009"/> 'He is so, in fact,' was the cool reply ot'Elsey, 'and, general, if you could listen to the sad stories of the many wretched, miserable beings,once beauti- ful and - happy maidens, whom this das- tardly deceiver has seduced and ruined, you would say that he was a demon in- deed.' 'And then, among his other crimes, he has been a seducer of female virtue? said Napoleon, inquiringly. 'A most cruel and heartless one,' promptly returned d'Esley. If he met with a beautiful or interesting girl, he was sure to be her ruin.' Liar I thou knowest that is a per- jury base as thine own heart!' cried a voice of thunder, as the curtain of the tent was raised, and VICTOR BERTHER stepped in before them. As he stood there in all his noble majesty, that group was a study for an artist, D'Elsey, with a cheek blanched with fear at the sight of Berthier, and a frame trembling, yet erect and haughty, stood .before the youthful lieutenant, endeavoring to shake off the fear that, in spite of his utmost exertions"to the contrary, would blanch his cheek and cause his frame to tremble. Immediately in front of him, with his arms folded upon his bosom, and. his whole frame quivering with the strong- est excitement, stood Victor Berthier, forming as noble-looking a specimen of a man as ii-very often seen. His dark, searching eyes seemed to emit flashes of fire, as their terrible glance was bent upon D'Elsey, The veins in the broad full brow were swollen and distended, and the cheek flushed with the hue of powerful excitement. The lip was curv- ed with an expression of scorn, contempt and pride, and the whole frame gave evidence of strong mental excitement- Napoleon, the only one of the group who was in any degree calnm, stood near Ber-   thieris keen grey eyes fixed with an expression of pride and admiration, upon the young man's noble features His fine lips were curved with a proud smile -it was evident that he believed the young man before him innocent of the dark crimes that had ibeen asserted against his character. ' Dare you deny the charges 1 have brought against you, Victor Berthier? I asked d'Elsey, endeavoring to shake off his trepridation and fear, and bring the bold assurance of his half-demon nature into action. ' Deny them, perjured villain!' cried Victor, in a voice that caused both d'Elsey and Delancy to turn pale and tremble violently,'Deny them? The charges brought against me are the basest and most villainous perjuries ever spoken I That letter, which yonder vil- lain handed the general but a short time since, is also a forgery, got up by a band of demons in human shape, to destroy my good name  And all for envy-for revenge! And as if the humiliating ac- cusation that I was the basest of all characters, a treacherous sPY, was not enough, you added to that an even darker and more degrading crime-that of a seducer of female virtue! God in heaven knows that I would die a thousand deaths rather than sully the honor of a defence- less aftd innocent female. There is no crime that you could name that I would shrink from with horror sooner than that-none more demon-like and degrad- ed  God above knows that I am in- nocent of all these charges, that my honor is, as it has ever been, unsullied by the slightest' breath of crime of in- famy! The perjuries you have spoken are as base and false as he demon heart that originated them!' Even at that moment, Napoleon could not repress a proud smile of admiration,   as he gazed upon the noble countenance of the excited young man before him.- There was a fire and spirit in those dark- ly-flashing eyeFthat told of a s'pirit with- in that would not brook this base insult to his character, without an attempt to disprove it. "ieutenant Berthier,' said the gener- al, laying his hand upon the arm of Vic- tor, and speaking kindly, 'you are deep- ly excited, and I fear too much so' for - your good.. Think not too much of this, my young friend-I believe you 'inno- cent of all these base charges against your -honor.' ' God bless you for those words!' fer- vently ejaculated Victor, falling upon his knees and clasping the hand of Na- poleon, while a flood of tears that he could not repress, fell,upon it. Even. the stern general was affected-and from that hour he LOVED the young man whom he now felt assured possessed all the truly noble traits of character that stamp a perfect man. 'Arise, my young friend,' said the general kindly, 'you shall not suffer for this. Lieutenant d'Elsey,' said he, turn- ing to the crest-fallen villain, 'you may retire for a few moments. Captain Leis-; er,' he continued, addressing a guard who at that moment enteed at his bid- ding, 'you will please tike Lieutenant d'Elsey in charge. You know your du- ty, captain,' said the general, significant ly. 'I do, your excellency,' replied the' captain with a respectful bow, and a mo- ment after, Lieutenant d'Elsey was led from the tent, by the guard. The feelings of Delaney were indes- cribable. 'Can it be possible,' thought he, while his cheek blanched at the bare idea of such a thing, 'that Napoleon has discovered our plot,' and knows all?-- And that d'Elsey has been led away, to   'be put under guard, and punished?- But if this is the case, it is quite cer- tain that they would have sent me off also, as I am as much engaged in the matter as d'Elsey, and perhaps more.- However, I'll stand to the point a little while longer, at least; though I have , very faint hopes of making the general believe our story of Berthier. I've got Chatillon, Savary, and the rest to bring. in yet.' 'Monsieur Delancy,' said Napoleon, 'I have a few questions to ask you, and I wish you to answer them promptly.' 'You may rest assured I shall do so,' replied Delaney. 'In the first place,' said the general, 'how long did you reside in Ardelle?' ' Seven years,' replied Delaney. 'And Lieutenant d'EIsey resided there the same length of time.' 'He did,' replied Delancy, with a slight hesitation in his tone,- 'Did he come from Ardelle' at the same time you did.' 'He did.' 'And that was about six months since?' ' It was.' 'And perhaps you can remember what color the house was in which the magistrate who wrote that letter lived?' 'It-it-was-white,-no, yellow- no--I do not reollect, your excellency, what color it was,' stammered the vil-  lain. 'If you were there but six months ago,' thundered the general, 'and had lived there for seven years, you know what color the governor's house was, and I command you to answer my question promptly and immediately.' 'The house is white,' said Delaney, with as much calmness as he was-master of. 'You are SURE that it is a house built of wood and painted white, are you?'    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6822-00000010"/> 'Perfectly, upon further thought.' ' And,' continued Napoleon, while his keea eyes sparkled strangely, 'you will perhaps remember whether M. ILecard is married or not?' He is not, replied Delancy. 'His age ' 'About-thir--forty-forty-five, I1 should think.' 'That will do' said Napoleon, and turning to Captain Leiser, who at that moment entered the tent, he ordered him to bring forward Lieutenant d'El- sey. A few moments elapsed and Cap- tain Leiser returned, followed -by d'Elsey. ' Lieutenant d'Elsey,' said Napoleon, 'I have a few questions to ask you, and I wish you to answer them promptly.' 'I will do so, replied d'Elsey, in an easy, careless tone. ' How long did you reside in Ardelle?' questioned the general. About seventeen years.' ' And Monsieur Delaney resided there the same length of time ' ' He did not come to the village until I had been there about three years.' 'Did he ceme from Ardelle about the same time you did ' 'I left a year before he did.' 'When did he leaver' 'Some two years since.' 'Do you remember the color of the governor's house?' 'It was built of gray stone, with green doors, and the window panels dia- mond shaped and very small. 'Is M. Lecard marfied?' 'He is, and has several children.' ' What is his age ' ' Near seventy.' During this cross examination, Napo- leon had stood between Delancy and d'Elsey in such a manner that either could see the countenances of the other, and consequently Delaney would have   no opportunity, either by looks or signs, to direct his confederate in wickedness in what manner to answer the general's questionN Napoleon nw stood aside, and, upon the first glance at the pale, despairing features of Delaney. d'Elsey knew that he had said what iad betray- ed them. Napoleon gazed upon the dis- comfited villains with an expression in which scorn and pity were blended. 'Your rascally plot has failed,' said her addressing the crest-fallen rogues, who both looked as if they would sink into the ground for very shame: 'The answers which you have respect- ively given to the questions I have asked you, have every one of them differed ve- ry much. This proves that you know nothing about Ardelle, that you have not resided there, and that you know no- thing of Victor Berthier. I regarded him with distinguishing marks of my favor, and raised him immediately to a lieutenancy, which you have 'been long wishing for. This excited your envy and malice, and you determined to ruin him; but you have not succeeded. The offence, though a bold one, shall not be punished too severely, as it has not led to any serious consequences. I shall deprive you both of your commissions, as second and third lieutenant's, and, whatever may be your conduct you can- not be promoted again for three months. This is a sentence far milder than you deserve, but if you confess that the dark charges you have laid to Victor Berthier are only accusations of your own fram- ing, to deprive him of his post and the place he held in my favor, and, hereafter give me no cause to find fault with you; ths is'all the punishment I shall inflict upon you. Do you confess that these charges against his character, and that letter, were all forged?' Both the villains sullenly confessed   to the plot, and with a few words of cau- tion and advice, Napoleon allowed them to leave the tent. which they did without waiting for a second permission. They walked away, arm in arm, until they reached a spot where they would sot be overheard, and then the full tide of their wrath and chagrin burst forth. 'This shall not be the last of this matter,' cried Delancy, his gray eyes lighting up with an expression almost   fearful to behold,'my watchword shall henceforth be REVENGE I  'Yes, REVENGE! and on both Napo- leon and Victor Berthier! We will crush both beneath the power of our never-sleeping vengeance!' returned d'Elsey, in a voice resembling the heavy mutterings of distant thunder. How far this threat was executed, the future page of our story shall acquaint the reader.    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6822-00000011"/> CHAPTER III. TIE BATTLE OF MARENGO. Again!-again!--again! And' the havoc did not slack, Till a feeble cheer the Austrian To our' cheering sent us back! [CAMPBELL.   IT was the 14th of June, 1800-and a brighter day never opened upon the sunny land of Italy, than this, which was  to fill such a high position in the history of nations. The rays of the sun fell with unclouded glory upon the broad plain of Marengo, where was encamped  the French army, and lighted up the scene with a sunny brightness that ill accord- ed with the terrible carnage that was so soon to follow. On the 12th of June, two days before. Napoleon had advanced his headS quar- ters to Voghera, and on the 19th to St. Juliana, in the midst of the great plain of Marengo, where he could better ob- serve the movement of Melas and his army. As he still saw nothing of the enemy, Bonaparte concluded that Melas had ac- tually retreated -from Alexandria, hav- ing, notwithstanding the temptation af- forded by the level ground around him. prefered withdrawing, most probably to Genoa, to the hazard of a battle. He was still more confirmed in this belief, when, pushing forward as far as the vil- lage of Marengo, he, found it occupied only by an Austrian rear-guard,' which offered no persevering resistance to the French, but retreated from the village without opposition.   Bonaparte could n'o longer doubt that Melas had eluded him by marching off  by one of his flanks, and probably by his right. Determined not to be foiled in this manner, Napoleon, with his charac- teristic energy and strength of mind, gave orders to Dessaix, whom he had en- trusted with the command of the reserve, to march towards Rivoltz, with a view to observe the communications with Genoa and in this manner, the reserve was re- moved half a day's march from the rest of the army, which had like to have pro- duced most sinister effects upon the great battle that followed, which has made that memorable day, one of  the most celebrated in the history of nations. But, some time after Dessaix, with the reserve, had left for Rivoltz, Napoleon made the important discovery that, on the evening of the 13th, Melas had con- centrated his forces in front of Alexan- dria, divided by the river Bormida, from the proposed field of fight; and the French general, undeceived concerning the intentions of his,enemy, made with all haste the necessary preparations for battle, and failed not to send orders to kDessaix to return as speedily as possible and-join the army. - The crimson clouds that herald the approach of day, were just brightening   up the eastern sky on the morning of the "th, but the army of Bonaparte were already upon their guard, and endeavor- ing to account for the sudden disapper- ance of the Austrians, for no traces of them were now to be seen. Dessaix had been sent several hours before, to Ri- voltz, with the intention of watching the communications with Genoa, as they had had solme suspicion that M-elas had re- treated in tnat direction.  Napoleon, as well as most of his offi- cers, had passed a sleepless night, for their anxietj for the safety of their ar- my, would not allow them to think of slumber. Victor Berthier, the young lieutenant whom Napoleon had seen fit to honor as a friend, had been with the general dur- ing most of the night, but had left him some two hours since, for rest, as the general thought, but in reality, for a far, different purpose! Napoleon, with a few of his generals, and other officers, the companions of his military career, sat silently around the small table in the general's tent, each meditating upon the battle that must soon be fought. A light burned faintly upon the table, and threw its sickly glare upon those stern countensnces, lighting them up with a strange glow, and giving a peculiar glitter to the gild-. ed uniform which they wore. There sat the intrepid Lannes, the hero of the bloody field of Montebello, his lips com- pressed with the stern determination of true courage, and his dark eye flashed with a peculiar fire. Opposite to him, sat Napoleon himself-his, countenance pale as ever, though marked with even more courage and firmness than usual, and his restless gray eyes .expressing some of the lion spirit that was burning  within him. Suddenly rising his heed;   he broke the silence by abruptly exclam- ing--Where is Lieutenant Berthier?' 'He left us more than two hours ago,' promptly replied Lannes; 'if your ex? cellency desires to see him, I think he may be found at his quarters. He was doubtless weary, and wished to get a few ,hours sleep before engaging id the roar and din of battle.' 'I think not,' as the reply of Napo- leon, that young nSan is too deeply in- terested in the issue of this battle, to sleep now. I fear he may have' been foully dealt with. He has at least. two bitter enemies in our army, who would not scruple to destroy him if it was in their power. I fear he may have fallen in with them.' He was interrupted by the sound of horses hoofs rapidly nearing the tent, i and all simultaneously sprang to their feet.' 4n instant more, and the charger had stopped in its lightning-like course, and Victor Berthier sprang from it, and rushed into the tent where stood the general and his companions. 'What has happened?  Tell us in- stantly 1' cried the general, springing to- wards the excited Berthier.  'The Austriansl' was the ithrilling answer of the young lieutenant, 'they are even now marching towards u's H And"t#ey are not more than two leagues distant! Melqs is at their head, lead- ing an army forty thousand strong, and in less than an hour they will be upon us!' 'How do you know?' sternly asked the general. 'I half suspected all was not'right, and I left you to assure myself thatndne of the enemy were near. I discovered the army, and rdde at the greatest speed to inform yod!  General, something must be done, and quickly!'    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6822-00000012"/> cWhat shall we do?' asked Captain Leiser, who had heard Victor communi- cate this thrilling intelligence to Napo- leon, 'the Austrian army is forty thou- sand strong, and, now that you have sent away six thousand with Dessaix, we can muster but twenty thousand. What can we do with such disparity of numbers?' ' WE MUST FIGHT T4EM ' was the firm, decided reply of the'auntless hero of Lodi, and then rushing from the tent, he cried in a voice of thunder-' To ARMS! TO ARMS I THE AUSTRIANS ARE UPON US!' These words, spoken by a voice that no one dared to disQbey, had the desir- ed effect. But a few moments had elaps- ed, before every man had sprang to his feet, and was awaiting the further orders of the general. Orders were given, and executed with almost incredible qiick- ness and celerity. The tents were soon struck, for it was evident that there could be d'o better place for a battle than the great plain that had been occupied for their camp. Theartillery of the army was placed in a most advantageous position in an incredibly short space of time-- and, 'ere half an hour from the time when Victor Berthier had arrived at the camp with the intelligence that the Aus- trians were marching towards them, all things were placed in readiness fgr their approach. The divisions of the army now formed in a regular manner-each knew his place, and took it without wait- ing forfarther orders. Napoleon,mounted upon a spirited jet-black steed, was rid- ing in all directions, giving orders in his brief, laconic style, and scanning, with his restless eagle eye, every portion of the army,that nothing which might tend to their disadvantage could escape his vision. Lannes, also mounted upon a spirited charger, was viewing the army with the eye of a practiced soldier, and detecting every error that might be   made in the formation of the columns.- Neither were the other officers idle; all seemed to enter, heart and soul, into the thrilling importance of the preparations for a great and dicisive battle. General,' said young Victor Berthier, riding up to Napoleon, and speaking in a hurried, anxious tone, 'where are' d'Elsey and Delancy, of the 6th regi- ment?' ' Are they not in their regixment?' quickly'asked the general. ' They are, not,' promptlyreplied Vic. tor, 'I have not seen them since 'yester- day afternoon, and though I have been looking for them for some time, I can find no traces of them.' 'They must be about the army some- where, even if they are not in their place,' replied the general, with a touch of displeasure in his tone 'General,' said BerthAer, in a tone of meaning,' I have my suspicions of these two men.' 'What do you suspect ' questioned the general. 'That they have deserted from the army, turned traitors, and joined the Austrians under Melas, and will to-day fight against us!' The keen eyd of Napoleon flashed fire. 'By our lady!' he exclaimed,' if this be true, and, as I think of what has passed, I have little doubt but that it is, if to day proves that they have turned traitors, they shall rue the action! Their lives shall be the forfeit, for, if they are discovered in the Austrian ranks, I will plake them a mark for our fire, and it will be impossible for them to escape.- But you, my noble young friend, will fully make up for the' loss of these two traitorous rascals. But time presses, and we must not be idle-adieu, for the present.'   And with a friendly grasp of the young lieutenant's hand, the general rode rapidly away. An hour had passed since the young lieutenant had arrived at the 'camp with the thrilling intelli- gence that the Austrians were marching towards them, and the French army in this incredibly shorLtspace of time, were ready to meet the enemy. It was not yet sunrise, but the rosy-tinted clouds that glowed 'in the Eastern horizon, showed that the king ox day was, ap- proaching to light the scene of battle. The whole army, numbering about twenty thousand men, was now formed in order to meet the Austrians. Des- saix, with the six thousand reserve, was at such a distance, that he could not; possibly reach Marengo before the close of the day, though their fastest courier had been sent to order him to return immediately, and with the utmost des- patch possible. Napoleon, with intense solicitude, was watching every point from which the Austrians could possibly appear, knowing not upon what point the onset would fall. 'General,' said Lannes, approachingl the First Consul,' our army-is ready and impatient for the battle. Have you any more orders for us V ' None of importance,' quickly replied Napoleon, 'but have you found -' Suddenly he hesitated, and listened. His quick ear had caught a prophetic sound,-the great army, like the waves of the ocean, were sweeping on with re- sistless power, and would ere long be upon them! The heavy tread of the Austrian army could now be plainly heard, slow, yet firm and decided, as they marched on towards the spot which had but one sort hour before, been the camp of the French. But Napoleon manifes- ted not the least excitement or alarm, as the well-filled colums of the Austrian   army made their, appearance around the i brow of a hill, just visible in the fajnt opening of day-light, but riding up to the head of his firm and decided battal- ions, he addressed them in his brief and laconic style.  Soldiers!" he cried, pointing to the on-coming ranks of 'Austrians, as they swept onwards, ' there are our foes, -and but a few moments can pass, ere we must meet them.? Solkiers! Let not your actions to-day belie the reputation for bravery that you have heretofore sus- taided. Remember, that Iam in the habit of steeping on the field of battle. I trust you will do your duty.' A volley of sheeted flame now poured upon them from the Austrian Ianks,and the French, roused by their leader's words to the highest extreme of daring bravery, stood the fire with their ranks as firm as before. The battle had now in 'reality com- menced. Melas leading on his forty thousand men, rapidly neared the solid columns of the French, and, in a few moments, the two armies stood face to face. Volleys of sheeted flame poured in upon the ranks of the French, and were returned with desperate courage and unflinching finness by the devoted band. The seven thousand cavalry, and the tw# hundred pieces of cannon, which were included in the army of Melas, did terrible execution to the colums of the French, but firm and unflinching, with the most desperate courage, they still stood their ground. Above the roar of  battle, and the shrieks and moans of the wounded and dying, was heard the ring- ing voice of Napoleon, cheering on his men, and by his Fresence as well as his words, inciting them to strive for the victory, even with an army of double their number. Courier after4/ourier was dispatched after the division under Des-    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6822-00000013"/> saix, to hurry them along, with all pos- sible speed, towards the scene of action. Thus hour after hour passed-but through those terrific hours, the French troops still stood firm, while their ranks were plowed by the murderous discharge of their foes. As the sheeted flame poured in upon the colums of the devo- ted army, hundreds fell beneath it, in the dreamless sleep of death, and over their bleeding corpses, their comrades pressed on, with all the courage of despair, to ,avenge the slaughter of their fellow sol- diers, but to have their ranks again plowed by the fire of the Austrian artil- lery, scattering among them blood, death, and' destruction. Still they hoped for succor--almost against certainty that it could not arrive. Dessaix, with the reserve, was coming to their rescue, and with the courage of despair, they resolved to stand firm un- til he could arrive, if it was possible.- ' But the danger was frightful that the French would be entirely cut to pieces, before Dessaix could possibly arrive to succor them-yet, through those terrific hours, those men stood firm and unflinch- ing, led on by the eagle eye of the man whose motto in battle was ever-' Con- quer or die 1' At last the destruction was too awful for mortal men to endure.  Horror seized upon them, and many divisions of the French army broke'and fled, crying -- ALL IS LOST-SAVE HMSELF WHO OAN ' A seene of the most frightful disorder now ensued.  The whole plain was covered with fugitives, swept like an in- nudation before the multitudinous Aus- triaus. Not even the voice of their be- loved general could longer induce them to stand the terrific fire, but, renouncing all discipline,- and thinking only of the safety of their lives, they fled in the   wildest disorder and confusion. By di, of the utmost courage an4 daring on hi part, Napoleon still held a few squares together, who slowly and' sullenly re- treated, while two hundred pieces of ar- tillery closely pressing them, poured in- cessant death into their ranks. At the head of one of these, stood Victor Herthier-all the higher officers O of that battallion h viug been shot down -and, as the youthful soldier led on the hopeless and dispirited column, his own bravery and dring courage seemed to infuse new life and energy into the hearts of the men, and they fought with. all the superhuman strength and determination that only despair can give. Napoleon's keen eye fell upon the form of the noble young man, as, with his uniform soiled and torn in numberless places by the terrific strife, and his face blackened and disfigured by powder and smuke, he led on that band of desperately brave men, and the noble general, even at that ter- rible moment, felt a thrill of pleasure as he witnessed the unflinching courage of the youthful lieutenant, and he forgot not his reward. Slowly and sullenly the remaining columns retreated, pressed on by the victorious Austrians, who still poured their murderous fire upon the French,' while, ringing loud above the din of bat- tle, rose their loud shout of victory.- Every foot of ground, from which the French retreated, was left encumbered with the dead. Groans and shrieks of anguish, and yells of despair, mingled with the wild shout of victory, added horror to the scene, while the booming of the Austrian cannonade, which was still pouring its sheeted flame into the retreating ranks, sounded heavily above the tumult and cenfusion. The seene was one which no tongue can describe- no pen can trace. Horrifying in its im-   port, thrilling in its intensity, terrible in its fearful grandeur, it was a scene which no imagination, however vivid, can picture. It was now three o'clock in the after- noon, Melas, exhausted with toil, and assured that he had gained a complete victory, left General Zach to finish his work. The Austrian general, with the most perfect assurance that the battle was gained, retired to his head quarters, and immediately despatched couriers all over Europe to announce his great vic- tory at Marengo. But, even then, some of his army felt that the First Consul might not be so easily conquered-and there were those, even in the Austrian army, who felt that Napoleon might yet be the victor. ' Melas is too sanguine,' said an Aus-   trian veteran, who had before encounter- -ed Napolean at Arcola and Rivol; 'de- pend upon it, our days work is not yet done. Napoleon will yet be upon us with his reserve.' And still, with a murderous fire, the Austrians poured their sheeted flame into the retreating ranks of the French, whose resistance, though feeble, was still firm. Each time the deadly war of the cannonade rang out its fearful tones upon the air, another band of souls, with all their sins upon them, were ushered into'the spirit-world, before their final Judge  But we will not dwell upon' the scene-it is too fearful for descrip- tion, even if the pen possessed the power to trace it, with all its terrific vividness, for the eye of the reader.    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6822-00000014"/> CHAPTER IV. THE VICTORY--THE DEATH AND BUriAL--THE WOUNDED SOLDIERS. 'There came a sound-'twas like the gush When night winds shake the rose's bush! There camie a sounc--'twas like the tread Of wolves-along the valley's bed! There came a sound-'twas like the roar Of ocean on its wintry shore.' [CROLY.   The rose-hue of morning was lighting' up the east, on the terrible day of Ma-' rengo, but still Hessafx, with his six thousand soldiers, wearied by the march of the preceding day, slept the sleep of the weary. Scarce a sound, save the oacasional neighing of horses, or the sweeping of the breeze-among the droop- ing branches of the orange trees, broke the quiet stillness whilch reigned around and over that band of slumberers: the angel of silenqe spread her wings, and. held her uninterrupted sway. On the hard ground beneath the tent, wrapped only in an ample blanket which was his only couch, slumbered the com- mander of the reserve-the intrepid Dessaix. Yes, the heroic soldier, 'who had fought in many battles, who had heard the stunning roar of the cannon- ade, as well as the quick rattle of the a death-dealing musketry,-who had en- gaged in many hand-to-hand conflicts, and faced death, without a thrill of fear, a thousand times-he now  slept!- Dreams of his childhood's home, of his beloved mother, and the many friends who clustered round his happy youth, and predicted for him a bright fortune -n future years, came over his mind,   mingled with visions of days yet in the futdre, when his name, gilded with the brightest flash of glory, should be placed upon the highest point of the pinnacle of fame, there to live through all com- ing time, shrouded in a glory that will never die! And then came visions of a holier, calmer happiness-when the lov- ed one of his youth should again smile upon him, and, with a heart full of love and happiness, again pillow her head upon his manly bosom-and, as the sol- dier slept and dreamed, a smile, bright as the visions that floated through his brain, passed over those stern and proud yet handsome features, and told that the'sleeper was happy! Ah, dream on, noble warrior! for thy next slumber will be the cold and dreamless sleep of death-ere the sun again sets, thy spirit will be before its God I But why does the sleeper start, and spring so suddenly to his fet, as if smitten by an electric shock! He rush- ed from the tent, and with his eye fixed upon the g owing eastern horizon, list- ens earnestly. Again, on the hills comes ,that faint, but heart-thrilling sound, now clearer and deadlier than before- the roar of the cannonade, booming over   the plain, like distant thunder! The eye of Dessaix lights uip with an unusual fire-his senses wrought up to the keen- est intepsity, add but to the excitement of his brain. Still, over the distant hills, comes the thrilling sound of the cannonade-the heavy and uninterrupt- ed roar like the sound of distant thun- der, proclaimed a pitched battle, and the eager listener was alarmed for the safety of his beloved chief. Time was precious; and the delay of even a few moments might prove- fatal.. This the noble Dessaix fully realized, and, rous- ing himself to the full consciousness of his situation, he proceeded to rouse his troops, without an instant's delay. The tents were struck in a most incredibly short space of time, thie army formed in- to columns and divisions under their respective officers, and, by the exertions of Dessaix, they were soon ready to start upon the rush to succor their comrades. Just as they left the' camp to begin their rapid march, the sun rose above the horizon, and shed its light in un- clouded brilliancy upon their\pathway. They soon began to realize that its rays were far too warm to be comfortable; but, led by the gallant Dessaix, they still continued the rapid march. Two hours passed-and, as the army swept around the brow of the hill, they dis- covered a man. mounted on a foaming charger, riding with a furious speed to- wards them. As he approached them, he sprang from his horse, and grasping the hand of Dessaix he exclaimed. 4Thank God,' Dessaix, that I have reached you at last. The Austrians have attacked Napoleon and his army upon the plain of .Marengo, tnd are now pouring upon them a most terrific  fire. The flower of the army is under  your command, and unless you fly to the rescue, the battle must be lost. Be l   rapid in your march, for heaven's sake 1' ' I will do so, good $aqui! Not a moment must be lost 1' returned Dessaix. t But you-will you return now with us?' 'No, as I must go back to Napoleon with the information that you are upon way, and marching with all possible haste to his assistance,' replied the cou- rier, turning his horse's head and riding rapidly away in the direction from which he had come. 'On, my men-we must march more rapidly I' cried Dessaix, putting spurs to his charger and dashing onward with greater speed. Hours passed-the sun was beyond the meridian, and the sol- diers,weary and dispirited, and covered with dust were now but an hour's march from the field of battle. Suddenly the cannonading, which had ceased for a few moments, again commenced, and louder, heavier, deadlier in its swelling intensi- ty, the thundering sound rang out upon the air Its fearful import roused the lagging pulses of the wearied soldiers, and with hearts burning to avenge the death of their comrades, and anxiety for the fate'of their beloved chief, reigning paramount in their bosoms, they rushed on towards the scene of action, more ra- pid than before. - With a heart torn with fears for his beloved general, Dessaix pressed on, while the solid battalions of the French reserve followed with as ra- pid a march as possible. It was now three o'clock in tie after- noon  Napoleon, still holding a few squares together, who still slowly and sullenly retreated before the murderous fire of the Austrians, now, for the first time, began to fear that victory must de- cide in favor of Melas. The Austrian geiital, himself, had retired to his head quarters, and despatched couriers all dver Europe to announce the great vic- tory of Marengo. The victorious Aus-    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6822-00000015"/> trians, assured that they had entirely conuuered the French, still poured their heavy cannonade into the ranks of the retreating army, while, rising to the very heavens, the mad shout of victory rent the air. Most of the French army con- sidered the battle as lost-all knew that they could resist but a few moments longer, if )Dessaix did not arrive. Just then the anxious eye of the First Consul espied the solid columrns of Des- saix'entering the plain. Dessaix taking in the whole position of things at a glance, plunged his spurs into his steed, and outstripping all the rest, galloped into presence ef Napoleon. As he cast a glance over the wild confusion and de- vastation of the field, he exclaimed, hur- riedly-- ' I see plainly, your excellency, that the battle is lost. I suppose I can do no more for you than td secure your re- treat.' It was then that the strength and en- ergy of character that has made the name of Napoleon Bonaparte immortal, presented itself in all its sublimity and greatness. With as much composure, apparently, as if he had been calmly sit- ting by his own fireside, instead of upon a battle field, and amid the roar and din of such a' battle, the great general re- plied- ' The battle, I trust, is gained. Charge with your column.  The disordered troops will rally in your rear.' For an instant Dessaix gazed in ad- miration upon the firm, composed coun4 tenance of his beloved general; then turned his charger's head, and rode up to the head oi his division. At the same time Napoleon dispatched an% order to Kellerman, with Ais cavalry. to charge the triumphant column of the Aus4tjans in flank. Flushed with victory, and seeming to think that they could entire-   ly rout Dessaix's battalion in a short time, the Austrians, now headed By Gen. Zach, swept on towards that firm band of brave men.  Like a rock, pessaix, with his solid phalanx of ten thousand men, met the onrolling billow of Aus- trian victors, and as they approached, discharged upon them a destructive fire.  It was the work of a moment, but the whole aspect of the field' was changed. Napoleon, with all the energy and de- termination of his character visible in the flashing brightness of his eagle eye, and his very bearing that of one who 'was already a conqueror, rode along the lines of those who' were on the retreat, and in a voice that thrilled new courage to their hearts, he exclaimed: 'My friends, we have retreated far enough. It is now our turn to advance. Recollect that I am in the habit of sleep- ing on the field of battle. I trust you will do your duty. Advance, soldiers, and charge the enemy i' The fugitives, cheered on by the voice of their commander, and re-animated by the arrival of 'the reserve, immediately rallied in the rear. The double charge in front and flank was instantly made. The Austrians were checked and stag- gered. Their yells of victory, whidh, a moment before, had filled the air with their ringing echoes, were now hushed, or repeated only by-a few, more sangu- ine than the 'rest, who still felt certain that victory was theirs. A perfect tor- nado of bullets from Dessaix's division swept the Austrian ranks. They pour- ed an unswering volley into the bosom of the French, though doing less execu- tion. Dessaix, at the Hlead of his division, -still fought with the desperate courage that had ever characterized that young and noble officer. The splendid jet- black charger that he bestrode, bore hii   as if'proud of his burden-'and well he might have been, for, among the whole army, it was acknowledged that Dessaix was the favorite general, next to the com- mander, Napoleonhimself. Noble, hand- some, brave, generous and talented, none wondered that he was the favorite of the First Consul, who loved him as a brother. And now he seemed more worthy of ad- miration, more brave, more handsome than ever, aswith his dark eyes flashing with spirit and excitement, he led on that devoted band to victory. But sud- deniy his arm fell powerless to his side -he reeled, and would have fallen from his horse, had not an aid, who rode by his side, caught him in his arms. A bullet had 'pierced his breast! The wound was mortal-and, gasping for breath, the dying general turned his eyes, dimmed with the film of death, up- on the one bent over him in silent agony, and gasped- 'Tell the. First Consul that my only regret in dying is, to have perished be- fore having done enough to live in the recollection of posterity.' One more gasp-one more effort to speak-and he wag dead! The dark eye, that but a moment before, had flash- ed with all the brilliancy of health and hope, was now closed and -dimmed in death, and the heart, that had ever beat with high and noble impulses, was now still and motionless-its beating had ceased forever, but from, it still flowed the crimson life-blood, staining the rich uniform with its gushing flood! The ?oldiers who devotedly loved him, saw 'is fall, and rushed on still more madly 3 avenge his death. The swollen tide of uproar, confusion, ,ad dismay, now turned and rolled in lurging billows in the opposite direction. Scarcely one moment elapsed, before the Austrians, flushed with victory, found   themselves overwhelmed with defeai.- The tide of battle had turned-and now the angel of victory spread her wings over the French! In the midst of this terrific scene, an aid rode up to Napoleon, and placet his hand heavily upon his shoulder, request- ed his attention for a moment. ' What news now?' demanded the gen- eral. An expression of the deepest sorrow rested upon the countenance of the aid, as, in a tone of solemn grief, he replied -' DESSAIX IS DEAD!' The cheek of Napoleon became of a deathly pallor, and staggering in his saddle,bhe would'have fallen had it not been for the assistance of the aid. But a moment before, he had been convers- ing side by side with Dessaix, and to hear the sad intelligence that he was s now dead, almost unmanned even the great general. But it was only for a moment-he raised his head proudly, and again glanced his eagle eye over the battle field. 'Why is it not permitted me to weep' he exclairied, mournfully, pressing his hand convulsively to his forehead, while a deep sigh escaped hiq lips, 'victory at such a price is dear.' And then turning to the aid, while an expression of anxiety, mingled with deep sorrow, rested upon his pale features, he said, inquiringly- 'And young Lieutenant Berthier, is he safe?' 'I know not,' replied the soldier, 'but I have not seen him for some time.' 'Go and search for him,' returned Napoleon, 'for I fear that he, too, has fallen a victim to,the murderous bullets of the Austrians. Bring me word of him as soon as possible.' The soldier bowed low to the general and disappeared in search of the young    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6822-00000016"/> lieutenant, the new favorite of Napo-l -leon. At the moment Dessaix, with the re-  serve, appeared upon the field, the col- umn which Victor Berthier'was leading on, being thinned in numbers, and more thanaialf of those who still remained being wounded, broke and fled, leaving the young com'mander standing alone, and fighting hand to hand with a power- ful Austrian. With a desperate lunge of his sword, Victor sent the weapon of his opponent several yards from him, at the same time giving him a mortal wound.  The Austrian fell, and Ber- thier stood alone. Raising his eyes, he saw the solid columns of Dessaix enter- ing the field, and with a shout of joy, was about to spring forward to meet them, when he was prevented by a man in the costume of the Austrian army, stepping before him, and assuming an attitude of defiance. Victor glanced his eye upon the countenance of-the man before him, and saw plainly that it was d'Elseyl He had turned traitor-his uniform told the story! With the quickness of thought, the hot blood mounted to the cheek of Vic- tor Berthier, and his dark eye flashed with an unusual fire. He remembered the foul wrong which that man had done him-and raising his word, still drip- ping with Austrian blood, he prepared toavenge himself for the injury which d'Elsey had done him, as well as to pun- ish him for his traitorship. But he soon found that it was no common, enemy that he had to deal with-for d'Elsey was as perfect a master of the weapon as himself, and it was as much as Victor could possibly, do to parry his thrusts and preserve his own sword, of whidh dtElsey seemed intent on disarming him. Both seemed determined on having the life of the other-one, goaded on by the   remembrance of injuries that could nev- er be forgiven, while in the bosom of the other, the all-ontrolling power was RE- VENGE! Both were expert swordsmen, and for a time,.it seemed as if neither could gain the victory. But by a desperate plunge d'Elsey succeeded in disarming Berthier, and with a fiendish laugh, he endeavored to plunge his sword into the heart of the young lieutenant. The weapon in- flicted a severe wound in the young man's side, and clasping his bands and raising his eyes to heaven, be fell back insensible. D'Elsey knelt down by the side of his fallen foe, and placed his hand upon the young man's heart.' 'It beats still,' he muttered to him- self, while a demoniac smiles crossed his features, ' but this wound is MAortal, and that heart will soon be hushed forever I I am speedily revenged on one, at least. Now for the other-the fiends of dark- ness grant that I have as good luck with him!' And arising from his kneeling posi- tion he sprang upon a horse off which an Austrian soldier had just been shot, and rode rapidly away. The battle still continued, but now the carnage was no longer on the side of the French. The Austrians, now no longer the victors, but the vanquished, fled with* indescribable dismay before their unrelenting pursuers, while the French made the welkin ring with their wild shouts of victory. But the route of the Austrians were utterly hopeless -their pursuers, determihing to fully avenge the death of the heroic Dessaix, as well as of their other comrades, left scarcely one to tell the story of their de- feat. The French tricolor now floated 'over the field of Marengo, which was strewed with bodies, not a foot of ground emained that was not encumbered with   the dead. So ended one of the blood- iest victories everirecorded by the pen of the historian-and one that will be remembered through all future ages, as long as one admirer of true courage, he- roic bravery, and unflinching firmness, can be found. But it was a victory dear- ly bought, and one which blood was poured like water to' obtain! Speaking of the field of Marengo, an eminent historian has thus graphically, described its appearance after the bat- tie. 'When the sun went down,' says he, 'over this field of blood, after twelve  hours of the most frightful carnage, a scene was presented horrid enough to appal the heart of, a demon. More than twenty thousand human bodies were strewn upon the ground, the dying and the dead weltering in gore, in every con- ceivable disfiguration. Horses with limbs torn from their bodies, were strug- gling in convulsive agonies. Fragments of guns and swords, and of military wag- ons of every kind, were strewed around in wild ruin. Frequent pierbing cries, which agony extorted from the lacerated victims of war, rose above the general moanings of anguish. which, like wail- ings of the storm, fell heavily upon the ear. The shades of night were now de- scending upon this awful scene of mise- ry. The multitude of those wounded were so great, that notwithstanding the utmost exertions of the surgeons, hour after hour of the long night lingered away, while thousands of the wounded and dying bit the dust in their agony.' Midnight had now settled down upon the revolting scene of carnage-and the gentle moon, with her brilliant retinue  of stars, was sailing cloudlessly in the v deep blue of the sky of June. Brightly 1 her soft light fell down upon the battle-  field of Marcngo; disclosing the forms of a   a group of the victorious French, who were kneeling silently and sadly, around a coffin, roughly made, unpainted, and  formed of materials evidently intended for a coarser use. At a little distance from the group four soldiers were dig- ging a grave. It was in a corner of the' great plain, yet but a short distance from the scene of carnage, though the  grass there was fresh and green and un- stained with blood. The pale glare ofa glimmering lantern shed its light upon those who were digging the grave, but where stood the group around the coffin the moon-rays seemed sufficient light, in which to take the last look of the belov- ed dead. As the rays of the moon fell softly down upon the icy brow of the noble dead, it showed the features to be those of the noble Dessaix. The dark eyes were closed forever in the dream- less slumber that never knoweth waking -but still, around 'the finely chiselled lips, played a smile of sweetness, as if the spirit still lingered behind, to speak words of comfort to those unhappy mourners. The dark hair, in shining ? raven curls, lay still and motionless on the broad, high, noble brow, whose icy chilliness told that the warm life-current, no longerefilled its swellingveins. Like a marble bust, that pale, noble counte- nance seemed in all its chilling beauty: for the angel of death had set his seal upon that icy brow! No snow-white funeral shroud en- closed the manly form of the departed, but there he lay, in full uniform, just as -as he had died. Above the mortal wound that had deprived him of life, the rich costume was saturated with the' heart's-blood of the wearer, and the white plume of his martial cap, that lay beside him, was also stained with the crimson life-current. But over the bosom: was folded a still prouder emblem of the    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6822-00000017"/> victory-the French tri-color, shrouding'  the heart that died in its defence.  Over the head of the coffin, and gaz- I ing mournfully upon the marble coun- E tenance of the dead, Napoleon himself was bending. Tears-yes, tears of an- 1 guish, ivere wrung from the heart of the stern general, as he knelt beside that  coffin, and gazed for the last time upon the features of one who was truly dear eo him, both as,a soldier and a friend. And those who knelt by his side, who were mostly the surviving officers of Desssaix's division, and who had devot- edly loved him were also weeping. But not'all who mourned for the heroic dead were there; for there was scarcely a man in the French army, but who loved the noble handsome, brave and generous Dessaix. The soldiers who had been digging the grave, now approached the mourning group, and informed them that the last resting place for the noble dead was ready to receive its occupant. Slowly and sadly those mourners rose from'their kneeling position-and raising the cof- fin from the ground they bore it towards the new-made grave. Napoleon himself bore tie head, and slowly and solemnly they marched to the grave, followed by the remainder of the group, and the four soldiers who were members of Dessaix's division. The body was lowered to its last resting place, and a French flag thrown over the coffin. Then all knelt around the grave, and a brief, but solemn and fervent prayers was offered for thJ soul of the dead. The grave was then filled, and with nought bnt a simple mound as a monumeni tohis memory, the heroic soldier slep the dreamless sleep that never knoweth waking. Slowly and silently the mourning band turned away from the fresh mound.- They stepped cautiously over the bodies   of the dead and dying, and the silence was unbroken until Napoleon turned to Lannes who was with them, and said in a low voice-- 'And you say Lieutenant Berthier has not yet been found.' "He has not, was the reply of Lan- nes. ' He must have been either taken prisoner by the Austrians, or killed in the terrific strife. He was a noble young man!' 'You speak truly, Lannes,' said Na- poleon, brushing a tear from his eye, ilt is not often that we meet with such as he. I would rather--' 'See here, general!' suddenly ex- claimed the soldier who was carrying the lantern, as he knelt by the side of a wounded soldier, and gazed earnestly upon the countenance before him, 'know you this young man?' Napoleon sprang foriard! He knelt by the side of the body, and casting one glance upon the marble-white features, discovered them to be those of Victor Berthier. A groan escaped his lips as he gazed sadly upon that noble counten.' ance,-and then, bending forward he laid his hand upon the youthful lieutenant's heart. 'Thank heaven he exclaimed,' springing to his feet, ' he is not dead yet! His heart stills beats, though faintly! Hp must be attended to. Some of you take up the body, and convey it to my tent.' 'If your excellency would think ought of my judgement:' said a noble-looking middle-aged officer, arising, from the ground, where he had been examining the condition of Victor, 'I should say that this young man had better be taken to a more suitable hospital, as, unless he is immediately attended to, and the best of care taken of his very severe wound, he cannot possibly survive. This cannot be, if he remains here, and consequently,   he must die. If your excellency is will- ing, I will have him conveyed to my country-seat, which is not more than a mile from this spot, where every care and attention that motiey or influence can procure, shall be his, and nothing shall be asked of him in return.' 'You are too generous, Colonel de St. Arnand,' said Napoleon, pressing the hand of the kind old man, 'but remove  him there, restore him to life and health, if possible, and Napoleon will not forget  your reward.' 'Then, giving one more look at the marble countenance of Berthier, he walked away, followed by all his com- panions, save Colonel de St. Arnand, and two soldiers. The latter, taking the senseless body of Victor Berthier in their arms, bore it, in compliance with the directions of the colonel, to his beau- tiful country residence, at the outskirts of the village of Marengo. De St. Ar- nand followed, after taking one more look at Dessaix's grave, and they sdon left the scene of anguish and death.   Still the groans and shrieks of the wounded continued rising, with heart- piercing intensity, upon the still night air, ever and anon mingled with curses and imprecations, or the fearful shrieks of those dying in the most fearful agony. More than twenty thousand bodies were strewn upon the ground, every foot of which was covered with the dead and 'wounded-a horrid scene! 'For the carnage of the field of Mar- engo,' says the historian, before referred to, 'Napoleon cannot be responsible.- Upon England and Austria must rest all ,the guilt of that awful tragedy. Napo- leon had done everything he could to stop the effusion of blood. He had sac- rificed the instincts of pride in pleading with a haughty foe for peace. His plea was unavailing. Three hundred thou- sand men were marching on to France, to force upon her a detested king. It was not the'duty of France to' submit to such dictation.

Her brow Was fair as moon-light on the srnow- And neathit beamed an eye as bright As star-gems on the brow of night. [Anonymous.   It was the morning of the 24th of June-and the sun. rose in unclouded glory over the sunny land of fair and classic Italy, and lighted up its vales and plains of unequalled lovliness with a golden radience, and gemmed the spark- ling waters of the fair Mmo with a flash- ing brilliancy. Ten days had elapsed since the battle of Marengo--and the vast plain, which had been the scene of the terrific strife, now presented the ap- pearance of a vast burial-ground, for there was scarcely afoot of ground that did not cover the mangled remains of some unfortunate being who had fallen a victim to the horror and carnage of bat- tle. A mound of fresh earth was the only monument to tell the resting-place of the sleepers, and many of them had been laid in their narrow beds without a coffin or a shroud, and very many with- out a prayer over their lonely graves - The emerald-green verdue was springing up over the fresh mounds, and it was evident that the vast burial-ground would soon be as fresh and green as before, though the great battle that had been   fought there might never be forgotten through the lapse of ages. The small, but pretty village of Mar- engo, with its surroundings, was-situated at about a mile distant from the great plain, and derives its importance chiefly from its being in the vicinity of the scene ,of the memorable battle. On the south- ern side of the village, gracefully rises a beautiful eminence, whose summit over- looks the village, the plain, and the sur- rounding country for several miles, pre- senting a scene of rural loveliness rarely to be found, even in the fair and sunny Italy. On the sutnmit of this eminence, stood a beautiful mansion, the country residence of the noble and wealthy Count de St. Arnand. It will be necessary to give the reader a, brief sketch of the his- tory of the occupants of this mansion, before proceeding farthef with our story. Count Hubert de St. Arnand, tle father of Colonel de St. -Arnand, whom we have already introduced to the reader, was the only remaining descendant of an old and noble family, who boasted that their blood was closely allied to that of I   the Bourbons. Count Hubert, who,!n early life, had wedded a lady of a house as proud and ancient as his own, possess- ed a large share of the family pride that had ever distinguished his ancestors.- He had but two children, a son and daughter, and the sole aim of both the count and his wife seemed to be to instil into the youthful minds of these two children the full importance of theirsta- tion, and the strictness with which they should guard against marrying beneath it. Growing up under these influences, it would naturally be inferred that the two young St. Arnands would be haugh- ty, conceited, proud, and vain creatures, and fully fitted for the station, which, in the opinion of the parents, they were to held in the world. But, it, was not destined to be so. Julian, the elder of the two children, grew to manhoodt a no- ble-minded, intelligenthighsouled man, with scarcely a characteristic of either parent in his disposition, save the, in: domitable will Doffis father, and the high proud spirit of his mother. Noble in mind as in person, and an heir to im- immense wealth, it wasnot to be wonder- ed at that Julian de St. Arnand, at twenty, was considered a most desirable match for the proudest maiden of the land. The proud and wealthy Lady Annette Chartreaux, the only daughter of the Duke Chartreaux, was the lady whom Count'Hubert had selected as the wife of his son. The young man himself, though not seriously opposing his fath- er's wishes, still did not favor the match, . as Lady Annette, though possessing some charms of person, still was devoid  of all beauty of mind or heart, and pos- i sessed no conversational power-by which - to engage the attention of young Julian. i As yet, he was heart-free-no maiden ] had yet had power to win his affections.    i But his parents, charmed by the noble title and broad domains of Lady An- -nette's father, and knowing that she , would not be averse to the arrangement, determined that their son should wed her. 'Julien,' said Count Hubert, one evening, addressing his son, who sat lei- Surely reading a newspaper, (I wish you to go to Madrid to-morrow.'  'For what reason,' asked Julian look- ing up in surprise. ' To transact some business for me,' returnedfthe father, ' as I myself have too much to attend to at home, and the journey will do you good. You will go, will you not 2' 'I don't care much of anything about the matter,' replied Julian, yawning, ' but I will go if you wish it.' 'Then prepare yourself to start to- Xmorrow morning,' said Count Hubert, 'and in the meantime, I will write the orders as regards my business for you.' But you must remember to be careful, my son, that none of those black-eyed Spanish senoritas succeed in enslaving your heart before you return.' 'Never fear, father,' returned Julian, with a light laugh. 'And remember, also, that immedi- ately upon your return, preparations will be commenced for your marriage with Lady AnnetteChartreaux.' ' I'll endeavor not to forget it,' return- ed the young man, carelessly, as he arose and left the'room, to 'seek his sister and inform her of his intended journey. Four days passed-Julian had reach- ed Madrid, transacted the business that had brought him there, and had now started on his journey homeward. The spires and turrets of the city were fad- ing in the distance, and Julian was now passing through one of the most diffi- cult and dangerous of the mountain    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6822-00000019"/> passes. Immense rooks reared their jagged summits far above his head, and cast their dark, gloomy shadows far down into the narrow defile, rendering the place, at all times, a dark, shadowy, and; gloomy spot. And it was also rumored that a band of outlaws frequented the placq, and whenever a traveller passed they murdered and robbed him. But Ju- lian de St. Arnand ueither knew or cared anything about these rumors, for he was well armed, courageous, and determined, and feared no danger, but still rode on as leisurely as before, wrapt inehis own meditations, which partook nothing of  the gloomy scenery around him. Suddenly, as if by magic, a whole band of armed men seemed to rise from the ground, and surrounding his horse, one of them, who seemed to be the com- mander, grasped the bridle of the ani- mal, while he presented a pistol at the heart of the rider. The young man, so suddenly aroused from his meditations, quickly regained his sell possession, and in a calm, authoritative voice, demanded :Villains, what means this interruption?' 'It means, my young friend,' replied the one who seemed to be the leader of the party, ' that we are the bandits of the Sierra Morena, and have come to- relieve you of as much of your surplus money as you can comfortably spare,and also your gold watch, and the diamond ring which you wear upon your finger. If you can spare them comfortably we will let you go yOuriway without further molestation: if you resist we shall sil- enbe you forever.' With the greatest pleasure imagina- ble,' replied the young man, not at all disconcerted by the manner of the ban- dit chief, 'and as I see you seem to need the articles much more than I do, I am very glad that I came this way, that I oan have the opportunity to oblige you.'   'By St. Mary, but that's cool ' cried the leader of the bandits as Julian threw him his purse, watch, and ring, you are a brave young fellow, my friend, and the only one we ever met that seemed not the least afraid of us. You are a man of real courage and we will take nothing from such as you. Take back your money, watch and ring-it shall not be said that Oswald Seville ever robbed a truly brave man.' 'Thank you, my friend,' said Julian, as he again passed the rich chain of his watch around his neck; ' you are very accommodating. And,' he continued, 'as it is getting towards sundown, I should like very well to lodge with you to-night. It would be a great accom- modation, if you would allow me and my, horse'to form one of your company to- night,-as itli6 a long distance to the'next Village, and we are already weary with travelling.' 'Should you not fear to remain with such as we during a night, with such an amount of money in your possession ' asked the surprised chief. ' Not at all,' replied Julian, coolly, ' I don't fear you at all. And the romance of the thing would please me prodigious- ly. I've heard of you and .your band before, and have often thought that I would gi'e much to see you. And now I haveiseen you, I have an unconquera- ble desire to converse with you, and find out what kind of a human you are in, re- ality, for I don't believe half rumor says about you.'  'The devil is not so black as he is painted,' laughed Seville, 'but you are a curious specimen of a ' human,' be that as it may. What is your name, if I may be so bold as to ask you?' 'Julian de St. Arnand,' replied our hero. ' Any title ' questioned the bandit.   'Count,' replied Julian, with the greatest NONCHALANCE imaginable. 'Well, Count Julian, as I like your appearance very much, I will grant your request to lodge with us. But first, I shall exact from you a solemn promise that you will never disclose the secret of our haunt.' 'I promise,' said Julian- solemnly. 'Enough,' said the bandit. Now fol- low me, and I will leajd you to our cave.' Seville led the way through the rocky and dangerous pass. while the remainder of the bandits, accompanied by de St. Arnand, followed. They soon reached the entrance to a large cave, such as are often found in the rocky mountains of Castile, where all dismounted from their horses. '1'1l lead you now, Count Julian,' said the bandit chief, grasping the hand of Juliani and entering the dark yawning mouth of the cave. The passage which- they entered was dark -as Erebus, and with a floor so rocky and jagged, that de St. Arnand could scarcely keep his feet, even with the assistance of Sayille.  At length they halted, and Seville, after listening for a moment, gave a peculiar whistle. A large massive stone door was slowly unbolted and thrown open, and a scene met the eyes of the aston- ished Julian, such as he had never be- fore even dreamed of. He stood at the entrance of a bandit's hall-and the richness, elegance, and even taste which' characterized the furniture and other belongings of the room, surprised and astonished the young man, and he gazed at the scene before him in undisguised wonder. About forty bandits sprang forward to welcome their leader, and to these Seville presented de St. Arnand, with the grace and finished politeness of an accomplished courtier.  Y .J.  ,   'Enter, this is our reception room,' said Sevllle, with a pleasant smile, as Julian seemed in doubt as to the pro- priety of his setting foot in the bandit's ball. He obeyed, however, and 'the oth- ers of the band following, the door was closed and bolted as before. The hours flew by on rapid wings to Julian, for amid hew scenes of romance and inter- est, he lost all thought for the future.- He found the bandit chief to be a man of powerful intellect, strong mind, and generous feelings, and thought he would be one uwo would prove a noble and true friend, or a most bitter and dangerous enemy. He found him to be a man who was well acquainted with courts and courtiers, and one whose life must have in it a large share of romance. The con- versation of the chief strengthened this opinion, and in the impulse of the mo- ment, he asked the bandit chief if he would favor him with. a recital of his past history. Instantly the brow of Se- ville grew dark and angry. ' Pardon me, Captain Seville,' said Julian, quickly, as he noticed the change in the countenance of his companion, I did not intend to displease you by my request.' 'I know you did not, my young friend,' replied the bandit, with a fascin- ating smile,' but there are scenes in my past history, which when it is reverted to, rouse all the lion-spirit that burns within me. Speak of the present or the, future whenever, you please, Count Ju- lian, but NEVER of the past. My past life has been varied, romantio, and al- most incredible, some portions of it; and, as I think of it, I almost wonder that I lived through it myself. But, as I said before, I can never turn my thoughts to some of the scenes,. which, in my..past life, I have witnessed, with' out feeling the lion-spirit that I would    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6822-00000020"/> gladly crush forever, rising in my bosom. At such times, all nobler feelings leave me, and REVENGE alone burns in my proud heart. So, if you do not wish to make a demon of me, my friend, refen not to the past. But this subject is a painful one, at least, to me-and we will drop it. By-the-way, Count Julian, you have not seen my daughter yet-would you wish an introduction to her ' ' Your daughter, Captain Seville-I knew not that you hid a daughter!' Did I not tell you?' 'Not' 'Well, would you wish too see her?' 'I would, most certainly.' The bandit chief arose and left the hall, leaving Julian alone. He soon re- turned followed by a slight, graceful, elegantly dressed young ldy, and they both approached Julian whose curiosity was now considerably excited, They crossed the hall, the young lady follow- ing directly behind her father so that Julian could not see her face, until they stood beside him. Isabel, this is Count de St. Arnand -Count Julian, this is my daughter Isabel.' Julian looked up-and so astounded was he by the appearance of the bandits daughter, that he made several awk- ward blunders during the ceremony of introduction, but Isabel, with perfect 'self-possession, acted her part with the grace of a finished lady. Julian Was astounded, bewildered, taken by surprise -and well he might have been, for she was beautiful-brilliantly, bewitohingly, beautiful-that bandit's daughter! Her eyes were dark as midnight, brilliant, expressive, and thrilling in their be- witching glances, and from them beamed all the fervor and passionate ardor of her Spanish blood. Her browwas full, swelling, and intellectual, and bespoke a I   powerful intellect, while the tresses that shaded it, were of' the aiost jetty hue, and shining and glossy in their abund- ant richness. A slight blush tinged the t' rich brunette of either rounded cheek, while the roseate hue deepened in the full, curved, smiling lips, beneath which was visible teeth of the whitest ivory.- Her dress was rich, yet neat and grace- ful, and well became her delicate, sym- metrical form. Upon her throat, wrists and fingers glittered diamonds richly set in gold, and a wreath of fresh white roses bound back the raven tresses from her broad brow. 'Can it be possible,' thought Julian,'that this queen of beau- -ty is arbandit's daughter '  Like moments of bliss the hours pass- ed to Julian and Isabel. Each found in the other, the realization of the ideal they had so often pictured to them- selves, but with scarce a hope that they should ever find it realized. Julian, by conversing with the beautiful Isabel, soon discovered that her mind was as beautiful as her person-and the fair Isabel, with the true tact of a woman, soon ascertained that the young mai was as brave and noble as she had at first thought him handsome. They con- versed until midnight, and during the brief time they had been together, each had discovered in the other a congenial spirit. What wonder that the dreams of both, that night, were of love and happiness. The morning came, and as Julian de St. Arnand rose from the comfortable couch that had been provided tor him 'by Captain Seville, he thought for the first time of the home he had left, and of the necessity of his return to it. But then came thoughts of the lovely Isabel, whom he felt that he already loved, and the pang of anguish that shot through I his heart, as he thought of th'eir parting:   decided him to remain ufitil he had seen her once more. He felt, that if they -parted now, it must be forever, while, if he remained a short time lon- ger, he might have an opportunity of enlisting the feelings of the beautiful Spanish girl in his favor. Two days passed-Julian still re- mained at the bandit's cave. With the characteristic impetuosity of the French he declared to the lovely Isabel his burning affection for herself, while she, with all the passionate fervency of her Spanish blood, had confessed that she most fully returned his ardent affection. They had met strangely - conversed freely, and now they LOVED--loved with all the strength and earnestness of their passionate, youthful natures, and loved with a truthfullness and fervency that could never die 1 With a sad heart and a tearful eye, Julian de St. Arnand took leave of his beautiful and beloved betrothed, and, mounting his steed, he started away- from the bandits cave, for his Own home. A melancholy that he could scarcely ac- count for, prevaded all his thoughts- for he knew that his father would most bitterly oppose his love for- the bandit's daughter, as he had been so fixed that his son should wed Anuette Chartreaux. At length he- reached his home, and, springing lightly fromilhis steed, he en- tered the presence of his father. ' Julian,' said Count Hubert, sternly, 'what has detained you so long ' With a firm voice and an unflinching eye, Julian de St. Arnand told his stern father all. In words whose burning fervency only a lover knows, he dwelt upon the beauty and goodness of Isabel Seville, upon her brilliant talents and accomplishments, her powerful intellect and strong mind, and, as he did so, a frown, black as midnight, gathered upon   the brow of Count Hubert.. When, in eloquent, impassioned language, the young man told the stern father of his deep and earnest love fog the bandit's daughter, it was then tha' the terrible storm of anger broke in its full fury up- on the head of the defenceless lover. 'Julian!' cried the angry father, in a voice that told the young man his father was in earnest, 'promise me, solemnly,t that you will never again see this young girl, and that you will wed the Lady Annetta Chartreaux within the month, and I 1will forgive this insult to our an- cient and noble name, which you have committed in daring to love this obscure daughter of an outlaw and a robber.- Promise to conform to my wishes in everything, and I forgive you p but if you still persist in disobeying me, and still dare to love that girl, then you are no longer a son of mine I will disin- herit you I I will disgrace you I and a father's curse shall follow you wherever you may go!' Julian de Sit. Arnand had expected opposition to his wishes; he had expect-  ed some anger, and, perchance, some threatening; but he had 'not expected this terrible storm of. passion. With a eountenance expressing both surprises and disappointment, he gazed earnestly into the face of his parent, and there he saw that the words his father uttered were MEANT. Butstill firm, though dead- ly pale, the young man stood before his incensed parent, with his arms calmly folded on his bosom, and his dark eyes flashing with the fire of a firm resolve.- Even with those dreadful words ringing in his ears and the terrible threat of a father's curse before him, the young man had resolved to be true to his firht;love- the bandit's beautiful daughter I 'Father,' said the young man, ' Isabel Seville is far more beautiful, talented,    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6822-00000021"/> graceful, and accomplished than Annette Chartreaux, and she is far better fitted, both by nature and education, to be a nobleman's bride. Father, will you not see my'Isab4e before you so boldly con- demn her?' 'NEVEIt ' angrily exclaimed Count Hubert. 'But your answer young man --will you renounce her or not?' #  The countenance of Julian de St. Ar- nand became even a shade paler as his father spoke, but still that look of firm resolve beamed from his dark eyes. He spoke not-his lips seemed unwilling to give forth the decision upon which so much depended. 'Can you not decide, young man, be- tween a robber's child and disgrace, pov- erty and misery, and a nobleman's daugh- ter and honor, wealth and happiness ' ' Father,' said the young man, in a low, deep voice, whose thrilling tones impressed the stern father more- deeply than he was willing to confess, 'I can never be happy with any due save Isabel Seville. I promised to be true to her and my own heart, come what might, and NEVER to wed any maiden save Isa- bel Seville. God pardon me for, dis- obeying you, and protect me from your curses, for, come life or death, I will sol- emnly keep that promise!' 'Then you are no longer a son of mine 1' shrieked the angry father, foam- ing with rage. Leave my house, this i stant, and never darken its doors again! Begone, ere I curse you to your face - Begone, I say I' With his eye flashing with the inten- sest excitement, and his whole frame quivering with emotion, Julian de St. Arnand left the mansion where he had, spent so many happy hours, to cast him- self upon the wide world, an outcast and a wanderer Slowly he left the home of his childhobd with, many a 'lingering   look behind,' and, as he thought, gazed for the last time upon the many beloved objects that surrounded the old paternal mansion. '0, Isabel, Isabel!' he murmured, clasping his hands tightly over his burn- ing brow, 'thiis i a great sacrifice for thee, but it is all deserved! My own dear Isabel In thy love I shall yet be happy. Wealth, friends, honor, and pleasure, would be naught without thee, but poverty with thee, would be happi- ness! O, Love! how strong, how all-conquer- ing, is thy power I Thou subduest all baser feelings, and leadest the votary where thou wilt I Thou art more power- ful than aught else-strong, yet gentle,' tender, yet unyielding! All nations, all tribes, all power, own thy conquering sway: for thou art more powerful than all t Ten days passed-Isabel Seville was now the bride of Julian de St. Arnand. They were wedded in the bandit's cave amid a blaze of magnificence and splen- dor, and in the presence of the whole band of outlaws, by a Spanish priest who had been sent for from Madrid to performthe ceremony. Neverwas there a more splendid bridal: and nevet was there two nobler, happier, or more loving hearts united. Had you asked Julian de St. Arnand if he/regretted his .decis- ion, the smile of perfect happiness upon his noble countenance, would have been a sufficient answer. - Mirth, musie and joyousness reigned supreme upon that happy bridal eve-and the wild romance of the circumstances under which Count Julian had first met, then loved, and then wedded the beautiful and accom- plished Isabel Seville, was the theme of every tongue. The robber chief, Cap- tain Seville, wtho fully appreciated the merits of Julian, was delighted with the   romantic manner in which his idolized daughter hald -been wooed and won, and gave his full consent to the marriage of his daughter with Julian de St. &amp;rnand. Three years passed away-to Julian and Isabel, they had been years of unin- terrupted happiness. The large dowry of Isabel enabled them to live in comfort and luxury, and, from the moment he left his home, Julian had never known the want of aught that he had left in his father's mansion of luxury and wealth. At times, he had sighed for the compan- ionship of his only and beloved sister, but the sweet society of his Isabel had fully compensated for that. An infant daughter, the perfect counterpart of the beautiful Isabel, had been given them, and on her the fond parents lavished the wealth of their affection. Happy in each other, and living in the consciousness that each loved the other far more than all earthly things, they scarcely knew a care or sorrow-those three years were years of uninterrupted happiness!  It was the evening of the third anni- versary of his marriage and Julian de St. Arnand was swiftly wending his way home to meet his beloved wife and in- fant daughter, after an absence of sev- eral hours, on business which had kept him much longer than he had anticipa- ted. He feared lest his wife might be alarmed at his long absence, and his step was quick and hurried. He reached the neat white cottage which he now called his home, and as he opened the door, the words-' Forgive me, dear Isabel' were on his lips, but, to his surprise, Isabel did not spring to the door to greet him with a kiss, as usual. A light was faint- ly streaming through a half-opened door that led to an inner room, 'and with a quick step, he approached it, pushed the door, and gazed anxiously   around. The sight that met his eyes filled his soul with anguish and horror. There on the flood, lay his wife-the crimson life-blood streaming from a ter- rible wound in her breast, and stainbig the rich carpet with its crimson dye t- The dark eyes, upturned with a plead- ing, entreating gaze, were now dim and glassy with the film of death, and the pale brow, above which the raven tresses fell in rich profusion, was now icy cold I The horror-stricken husband sprangfor- ward, and knelt by the side of his young wife-he placed his hand upon her heart -it was still and cold! He placed his hand upon her brow-that, too, was fast approaching the icy chillness of death I He could not shut out from his mind the fearful truth-Isabel WAS DEAD  ' My God I who could have done this horrid deed!' frantically cried the be- reaved husband, as he gazed horror- stricken, upon the lifeless form of his once beautiful and beloved Isabel.- 'Isabel O0, Isabel!' he cred, clasping the senseless form frantically to his bos- om, as ifhe would again warm the cold remains with life, 'would to God I had died, before this terrible blow had blast- ed my happiness forever!' Thus wildly raving, 's  frantically calling upon the lifeless form of his wife, Julian de St. Arnand mourned in the keenest anguishW The feeble cries of his child at last aroused him from the death-like stupor into which he had fal- len; and remembering that he must now live for that little innocent being, the only child of his dead Isabel, he roused himself to action. The babe was given into the care of a kind old lady of the village, and Julian, after the burial of his beloved wife, resolved thathenceforth he would not rest until he had ascer- tained who was the ihurderer of Isabel, and punished him as he deserved. Two    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6822-00000022"/> years were thus spent-but the search for the murderer had thus far been fruit- less. wIt was a dull, stormy afternoon, that Julian de St. Arnand was sitting alone in his desolate'room, meditating upon the probability of ever discovering the murderer of his wife. As yet, no clue had been found to him-and had it not been for the firm determination and in- domitable will of Julian, the search would long since have been abandoned. The entrance of a servant interrupted his meditations; and rising to discover the cause of the sudden interruption, the page handed him a letter, stamped with the seal of the de St. Arnand family.- He tore it hastily open, and read as fol- lows: 'My dear son, Come to me immediately, for I am dy- ing. I have something-of great impor- tance to say to you before I leave this world,anA I trust, my dear son, that you' will not refuse to grant this last request of your dying father. 1 forgive and for- get all-only come. I can write no more, for this exertion has almost ex- hausted me, YoyS father, I lubert do St. Arnand. 'I will go immediately,' murmured Julian, as he hurriedly refolded the al- most illegible letter, and throwing his cloak around him,he mounted his favorite steed, and set off in the direction of his father's palace. Two hours of hasty riding, and Julian St. Arnand sprang upon the steps of his father's mansion, the first time for five years. No gentle sister sprang to greet him, as in other years-for she was laid in the silent tomb, beside his mother! His fat4er alone remained of the household band- and he, too, was now dying. 4   The heart of Julian beat with a quick- er motion than usually, as, with a noise- less step, he entered the silent and dark- ened room of his father. He sprang forward, and clasped the hand of the re- pentant old man within his own., ' O, Julian, my son ' cried the dtying man, in a voice of agony, ' can you for- give me the terrible wrong I have done you?' 'All-all is forgiven, dear father,' re- plied the young man in a choking voice. But O, my son!' cried the did man, with a frantic jesture, 'you do not know all-you do not know the terrible crime I have committed to destroy your happi- ness? Rbmorse has undermined my health-has killed me!' 'My God!' cried Julian, his face be- coming livid with horror, as a terrible suspicion crossed his mind,'it cannot be that You-' 'It was! it was myself!' frantically exclaimed the 'old man, 'I MURDERED YOUR WIFE --I SHOT THAT WOMAN THROUGH TIE IEART) WrTI  MY OWN, HAND!' ' God of heaven!' cried the horror- stricken Julian, 'can it be that YOU did that horrid deed!' 'Yes, my son,' replied the dying man, 'the demon of REVENGE urged me on, to commit a drimp which, in my calmer moments, I shoald have shrunk from with horror. And when, since then, I have half resolved to confess all to you, the same demon seem to hold me back. But O, my son, can you not forgive me -now, on my dying bed, for this terrible crime, as I trust my God has forgiven me ' The heart of Julian was bowed upon his bosom, and his countenance was pale and passidnless, but there was a fearful   conflict goington within. Over the mur- dered body of his wife, he had vowed to avenge her death-but now, when, the murderer proved to be his dying father could he keep that vow? 'No!' was the solemn reply of conscience. The young man's resolve was made. 'My dear father,' he murmured, bend- ing low until his lips touched the fore- head already damp with the chill of death,' you are freely forgiven.' 'God bless you, Julian!' feryently ejaculated the dying man, as he turned his glassy eyes, now dim with the, film of death, once more upon his son. One gasp-a slight groan, and all was over. The MURDERER was in the spirit world! It was with feelings such as he never before experienced, that Julian de St. Arnand left his father's mansion, and again turned his steps towards his lone- ly home. Could it be 'possible thaV it was Ims FATHER who was the murderer of his beloved Isabel? It was long before he could bring his mind to realize the truth; yet he could not doubt it. His father had confessed it with his own lips -and his manner and words both seem- ed to confirm it. Among the private papers of Count Hubert; was found his will, bequeath- ing the entire amount of his property to his son Julian. The old man was laid in the sculptured ancestral tomb of his fathers-and Julian, forgetting his aw- ful crime, and the sad wrongs which he had experienced at his hands, mourned in sincere sorrow for the dead. With his only child, now three years of age, and a small retinue of servants, he removed to-the beautiful country mansion near Marengo, resolving to spend the re- mainder of his days in solitude and re- tirement, and devote himself entirely to the education of his daughter. Years passed away into the ocean of oblivion-   and in peace, quiet and refinement, the days of Count'do St. Arnand had been spent. But the memory of his lost Isa- bel, which was ever before him, marred all his hours of happiness, though now, in the society of his beautiful and ac- complished daughter, he, at times, felt  really happy. Thus his days were pass- ing onward to the grave in peace and quiet, when, with a sudden impulse, he formed a resolve to join the standard of that new and brilliant star, which was now rising so gloriously-Napoleon Bo- naparte.  In vain did his daughter remonstrate, in tears, and endeavor to dissuade him from his purpose-he was firm in his determination, and naught could move him from it. He enlisted under the banner of the Corsican Conqueror- 'fought at Montenette, Arcola and Rivo- li, and, finding that the excitement of battle revived the vigor of his youthful years, he followed the victorious general to Eigypt; where he first attracted the at- tention of Napoleon, by his determined bravery at the battle of the Pyramids. From that time he rapidly gained in favor with the great general, and, at the time of which we write, was a colonel in a regiment of cavalry,' and one of the favored friends of Napoleon. Sixteen years had elapsed since the untimely death oi his wife, and his only child,the perfect counterpart of the beau- tiful Isabel, was now seventeen. Lovely, accomplished, and noble-minded, the Count almost idolized his daughter, and she, in return, gave him the undivided affection of a young, and guiless heart. Such. is the state of the Count de St. Arnand's household at the time we in- troduce them-and tow, with the con- sent of the reader, we will continue the broken thread of our story.    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6822-00000023"/> CHAPTER VI. / TIIE SOLDIERS DAUGHTER. 'Tis not thy wealth of mind that bids My heart in homage bow; 'Tis not the soul of intellect That gems thy regal brow. But 'tis thy heart's true purity, Thy music-tones of love That draws the wearied soul to thee As thine is drawn above. M. MAVERLM.   IT was a beautiful spot where stood that elegant mansion, almost hidden by tall trees, and climbing vines, and sur- , rounded by a wilderness of beautiful and sweet-scented flowers, of every form and hue. -A veiling wreath of ivy climbed over the gothic portal, entirely conceal- ing. the fluted columns, and replacing them by its thick-leaved wreath of em- erald green. Entwining its delicate fo- liage wiih the dark green of the ivy, was a fragrant clematis, filling the air with its sweet perfume. Everything around the mansion seemed to speak of taste, elegance and luxury-and an admirer of rural beauty would have pronounced the spot almost a fairy paradise. At an open window, with her head resting upon her hand, and gazing ad- miringly upen the scene of beauty that' presented itself to her eyes, sat the sol- dier's daughter-the only child of Count Julian de St. Arnand and the lovely Is- abel Seville. More beautiful if such a   thing could be possible, than the ban- dit's daughter, was the maiden-for to the exquisite loveliness of her mother, was added the spiritedly curved lips and noble expression of her father. There were the same large, brilliant eyes, the, raven ringlets, and graceful, elegant form that had characterized Isabel Seville, but the complexion had not the dark southern tinge, but was as fair as ala- baster. A sweet, tender expression i lingered around the finely-chiselled lips, and the brilliant eyes, of midnight black- ness, were not illumined with their wonted fire-a softer, gentler expression had taken the place of,their sparkling brilliancy, and it only served to render her more exquisitely lovely. Her fair cheek was resting in the palm of her delicate band, but though she was gazing upon the beautiful scenery around, still, if one could judge by the expression of her countenance, her heart was revelling amid scenes of imagination, more than   in the beauty of the scenes around her., She wore a pure white dress, without a single ornament, save the jetty ringlets that fell in rich profusion over her fair neck and swelling bosom. Such was Eugenie de St. Arnand-the heroine of our tale, and, at the time of which we write, the belle of Northern Italy. The room in which sat the young girl  was the most pleasantly situated one of the St. Arnand mansion. The scenery from the windows was, indeed, lovely- characteristic of the sunny land of Italy. Every variety of view, from the most sublime to the most lovely, was visible from the different windows. . The battle ground, now fresh and blooming as ever, with its rich emerald foliage, rising greener and brighter than before, was plainly visible. And within the room had the same air of freshness and beauty that characterized the scenery around. The carpet was of the richest material, and in its colors were blended the bright- est with the most delicate hues. The room was somewhat darkened, for all the windows, save the one at which sat the maiden, were heavily curtained with' rich damask, and over these, delicate, muslin curtains fell gracefully, and sweptthe rich carpet with their. folds.- The furniture was all of rosewood, and cushioned with purple damask, Upon the table lay a harp, and several lsheets of music were lying around, showing that the soldier's daughter was not un- skilled in that most beautiful of all arts -music. In one corner of the room was an alcove, sufficiently large to con- tain a bed, and the snow-white curtains of which were closely drawn.  The young girl occasionally cast her eyes' anxiously towards it, but again fixing them upon the scenery before her, she relapsed into her reverie. Suddenly a low moan from the'direc-    tion of the alcove interrupted her medi- tations, and springing up, she approached it, and drew the snowy curtains careful- ly aside. There with his face almost as white as the pillow upon which he lay, his dark eyes closed, and his whole ap- pearance giving evidence that he had ex- perienced the most intense physical suf- fering, lay the, noble toung man who had been so severely wounded on the battle field of Marengo-Victor Berthier. He could scarcely move from the pain of his wounds, and, as yet, had not been pro- nounced out of danger of death from them. During the ten days which had passed since the battle, he had been rav- ing in a delirious fever-and talking wildly in the midst of his delirium, of the battle, of the defeat of the French, of Napoleon, and of the Austrians-and at times his eye would light up with a wild fierceness, his voice become strong and commanding, and again he would fancy himself amid the fire and excitement of battle. At ouch times, he would have been unmanageable, but for the severity of his wounds which were such as ren- dered him entirely helpless, and scarce- Iy able to move. The stout, muscular frame had been gradually growing thin- ter and weaker, until it was now redu- ced to an attenuated figure, as during all this time he had taken but very little nourishment of any kind. The surgeon, who had called to examine his wounds, on the night when he had been brought to $te mansion by the generosity of de St. Arnand, had then pronounced his wounds to be mortal, and informed the Colonel thatit was utterly useless to at- tempt to save him. 'Doctor Susart,' said Count Julien, as the physician imparted to him this unwelcome intelligence,' you must exert all your powers to save this young man. I have promised Napoleon ,that every    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6822-00000024"/> '4ing possible shall be done for him.- He must not die, Doctor Susart-if hu- man aid can save him.' 'Ah ' exclaimed Susart, elevating his eyebrows as if in surprise, 'then this is one of the young French fellows wounded at the-great battle I And one of Napoleon's favorites, it seems, by the great anxiety he displays for him. Well, Count, I'll do all in my power for him; though I have not the least doubt he'll be a corpse before the sun again sets.' 'Only saye him, doctor,-save his life, and your reward shall be anything that you will ask, that I can give. Napoleon has lost .Dessaix, whom 'he loved as a brother; and if Berthier, too, must die, it will be to him a sad blow. Save his life-and your reward shall be princely.' 'I will do my best, Count de St. Ar- nand,' returned the surgeon. Instruments were brought and Doctor Susart immediately set about dressing the wounds of his youthful patient. The severe gash in his side, that d'Elsey meant should reach his rival's heart, was found to be a very dangerous wound, from which the blood had been flowing freely for some time. There were also several other severe wounds upon his person, all of which Doctor Susart dress- ed with the nicest care, though, as he said, he had no hope of its doing any good. Victor, still'insensible, was then wrapped in warm flannels and'blankets, and his body kept warm by artificial heat, for the extremities were already becoming cold. The most strenuous efforts were then made to-restore him to conpoiousness, but, for a time, they did not succeed, and when he did again unclose his eyes, they were brilliant with the wildness of delirium. For three successive days did the sol- dier's daughter watch by the bedside of the young man, without leaving her post'   for a moment, or sleeping even when her frame was almost exhausted by her midnight watch. At the close of the third day her father, sternly bade her seek her couch and rest herself in slum- 3 ber, for the young soldier should be as tenderly cared for as if she was by his X side. She attempted to obey the man- , date, but, rising from her seat, her brain ; whirled, and she fell senseless to the floor. The over-excitement of the past three days had been too much for a ,frame unused to the slightest exertion. During that night, Eugenie slept pro- [oundly, and before the sun had reached her meridian the next day, she was at her post by the bed-side of Victor. The surgeon now began to entertain some slight hope of his recovery, for the wounds were very slowly healing, and though the delirious fever of the patient still continued, there was now a 'slight' chance for hope. Doctor Susart was almost constantly by his side; though he stoutly insisted it was not so much his excellent surgery, as it was the care- ful nursing, and unremitting attention of Eugenic, that was restoring the youth to life. For seven days more she had now been his constant attendant, allowing herself a short time each day for sleeping, but during which she was always careful that her place should be well supplied by some one who would attend him as kind- ly as herself. Thus ten days had passed since the battle of Marengo, and still Victor lay helpless, scarcely able to stir either hand or foot. During this tmne, Napoleon himself had several times visit- ed him, and expressed great anxiety for his recovery. On the morning of that day, Doctor Susart had informed Eage- nie that the life of Berthier now depend- ed mostly upon the abatement of thefee- ver, ant had given her the welcome in-   telligence that if a favorable change should take place in that, the young man would probably live. As Eugenie drew apart the curtains, when the moan from her patient had so suddenly startled her, she sprang back and uttered a slight exclamation of fear and terror, as she gazed upon the fea- tures of the young man. At first she thought he was dead, so perfectly did the countenance resemble that state.- The face was very, very pale-it had not the hectic flush that had mantled it the day before, or the countenance its wild, restless expression. The eyes were closed, and the features presented the ap- pearance of perfect stillness and repose. Eugenie sprang forward, and laid her trembling hand upon the heart of the young man. It beat, though faintly-- and a strange delight filled her mind to know that he yet lived. Slowly he un- closed his dark eyes, and fixed them with an inquiring glance upon Eugenie. 'Where am I? and who are you?' he murmured, in a faint, low voice. A thrill of delight shot through the heart of Eugenie, for these words as: well as his looks and manners, told her that reason had again resumed her sway, and the delirium of fever had gone. For a moment, she did not answer, but meet- ing the surprised and inquiring gaze of the patient she blushed and replied- 'You are in the houseA of Count de St. Arnand, and I am his only daughter. You were wounded very severely ten days ago, at the great battle of Maren- go. .. You were brought here senseless, and since: then your mind has been shrouded in delirium, while your wounds have been slowly healing. Though now not entirely out of danger, you are much better, and, with excellent care, you will probably recover.' O, I remember, now,' murmured Vic-   tor, half to himself, as he close his eyes as if in reflection, 'but tell me,' he ex- claimed, speaking eagerly, while his eyes lighted up with a flash of their wonted fire, 'tell me is Napoleon saf?-has d'Elsej escaped?-did the Austrians gain the victory?' ' Nqpoleon is safe, and has been here to visit you several times during your ill- ness' replied Eugenie, half smiling at his earnestness, and he seems to take a great interest in your welfare. The d'- Elsey you speak about, I know nothing of. The Austrians did not gain the vic- tory on that memorable day, but re- treated in the most inglorious and shame- ful disorder, and on the next day, Melas, with that number of his army as were left, surrendered to Napoleon, leaving the French general conqueror of Italy I' ' Thank God I' fervently ejaculated the young man, as he listened eagerly to the young girl's words. A slight flush of ex- citement flitted over his face, but quick- ly passed away, leaving it colorless as before. 'And Dessaix' again spoke Berthier, 'is he safe?' A shade of sadness passed over'the fair countenance of Eugenic, and, in a tong that proved she mourned with the for the death of the favorite officer, she replied-- ' essais is DEAD!' 'Dead! shot by the rascally Austri- ans!' cried Berthier, while his counte- nance expressed both grief and a desire to avenge the death of the noble officer, ' He was killed a short time after you were wounded,' replied Eugenie, 'and was buried that very night upon the bat- tle field. His grave can be seen from this room.' ' Dessaix was as brave and noble an officer as the army could boast,' replied Victor, mournfully, 'and   the whole    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6822-00000025"/> French nation will mourn his death.- But Napoleon-where is he?' 'He is at Milan. But Lieutenant Berthier,' said Eugenie, gently, yet firm- ly, 'you must ask no more questions at present, for you have talked too much already for your weak and debilitated state. To-morrow, if you are stronger, *I will gratify your curiosity a little more, but now, as your nurse, I shall be compelled to prohibit any more talking on your part. You must endeavor to sleep, for Doctor Susart will be here soon, to inquire into your symptoms, and if he finds you have been wearied by talking, he will be displeased with me for allowing you to do so.' So saying, she drew the curtains to- gether, and left the bedside, taking her seat in the chair by the window. Vic- tor closed his eyes, but he could not sleep. Sadness for the fate of Dessaix, mingled with exultation at the glorious victory of th French, filled his mind, but among those thoughts, the exquisite ly beautiful countenance of his fair -nurse'would occasionally steal. But the more he meditated, the more his mind was filled with the gentle maiden who had but now left his side. The soft, sweet voice, seemed softer and sweeter than any he had ever before heard. The liquid dark eyes were the brightest and most expressive, and the form the most elegant and graceful of any he had ever before met. And the most grateful feel- ings of his heart were also called into action, while thinking. of her, for she had watched by him and nursed him with the utmost tenderness, during ten days of severe illness, while he was helpless as an infant. 'This soldier's daughter is a lovely creature,' he murmured to himself, 'and I shall ever cherish towards her feelings of thP deepest gratitude. If it had not   'bten for her careful watching and nurs- ing, I might now have been slumbering in the cold embrace of death, instead of being yet on earth, with some prospect of regaining my lost health, and being myself again. And how much the in- telligence she has given me has revived me! I scarcely feel the pain of my wounds, when I realize that I have re- ceived them in serving the great Napo- leon. And they gained the victory on that terrible day, she tells me. Ah! the Austrians need not hope to conquer while Napoleon is in the field!' And giving himself up to these plea- surable reflections, he gradually fell in- to a deep and profound slumber. Euge- nie arose from her seat at the window, and again approaching the bedside part- ed the curtains and looked in upon the pale face of the unconscious sleeper. At first she again turned pale as the thought -that it might be'the dreamless slumber of death crossed her mind, but the breath came faintly from between the parted lips, and, her fears that the angel of death might have set his seal upon that noble brow, were soon quieted. She bent over him, and gazed long and earn- estly upon that marble-like countenance, while strange thoughts filled her mind. '0, if he should die now ' she mur- mured, half aloud, what a terrible blow it would be to me I It is strange how deeply my whole happiness, even my life, is centred in him. Yes, I might confess it to myogpn heart, though 1 would not to even my dearest friend, that I LOVE this young soldier, whom L have watched over with more than a sister's care, with all the depth, earnestness, and fervor of a first and truest love! And I have blindly loved him, without even a hope that my affection can ever be returned. I know not but he may have left behind him, with some fair maiden of his own   native land, the heart that I would give worlds, if I possessed them, to call my own. If so,. I have destroyed my happi- ness forever, by thus blindly loving him. But God forgive me, if it is a criminal love-for my affection was but the warm gushing of a heart that never knew de- ception. But it can never be returned. and henceforth my life must be one of anguish and misery.' Tears filled the eyes of the lovely maiden, as she gazed sadly upon the no- ble countenance before her, and, before she could dash them aside, they fell upon the face of the slumbering soldier. Eu- genie bowed her head, until her raven curls mingled with the dark locks of the youthful soldier, and imprinted upon the pale higa forehead a kiss of passionate devotion. Then almost frightened by her own boldness, and fearing she might have wakened him, she sprang hastily back, and drawing the curtains together, she took a seat by the bed-side. - Hours' passed on, and still he slept-and Eu- genie, like a faithful watcher, fat by the bed-side. Doctor 'Susart and the Count de St. Arnand had both been in to in- quire into the state of the wounded sol- dier, and the surgeon, much pleased, as well as surprised, at his improved con- dition, imparted to them the welcome' intelligence, that their patient was now in a fair way to recover, with careful nursing. Scarcely had they left, and while Eu- genie was struggling with her conflicting emotions, the door again opened, and Napoleon entered. He was dressed in full travelling costumeand seemed about to undertake a journey. Eugenie arose to greet him with a smile of pleasure , upon his fine features, and extended to him her hand which he grasped warm- . ly.  'How is our wounded young soldier,   to-day?' earnestly asked the great gen- eral, as he approached the alcove. 'Much better,' replied Eugenie,' Doe- tor Susart has just informed me that he is now in a fair way to recover.' A smile of undisguised pleasure flitted over the face of Napoleon. '  'And it is to your kind care and gen- tle nursing that he owes his life,' said Napoleon with one of those irresistable smiles that at times irradiated his coun- tenance. 'But can I speak to him, now?' 'Yes General,' spoke a voice from the alcove, for Victor had awaked at the mo- ment the General entered, and had re- cognized the voice of the new comer as that of his beloved commander. Again that smile of pleasure flitted i over the face of Napoleon, as he sprang forward and drawing aside the snowy curtains of the alcove, again met the eyes of his young favorite. The General grasped the attenuated hand of Victor, with all the warmth of an old and tried friend, and his whole manner told how great was his pleasure at the prospect of his youthful favorite's recovery. 'You have narrowly escaped from death, Victor,' said the General, gaztib upon the pale face of the loung man'Viti an expression of uncommon pity 'ana tenderness, 'and to this lovely girl,"h continued, pointing to the blushii'g EB genie, 'you owe your life. - tiftr if' greatest tenderness has she watched!dc 4 you during the ten days you ha;vers,'en ravine in delirium, and, not, the most devoted mother or affectionate fist6 could have performed th6' officeg with more kindness and attention.; :It isi her, Victor, more than to Vod6t69Sdui, though he, too, has wiel' pefformhod ,bli part, that you owe 7your 'ee .ape tfbal death.'      :: ; . i : 'I can never repay her. fully' /reiled    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6822-00000026"/> Victor, casting a look of the deepestl gratitude upon Eugenie, who stood blush- ing and confused, by the bed-side, ' and, in fact, the debt which I owe her cannot be repayed. But if the deepest grati- tude can be any equivalent for her un- rempitting kindness, I assure her that it is already hers. I trust that Providence will yet give me some opportunity for proving it, as I feel under the greatest obligations to repay the debt as far as lies in my power.' It will be long, I fear, before you will be able to do her any important service,' replied Napoleon, 'for these wounds will prevent your rising from your bed for many weeks yet. They were very severe-the one who inflicted them evi- dently intended they should be your death-wounds. They were given, the surgeon said, by a sword. Do you know, Victor, who it was that inflicted them?' 'Yes, I do know,' replied Victor, his dark eyes brightening with a flash of their wonted fire. ' It was that rascally villain and traitor, d'Elsey!' 'And did HE escape with his life?' asked Napoleon. I think it very probable that he did,' returned Victor, bitterly. 'Such vil- Jains seem to be bullet-proof, and as I aave neither seen or heard anything of him since, I havn't'any doubt but what he escaped. He was on the Austrian side, and dressed in full Austrian uni- form.' 'And it was HE that inflicted the wound itha has so nearly proved mortal 1' ex- Napoleon, with a strange fire in his dark grey eye. ' Had I known it then-had I, known it on the field of, Marengo-he would have been food for the vultures before this time I And you say he has turned traitor?' 'It is true,' replied Victor. He wore a full Austrian uniform, and the moment   II set my eyes upon him, I knew he was the traitor I had sworn vengeance upon. But d'Elsey is as expert a swordsman as myself-and I soon found that it was no commpon enemy that I had to deal with. I did my best to disarm him, and should have succeeded, but, by a desperate plunge, he disarmed me of my sword, and then inflicted this teirible wound in my side with his own. It was meant for my heart, and had it not been for the interposition of a kind Providence, it would have been my death-wound. I felt senseless the moment it was inflict- ed-and since then, I have known noth- ing that was passing until this morning. I know not where d'Elsey went, but sup- pose that he joined the Austrians, and escaped with them, for I have a firm be- lief that he has not yet received the pun- ishment due his dastardly course.' ' But, when I went to view the Aus- trian army after the terms of capitulation were agreed upon, I saw nothing of either Delaney or d'Elsey, though I glanced at every face in the lines, expecting to see them. But Delaney, did you see him among the Austrians?' 'I did not,' promptly replied Victor. 'But I have no doubt 'but that he was with them.' Neither have I, returned Napoleon, ' I will set spies upon their track, and give such directions as will ensure their apprehension. And if they are disoov-- ered, I can assure you they will pay the penalty of their crimes with death. I cannot remain here myself longer, as my presence is needed in Paris. I shall leave Milan fbr the French capital to- day.' 'And when shall you return?' asked Victor, anxiously. 'It will be needless for me to return, replied the General, Italy is conquered, and I leave Massena here to keep it un-   der subjection. I am the first Consul of France, and it is my duty to look after her affairs at home as well as to lead her armies abroad: I shall remain in Paris for the present.' 'And the army--will that remain in Italy 2 A portion of it. But the regiment to which you are attached, will go with me. And, my young friend,' continued Napoleon, drawing from his bosom a captain's commission, and holding it up before the astonished eyes of Victor, 'I give you this, as a slight testimony of my good opinion of your merits. It is a reward for your faithfulness and effici- eny in my service, and, if you continue as you have begun, it shall not ,be the only one you will receive.' 'God bless you, General Bonaparte!' fervently exclaimed Victor, fixing his glance upon Napoleon, with an expres- sion little short of veneration. ' My life shall be given to your service, and, if I ever prove recreant, I will lay my head upon the block most willingly. I feel that I do not deserve this kindness- and I cannot think you sufficiently for it.' 'Speal not of thanks, my friend,' re- plied the General, while that fascinating smile again overspread his features, you have fully deserved it all. -Vhen you are sufficiently recovered to under- take such a journey, come immediately to me at Paris. You will be welcomed by your regiment as their captain. Be cautious and watchful as regards De- laneyand d'Elsey; for I have not the least doubt but that they are determin- ed to take your life, and when d'Elsey ascertains that he has failed in accom- ] plishing your death this time, he will  be doubly watchful against your escap- t ing him., And as to your recovery,' he i continued, turning with a pleasant smile 1   to the lovely Eugenie, who stood near, 'I leave it in the hands of Mademoiselle de St. Arnand.' 'Then I assure you it is certain,' re- turned Eugenio, smiling sweetly and blushing rosy red. 'I have no doub thut captain Berthier will soon be on his feet again, if Madam- oiselle Eugenie will continue to be his nurse,' answered Napoleon, gaily. ' And I have no fears for his recovery, while his symptoms are as favorable as at pres- ent, and his nurse so unremitting in her kindness and care. But I cannot pro- long my visit more,' he continued, turn- ing again to Victor, 'for it is time I was already on my way to Paris, I trust you will meet me there before many" weeks have expired,-farewell,my young friend-may God soon restore you to health and happiness!' 'Adieu, General-may heaven bless and prosper you!' fervently ejaculated the wounded 'soldier, as Napoleon tend derly pressed his hand at parting. 'Farewell, Madenoiselle Eugenie,' said Bonaparte, kindly, as he grasped the hand of the maiden, 'I trust you will yet be as happy as you are beautiful andlovely I' And, with a parting wave of the hand, the conquerer of Italy bade them adieu, and passed from the room. At the door stood his favorite jet black charger, and springing into the saddle, he was soon out of sight. Victor closed his eyes, and gave him- self up to the wanderings of his imagin- ations. In fancy, he was again upon the battle-field-again charging the vic- torious foe, and, sweeping them before his powerful arm. Anon, the wild shout of VICTORY rose upon the air; and he, too, had gained it I The enemy was his prize; and, exulting, ho now looked for higher promotion. And he did not'look    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6822-00000027"/> in vain, for it was granted. He soon ; became a general. Favor after favor is v bestowed upon him-wealth, titles and t -honors are his, and soon, in imagination, i he sees himself the favorite of his coun- x try, and second in power only to Napo- ( leon himself I But this scope of fancy, - added to the excitement of the interview with Napoleon, was too much for the i wounded soldier's weakened powers-  i and, closing his eyes involuntarily, hbe- I relapsed into a fit of insensibility.  Days and weeks passed-still the 1 wounded young man remained at the mansion of Count de St, Arnand-and still the lovely Eugenie watched over him with more than a sister's tenderness. Doctor Sausart, though his visits were less frequent, occasionally called at the, mansion, to inquire into the situation of his patient, but Victor had now so near- ly recovered froWn the severity of the wound, as to render his services need-  less. But still the kind care of Eugenie was not diminished; and, under her treatment, the young man . rapidly im- proved. He was now so much better as to be able to converse for several' hours without detriment; and conversation with him only strengthened the hope- less love that turned within her bbsom for him, and served but to draw the chords of affection tighter. She saw that his mind was as noble ad his person; that in any kind of conversation, he was perfectly at home; and though young in years, he evinced a strength of mind,and superiority of feeling, that is rarely seen in those of more advanced ages. He conversed of history, art,poetry, travels ; in fact, of everything, but of love. On this subject he was silent, and the heart of Eugenie, which had at first treasured up something of a hope that her affec, tion might be returned, ow bowed like a crushed lily, ben6ath the weight of an   guish that rested upon her soul. In vain had she watched him eagerly to de- tect one glance of love; all was cold and passionless, and the gentle, beautiful maiden felt that she was unloved by the one whose affection, of all others, she would have possessed. The truth was, that the tenderest feel- ing Victor cherished for the fair Eugenic, was gratitude. It is true, he admired her peerless beauty, which he acknowl- edged excelled that of any maiden he had'ever before seen; and he admired her many accom plishments, her graces of both person and mind, and her rare talents. He acknowledged her superi- ority of intellect, and her fascinating i charms. But if there was anything that would have won the heart of the youth- ful soldier, it was her purity of heart, her gentleness and sweetness of dispo- sition, and her unremitting kindness and ,attention to himself He felt for her respect, admiration and gratitude; and, had not his hear been invincible to Cu- pid's darts, he would have loved hU.- But the heart and soul of the young sol- dier was now rendered unimpressible to female charms, for their love was given only to fame and honor. Glory was his bride-and most fervently did he wor- ship her! Three nmonths had passed since Napo- leon had departed on his journey to Pa- ris, and the wounds which Victor had , received were now so well healed, that Ihe entertained serious thoughts of leav- "ng Italy, and joining Napoleon in Paris. ; This determination was imparted to Col. ; de St. Arand, and, though he would i 'gladly have enjoyed the society of the t young man longer, still he did not oppose I the measure, as he knew it was for the ; good of the ambitious young captain.- e But upon the gentle Eugenie the blows a, fell with greater force. While young   Captain Berthier had been among them, she had felt a pleasure even- in being in the society of the beloved one, though she now felt all too deeply the sadden- ing truth that her affection was not re- turned. She had blindly loved on with- out daring to think of the future. or of the weight of untold misery which it had. in store for 'her. But now even the pleasure of his society; was to be denied her. The one whom she loved so mad- ly was about to' leave her, perchance for- ever, and she must be left to endura he misery of unrequited love with naught 'to solace her heart's deep sorrow! The day came   when Victor was to leave them--and with a heart full of the deepest misery, Eugenie descended to bid him farewell. In vain dideshe gaze eagerly into his dark eyes, with the hope 'that she might discover one glance' of tenderness there-but it was useless, for a his countenance was as passionless as  sculptured marble. The heart of Eu- ] genie sank heavily within her bosom.- To tell the truth; Victor did really re- a gret leaving the hospitable mansion, where he had received so much kindness, 8 arid whose inmates had preserved him  c from a  grave on the field of battle, and restored him again to life and health. He   knew he should miss the pleasant company of Eugenie, and he felt a pang of regret at leaving her. And the old Count, too--the young man loved him  y as a  father, and it was with tears in his eyes that he bade him farewell   With fa a   hearty grasp of the hand, and a fer- vent I  God bless you' they parted, and Y the young Captain turned to Eugenie. fa Mademoiselle de St. Arnand,' said Victor, taking her hand tenderly, it is vc to you that I  owe my life, and most deep- er ly do I regret that fate is about to call sp me away from the pleasure of your soci- ce ety, which has ever been to me a delight. ki   a, I owe you a debt of gratitude which I n can neverrepay. I maynevermeetyou h again, fair Engenie-but if I do not, I a- can never forget your kindness, and your e- watchful care over me during weeks of 1- sickness. I trust I shall yet have an If opportunity to prove my gratitude for d. your unremitting kindness.' e  ' Speak not of it,' returned Eugenie, in d a trembling voice, 'for it was no more - than I would have done for any suffer-  ing creature. If it has Restored you to e health, I am fully repaid, and can neither t ask or accept any other reward for the action.' ' As generous as you are kind,' replied  Victor, smiling, ( but I must now leave ) this hospitable mansion, where I have ; spent so many pleasant hours, to seek my fortune in the land of my nativity.-. I hope-nay, I trust, that we may yet meet again. If we should not, I shall ever remember you with emotions   of pleasure.' ' I trust I shall never forget the hours we have passed together in pleasant and profitable conversation,' returned Eu- genie, while, with a master effort, she suc- ceeded in forcing back her tears. ' And, wherever you may be, my best wishes will be for your safety, happiness, 'and' success.' ' jnd my   fervent prayer shall be for your health and happiness,' replied Vie- tor, tenderly pressing to his lips the white hand he held in his.  But now, fair Mademoiselle Eugenie, I must bid you adieu. May heaven's richest Lbes- sings be showered upon your head-- farewell!' ' Farewell!' murmured Eugenie, in a voice almost inarticulate from intense emotion. Victor released her hand, and springing into the saddle, he turned his' charger's head, .and rode rapidly away, kissing his fingers to Eugenie as a part    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6822-00000028"/> ing salute. The heart-stricken maiden gazed after him until his form was lost to view, and then, unable to endure her   agony longer, she fell insensible into her father's arms!   CHAPTER VII. TIE CONSPIRATORS OF LA VENDEE. "In the vales of placid gladness, Let no rueful maniac range; Chase afar the fiend of Madness, Wrest the dagger from Revenge!,' [From "Medea," translated by Campbell.   It was in the month of January, 1803 -more than two years bad passed since the greathattle of Marengo, and the sub- mission of the Austrians to the French. Still Napoleon Bonaparte was First Con- sul of France-and rapidly rising in favor with the nation, and becoming the terror of all Europe. His star was still rising in the horizon of fame, and it bid fair to outshine all others who might dare attempt to rival him in the favor of the nation. His daring bravery-his per- feet self-command in danger, and his un- precedented success in every thing which he undertook, all contributed to render him a favorite with the enthusiastic, war- loving French people, and they now look- ed upon him as a/being possessing powers iand talents of no ordinary degree of im- portance. And with our young hero, Vietor Ber- thier-time had also wrought many changes. During the two years which had passed, he had been to Napoleon a true friend,-and had often assisted him   materially in carrying out his plans.- Possessing ability, courage, and a perfect willingness to aid him in any thing that would not compromise his honor. Na- poleon found in the young Captain Ber- thier, an invaluable assistant. He had been promoted to the post of Colonel in the army, and now enjoyed the honor of private Secretary to the First Consul. And, in the army he was a decided fav- orite. His kind disposition, perfect gentlemanly deportment, and withal, the favor in which he stood with the com- mander, all contributed to render him beloved and respected by his brother of- ficers. Itis true, some disliked him from mere envy of his position in the confi- dence of the general, but there werefew, for the frankness of the Frenchman's is- position, prevents him from perien- cing envy as much as the people of most other nations. And, in the highest circles of society, -in the class ambng which Napoleon himself moved, the young secretary was   at all times a welcome guest. His ex- tremely handsome countenance, and the perfect grace and elegance of every ac- tion, would have been a sufficient pass- port to the good graces of the higher circles, even had he possessed no, other peculiar recommendation. But his live- ly sallies of wit, which, like lightning amid the darkness, occasionally gave a new lustre to his conversation; his ex- celtent powers of conversing; and, with- al, his strength and versatility of mind, rendered him a decided favorite among the more intellectual class, and. among the 'fairer sex,' he was universally ac- knowledged to be a young man of re- markably fascinating manners; and many a schenming beauty tried all her arts to entrap the handsome young sec- retary, but all were fruitless-Victor was invincible to the power of beauty. And it may be asked by the interested readers, 'Did not Victor, during this time, ever think of Eugenia de St. Ar- nand?' Often, very often, yet the feel- ings with which he thought of her were never deeper than those of gratitude. He acknowledged to his own heart, that she was the most fascinating maiden he had ever met, but yet, he loved her not, for his heart was given to the goddess qf Ambition I But now with the readers consent, we will transfer the plot of our story to the pretty village of La Vandee, a place about twenty miles distant from Paris. It was a retired and secluded spot, sur- rounded by high and rocky hills, seem- ing alone by [itself, and isolated from the rest of the world. The spires of two churches were visible from between the green foliage of the trees, their white walls contrasting beautifully with the 'dark emerald here. Here and there were scattered white cottages, with the neat cheerful aspect which characterizes 4 t   the homes of the French peasantry. On the southern side of the village, and sev- eral rods from any other building, stood a house of much larger size than the- others, and seemingly a place of consid- erable importance. It had once been painted white, but was now grimmed with age, and more a light slate color than any other hue. Thewindows were all protected by blinds of a dull green. color, most of which were kept closed: A large yard, with here and there a state- ly tree to disturb the dreariness of the prospect, extended around three sides of the building, and though it gave evidence of having once been highly cultivated and beautified with flowers, it was now overgrown with weeds, and presented the appearance of perfect neglect. Above the door was hung a small swinging sign, informing the traveller that the large gray building was an inn, and bore the name of the 'Rosy Cross.' It was a cold, chilling night in the month of January, 1803, and the wind, seeming determined to Sweep all before its resistless power, whistled among the leafless trees with uncontrolable fury. But few travellers were abroad, and those that dared to brave the fury of the chilling north wind, were closelymuf- fled in their cloaks to protectthemselves 'from the sleet-laden blast A blazing" fire was sending its genial influence throughout the parlor of the', Rosy 'Cross,' and gathered around it with their feet upon the fender, and puffing away at their cigars with considerable energy, were several worthies, chatting upon their various matters, and seeming. to think little, and care as much, about the strife of the elements around. Most of them were men past the middle age.; but yet all eemed hale and hearty, and. well fitted to endure the many changes. of life for years longer. But two or    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6822-00000029"/> three of them were young men, and these, who bat together at some distance from the others, were chatting gaily of the many levees and balls of the season, which they had lately attended in the gay City of Paris.  On one side of the store sat a man of about fifty years of age, with dark, shag- gy hair almost concealing his features, and an expression in which cunning and daring were mingled. His eyes were jet black, keen, brilliant and searching, and expressive of spirit and courage. He was tall and had it not been for a tre- mendous hump upon the back, would have been elegantly formed. He was dressed in the usual style of the French peasantry, but instead of the small close- ly fitting cap, he wore a large Spanish slouched hat, ornamented with a droop- ing'black plume. He was listlessly puf- fing a Spanish cigaretto, but seemed more interested in listning to the con- versation of his companions, than in join- ing with them. Two of them were con- versing of the condition of France under the supervision of Napoleon, and at times the dark strangers eye would flash, and his whole frame seem to tremble with suppressed excitement, but still he spoke not, and only puffed away at his cigaretto, though it was evident he was listning to every word that was spoken by the two men. Both of these men were persons in whom at first glance, we shduld detect nothing uncommonly unpleasant, but upon more acute observation, it would be perceived by a keen student of human nature, that they were men it would be - dangerous to rouse. Both were dressed  in the usual style of the French peasan-  try, but their demeanor would quickly  convince the most casual observer that X they were not of the class to which their i dress proclaimed them to belong. One    was tall and symmetrically formed, and with a grace and elegance of manners, that told he had once seen better days. The eyes of this individual were a keen sharp gray, evincing both courage and cunning, which expression was also visi- ble in the strongly marked features, and the small, finely cut, haughtily curved lips. His, light'hair was long and abun- ant, and fell over his shoulders in such profusion, as almost to conceal his fea- tures. The other was short, thick set, and more awkward, with lead colored eyes, and short crisp red hair. Hes nose, which was the principal [feature of his countenance, was almost frightful in its appearance, having been broken several times, and withal uncommonly large. At first sight, a person would take him for a perfect dough-head; but upon far- ther examination, it would be discovered that he possessed as much cunning and shrewdness as his more comely compan- ion. 'It's a fierce night without, Georges,' said the red-haired man, gazing from the only one of the windows which had not its blinds closed, 'and I fear that St. Aubert will not be here to-night. He will hardily dare to brave such a storm, and come from Paris here, even for such a purpose, and one in which he seems so much interested. I fear he will not come.' Hush! speak lower, Mairn!' whisp- ered Georges, frowning terribly upon his companion, while his keen grey eyes flashed with anger, ' You must be cau- tious how you speak of these things,' he continued, in a tone so low that only the dark-looking man in the slouched hat could possibly hear him, for there are ears here that will take up every sound, and even the first breath of insurrection will be borne to the ears of Napoleon himself. You must be more cautious,   Maim-if you are not you will ruin us all!' , A strange smile flitted over the face of the dark stranger of the slouched hat, as his quick ear detected the low-spoken words of his companion. His keen eyes glittered with satisfaction, and he puffed away at the cigaretto With renewed en- ergy. The two men, who had been con- versing so mysteriously together, now relapsed into silence, and the gentleman with the slouched hat soon became aware that though he had been puffing away at his cigaretto so energetically, it had gone out more than half an hour before. An hour passed-and, by Georges and Mairn, as also by the one who had list- ened to their conversation, this time was passed in silence. The rest of the com- pany chattered and laughed, and conver- sed upon the news of the day. and seem- ed not to notice the taciturnity of their companions at all. But Georges, who had all this while Teen casting anxious glances from the window every few mo-  ments, now arose, and going to the win-  dow, gazed earnestly out into the dark- l ness. Eor several moments he endea-  vored to penetrate the deep gloom which E hung around; but the effort was useless,  and abandoning the attempt, he again 1 seated himself by the side of Maim. I But scarcely had he taken his seat,  when the tramp of horses feet was dis- p tinctively heard, and, a moment after, it c ceased at the door of the inn. A man e sprang from the saddle of the foaming o charger, and, giving the bridle to the at- a tentive hqstler, he entered the inn. A  moment more elapsed and the door of d the parlor opened, and the new comer p entered, and threw himself into a chair tl before the blazing fire. The eye of every cc one in the circle was turned upon him. p! 'Pretty cold night this,' said one of bl the peasants, who had been chatting for, w   s the last hour about the cold weather, as he drew up his chair nearer to the fire, e and addressed the new comer, 'Don't i, you think so, stranger?' ' Yes, 1 do,Z answered the other, short- s ly, as he rubbed his half-frozen hands i vigorously together. Have you ridden far to night, strang- er?' again asked the other, who appear- ed to be a person of a sociable turn. ' Yes,' answered the stranger, seem- ingly not disposed to cultivate the ac- quaintance of his new friend;.  'How far, if I may be so bold as to ask?' questioned his Persevering tor- mentor. 'As much again as half,' rather sharp. ly replied the stranger. This sally effectually silenced the in- quisitive gentleman, and the strager was allowed to warm his frozen limbs in peace. The new comer was a tall, symmetrically built man, but he posses- sed the same defect of the dark-looking stranger with the slouched hat--he was hump-backed. In addition to this, his right leg was quite lame, and these two detects combined, seemed to destroy the symmetry of his form. His complexion was of a dark southern hue, and his eyes, brilliant and searching, were black as midnight. His hair, of the same raven hue, was coarse and shaggy, and fell in profusion around his temples, entirely concealing his forehead, and shading his eyes like a curtain. His lips were the only handsome portion of his counten- ance. They were beautifully shaped, and curved with an expression of proud defiance and manly daring, and, when parted with a smile, disclosed teeth of the finest ivory. He was dressed in the costume of a French gentleman-with a pair of beautifully mounted pistols visi- ble from beneath the folds of his coat, while from the bosom. protruded the    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6822-00000030"/> jewelled hilt of a dagger. From his' richly-ornamented cap drooped a grace- ful snow white plunge, which was now twined in among the raven looks of the stranger, forming a perfect contrast in color. Since the arrival of the stranger, a perfect silence had reigned in the parlor of the Rosy Cross,' save when the old Frenchman had endeavored to draw him into conversation, and had been so sig- nally repulsed. His presence seemed to east a shade over the, spirits of all, for not even the gay young men, who had been laughing and chatting so merrily, seemed able to break the spell. At length the young man raised his eyes, which had been fixed, until now, upon the blazing fire before him, and they in- stantly met those of Georges. One glance only passed between then-but that glance was sufficient. There was a world of meaning in it, ,and each un- derstood well what the other would have conveyed. The new comer was the one who had been so long expected- their ally, St. Aubert! A few moments more elapsed, and then Maim and Georges both rose, and, without a word, left the room. St. Au- bert leaned back in his chair, and, yawn- ing lazily, called to an attendant to show him to his room.  ' Will not the gentleman take a cup of tea before retiring?' asked the obse- quious attendant- i I have no wish for any,' carelessly re- plied the stranger, with an im atient gesture towards the door. The servant understood it, andkng up a lamp, led the young man to t room destined to receive him for the night. The attendant retired, at a ges- ture from his master, and St. Aubert was left alone. Ten minutes,"perchanee, had elapsed,   during which time St. Aubert had been pacing the room with a quick and im- patient step, when the door was slowly and cautiously opened, and Georges, fol- lowed by Maim, entered the room. St. Aubert stopped in his walk, and greeted the new comers with a pleasant smile. 'You are very late, Monsieur St Au- bert,' said Georges. 'We have been waiting for you for more than an hour, ahd ad almost dispaired of your coming'  'It is some distance from here to Paris, you know, Monsieur Georges,' re- plied St. Aubert, in a,careless tone, 'and before I had got ten miles on my way, I was so chilled by the fierce snow-laden blast, that I was, obliged to halt at a- pleasant country house, and warm my benumbed limbs. And I had gone about ten miles farther, when I was obliged to stop again for the same purpose ' This fact, added to my being detained later in Paris than I had expected to be, ac- counts for my tardiness.' ' You have given a very satisfactory explanation, Monsieur St. Aubert,' re- plied Georges, with a smile, 'but we must join the league now; for I suppose you are anxious to become a member of our band of liberators.' 'I am, indeed,' returned the young man, 'but have you not been with them yet this evening ' 'I have not,' answered Georges. 'I wished to meet you when' you first ar- rived, and therefore remained in the par- lor of the inn. Maim chose to remain with ine, so that neither of us have yet entered the secret chamber. But now you have come, we will delay no longer, for those of the league already assembled, have no doubt despaired of seeing me to- night. Follow me, St. Aubert.' Georges took from his pocket a dark lantern, and leading the trio, he was fol- lowed by St. Aubert, while Marin   brought up the rear. They first ascen- ded a long, winding flight of stairs, at last. terminating before ia large heavy oaken door. Georges drew a key from his pocket, and inserting it in the lock, the bolt shot quickly back. The door was now throtwn open, and they entered alarge square, unfurnished room, with no visible door leading from it save the one at which they had just entered. St. Aubert was at a loss to know what was to come next, but he found that Georges was equal to the emergency. Approach- ing a portion of the wall, which to all outward appearances was the same as the rest, he touched a concealed spring, and a small door flew open, disclosing a secret passage. Mairn first sprang through the opening thus made, St. Aur- bert followed, while Georges brought up the rear, and cldsed the secret opening. They passed on through a devious winding corridor, so low that they were often obliged to stoop to prevent coming in contact with the ceiling above. This soon ended, and they reached another flight of stairs, at the head of which was visble an oaken door, lar ger and strong- er than the first. To this Georges ap- plied a peculiarly formed key, and shoot- ing back the bolt, threw the door wide open. Theglare of the lamps almost blinded the eyes of St. Aubert, but ac- customing them to the blaze as quickly as possible, he turned his gaze upon the scene around. They had all now entered the room, which was a hall of large de- mensions, and the door was locked se- curely on the inside by Georges. Small lamps were set in sconces around 'the room at short distances from one anoth- er, and their united glare formed a bril- liant blaze. Thick and ample curtains shrouded the windows, and the blinds were all closed. In the centre of the room was a large stoye, in wnich was   burning a roring fire, that was sending its genial influences throughout, the roQm. In this hall were seated about a hun- dred men, of ages from twenty to sixty, dressed in every imaginable style of cos- tume. Some wore the rich dress of a Spanish cavalier, others the gay costume dr French gentleman, but most of them were dressed in the style of the French peasantry. The room was filled with cigar smoke, for nearly every one of the company were puffing away at a cigarette All rose simultaneously as Georges en- tered, followed by Maim and St. Aubert, while several sprang forward to grasp his hand, but assuming an air of dignity, he waved them back to their seats, and , turning to St. Aubert he said:- 'Gentlemen, to-night I have brought 'with me a new ally in the cause of liber- ty. His name is St. Aubert, and he is 'from Paris. I met him a few days since in that city, and endeavored to draw out ,his opinions upon the subject of Napo- leons ascending the throne of the Bour- bons, and I soon saw that he entertained the same feelings in regard to the usurper as we ourselves do. I sounded him suf- ficiently upon the subject, and then ven- tured to disclose to him the whole con- spiracy, and asked him to take a share in it, he readily accepted the proposal. To-night he has come here to take the oath of the league, and become a mem- ber of the liberating band. Unavoida- ble circumstances prevented his coming sooner, and his delay has caused mine. But now we will to business. In the first place the binding oaths of league must be administered to our new confed- erate.'      .  : Gentlemen,' said St. Aubert, stepping ,forward and removing the plumed cap from his head, 'I come here to-night to join you against the treacherous usurper, $1    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6822-00000031"/> Napoleon Bonaparte. I shall do all in my power to further the noble cause in which we are enlisted. This conspiracy is a result for which I have been long wishing, and I now engage in it with the greatest of pleasure, I'am ready to take the oaths that make me a member of it at any moment.' "We will soon be through with tde ceremony," said Georges, throwing open his coat and disclosing two pairs of handsomely mounted pistols, and the hilt of a dagger. He took out one of the loaded pistols,.and, approaching St. Aubert, he levelled it at his heart. The room was silent as the grave but at length the stern voice of Gborges broke the stillness.. "Raise your hand to heaven and solemn swear that you will never dis- close the secrets of this league to mortal man 1" St. Aubert took the oath. "Swear that you will aid us in every-   thing we may undertake, to the extent of your ability, and that you will prove to the last, faithful to the league!" St. Aubert pronounced the oath. "Swear that you will do ail in your power to dislodge Napoleon Bonaparte from the station which he now occupies, and sink him in disgrace, misery, and death!" Again the required oath was taken. "And now," continued Georges, lower- ing his pistol from the breast of St. Aubert, "see that you break not one of these oaths, for the hour that you do it, you shall be a corpse! I say it, and I never speak in vain!" The oaths were taken-and the young man breathed freer, as the pistol was lowered from his breast, and again placed in the belt of (eorges. The ceremony was performed-and Armand St. Aubert found himself a member of the terrible LacAGUE OF CONSPIRATORS!   CHAPTER VIII. THE BENIGHTED   TRAVELLER--THE SPY. The hand of crime Hath stamped its loathsome impress on his brow, And in his soul, stained with guilt's darkest dye, The demon of revenge is burning still, And blots out all his native nobleness. E. ELLINGWOOD.   HALF an hour; perchance, had elapsed since Mairn and Georges had left the parlor of the "Rosy Cross," to join the conspirators in the secret chamber. The wind blew, if possible, more furiously than it had before done, and swept around the corners of the buildings as if determined to carry everything before it. The streets of the village of La Vendee were entirely deserted; and most of the lamps of the cottages had been extinquished, save now and then a faint glimmer from some chamber win- dow, seen but dimly through the almost impenetrable gloom. With his horse headed in the direc- tion of the village of La Vendee, and urging it forward with as much speed as the darkness and the irregularity of the way would permit, was a young man, evidently in haste to reach the village, yet perplexed to know in what direction to go. It was yet several miles to La Vendee; and the noble looking animal which the traveller bestrode, was already jaded and travel worn, and foaming at the mouh with fatigue and excitement. The traveller himself, seemed as anxious to reach his journey's end, as was his no- 'ble charger, but yet he seemed at a loss to know whether the road he was pur-   suing was the one that would lead him to his destination. All was darkness both before and behind, and not even a single light gleamed out from the im- penetrable gloom, to guide him onward. The road was one of the most dreary highways in the northern part of France, and not a single person had the traveller met for the last ten miles, and he had not passed more than two or three dwell- ings for that distance, and though he had inquired at these for directions on his way, the inmates either could not or would not inform him. 'This business is assuming rather a serious aspect,' muttered the traveller to himself, as he again endeavored to pierce the heavy gloom with his earnest gaze, ' and I would give a sovereign if 1 was only safely out of it. But yet, I do not really feel inclined to give up the pro- ject entirely, as I may yet be of consider- able efficiency in detecting these villains, and bringing to light as dark a plot as was ever recorded in the annals of crime. I know the undertaking is hazardous, and attended with danger, for, if I should be discovered, the only thing I could hope would be death. But I think I can carry out the plan successfully, for I have thought long upon it, and chobeu    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6822-00000032"/> the best way to play the spy, and not be  discovered. If I am successful, the re- sult of the enterprise will be of incalcu- lable benefit to Napoleon. If I fail death is the only alternative that I can hope for. But I will not think of fail- ure-I will hope for the best.' The meditations of the young man were interrupted by a faint light, just distinguishable through the heavy gloom which hung around, and which was apparently nearing him. The steed seemed to perceive it at the same mo- ment with his rider, and pricking up his ears, he quickened his pace without need of urging, and trotted along at quite a brisk rate, The light seemed to come nearer, and the traveller soon became aware, from the faint glimmer with which it illuminated the darkness, that it pro- ceeded from a lantern carried in the hand of some one, who was travelling in the opposite direction. A smile of grat- ification lighted up the anxious face of the young horseman, for he had deter- mined to question the stranger, whoever he might be, and ascertain if he was in the vicinity of the village where he was to pWssthe nigt. As the light drew nearer, he perceived that it was the glare of a lantern, carried in the hand of a middle-aged, sober looking peasant, muf- fled to the eyes in a large woolen shawl, and otherwise pretty efficiently protect- ed from the chilling blasts of the cold north-east wind. As he came within range of the foot passenger, the horseman halted, and, in a voice of eager inquiry, asked, ' My good friend can you tell me if 1 am on the direct road to the village of La Vendee?' The peasant looked up, and raising his lantern so as to get a better view, he commenced a deliberate survey of the    stranger's features wi thut replying to the question. The lip of the traveller curved with a scornful smile, and, in an impatient tone, he exclaimed, 'Please answer my question, and not stand here reconnoitering me, as if I was something very wonderful. My horse is jaded and travel-worn, and, as well as myself, is hungry and cold, and does not wish to stand here waiting for you to survey us. So tell me, as soon as you conveniently can, if I am on the road to La Vendee.' The peasant didn't seem at all inclined to be in a hurry, but continued his sur- vey of the person and accoutrements of the horseman, much to the impatience and displeasure of the latter. At length he lowered the lantern, and fixing his small twinkling grey eyes upon the face of the stranger, he replied: 'Well, old feller, I guess I can tell you about where you are. But I shan't be in any hurry about it, so you need'nt be so kinder anxious and eager. But, afore I tell ye, I wantto know what your name is.'  This was said in such an honest, yet comical tone, that the young horseman could not forbear laughing outright.- At first, he determined not to gratify the curiosity of the strange genius be fore him; but, upon further thought, he saw that it would be best to do so, in order to gain the information which he desired. Therefore, though he was, in reality, both vexed and impatient, he replied with a light laugh., 'You're an odd genius, I should think, and if I was not in an uncommon hurry, I'd go along and find the way in some other manner, instead of standing here in the cold, waiting for you to get ready to direct me. But as you insist upon knowing my name, I will gratify your   not very commendable curiosity by in- forming you that I am known by the name of St. Clair.' 'Quite a pretty sort 9f a name, con- siderin' what a scaly lookin' sort of a chap owns it,' replied the other, with a curious squint of'his small grey eyes.- 'And, in the second place, I want to know where you come from.' 'I have ridden from Paris, a distance of rather more than twenty miles, with- in the last two hours, and I am perfect- ly chilled through with the cold north- east wind, and wish very much to reach my destination which is the Inn of the 'Rosy Cross,' at the village of La Ven- der. I am not much acquainted with this region, and I fear I have lost my way. Therefore, my good friend, if you will inform me, without further digres- sion, if thisis the direct road to La Ven- der, and how far it is from this spot to the village, you will oblige me very much.' "Well, stranger, as I began to per- ceive that you are an .honest feller, and ain't a tryin to stuff a body with inqui- rin for a place that you know as well as ye do your own name, I'll tell ye all that you'll want to know. In the first place, this is the direct road to La Vendee. The village is about three miles distant, and the road to the plaoe is straight ahead, so that you can't miss it, even in the dark. The Rosy Cross is the largest house in the village, and the only inn. I guess you'll find the way now!" "I think I shall," was the pleased re- ply of the horseman. "Wouldnt you like this lantern to aid you in finding the way?" asked the friendly peasant. "I can go very well without it, now that I am sure I am on the right track," replied the young man. Well, good bye-I hope you'll get there safely," said the odd genius, and,   with this parting salutation, he lowered his lantern, and jogged on, leaving the horseman in the middle of the dark road, to pursue his way to La Vendee as he best could. St. Clair, as he had given his name to be, looked after his receding figure for a moment, and then putting spurs to his horse, started onward. at a brisk' trot. "That is a very strange person," he murmured to himself, " and though he has in his composition a large share of provoking humor, still he possesses a really good disposition, and, I have no doubt, a kind heart. I wish I had ask- ed him his name!" But he had gone, and could not be re- called; and St. Clair realized this, and,  as he recollected that the wish was a vain one, he dismissed the subject from his mind.  The horse of the traveller, par- taking somewhat of the improved spirits of his rider, stepped along at quite a brisk trot, and soon the pretty village of La Vendee, looking uncommonly pretty and inviting to the eye of the chilled, hungry, and weary, traveller, as he slightly reined in his horse, evidently endeavoring to observe the seenery and appearance around, through the heavy darkness which enshrowded the soeno. "Now, Florian, you shall soon rest your weary feet," saiil the horseman, affectionately patting the neck of the noble charger, as they rode slowly into the village, and turned into the long avenue of leafless elms that led to the inn. In a few moments the half frozen traveller reined up his jaded steed be- fore the door of the "Rosy Cross," and in a clear, ringing voice, St. Clair called to those within. The short, red headed landlord soon made his appearance, and seemed much surprised to see a traveller at such a late hour, and on such a terri- ble night.    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6822-00000033"/> 'Here, landlord,' said St. Clair, spring- ing from the saddle, and throwing the reins across the neck of the steed, ' I wish you to have this horse put up im- mediately, and well rubbed down, and plenty of grain given him. He has brought me from Paris within the last three, hours, and is jaded and tyavdl- worn.' ' What! can you have come from Paris on such a night as this?' exclaimed the landlord, ,throwing up his hands, in sur- prise.             ' ' I have,' calmly replied St. Clair. 'Well, you must be frozen half to death yourself,' said the host. 'Walk in immediately, and make yourself as -comfortable as possible. There is a roaring fire in the parlor. Here, this way,' he continued, throwing open the parlor door, and motioning to St. -Clair to enter. ' I will be with you in a few' moments, after I have seen that your horse is well taken care of.' St. Clair entered the parlor, and drawing a stuffed rocking chair before the cozy fire, he proceeded to warm his frozen hands. The heat of the fire had at first an influence far from pleasant, but the painful sensation soon subsided, and the genial influence of the roaring blaze was soon fully appreciated by the thoroughly chillqd traveller. She muf- flers and coats, which had protected him ' from the searching blast, were- now throwo off, and the face and form of the young man were visible. He could not have been more than twenty years of. age: his form was slightly under the medium height, and most perfect and symmetrical in all its outlines. His face was a model of manly beauty. His eyes were black as jet and brilliant as the gems from Galoonda's mines.-- They were large and expressive, and, beaming with the brightness of a daring   spirit, and the clearness of an unsullied conscience. His glossy chesnut-brown hair was curled around his head in short crisp curls, showing the noble expansive brow, and the fine coutour of the head. His complexion, though of the dark olive tinge, which imbues the skin in the tropics and the Indies, did not in the least diminish his fine style of beauty. His lips were very finely chisselled, and, perhaps, too feminine in their delicate coutour, to constitute a manly style of beauty, but this was a fault which but- few would consider as diminishing his remarkably handsome appearance. The expression of his countenance was both intelligent and fascinating, and a dash of bold courage and .bravery flashed from the fine dark eyes. There was something irresistably fascinating in his peculiarly sweet smile, and it was such as would draw others to him, with as magic power as the loadstone attacts the Adlicate steel wire. He was dressed in the picturesque costume of the Italian nobility; and over his fine brown hair was thrown a large rimmed Spanish nmbrero, with, a plume of the most snowy whiteness. 'It is a chilling night my friend,' said the landlord entering the parlor, where sat the young man reclining on the cush- ioned 4rm chair, and leisurely warming his benumbed limbs, ' you must be half frozen sir," continued the host, ' if yoa have come from Paris.' 'Yes, I was a little cold when I came in, and now that the blazing fire has made me feei a little more like myself, I begin to realize that I am' most decidely hun- gry.' The host took the hint, and in a few moments a tray of refreshments was placed before the traveller, of which he partook enough to satisfy the cravings of hunger, and then politely informed the   landlord he would like to be shown his room. In a few moments St. Clair found himself the sole tenant of a neat, prettily furnished, sleeping chamber, and turning the key of the door, he threw himself into a chair, and leaning his head upon his hand, seemed entirely absorbed in meditation. For half an hour perchance ,he sat thus, and then springing to his feet. he murmured half aloud:- ' Yes, it must be done, I can delay no longer, I will not shrink from the fierce- mess of the blast, when the result of my Oourage may be to save the life of Na- poleon; and the happiness of my coun- try.' Then throwing 'onthe warmly lined -coat and clbse muffler which he had worn while riding, he equipped himself to again brave the fierce storm. He drew from his bosom a small keen dagger,and -carefully examined the glittering blade; -then from beneath his inner coat' pro- duced two elegantly carved pistols, and! examined them as if to ascertain if they were loaded properly. He then placed the weapons again in his bosom, a*e closely buttoned his coat above them. He approached the door of the chamber, and his hand trembled slightly as he laid it upon the latch-but immediately re- covering his self-possession, he raised it, andpassed from the room.  With some difficulty he groped his way through the darkness until he reached the outer door. This was locked. But St. Clair had ev- idently come provided for such things; for he drew from his pocket a large bunch of keys of different sizes, and, after try- ing several of them, at last found one that fitted the key-hole to the door. A sleet-laden blast swept in as the door was cautiously and noiselessy opened, but St. Clair only drew his sombrero more closely over his Lead,and then pass-   3 ed out into the storm, closing the door behind him. He bent his steps towards the large ; barn which loomed up through the dim ' darkness, and a few brisk steps brought L him to its large doors. This, too, was l locked-and again St. Clair had recourse to his bunch of keys, and soon found one that fitted the look. The door was soon opened, and the young man entered.- A short time elapsed, and he emerged from the building, bearing upon his shoulder a very long ladder, sufficient- to reach the very roof of the high house. Tle door of the barn was again closed and locked, and the young man moved slowly with his burden   towards the house. He walked almost entirely around the building until he had reached the western side, where the wind blew with much less fierceness 'and power, where he lowered the ladder from his shoulders, and placed ,it against the side of the L house.  Every one of the blinds upon that side of the house were closed, and not a light was visible from any of them. St. Clair placed the ladder firmly against one of the upper windows', and then mounted it. Noiselessy and with the greatest care he unclosed the fastenings of the blind, and threw it open. A few faint beams of light beamed through the heavy curtains that shaded the windows upon the inner side, but nothing more could be seen through them. For several moments St. Clair stood there, listening eagerly, but it was only now and then that he heard a voice, and then it wag not possible to distinguish what the speaker hlad said. Biut he un- derstood enough to convince him of the truth of the suspicions that he had be- fore entertained-that the hall within was filled with a league of conspirators against the government I ' All right,' murmured St Clair, while    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6822-00000034"/> a smile of triumph overspread his hand- some features. 'I'll learn all I can about the matter, and then Napoleon himself, shall have the benefit of my knowledge.' St. Clair then slipped a rich diamond ring from his finger, and noiselessy com- menced cutting an orifice through the thick glass of the window. This opera- tion he was obliged to perform slowly and with great care, for, if he made the slightest sound, the quick ear of George   would have detected it, and St. Clair would have paid for his imprudence with his life. At length an orifice suficiently large was made, and the young spy, con- gratulating himself upon his good luck in having effected it without detection, placed his ear against the opening, and listened eagerly to the voices which were now plainly and distinctly heard from the donspirators within.   CHAPTER IX. THE CONSPIRATORS-FEARFUJL PLOTTING. No! from our blest beloved Put far the gross, the treacherous, sensual thing, Dimmed by the moth from off hiq wing, Slackening the sou-harp's most melodious string, False hath the glitterer proved. S. H. BRowNE.   'The enterprise in which we are en- gaged, is both a bold and dangerous one, spoke a voice which St. Clair recognized as that of Georges, but yet, it is forthe good of the country that we undertake it. Napoleon, it is currently reported and I doubt not but that the rumor had a good foundation, has serious intentions of, proclaiming himself Emperor as soon as he has established his power in the nation sufficiently to do so.. He is al- ready a great favorite; and France will stand by hi% in any measures he may see fit to engage in. This he well knows, and I doubt not but that ete long he will take advantage of his power, by usurp- ing the crown and throne of France, and depriving our nation of its republican liberty. This wetare in duty bound to do all in our power to frustrate. Napo' loon has no right to proclaim himself Emperor of France; and we, as French- men, as soldiers, as patriots, are- bound by the most solemn oaths to prevent his becoming so. His ambition shall never raise him to the throne of France-I awear it, and I call upon YOU, my fellow    countrymen, to aid me in the noble de- ,r termination! ' But, Captain Georges,' spoke the voice of an old veteran, who had been Xone of the firmest supporters of the Ithrone of Louis Sixteenth, 'you know L our band numbers but little more, than one hundred men, and with this small number what can we do against the mil- lions of Frenchmen who will fight till the last drop of their blood is spilled, for Napoleon. 'Fear not, Captain Lesalle, replied Georges, 'with a smile,' for though the band who are. organized and bound toge- ther by oaths of fidelity, may not num- ber over' one hundred, still there are thousands, perchance millions, in Frande, who think the same ad ourselves, but ' dare not avow their feelings, fearing that Napoleon will wreak his vengeance up- on their heads, for the principles which they entertain. These, if they but knew that there was a band of revolutionists organised here, would flock in by hun- dreds to join us. It -is our business, at present, to attempt to discover how ma-    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6822-00000035"/> ny of these will join our standard of re- b: bellion. The manner in which it is to h be done, is one that will need much t, caution and cunning, but I trust you s1 are all well enough skilled in plotting to si know that all this cannot be accomplish- c ed in a day.' - That is a suggestion which is evident ti 'to every one,' replied the old royalists, o 'but the question which I wished to h Jlbave answered, is, how can a hundred v of us, subdue millions of the Napoleon I party V     k  (Are you .sURE, Captain jLesalle, that s the millions whom you call the ' NApo-  leon party' are not at heart royalists?'  asked Georges.  ' Most of them, I fear are really in fa-  vor of the empire, with Napoleon at its  head,' replied the old royalist with a slight shade of despondency in his tone. 'I think you are' somewhat mistaken, Captain Lesalle,' returned Georges.- ' What is your opinion of the matter, Colonel d'Elsey?' he continued, turning to a tall young man by his sideq dressed in the rich uniform of the Austrian army.  Colonel d'Elsey, as Georges had de- :signated him, raised his head as the question was asked him by the captain -ef the conspirators, and the rays of the itmany lamps fell full upon his features, -disclosing them to be-those of the same -%d'Elsey who has formerly figured in our -story, as the bitter enemy to the young ,lieutenant Berthier, and the one who 1 tirned traitor, with his confederate De- :liticy, at the great battle of Marengo.- -.There were the same wildly-flashing - blck eyes, the same sinister expression, :;.lthe same look of revengeful hate upon   v hedark features, that had characterised hiim when we first introduced him to the ',redper. He still wore the showy Aus- &amp;tqian uinform, proclaiming to the world histraitorship and disgrace, and the   bright color df his cockade showed that he bore the rank of colonel in the Aus- trian army. He looked up as Georges spoke, and, with one of those insinuating smiles that were ever on his deceitful countenance, he replied, 'I think you are nearest right, Cap- tain Georges. I can speak from my own observation, and I should judge that the hearts of the people are not so much with Napoleon as with the heirs of the Bourbon family. They have still a lin- gering affection for the dynasty that has so long held the throne. and were hunt- ed from it by the revolution of 1792, and I think that. the majority would give heart and hand to restore to them their rightful inheritance. The brilliant mar- tial career of Napoleon has dazzled them by its glory, and they have bowed in ad- miration to his remarkable warlike tal- ent, and raised him to the state, which he now occupies, but without a thought of his assuming the dictatorshiptof their ; country in return for their generosity. a But when they become fully satisfied that his intention is to proclaim himself emperor of France, the scales will fall e from the eyes of the people, and they will n see him as he is-an ambitious and war- e like, but crafty and selfish usurper, who 9, would like to tyrannize oer all Europe, e if it was in his power to bring the whole r of it under subjection to him. And, be- g sides, he is a man of low birth, with not o a drop of royal blood or even noble e- blood in his veins, and of the most ob- -.scure parentage. And he can't even g justly claim the name of Frenchman, a, though France is his adopted country.- n If the people would only consider these ad facts, and I feel satisfied they will do so, ie if he attempts to proclaim himself em- s- peror, I think the popular mind will be d, turneclagainst him and France will be ie dethroning hinm, and raising Yie old ol,   Bourbon dynasty to their rightful inher- itance once more.'   I ' You are right, 0olonel d'Elsey, as you always are,' said deorges, with a smile.  'I think, Captain Lesalle cannot longer ,doubt that Napoleon's reign will be a brief one, and that he must soon lose favor among the French people. They are too proud a nation to raise a low-born peasant to the dignity of Emperdr.' ' But the French are too much dazzled by glory and conquest to so easily re- nounce Napoleon,' replied Lesalle. 'As long as he is their leader, the French will be the ruling nation of Europe.- You cannot deny that Bonaparte pos- sesses remarkable warlike talent.. Lodi Marengo, Arcola, and Montenette have proved this to the satisfaction of the world. THS is what wins honor for the First Consul from our nation; and this is what will enable him to proclaim him- self Emperor, and still retain the favor of the nation.' A dark frown settled upon the brow of Georges as the old royalist spoke,'for he liked not the obstinacy and decision with which the old wan held his point, and brought forward facts to substantiate it. He saw plainly the anxious expression settling upon the countenances of many of the band, and he feared that if Laselle was allowed to say much more upon the subject, that it would not be so easy to to bring about the result wished for- namely the destruction of Napoleon.-- But, concealing all these feelings, he turned tothe old man with an incredu- lous smile, and, with a gay, light laugh replied: 'Your fears are entirely groundless, Captain Lesalle. All is right, so far, and our cause is progressing famously. If we are but cunning and- cautious, there /    is not the least fear but that we shall succeed in our determination to rescue our country from the rule of an usurper. But we must give heart and hand to the work-for we cannot accomplish this great result, while our minds are inactive, and our hearts but half enlisted in the enterprise. Our cause, it is evi- dent is gaining ground; this very night another has been added to our band.- And the general feeling, though now in favor of Napoleon, must ere long change. And WE must be the ones to cause this. change-the French nation, we know, are proverbial for being vascillating and unsteady inheir opinions, and, by 'workinguponmhis susceptibility of mind we may bring about the desired result. We must, in the first place, poison the minds of the nation against the Corsi- can usurper. This is the first step- and, if this is accomplished, then we have but little more to fear. There are more than one hundred of us-and more than half of this number are men of in- telligence and eloquence./ These we must depend upon for the furtherance of our revolutionary project. These must be scattered through all portions of France, and their influence upon the national feeling, though silent, will be powerful. They must converse private- ly with every one whom they believe to be even slightly dissatisfied wish Napo- leon, and draw forth, by eloquence and cunning, their entire sentiments upon this important subject. When they are fully assured that the heart of the person is against Napoleon, then, and not un- til then, may they disclose the secret of the league, and, by the oaths of the con- federation,bind the new convert to our principles to serve us, and prove faith- ful to our cause.- No one will dare to break these oaths, for we will take care that all shall know that the penalty of'    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6822-00000036"/> traitorship is DEATH. If we do our best to further the cause, I doubt not but that we can succeed. NAPOLEON MDUST BE CRaUSHED-and WE must do it-and we shall.' i The energy and earnestness with which Georges spoke, revived the droop- ing spirits of his band, and they seemed to imbibe a portion of his enthusiasm. Many projects for the furtherance of their plan were mentioned; but they were as quickly rejected, as either im- possible or impracticable. During this time, St. Aubert had sat a silent but not uninterested listener; and, at times, the flashing of his brilliant dao eyes, and the strange expression which played around his finely curved lips, told that he was deeply excited. D'Elsey, also, had been silent for some time, and evi- dently listening to the different sugges- tions of the niembers of the band, and weighing in his mind the feasibility of the proposed plans. Atlength Georges turned to him, and said, with a smile, 'How is this, Colonel d'Elsey? You who are so good for planning, have not given us a single suggestion upon this important subject. You seem wonder- fully absorbed in meditation to-night.' 'I have beenthinking of one resource which I consider a little better than any of those'which have just been mention- ed, but as I fear it will not meet with your approbation, it will be useless to speak of it.' ' Oh, yes, Colonel, out with it,' inter- rupted Georges, with a pleasant smile, ' I hav'nt any doubt but that it will prove to be the best plan we have yet had proposed. You are proverbially good for plotting, and if this plot is as good as those you have before mentioned to us, when we were taking measures for organ- jzing our league, I doubt not but that it will receive my approbation. Come, i '      -    .   lay it before us. I will be the judge of its feasibility. 'Thus urged, Hknow' not how it is possible /Ir me to deny your request, :said d'Elsey, pleasantly, ' and I shall be obliged to gratify you. My plan can be comprehended in a very few words-itis to poison Bonaparte, as our first step towards bringing about the desired rev- olution.' A murmur of disapprobation was heard from the assembled conspirators, but Georges, with a stern look of command, hushed'every voice into silence. Then turning to d'Elsey, while his counten- ance expressed considerable surprise, he asked- ' This seems to be a very good plan, my friend, but is it not an impossible one? How we are to poison him, when every precaution is taken to prevent any such thing, I know not.' 'Neither do I,' returned d'Elsey,' but I made this suggestion, thinking that if it could be carried into effect, it would constitute more than half of the danger of our enterprise. Only get Napoleon himself out of the way, and his followers and adherents, whom we have also sworn death to, can be easily conquered.' 'I know this well, Colonel d'Elsey, said Georges,' if Napoleon could be pois oned, or murdered in any way, the dan- gers of our enterprise would be more than half surmounted. It would be very difficult to shoot him or dispose of him in such a manner, as he, always goes at- tended by strong guard. And he is very cautious about his food, also, as he knows there are many in the nation,who would gladly destroy him if it was in their power, I think therefore, that your suggestion must be set down, as one of the impracticable ones.'  "et us look at it a few moments lon- ger, before disposing of it,' said d'Elsey   in a tone that showed he had no inten- tioi of giving up his scheme so quickly, 4 it may not be so impracticable as you think, cunning and courage Will ccom- plish it.'    .  'We should be pleased to hear any suggestions Colonel d'Elsey will make in reference to his scheme,' returned Georges, smiling. 'In the first place,' said d'Elsey, we must corrupt the cooks who have served him with his food.' 'A very godd- suggestion,' returned Georges, 'but still it seems impractica- ble. Yot know that all those who are connected with Napoleon's household, are firm and decided friends to his cause. he has taken good care that they should be so. I do not think that they could be easily corrupted-for they love their master too well to do aught to injure him.' 'That may be the'case,' replied d'El- sey,'and now I think of it, there is a way that will do even better. You know that Napoleon's private secretary, the younger General Berthier, is a man 'who exercises considerable influence over the General-in-chief. -This young man must be removed. It can be done-I myself will undertake to put him out of the way. When he is gone, Napoleon will choose some other one for a private secretary. Now with cunning. and courage, added to a WILL to perform the work, we can so manage that Bonaparte may choose some one who will be friendly to our cause, and, perchance, one of us to fill this important office. This done, the fate of the first Consul is sealed. He would take a glass of wine from the hand of one whom he considered his friend, as he would suppose-his private secreta- ry to be, without the least fear or sus- picion. This wine MGHT have poison   'mingled withAt-and THEN we might ac- complish ourobject!' A very good plan this would be, if it were not for this one thing,' replied Geor- ges, who had been much interested in the suggestion of d'Elsey, 'you know that Bonaparte is an uncommonly good judge of character by physiognomy and appear- ance. He could not easily be deceived, by soft words or protestations of loyali- ty, and the keen eye of the first Consul would soon detect any attempt to deceive him, in this manner. And if it should be detected, the perpetrators of'the act' would be punished with death. This makes it a very, dangerous game to play, neither is it very likely to result in suc- cess.' ' Bonaparte can be deceived, as well as others,' returned d'Elsey, who seemed determined not to give up his point, 'do you not think, Captain Georges,' he con- tinued, with a smile, ' that I could de- ceive the great Napoleon.?' - Perhaps You could, d'Elsey, for you are a most uncommonly apt hand at the ,art of deception,' replied Georges,\pleas- antly. ' But then I think you told me that you- had once belonged to Bona- parte's army,. and, disgusted with him, you left it for the Austrian. If this is the case, I think it would be useless for 'you to attempt the experiment, as he wouflcognize you.' 'I think I could disguise myself in such a manner as to prevent any fear of that,' returned d'Elsey. ' I have reasons, aside from merely ridding the nation o a tyrant and usurper, for wishing the de- struction of Napoleon Bonaparte. Re- venge would nerve me on to perform the deed-and, under its influence, I could accomplish anything.' ' You are too sanguine, I fear,' said 'Georges,' and if you attempt this pro- ,ject, you will involve yourself in diffieul-    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6822-00000037"/> ty yoi cannot escape from. If I am not very much mistaken, I know Bona- parte rather better than you do yourself, I know him to be a keen, cunning, shrewd, and selfish man, Bat easily de- ceived, generous, all times to his friends, but always vindictive to his enemies.-- As you have once deserted from his ser- vice, and entered the Austrian, you hqve incurred his severe displeasure, and he will wreak his vengenance upon you, whenever he may find you. Consequent- ly, 1 think you had better desist from any such undertaking.' 'Do not fear for me, Captain,' said d'Elsey. ' And if you think it not best for me to trust myself in the presence of Bonaparte, some other of the band can take this portion of the enterprise.' 'Who of our band is fitted for it?' asked Georges. 'There is a man, whom I think is capable of deceiving even Napoleon Bonaparte,' said d'Elsey, pointing with his jewelled finger towards a tall, dark looking man who sat at a short distance from them, and who had not spoken even once during the whole of the evening.- The personage thus designated was a man apparently between forty and fifty years of age, dressed in a faded and tat- tered Italian court costume, and whose jet-black eyes, gleaming with cunning and courage, flashed out from beneath the broad slouched hat, from which drooped along raven plume. His hair, which was'snarled and matted in the most approved fashion, was also raven black, and fell in uncombed profusion over his shoulders and 'brow. Heavy black eye-brows shaded his piercing eyes, and an enormous moustache concealed his mouth and chin. His form was rather small, and symmetrically mould- ed, and 'his hands were white and deli. oate as those of a high born lady. On I   the whole, his appearance was far fr om prepossessing, for a sinister look seem- ed to gleam from his keen black eyes, and the shaggy eye-brows which hung over them but added to their fierce ex- pression. Such was Count Lucier, one of the prime movers in the conspiracy of La Vendee-and one of the most danger- ous foes of the great Napoleon. As d'Elsey pointed towards him, des- ignating him as the man to carry out his suggestion against Bonaparte, Count Lucier looked up, and his gleaming black eyes met the glance of Georgesi bent inquiringly upon him. 'Captain Georges,' said the count, in a low, peculiarly soft voice, that had been often used for insinuation and de- ception, 'I think this plan of Colonel 'd'Elsey's is possible to be carried into effect, and, though it involves much danger, I am willing to engage in it.- I think with you that it is highly im- practicable for Colonel d'Elsey to at- tempt to insinuate himself into Napo- leon's favor and obtain the office which will be left vacant by the removal of General Victor Berthier, as Bonaparte already knows him well as a traitor and deserter, and would, without doubt, re- cognize him immediately, and punish him for his deeds. If he succeeds in removing Berthier, and if it is in the power of mortal to deceive such a per- feet reader of character as he is, I will accomplish the object, for I too, am goaded on by the spur ofrevenge. Had it not been for Napoleon Bonaparte, I might now have been governor of the south of France. His usurping the gov- ernment of France prevented me from rising to wealth and power, and now, 'I would prevent HX from rising to the throne of the nation. You see, my friends, that the notives which actuate me in attempting to crush the power of   ltNapoleon, are such as would cause me to do my best to further the cause in which me are enlisted.' 'You have spoken well, Count Lucier,' said Georges, with a gratified smile. 'If the whole of the band were as ready and willing to act as yourself, the power of Napoleon would soon be crushed.' ' Say rather, if all possessed such an impulse to act,' returned Count Lucier. But, if I am to take this conspicuous part, I shall wish some other one to re- move Berthier, as I do not feel inclined to risk the danger of destroying both.' 'If you will but rid us of Napoleon, all such obstacles -as the one you refer to shall be'put. out of your way,' said d'Elsey. 'I myself will attend to Ber- thier. Within three days he shall be no more!' 'But even then, there are many ob- stacles in your path to the office of pri- vate secretary to Bonaparte,' spoke Cap- tain Lesalle. He is a man who prefers old friends to new ones, when he is select- ing a person for such a confidential and important post. There are many of his old generals from whom he could select a faithful secretary at any time, and who would be glad to serve their commander to the extent of their power.', 'I well know this,' replied Count Lu- cier, 'but there are only one or two of these in Paris at present. The elder General Berthier, who has been his com- panion ever since he commenced his military career, and whom he would le most likely to choose, is now in Spain, transacting important business, which it will be impossible for him to leave.- Murat is in Italy, and Bernadotte, An- gereau, Lanpes and Massena are also there. Ney and Davoust are in Austria, Kellermann is witif his mother in Swit- zerland, Soult, you know, is at present very ill, and Le Brun has received such   a severe wound in his right arm, that he can scarcely move his hand, and there- fore could not' assist Napoleon in his writing. Most of those who are absent are engaged in important business, and cannot very well leave. There are only two or three of his old generals left at home, and some of those are, ill, and the rest are either illiterate men whom he would not wish to have write his docu- mnents, or persons whom he knows can- not be trusted with anything. It is true there are many who did not belong to the army who hold a large share of Napoleon's favors, and it is from among these, that he would probably make his choice. But most of these are illiterate men, and know but little about either elegance or rapidity as regards chiro- graphy. Now I have been educated iu this branch of accomplishment more than in any other, and am an expert,; rapid and handsome penman. I can write faster than any writing, master in Italy, and there is not one who can curve and flourish better than myself. And as my business has been for a numbar Of years to copy documents, I am well acquaint- ed with every thing pertaining to the world. I will take care that Bonaparte is made acquainted with these qualifica- tions, and I am sure they will have some 'weight with. him, enough, at least, to make me his secretary, even if I am not entrusted with his private matters. And even if I can get into his household as much as that, I shall find opportunities enough to carry out my design as re- gards Napoleon. I doubt not but that I can succeed. I am a very good look- ing'young man when this mass of hair, mustachios and eye-brows are removed; don't you think so gentlemen?' As Count 'Lucier spoke these last words, he threw off the false hair that fell in such profusion over his shoulders,    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6822-00000038"/> and cast aside the immense moustache and heavy eye-brows. He then-threw off the tattered Italian costume, and dis- closed beneath it the rich and elegant dress of a French gentleman, ofthe most fasteful fashion. His hair, which was less exposed, was of a rich, deep brown, cut closely, and displaying a brow white as marble. His lips were very finely chiselled, and curved with a peculiarly piquant expression, that gave to his faee more of a feminine look than it would otherwise have had. The eye-brows, in- stead of being shaggy and overhanging were most graoefully arched and curved, and of the same rich dark brown as the hair. Count Lucier was most truly a handsome man: still thq perfect judge of character, by physiognomy,would have declared that his countenance was one that was far from preposessing. There was a sinister expression about the lips, in spite of their spirited curve and per- feet contour, and a flashing brightness in the keen 'black eyes, that spoke of a soul within that did not now retain its original purity. But few would have noticed this, so completely did his in- sinuating smile destroy the effect of the sinister expression, and the common ob- server would have taken him for a man of uncomfmonly noble and intcllec- tual appearance. And he was, intruth, eminently handsome; but his beauty was not of the'truly noble style. As Count Lucier threw off his dis- guise, a portion of -the band sprang to their feet in surprise, while the remain- der, who were well acquainted with the fact that the Count seldom or never ap- peared in public without his favorite dis- guise, only smiled and looked upon him admiringly. Hp turned around and sur- veyed his comrades with a look of digni- flied pride. 'My friends,' said he, with a pleasant'   smile, am I not well fitted by nature to be Napoleon's secretary?' 'Yes, most perfectly, Count Lucier,' was echoed by a score of'voices. 'Then,' returned the Count, with a self-satisfied smile, ' I think we shall have but little trouble in making me secreta- ry to General Bonaparte, after General Victor Berthier is removed from this important office. But I shall- need a lit' tle aid in getting to this height-I want some one to blaze forth my merits, and inform Bonaparte that I am a man of STRICT INTEGRITY, of EXCELLENT MORAL CHARACTER, and all of the rest good qual- ifications. The first Consul will soon find out that I'm a capital secretary, and he won't dismiss me, after I've serv- ed him awhile!' This sarcasm was received with a light laugh by Georges,who turned to St. Au- bert, who had been sitting silently dur- ing the evening and said- 'Mopsieur St. Aubert, I think you said you held a post of some importance in Paris, and Bonaparte kndws you well. You see him quite often, do you not? 'Generally every day, unless some very important businessa keeps him at home,' replied the young man. 'Does he ever speak to you?' asked Georges. Often,' replied St. Aubert, 'it is sel- dom that he passes my post, without halt- ing to exchangeda word with me.' 'Does Napoleon hold you in any de- gree of favor?. questioned GeorgeS. - 'I think he is not much'displegsed with my appearance,' answered St. Aubert, ' certainly if he does he conceals it.' , Then you are as good a one as any !'here to assist in promoting Count Luci- er to the office of secretary, which is so soon to be made vacant. You will do your best, will you not V' 'Most certainly, Captain Georges' re-   turned St. Aubert, in his usual free and easy manner, 'and if Count Lucier is not Napoleon's secretarybefore ten day's are out, the fault will not be mine.' ' Then I see not but we are in a fai way to succeed,' said Georges. ' rlonel d'Elsey will despatch Berthier-M-on- sieur St. Aubert will recommend Count Lucier to Bonaparte-and the Count will rid us of the usurper.' 'A dangerous and impracticable plan, said the obstinate Captain Lesalle, who had been listening to the conversation with evident signs of disapprobation. / A dark frown overspread the brow of Georges, as the old royalist spoke, and he glanced his dark eyes upon him with the intense flishing of anger; Georges knew that the old man's opinions had considerable influence over some mem- bers of the band, and he fearedthat if he was allowed to express them fully, he might give them some alarm, and thus the favorite project, might be defeated. This Georges much dreaded, and he saw it would not do for him to allow Lesalle to continue the subject. ' You are always looking upon the dark side of the picture, Captain Lesalle,'said he, with a smile that belied the angry feelings that were rising within. 'Those that are engaged in this plot are men of both courage and cunning, who know their duty, and will perform it. We know it is a dangerous plan, but do we expect to crush Napoleon and his allies Without incurring some danger? Brave men do not fear it, and I know those who are engaged in this enterprise are such. And as to its impracticability-- we'll not feel at all concerned about that. Before another month has passed, Napo- leon Bonaparte,will be lying in state in his ancestral tomb.' 'But even then,all the difficulties which i weave to encounter will not be sur-'   I' mounted,' said an old veteran who had "not before spoken during the evening., ' Certainly not,' replied Georges.- 'There are more thad a score, of Napo- ' leon's old veterans who must 'be picked off from the field of action silently, but surely,-who must soon lay at rest in the grave beside their master. The elder General Berthier; a man who has grown old in the couhcil chamber of France,and whoois the firm and steadfast friend of Bonaparte, in a man whom we cannot easily dispose of, but who must be put out of the way, before we can do anything towards restoring the ancient Bourbon race to their past magnificence and pow- er. ' This portion of the enterprise I will take upon myself, as I do not fear the danger of it, or think it to be impracti- cable because it is a little dangerous.- And then Murat-he is a firm friend of the First 0onsul, and must be disposed of, Maim, will you undertake to rid, us of General Murat?' he asked, turning to his confederate whom we first introduced to the reader in the parlor of the 'Rosy Cross.' 'I'll fix Murat for you,' returned the personage, in reply to the question of his superior, and the keen flash of his grey eyes told that he meant what he utter- ed. 'Very well,' returned Georges with a gratified smile, 'I see you are all ready and willing to take your portion of the difficulty and 'dangers. Massena I do not fear for. But Ny--he must be ta- ken care of, or he will do us and our. cause much mischief. It needs a fearless heart and a strong hand to dispatch him, I think that you, De Lancy, would be the right man to rid us of the stern old war-,., rior, Ney-will you undertake to do it? This was addressed to. a short, thick set, red headed man, who sat a short dis- tance from Georges, and who, like many -my o    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6822-00000039"/> of the others, had been silent during the evening, listening to the different pro- jects that had been brought forward.- He looked up as his superior spoke, and the glare of the many lamps fell full up- on his features-showing them to be those of the old friend and confederate of d'Elsey-the traitor Delaney! His keen grey eyes met those of Georges- and their eager expression told the cap- tain of the band of conspirators that his request was granted. s' If it's in the power of man to remove the old marshal from your path, I'll do it,' said the villain. 'Well spoken, good friend Delaney,' said Georges, 'And now, we must dis- pose of the other Generals. Soult is at present very ill, and I think we shall soon be rid of him, and not be obliged to murder him either. But there's Da- voust-he must be disposed of, St. Au- bert' you can prove your faithfulness to our cause by destroying Davoust, and ridding us of another implacable ene- my.' "I am at your service, Captain Geor- ges,' answered St. 4ubert, pleasantly, 'and if it is in my power, I will obeyyour command, and Davoust shall soon be no more.' 'I thank you for the readiness with which you comply with the request,BMon- sieur St. Aubert,' returned Georges, with a gratified smile. 'We shall soon be able to crush Bonaparte and his follow- ers, if you are all as ready and willing to undertake what is re'quired of you, as are those to whom we have entrusted thb destruction of the Generals ]erthier, Murat, Ney, Davoust, and Napoleon him- self.' Georges continued to name over the principal Generals and officers of Napo- leon's guard, and his particular favorites, and entrusting to each of the band, the   'death of one or more of them. This was all done in an unconcerned, business-like manner, as if they were making bargains for merchandize, rather than disposing of the lives of the noblest patriots of France. St. Clair still remained at the window, listening intently through the aperture which be had made by means of his'diamond ring. At times a flush of triumph would pass over his fine fea- tures, then would be succeeded by the paleness of fear and anxiety. The chill January blast occasionally swept by him with uncommon rudeness, and forced him to keep a firm hold upon the open shut- ter, lestjt should cause it to make some sound, and alarm the conspirators with- in. But all was silent-they had not the least suspicion that they were over- heard, and consequently felt no fears.- Not a word that was spoken within that chamber was lost by St. Clair-the whole plot to destroy Napoleon, as well as to murder his officers and Generals, was overheard, and all was understood! The old bell of the church of La Ven- dee tolled the hour of three, and many of the conspirators began to show signs of weariness, and two or three of them were fast asleep. They had plotted murders enough for one night, and thought it best to retire now to their homes, and reflect upon their deeds of eviL ' My friends,' said George, "rising and casting his eyes around upon the band assembled, 'we have just decided our destiny, either for failure or success. I have strong hopes that it will be the latter, and I have also confident opinion that it will be so. A11 depends upon your faithful performance of the duties assigned to you. All depends upon your fidelity to the oaths which you have sworn-even your lives depend upon it; -for if you break them you will answer   for your traitorship with DEATH. I have committed the lives of most of the gen- erals into your hands-and I have my- self taken the responsibility of ridding France of two of them-the elder Ber- thier and Le Brun. Napoleon himself must first be crushed, and then his gen- erals and officers must fall. -It will' he best to destroy Bonaparte by poison, and in such a secret manner that it will not be suspected that he was murdered. As soon as possible after his death, the generals must follow him. As to the younger ,Berthier, I leave him in the care of Colonel d'Elsey. It will be ne- cessary to despatch him before anything else is done; as it is in supplying his place that we lay the snare for Napoleon. You all understand the proceedings, and I have no doubt will do your best to perform your duty. The sooner the en- emies of our cause are out of the way the better-only let the blow be struck cautiously as well as expeditiously.- Those to whom I have entrusted the murders of the generals arid officers are' men whom I well know, and I feel satis- fied that they will choose the best way to rid us of these powerful enemies. I care not in what manner they are dispatched if they are only silenced for ever. You know your duty, you will be faithful in the performance of it.' A murmur of assent arose from the listening conspirators. 'It is now time for us to retire,' said Georges, for the old bell has tolled the hour of three. Depart silently, and with as little confusion and disturbance as possible-those who remain here to- night to their rooms, and the rest to their homes. Let each and all remember the work which they are to do.' 'But when shall our band meet again,' said St. Aubert. 'Two weeks from to-night,' replied   Georges, after a momenpts thought, ' I will meet you all at this rendezvous, and consult with you as to the further prose- cution of our plans. I trust that I shall learn from you that our cause is pro- gressing rapidly, and that Napoleon's generals will soon be no more. If all is done as well as I hope it will be, Napo- leon will be lying in his grave before that time. Now depart and remember your oaths of fidelity to the league, and your lows to serve them to the best of youri ability.' The conspirators arose from their seats and drawing their cloaks and muf- flers closer around them, 'prepared to leave. With the greatest caution St. Clair closed the shutter, and descended the long ladder. Then lifting it from its upright position, he bore it rapidly towards the large barn, and deposited it in the spot from whence he had taken it. 'I am well repaid for my trouble to- night,' he murmured, as he closed and locked the door of the barn, and rapidly took his way towards the house. But,' he continued, rubbing his hands together, as if to create some warmth in. their palms. 'I believe I'm chilled through with this biting blast. My feet and hands are nearly frozen. But yet I will not think aught of the pain it will cause, if freezing them will save Napo- leon, or benefit him at all.' St. Clair had now reached the door, and drawing forth his bunch of false keys, he inserted one of them in the lock. The bolt sprang back, and St. Clair was about to enter, when the fig- ure of a man appeared full before him, carrying in his hand a dark lantern. It was Georges. ' What are 'you doing here, fellow?' questioned the leader tf the conspira- tors, fixing his keen black eyes on the young man's face.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6822-00000040"/> St. Clair instantly recognized the voice of Georges, and his black eyes sought the leader's face, with the inten- tion of fixing the lineaments of the con- spirator WI his mind, so that he could recognize them at any other time. But this was imposssible, for the mass of black hair, and the large muffler which was drawn up over his face, so concealed his features that nothing was visible save his gleaming eyes, whose terrible glare was bent upon the youn'g man.- But these had such a peculiar fire, that St. Clair felt that he should know them whenever he should again meet them.-4-   As he did not at first answer the ques- tion of the conspirator, it Was impatient- ly repeated, and St. Clair replied: 'I am one of the lodgers of the Rosy Cross, and fearing my horse was not well cared for, I have been out to look after him, myself.' This answer, spoken with the most perfect simplicity of tone and manner, seemed satisfactory, and St. Clair was allowed to pass on. In a few moments the conspirators had either left the house, or retired to their rooms, and the inn of the Rosy Cross was given up to ,silence and darkness.   CHAPTER X. EUGENIE DE ST. ARNAND--AN U NEXPECTED cCENE. O, scorn thou not, the deep, the true, And steadfast love of years ; The kindly, that from childhood grew, The faitnful to thy tears! If there be one that o'er the dead Hath in thy grief borne part, And watched in sickness o'er thy bed, Call hers a kindred heart! MRS. HEMANS.   IT was a bright, sunny afternoon-one of those pleasant January days when old winter seems to throw off his mantle of sternnes, and smile through his frosty frowns upon the ice bound earth. The rays of the sun seemed almost as warm as those of springtime; and the snow under the genial influence, melted from its compact drifts, and coursed its way through the buisy streets in rivers of water. Even man seemed to revive un- der the genial influence of a summery winter day, and the streets were filled -with busy travellers, some transacting business, some riding because they had   nothing else to do, and othere merely to enjoy the warm and softening air, but all' alike felt the influence of the pleasant freak of old winter, in loosening his icy. chains for a day. In a pleasant room in' the palace of the First Consul, sat Viector Berthier, re- clining upon a divan, and seemingly en- gaged in deep meditation. The yellow' sunlight gleamed in. upon the gorgeous carpet, and gave its highly colored flow- ers a hue even more brilliant--but Victor 'did not notice the efforts of nature to draw him from his meditations, ]but still reclined lazily upon the divan, his eyes    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6822-00000041"/> fixed upon vacancy, and communing on- ly with his own thoughts. These were evidently not of the pleasantest nature, for his brow was clouded, and ever and anon an abrupt exclamation of vexa- tion or displeasure would escape his lips. He has changed some in the two years since the battle of Marengo; but there is a nobler look upon that high, broad forehead, and a brighter flash of spirit and determination in those dark eyes; the lines of the mouth express even more courage and decision, and the whole countenance is more like a warrior's and statesman's than it was two years ago. And he is even handsomer than he was i then-his noble beauty is more matured, more commanding, and better fitted to shine among the gay society of France's bver gay capital. A light knock was heard at the door of the room, and, before Victor could spring to open it, it was unclosed, and a light form stepped within, and stood full before the young officer. For a moment he stepped back, regarding the new com- er with mute surprise; then seeming to comprehend that in doing thus he was violating the proscribed rules of Parisian politeness,he sprang forward, and, a mo- ment after, he grasped in his the proffer- ed hand of Eugenie de St. Arnand! 'Pardon me, General Berthier,' said the lady, with a smile of fascinating sweetness, 'I did not wish to intrude upon your meditations, but General Bo. naparte said you were in this room, and assured me that you would be pleased to see me. I trust you will forgive the in- trusion.' 'It is no intrusion, lovely mademoisele Eugenia,' replied the gallant young Gen- eral, as he gazed upon the peerless crea- ture before him. If she had been love- ly at seventeen, at nineteen she was most brilliantly; beautiful. Her form was   taller, and had acquired more of the fullncso of maturity, while the queenly air with which she carried her head,gave her a dignified mein, with a spice of haughtiness, that had not been there two jears before. Her raven hair fell in shining masses over a brow of alabaster, its massy curls shading her marble bust and pearl-tinted shoulders. Her eyes were the same glorious jetty orbs that he had looked into two years ago, as she hung with the tenderness of a sister over his sick bed-but now, there seemed to be a shadow of settled melancholly in their soul-speaking depths, that he could i not account for. And the full rounded cheek was a little paler, and the fascinat- ing smile, though it had all the sweetness of former days, had also in it a touch of sadness, that only the heart of the maid- en herself knew. But still she was most brilliantly beautiful-lovelier even than when they had first met, two years ago, when the soldier's daughter had saved the life of the brave\young lieutenant, and had given her maiden heart into his keeping!  Ah! the youthful General little knew, that the shade of melanchol- ly in those beautiful eyes, and the sad- ness in'that fascinating smile, were all caused by unrequited love for him! 'es, the soldier's lovely daughter still retain- ed the affection for Victor Berthier which she had first felt two yeas ago, when she bent over his almost lifeless form, and bathed his burning brow, and wet his parched lips, with the cooling draught. She had watched his course to fame with pride and admiration-and when his name was sounded in common with that of Bonaparte, as the favorite of the great General, no eye gleamed with a prouder fire than hers-for, though her love was unrequited, she still felt a strange happiness in loving him, hoping that she might yet win his heart, and 'x   rest her wearied head upon his bosom, loving and beloved. ' This pleasure is as unexpected as it is exquisite,' said the gallant general, pressing the white hand of Eugenie to his lips, 'it has been long since I saw you, but I have not yet forgotten the gentle nurse of my sickness, and the savior of my life. More than two years have passed since we parted, and how has the lovely Eugenie fared since then?' 'I have been well, and as happy as the love of my father and friends and all the luxuries of my home could make me,' replied Eugenie, and, as she spoke, her cheek became a shade paler, and her voice trembled, though very slightly, as she thought that but one thing more was needed to make her perfectly happy -and that was more essential than all- the love of Victor Berthier But the young man did not notice her agitation, and with a pleasant smile, asked 'And Count de St. Arnand, is he in ' Paris 7' 'He is, replied Eugenie, 'and is now * conversing with General Bonaparte: If you wish to see him, you can do so, by entering the next room, for both he and the First Consul are there.' 'If the Lady Eugenic has no objec- tion, I would spend a short time in con- versation with her, and I can enjoy the society of my old friend the Count af- terwards. I have met with him several times since we parted two years since; L but you I have not seen since then. I love to converse of old times-and with you, who are the preserver of my life, this must be an exquisite pleasure.' Eugenie answered with a happy smile, and Victor gracefully led to the divan upon which he had been reclining, and  seated himself by her side. He took ] her hand in his, and glancing his eyes r 1]I   admiringly upon her peerless counte- nance, he said- 'Fair Lady Eugenic, your appearance has caUed up most vividly to my mind the scenes of other days-of the fearful battle, in which I received what would iave been my death wound, had it not been for your ceaseless watching and un- remitting care. I have ever thought of you with the feelings of deepest grati- tude-and though, the debt is one that I feel I can never repay, still I trust there will yet be some opportunity offer- ed, which will enable me to express my gratitude.' 'I am fully repaid for all the service which I rendered you,' replied Eugenie, 'by seeing you in life and health, and rising to eminence and power. You are now the favorite of Bonaparte-and as his star rises to an admiring world, I trust that yours will rise with it, a bright and shining light, never to sink in dark- ness and disgrace. A glorious-a noble, brilliant future is before you. And if I have the consolation and the pride of having once saved the life of one who is yet to fill such a bright page in his coun- try's history, by merely fulfilling the command to " do as we would be done by," it is sufficient for me. I will ask no more, for this is enough to repay me for all.' 'Nobly spoken!' exclaimed Berthier, as he gazed in admiration upon the coun- tenance of Eugenic, which was now lighted up with a proud enthusiasm.- The prophetic thoughts which she had expressed, had given a brighter flash to her dark eye, and a color to her' check that ,was not there before. Victor thought he had never seen any one so peerlessly beautiful-he had thought her lovely before, but she had never seemed to his vision so surpassingly so. Had he been a worshipper of beauty, his heart    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6822-00000042"/> would have been laid at her feet without hesitation; but as it was he never fought of cherishing for her any feelings deeper than those of,friendship and gratitude. ' Fair Lady Eugenie,' continued Ber- thier,' the words which you have spoken are but the repetition of my own thoughts -nd feelings. I feel-yea, I KNow that amn destined for no common lot in life. I am ambitious, and I feel satisfied that I may yet see this ambition realized.- JMy star must rise with Napoleon's-if his rises to a throne and crown, I shall hold a rank in the nation little inferior to his. If he sinks in disgrace and ruin, I sink with him. This is true, fair lady Eugenia. I feel satisfied that it will be all realised, in the 'low sealed book of the future. 'I knew, when I first cast my eyes upon your countenance, that you were one destined to no common deeds,' re- plied Euegnie. 'Even then, I prom- ised for you a glorious future. Your course since has strengthened this opin- ion-and I know" that you are one des- tined to rise to eminence and power, by your own unaided energy. Your name is one which will be loudly heralded by the voice of fame-and, in the future, I shall often look back with pride to the time, when I was acknowledged as the friend of General Berthier.' 'And may you ever be my friend, as now,' said the young man with a smile, 'for while I think that such a being as Eugenie de St. Arnand is my friend, I cannot be guilty of an action dishonor- able to myself or my country.' Eugenie blushed deeply, and bent her eyes upon the floor. 'I shall ever think of the hours which I have passed with you, as the happiest of my life,' continued Berthier,' for your society was to me refinement and exalt- tion of the mind. I found you posses-   sed of an uncommon intellect, which was highly cultivated and refined. I found your mind stored with knowledge- which you could impart in such a man- ner as to chain my attention and rivet my interest to you. The hours passed in such society must indeed be happy, and when they were ended, I sighed to think that they were gone. Since then I have mingled considerably in the ex- citement of public life, but often, very often, do my thoughts turn back to the pleasant hours which I passed with Eu- genie de St. Arnand.' 'Your father wishes to speak with you a moment, Mademoiselle Eugenie' said a youthful page, appearing at the door, and bowing gracefully to the young girl and the general. ' You will return soon, Will you not, Mademoiselle Eugenic,' asked Victor, as the blushing girl arose from her seat by his side, to follow the page. Yes, -that is,-I will come, if my father does not wish me to remain with him,' and with a sweet smile, she rose and reluctantly left the room. Victor lean- ed his head upon his hands, and seemed deeply absorbed in meditation. Per- chance his thoughts were this time of Eugenie; but if they were, the sensation which had rest within his bosom was not akin to love. O, Ambition! What right hast thou to shut out that fairest flower that ever bloomed among us frail mor- tals-lbve-from the human heart? Just as Victor's eyes closed in a pleas- ant reverie, a window at the lower end of the room was noiselessly thrown up, and a form stepped lightly in upon the car- peted floor. It was Colonel D'Elsey. In his right hand he carried a loaded pis- tol, while from beneath his coat, protru- ded the butts of two more, and the hilt of a dagger. As his eyes rested upon Ber- their, a demonaic smile passed over his   dark, but handsome features, and he mut- tered-- 'Now, now is my triumph sure! He cannot elude my grasp this time-I'll crush him and all his ambition now! This pistol is loaded with a double charge, and it never missed fire yet, and I think it wiltnot now!' With a soft -cat-like'tread, the villain approached the reclining form of the young man-leav- ing the window open, and all things rea- dy for his egress when the hellish deed was done. Victor, whose mind was ab- sorbed with his own thoughts, was entire- ly unconscious of the approach of any one and little suspected that danger was so near. The villain approached the re- clining form of the young man, and, as he saw all was favorable to the prosecu- tion of his infernal scheme, an expres- sion crossed his dark features, that might have been attributed to a demon of the infernal regions. For a moment he stood still, and gazed with an exul- ting smile of triumph, upon the features of the unconscious victim. 'Ah, though you have twice escaped my vengeance, you cannot do so more?' he muttered, while that demonaic smile again crossed his crime-darkened visage. He raised the loaded pistol, and levelled it at the heart of the young man. The report rang through the room, as the vil- lain fired it-but Victor was safe-for a hand had thrown up the pistol, at the in- stant it was fired, and the charge lodged harmlessly in the wall? D'Elsey turn- ed round, and confronted the intruder, who had so successfully prevented the villain from wreakingi vengeance upon the youthful secretary. It was a lady who stood before him-a young girl. of such wondrous and surpassing beauty, that for an instant he was struck dumb with admiration and surprise. But he instantly recollected his critical position f   and without taking farther notice of her who had so successfully foiled him, he turned towards Victor, who had arisen from his reclining position, and boldly confronted him. The young general in- stantly recognized the traitor of Maren- go, who had twice before attempted to Itake his life, but who had been success- fully and almost miraculously foiled- and seeming to comprehend all, he sprang lightly towards him. The hot blood mounted to his cheeki and his eyes flashed fire. 'Traitor, demon, murderer ' almost shrieked the youn'g man, springing to- wards his foe. But d'Elsey was not yet without the means of defence, -for with the quickness of thought he drew another loaded pistol from his bosom, and levelled it with unerring aim, at the heart of the youthful secretary. Euge- nie saw that movement-she realized in what a perilous situation stood the one she loved, and, springing forward, she threw herself upon his bosom, and clasp- ed her arms tightly about his form. ' Fire now, villain!' cried the heroic maiden, in a tone of defiant triumph, - But know, that it is only through BMY heart, that you will reach rH I For an instant, D'Elsey hesitated- even his crime-staihed soul shrank from taking the life of so pure and beautiful a being. But this was the only altern- ative by which he could take the life of Berthior,-and he hesitated but a mo- ment. Again the loaded weapon was Iraised Both Victor and Eugenie were in the most imminent danger. But at this instant another form entered the room. NAPO LEO himself sprang through the door, and confronted the traitor and ' murderer! He had been aroused by the report of the pistol-and had come to discover the cause of the disturbance. D'Elsey seemed to see his position in a    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6822-00000043"/> moment, and springing towards the win- dow which he had left open for his egress, he sprang through it, before either Bon- aparte or Victor had time to prevent his escape. Napoleon picked up the loaded pistol, that the villain had drop- ped in his fright and haste, and dischar- ged it after him, but fortunately for the traitor and conspirator, the ball whizzed past him, and lodged in a beautiful tree by the road side. It was useless to at- tempt to overtake hial-he was running for his life, and would soon be at so far a distance as to baffle pursuit. 'Now, by our lady,' exclaimed Napo- leon, 'It is most unlucky that this rank villain has escaped! He was here with the intention of murdering you, I doubt not, General Berthier!' ' He was, and had it not been for-this brave girl he would have accomplished his purpose,' replied Victor, with a grateful look at the lovely girl, who still remained with her arms clasped tightly, around him, and her head bowed upon his bosom. 'Look up, Eugenic,' he con- tinued, gently, addressing the heroic maiden, 'we are safe, but the villain has escaped. Look up, my heroic friend, and let me pour out my heartfelt thanks to you for saving my unworthy life a second time ' There was no answer from the maiden -she stirred not, neither did she ex- hibit any signs of life. Victor was alarmed, and gently unclasping her arms from around him, he raised her head from his bosom. Her face was deadly pale, and her dark eyes closed,--she was in a state of insensibility. Gently Victor raised her in his arms, and laid her upon the sfdly cushioned divan, upon which he had been reclining. Restoratives were applied--but for some time without effect. Victor bent over the postrated form of the lovely girl,   who had twice saved his life, and, as he thought )f the extraordinary devotion which she had manifested towards him, he felt tl at even his own sister could not have been kinder or more devoted. Ah! he was soon to learn the cause of all this t nderness and heroic bravery! Victor gently bathed the upturned brow of the beautiful girl, and looked earnestly for the first signs of returning consciousness. She heaved a deep sigh, and opening her eyes languidly, they fell upon the countenance of the young man who was bending so anxiously over her. A faint blush tinged her pale sheek, and turning upon him one look of the deepest devotion, she again closed them. 'Victor, dearest Victor ' murmured the half-unconscious maiden, in a tone of the tenderest emotion. The murmur- ed words were distinctly audible to the young man-and now, for the first time, he realized what was the cause of Eu- genie St. Arnand's strange devotion to him. Strange and conflicting emotions whirled through his brain. The hot blood rushed to his brow, and every limb trembled with intense and exciting emotion. 'How blind I must have been,' he mur- mured, 'not to have discovered this be- fore! I now remember how often her dark eyes have been turned upon me with a glance of more than sisterly af- fection, but as I suspected not the truth, I did no, notice how plainly those soul- speaking eyes had told the cherished secret of her heart. Ah! beautiful,gen- tle, lovely Eugenie I And thou hast so long cherished this secret love for me, not even daring to hope that it might be returned-but still loving on, and thinking of nought but present happi- ness in my society, looking not into the future which may have bitter misery in store for thee. I feel that I am unwor-   thy of such love-and God forgive me if I can never return it as such a love should be returned!' Again the reviving girl opened her eyes, and fixed their soul thrilling glance upon the young man. Her lips opened --and in a faint voice she murmured- ' Did the villian injure you, dear Victor?' 'No, Eugenie,' replied the agitated young man, 'you have again saved my life by your heroic self-sacrificing brave- ry. What can I do to repay you for these multiplied services ' 'Only remember poor Eugenie, and sometimes drop a tear to her memory, when she is laid in her last resting place,' replied the young girl in a mournful tone. 'O, my dear friend, I trust you will yet out-live me, and see many years of happiness in this world,' answered Vic- tor, striving to conceal his deep emotion. The young girl opened her languid eyes-she fixed them upon the counten- nance of Victor. For several moments she gazed, with eyes expressive of the deepest love and tenderness, upon the face of him whose life she had twice saved. A painful struggle seemed going on in her bosom-her breast heaved, and her lips quivered with her intense emo- tion. At length she raised her head up- on her hand, and, making a strong effort to appear calm, she thus addressed the young man: 'Victor Berthier, you have already discovered, by the incident that has just transpired, and by my words on this oc- casion, that I cherish for you a more than sisterly affection. I know a maid- en should never tell her love, unasked, but it is useless for me to attempt longer to hide the cherished secret of my heart from your eyes. Circumstances have made it known to you-circumstances which it was not in my power to prevent.   And now, as you already know it, I will confess it to you with my own lips-I "OVE IOU! Yes, Victor Berthier, I love you with my. whole soul-deeply, truly, devotedly, and 1 shall love you, until the grave closes over my stilled and pulseless heart. From the time when I first looked on your pale countenance, so fascinating in its noble beauty, I lov- ed you. For days and weeks I watched over you with more than a mother's care, and most earnestly did I note the pro- gress of your recovery. When they told me you might survive and recover, if the best of care was given you, I determined that I would save your life, even at the risk of my own. Weeks passed into oblivion-under my tender care and con- stant watching, you recovered. I found your mind to be as noble as your person, and I took exqusite delight in conversing with you. You spoke of history, of travels, of the beauties of art and nature, -of music, paintings. and every thing else which was good or beautiful, but not a word did you ever speak of LOVE. But still I loved on, not daring to look into futurity knowing there was nothing but misery in store for me, for I saw plainly that you did not return my ar- dent and almost idolatrous affection.- You recovered-and then left us for the gay city of Paris, to join the standard of the great Napoleon. For more than two years have Iwatched your upward course to fame and honor-and whenever I heard of your being promoted to some higher office in the nation, my heart would glow with a kind of national pride -but even then from the depths of my soul would rise a feeling of the deepest misery, for I anew that, amid your hon- or and happiness, you scarcely bestow- ed a thought upon the poor Eugenie, who was dying of love for you. To-day, my father came to Paris, and hoping that    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6822-00000044"/> a sight of that gay city would dispel the habitual melancholy that he could not account for, he took me with 'him to visit Napoleon. I was thrown into your society, and an incident, which I had no power to prevent, has discovered to you my love. I have thought it useless to attempt to hide the secret longer, and have made to you a full confession of my hopeless affection. Do not denounce my course as unmaidenly, dear Victor; for it did not seem possible to keep the secret shut up in my own breast longer, and, as I knew circumstances had already discovered it to you, I felt that I would confess all to you, and then die. 1 do not ask or expect your love in return, dear Victor; I know you cannot give it. But give me your pity for my misery, -and do not blame me for this confession. O, Victor, I can but hope and pray for your happiness,for I have lost myown!' As she ceased, the forced calmness which she had attempted to sustain gave way, and bowing her head upon his hands -she burst into tears. Her passionate and uncontrollable grief touched the young soldier to the heart, and bowing his head, his heart-felt tears mingled with those of the maiden. 'Dear EugTenic,' said the young man endeavoring to control his deep emotion, 4 I very much regret to inform you, that the feelings I have entertained for yon -ree never deeper than those of friend- ship and gratitude. I loved you as a dear sister, and the thought that your affection for me was deeper than that -which you would feel for a beloved broth- er, never entered my head. But I ac- knowledge, my dear friend, that if I should ever choose a companion for life, upon which to bestow my heart's best af- fections, it would be you. Your beauty, intellect, nobleness, and power of mind, excel that of any maiden I had ever met   with. If I was capable of feeling that tenderest passion of the human heart- LovE-'it would most certainly be for you. But I am wedded to glory-Am. bition is my bride. I can never love an earthly bride. But I will ever be to you an affectionate brother, and a tender and self sacrificing friend; though I can nev- er love you as you should be loved. For- get me, dear Eugenie, and mingle in thd society which your beauty and accom- plishments fit you so well to grace, and among the noble and the gifted, you will find one who is more worthy of your deep and true love than is the poor soldier. You will yet find one upon whom to be- stow your love that will be worthy of it -and one who will return it with as deep and true an affection, as you give, and, dear Eugenie, you may yet be hap- py. 'NeCer, dear Victor, never ' exclaimed the unhappy maiden with passionate ear- nestness, as she raised her head and ga- zed through her blinding tears upon the face of the young man who knelt by hersid,. 'Never can I cease to love you.' continued the maiden mournfully; 'I hav loved too long and too deeply for that. Nothing is now left for me but misery-and I must bear my lot with fcrtitudc, for if my poor father was to know of his only daughter's hopeless anguish, it would carry his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. For his sake I will rear a smile though my heart is breaking. The ardent Southern temper- ament, which I inherited from my moth- er, gives me depth and intensity of feel- ing, that but few save those of southern blood ever know-and to this I owe the excruciating suffering which comes with full force upon my heart, as I realize that I must live on, unloved by him who was my young heart's idol,-for whose life I *ould lay down my own, and for   whose happiness I shall pray most earn-  estly!' Victor buried his face in his hands, and groaned aloud. The utter despair, the hopeless anguish, of the young girl's tones and words, struck to his heart. He felt how deep was the misery that was consuming her; and as he felt that he could not alleviate it, his agony for a moment surpassed that of her for whom he sorrowed. -ICe knew that he could not return her deep affect- ion; and his whole frame quivered with  uncontrollable emotion. The agitation  of Victor was too great to permit him to speak; a d for sometime, the silence was broken only by the groans of Victor and the sobsof the heart broken Eugenic. 'It is best that we should bid each  other farewell as soon as possible,' spoke the agitated voice of the maiden; 'for the longer we are together the deeper it ren- ders our anguish. And let this farewell be forever, for I canlnot summon courage tomeet you again. In another world we may meet again but in this. we must not.' 'It is best that it should be so, replied Victor, in throken tones, 'for our meet- ing would open the wound afresh. But I shall ever think of you, Eugenic; with emotions of pity and regret, and shalli pray that you may forget your unrequi- ted love: and yet be happy. I shall ever love you as a sister and a friend and ever cherish for you feelings of the deepest gratitude. Though I mnay never meet you again in this world, I trust that I  shall join you in a better land, where anguish and sorrow are never known and  where the heart is never saddened by  unrequited love  Farewell, Eugenie, may God grant that youmay be happy!' 'Farewell, dearest Victor, may you never know the anguish of a broken heart, or the deep misery of unreturned affection!' murmured the heart stricken   girl, as she rose from her seat and with one last look of unutterable,never dying affection vanished from his sight. The door closed behind her retreating form. and sinking back upon the divan, Victor Bertheir gave himself up to the over- whelming tide' of misery that rolled its dark waters upon his saddened soul. CHAPTER   XT. ST CLAIr AND  VICTOR BERTIEIT-- A  TrimLLING( SCENE. Go forward: press onward A moment's delay May thicken the shadows That rise on ) ,ur way! D. C. Colcsworthy. IT was a clear starlight evening--the moon rose in majesty, and sailed calmly up a blue and cloudless sky and the stars gleamed with all the brilliancy of a clear winter's eveningwere out in innumerable numbers and gazing with their thousan d starry eyes: upon the silent world, bene- ath. The gay city of Paris was hushed in slumber and nought save occasionally the sighing of the wind in the branches of the leafless trees, or the dreary shriek of the night bird, broke tfie deep stillness which reigned around. It was the hour i of midnight, still and silent; the hour of meditation, adoration and love. Just without the environs of the city and walking slowly along arm in arm, were two persons, protected from the chilling influence of the night air, by large and heavy cloaks that were wrap- ped around them. The waters of tho Seine glistened at their feet; and i murmuring sound was all that disturbed the silence, save tlhc low and cautious voices of the two figures. The bright moon-light deliniated their figures darkly upon the fine snow around them and gave to the  murmuring  waves  of the river a clear silvery gloss, but they    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6822-00000045"/> heeded not the cold magnificence of nature. Pale ais the clear moon'-light which fell in silvery lines upon his features, was the countenance of Victor Berthier. An expression of sadness rested upon his handsome features, and the clear dark eyes were not of that spiritual bril- liancy that had before characterized them; but, in its place, was a sad ex- pression, as if the spirit of sadness had suddenly clouded them with her darken- ing wing. But the face of St. Clair though pale, did not wear the same gloomy expression of his companion, there was a light of hope and trust in the earnest dark eye, and a smile that told that its wearer was looking forward to a bright future, rested upon the clas- sic features. As the moonlight fell up- on his countenance, it seemed more like a spirit's than a mortal's; for its noble beauty seemed heightened by the soften- ing influence. Both spoke in a low, evidently suppressed tone, as if they feared to be overheard, though not a sound, save the river murmuring at their feet, broke the stillness which reigned around. They trod the crispy snow' with slow, measured steps, as if their conversation was of such deep impor- tance that they heeded not the moments as they flew. 'I feel a strange heaviness at my heart, St. Clair' said Berthier, in a low earnest tone. 'and a presentiment of evil. I know not why it h4s taken possession of my mind. I feel that my life is not safe even a moment. That demon d'El- sey, has determined to have my heart's blood, and he will not rest until he has accomplished his object. Twice he has attempted my life: once at the battle of Marengo, where he stabbed me to the' heart and left me for dead, and had not thelovely Eugenic de St. Arnand watch-,    ed over me with the most tender and anu remitting care, that would have been my death-wound. But she saved my life; and I recovered, after long weeks of suf- fering. IBoth B Tnaparte and myself did all in our power to get d'Elsey into our hands, and to punish him for his crimes; but though we often heard of him, still we were notable to apprehend him. We set spies uipon his track but he managed to elude them, and escape in safety. As we know it would be a task to secure him that we were too busy to undertake; we at last abandoned all hopes of success, and gave up the scheme entirely, 'I had jalmost forgotten d'Elsey in the multitilde of national cares, when he made another attempt upon my life, three days! since, and I was again saved by the heroic Eugenic. I thought that we should gethim into our power then, but, thanks to his agility and self pos- session, he escaped. As he had been foiled three times in effecting my de- struction, I know he will now be doubly anxious to; take my life, and gratify his long-cherished revenge. He will watch my every movement now-he will not let a single opportunity pass, that might favor his designs. And I feel as though I cannot escape from the power of his never-sleeping revenge-for a strange fear that his design upon my life is soon to be accomplished, has taken possession of my soul I am not wont to give up thus to despondency-but, I confess, it is not in my power to shake off this in- definable fear of something evil from my soul.' What, General Berthicr?exclaimed St. Clair, with an effort at rallying the spirits of liis friend,' is it possible that YoU, who was never known to turn your back to the enemy even in the hottest and most unequal battles, are haunted   with the demon of fear, NOW, when there is nothing to be feared! Why, General, I verily belive you are turning coward, staying in the gay city of Paris, so long, and doing nothing but flirt with the pretty girls, and write documents for Napoleon?  A faint smile flitted dver the pale face of Berthier, 'Ah, St. Clair,' he said, mournfully, 'ou little know how the heart that could stand the most immi- nlent real danger, when he can see it full before him, and give it fair and open bat- tle, will shrink from an unseen, but no less powerful enemy. Were I to meet d'Elsey in the open field, when I knew that he was the one with whom I was des- tined to combat, I should go to the strife like an impatient charger--fearing noth- ing, and caring for less ; but now my en- emy comes veiled, and in darkness-si- lently, but surely-and, with his bloody hand ready to take my life, he stands e-. ultingly over his helpless Victim. I know not when the blow is to fall, or in what manner; but I feel assured that it will be soon. This time he will be cau- tious and more wary, and I have no doubt but that he will lay his plans so that he cannot fail to succeed. I know that the blow, this time, will be struck in such a manner that I cannot escape. It is useless for me to be cautious and wary-he is now determined upon the execution of his plot, and no common obstacle will deter him from accomplish- ing it. And with this before me-know- ing that my sworn enemy is even now laying plans for my destruction, and with the consciousness before me that the next moment may be my last-can you wonder that it fills my soul with a vague, indefinable dread and horror,and weighs down my spirits with a hopeless despondency' ' It is true, my dear friend, that you   have ample reason for feeling despond- ent,' replied St. Clair, with a deep sigh, ' and I wonder not that your mind looks with a vague dread into the future. But you must think, dear friend, that while there is life there is also hope-that you may yet foil the villain, and his life may be the forfeit of his temerity, instead of yours. You have a quick hand, and there is not a man in Paris who excels you in the use of the sword or pistol-and why may you not be the victor in the fight, instead of the villain d'Elsey V' 'Al my friend,' replied Berthier, with a sad smile, you do not seem to realize that when the villain attacks me, it will not be in fair fight, as in the battle-field, -if it was so, I should not feel the least fear; but, instead of this, he comes silently, perchance when I am sleeping; and strikes the blow when I have no power to defend myself.  lie, too, is expert at these weapons which I have so often been called perfect in using; and before I should have time to defend myself in the least, his dagger would be through my heart. Ah, St. Clair, I see that you realize my position now; is it not a critical one ' 'I confess, dear Victor, that it is tru- ly so,' replied St. Clair. ;But stills there is some hope left-the cireum- stances may be such, that you may have some chance of defending yourself. You always carry weapons about you; do you not?' Victor drew from beneath his cloak two pairs of pistols, and a large, keen- bladed dagger. ' These,' he said, 'I've carried with me, since d'Elsey made the last attempt upon my life. The pistols are at all times loaded, and the dagger of the finest and best tempered eteel.-- These are all trusty weapons, and if could but get a chance to use them, I    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6822-00000046"/> would not fear for any of d'Elsey's ma- ohinations.' Well, my dear friend, you must trust in Providence and hope for the best,'  'said St. Clair, in a tone of hopeful re- liance on one higher and better than himself. ' All may yet be well, and the  presentiment which you now entertain  of your speedy dissolution prove entire- i ly without foundation.' ' Your words are kind and hopeful, my dear friend,' said Victor, gratefully press- ing the hand of St. Clair, but I wish I could entertain as much of a hope that all might yet be well as you do. But still, the presentiment of my speedy dis- solution haunts me; I cannot shake it  off. Bnt I feel calmer and more com- posed, now that I know you will conti- nue the work which I have begun; name- ly--overthrowing the league of conspir- ators against Napoleon.' 'I will continue this noble work with all the ardor and determination which you have manifested, and trust that I shall succeed. But I hope, my dear friend, that you will be able to continue it with me--that all your fears will yet be groundless.' Victor shook his head mournfully.- 'My fears will all prove too true,' said he, sadly, 'I know this presentiment which I have will be fulfilled, sooner or later. And in your hands, my dear friend, I leave the task of overthrowing the conspiracy against Napoleon. I have told him nothing of it, for I had a strange ambition to overthrow them all without his knowledge, and so add a brighter wreath to my laurel crown than I have yet ever won. I now see that it would have been far better to have ac- quainted him with the conspiracy, and then he could prosecute the search for the conspiratois even when I am no more. But the secret is in your hand ,   also; for you know as much as myself of the league and its hellish plots. And if I never again see the First Consul, I wish you, St. Clair, to tell him all. Tell him of my intention to surmount them in all their evil designs, and tell him I that if I had lived, I should have done it. And you, St. Clair, you must 'take my place as private secretary to Napo- leon. I feel that I can trust you-you are a firm and true friend to Bonaparte, for, had you been otherwise, you would not have dared the danger and peril of playing the spy upon the conspirators, for his sake. And I know that you are brave and noble; for the events of that night testify to that. 1 know that-you aIre the most fitting one that could be  found to take my place as the private secretary; and confidant of the Fiirst Consul. 'Tell him that it is my last j wish that you should take my place.' I If you wish it, I will do so,' replied St. Clair, in a trembling voice, but I fear that IBonaparte would think I never received any such message from you, but jhad taken the liberty to attempt to !make hin believe so, that I might fill t!at station of honor and influence.' eNo--no-my dear friend, it is not so.' earnestly interrupted Victor. ' Bo- inaparte has often heard me speak of you, as my best friend, and lie knows that you are a man of truth and honor, well fitted to fill the station that my death will leave vacant. lie will not distrust your word in the least; for he knows that I cherish you, as my very dear friend. Fear not on this score- only give him my pariting message, and it will be' sufficient.' I wili comply with your requcst,dear Victor, if fortune should will that you never see your great chieftain again,' replied St. Clair. 'And shall I tell him i    of your presentiment of death: of your settled conviction of your fate.' 'Yes, tell him all,' answered Victor. 'Tell him of all that has been said dur- ing this interview. You must tell him of the conspiracy immediately, and im-, plore him to beware of Count Lucier, or of any one who belongs to that ter- rible league. But you know, St. Clair,  that it is necessary to make him ac- quainted with all this; and I need not give you farther directions regarding the matter.' 'And of Eugenie,-shiall I tell him what you have confided to me respect- ing her love for you?' asked St. Clair, with a slight tremulousness in his voice: Yes,' you may tell him of that, and charge him to treat the unhappy girl with all a father's kindness for my sake. And, after I am gone, I hope that she will conquer her hopeless love for me. and yet be happy. Ah; St. Clair, I have something more to say upon this subject -which lays near my heart.' 'Speak on, then, my friend, I shall listen with the deepest interest.' replied- St. Clair. Have you ever seen Eugenic de St. Arnand?' questioned Victor. 'I have,' was the reply. 'Do you not think her supremely beautiful? 'She is, indeed, the most remarkably lovely woman I ever saw.' 'Do you not think, St. Clair. that You could love her,' earnestly asked Victor. 'If her mind is as lovely as her per- son, I could not refrain from doing so,' replied St. Clair, with some confusion. 'I assure you that her mind excels her personal charms, if possible,' replied Victor. 'She would make a life-com- panion for any one, even the most ele- vated, of whom they might justly be proud.  St. Clair, you are not much   older than herself, handsome, fascinating, talented and noble. I think, if her love could be drawn from me to any other, it would be yourself. She would love you with all the intensity and ardor which she has heretofore bestowed on my unworthy self. You will love her, St. Clair-I doubt' not but you will. You will wed her, and she may yet be happy.' "I fear I could not win her,' replied St. Clair, in an agitated voice. 'But promise me, St. Clair, that you will do 'all in your power to make her forget her unhappy first love,' earnestly said Victor. She will soon see your merits as fully as myself, and I doubt not but she will transfer her love from the dead to the living. And, my friend, I doubt not but you will love her. Promise me, St. Clair, that you will do all in your power to make that lovely being happy-to cause her to forget her first unhappy love.' 'I promise,' said St. Clair, his voice tremulous with viorcnt agitation. ' Then I can die in peace, if I can but hwrve the hope that she will yet be hap- py,' said Victor, clasping his hands as if in thankfulness. 'But why did you not love this peer- less creature?' asked St. Clair. 'St. Clair,' said Victor, in his former 'melancholy tones,: I loved Eugenie de 'St. Arnand, but only as a sister and a friend. It is not in my power to love a woman as she deserved to be loved; if my heart had been thus formed, she would have been the one of all others, upon whom I should have bestowed my' affection. But AMBITION is my bride: I can never love earthly bride, for I am already wedded to glory. You are not thus-you have warm afiections, and though you are ambitious, still your am- bition does not over-balance your affee-    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6822-00000047"/> tions. You can love Eugenie as she should be loved-and I hope and trust that you will yet be happy together. I would have loved Eugepie, St. Clair, but I could not 1' St. Clair buried his face in his hands, and his bosom heaved with intense emo- tion. But calming himself as quickly as possible, he raised his head. and turn- ing to Victor, asked- And do you wish me to make known to Napoleon your desire that I should wed Eugenic de St. Arnand?' 'No, it is best that you should say nothing to Bonaparte respecting it,' re- plied Victor, after a moment's thought. 'You may inform him of her hopeless love for me, but say nothing further. Only woo and win her, love her, and make her happy.' 'I will comply with your request, if it is in my power,' replied St. Clair, ' and I will be to her a true and devoted hus- band. But yet I may not win her-her love for you may be too strong.' 'Only endeavor to do it, and I think you will succeed,' replied Victor. 'But the moon is waning-we must part. Tell Napoleon that my last thought will be of him and France. I feel that I shall never see him more-that, before the sun rises, I shall be sleeping the dreamless slumber of death. Tell Eu- genie that I bid her an affectionate adieu, and my last wish shall be for her happi- ness. And you, my dear friend, I must bid you farewell forever. Be faithul to Bonaparte and his cause-serve him with as much faithfulness as I have done. And be faithful to Eugenie-love her and make her happy. Think of me now as one you will never meet again, for I feel that this is our last parting. Fare- well, St. Clair-my dear and faithful friend, farewell P ' Farewell, dear Victor ' murmured   St. Clair, his voice choked with intense emotion, and his whole frame quivering with the intensity of the sorrow with which his heart was filled. The two friends threw their arms aruond each other, and for several moments stood locked in a silent, embrace. At length their arms unclasped, and pressing the hand of St. Clair fervently, Victor bade his agitated friend a last farewell. Tears were in the eyes of the youthful general; but they flowed in streams down the pale checks of St. Clair. He was too agitated to speak, and giving the hand of Victor a farewell pressure, he turned away to hide the emotion that he could not suppress. With a mournful look of affection up- on his youthful friend, Victor turned slowly away, and walked along by the side of the Seine in the direction of Paris. The moonlight streamed bright- ly across his path, and lit up everything around with a silvery brilliancy, but the young man heeded it not-he was think- ing of scenes which were now past, and which he sighed to think would never return. The parting with St. Clair had only increased his belief that the pre- sentiment of death which had comd ovec his mind so strangely, would soon be realized. For half an hour he walked on, deeply absorbed in meditation, and now the towers and spires of Paris could be seen glistening in the bright moon- light, and the lamp burning in the win- dow of a room of the palace which Vic- tor knew to be that of the First Consul was distinctively visible. A walk of half a mile further would bring him to the palace, and when once within its walls, he felt more safe. A faint hope that his presentiment would prove to be no- thing but a freak of his imagination, was entering his mind, when he was sud- denly startled by a sound, as if of a foot-   step upon the crisp snow. He started, and drawing his dagger from his bosom, to be ready for his own defence, he hesi- tated and listened. Nothing was heard but the deep murmuring of the river, or the wind groaning through the leafless branches of the trees-all else was still and silent as the grave. Victor laughed at his groundless fears, and moved silent- ly and swiftly on. But again the crack- ling of the footstep upon the snow fell upon his ears, and before he could turn to discover who it could be, a shadow, as of a man, darkened the moonlight across his path, and looking up, he beheld be- fore him, with a demoniac smile upon his countenance, his deadly and most fear- ed enemy-the traitor and conspirator -COLONEL D'ELSEY I A cold thrill of horror passed through every nerve of Victor Berthier, as he met the gleaming dark eyes of his dead- ly enemy, fixed upon him with a glare of fierce, demoniac triumph; His cheek became pale as the spotless snow be- neath his feet, and the hand that still grasped the dagger, trembled visibly.- D'Elsey saw what an influence his ap- pearance had exerted over the nerves of the young man, and with a demon-like laugh, he exclaimed- 'Ha, ha, my fine fellow, I've caught you now   You need not attempt to es- cape this time, for there's no little black- eyed fairy here to throw herself into your arms, and defend you so heroically, ha, ha, ha ' The hot blood mounted to the cheek of Victor, and his eyes flashed with an angry fire. He grasped the dagger firmly, and raising it with the quickness of thought, he aimed a blow at the heart of d'Elsey. But the practiced villain was on the alert, and springing aside, he avoided the well-directed blow, and be- fore Victor could strike another, d'Elsey   caught his arm with the quickness of lightning, and wrenched the dagger from his grasp. 'Think not to foil me thus, young man,' said the villain, his keen eyes flashing with revengeful fire, 'twice have I been defeated, but this time you can- not escape. Say your prayers quick, my fine fellow, for you have only two minutes  to live!' 'And do you show no mercy, heart- less villian ' asked the youthful victim. 'Not the least,' replied the other, with the tone of one who never felt that heavenly attribute. 'But stop-I've one proposition to make, which if you acceed to, I will spare your life. If you will place that lovely girl who rescued you three days since from my vengeance, and for whom I have conceived ' most ardent passion, in my hands, and further- more, promise to leave France forever, and never again interfere with my am- bition, I'll let you go free. This is the only way by which you can obtain your life and liberty.' Victor hardly believed his own ears. To place such an angel as Eugenic St. Arnand in the power of such a practi. ced demon as d'Elsey, seemed a project too horrible to be named. This propo- sition roused all the spirit of Victor Berthier. 'And would you have me purchase life at such a price?' exclaimed the ex- cited young man. 'If you think I am so base and craven as to do that, you must imagine that I have come down nearly to your own level. No! were you able to inflict upon me the most cruel torture to cause one death, to have in it the concentrated agony of a thou- sand, I would not buy my release from it by giving that angel into your infer- nal power. Neither will I make the promise that you require. I acknow-    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6822-00000048"/> ledge that you have me in your power- but I am ready and prepared to die, though I will not give up my life with- out one effort to save it. Draw, villian, and defend thyself i' The spirited tone and determined manner of the youthful general astound- ed the colonel, but quickly recovering his self-possession, he drew his blade and sprang towards the young man. For a moment the clashing of the swords drowned every other sound, each being employed in parrying the other's deter- mined thrusts, and striving to give his opponent one thrust more powerful than before, by which he might gain the vic- tory. The strife was indeed terrific.- Neither seemed destined to conquer the other-but with eyes flashing, and brows reeking with a cold sweat, they still con- tinued the dreadful strife. It was a moment of life or death. A faint ray of hope gleamed from the dark eyes of Berthier, and he handled his good sword  with a stedier nerve--but with a dexter- ous thrust, d'Elsey parried the well-di- rected blow of his opponent, and after an instant's clashing of weapons, Victor was disarmed, and the sword flew several feet from him upon the moonlit snow! The eyes of the conspirator flashed with ,atriumphant fire. He sprang towards his now defenceless victim, and, throwing down his sword, he drew from his bosom a glittering dagger, and plunged it into the heart of Victor! 'Ahl I've secured you now, proud general,' said the demon in human form, with a horrid laugh. The glassy eyes of the young man turned once more upon his murderer with a look of reproach and agony, and then slowly closed. The moonlight lay in silvery lines amid the dark masses of jetty hair, and made the   pale face look almost like marble in, its silent whiteness; and it fell with a paler glow on the warm life-eurrent, that was -oozing from the bosom of the wounded man, and saturating the pure snow be- neath. The face was still and noble- but silent in its glorious beauty: for over it the dark angel had spread his wing! For a few moments the conspirator gazed upon the face of the murdered, with a smile such as a demon of the in- fernal regions might have worn, if a new victim had been added to the num- bers that are already his. Iie then drew the dagger from the wound, and placed his hand upon the heart to assure him- self that his victim was no longer liv- ing. The heart was stilled; its pulses had ceased to beat, and the villain knew that the young man was no more. Tak- ing the body in his arms, he bore it to the waters of the river which murmured near them, and cast it into the waves.- It sank beneath them with a heavy sound and the glittering waves rolled on as smoothly as ever, and rippled along as gaily, as if the noble dead had not been- laid to rest beneath their deep bosom. The cold moonlight fell down as brightly as ever upon the beautiful riverbut up- on all around there seemed to have been cast a shadow of mourning for the youth- ful and noble victim of REVENGE! D'Elsey picked up his bloody dagger and bending down by the glistening wa- ters, washed from it the dark stain. He then placed it in his bosom, and walked slowly away from the scene of the bloody strife. All was again still and silent- the sounds of contention had ceased- but beneath the glistening wave lay a form that had not been there before- TIIE PRESENTIMENT WAS PULPILLED!   CHAPTER XII. THE YOUNG SECRETARY-TIE STRANGER -A TIIRLLING SCENE. Light to regain the track, (Lost f? awhile mid those that downward tend Strength to press onward, bravely onward,lend, Till hope and faith triumphantly shall blend, Near to turn faltering back! S. H. BROWN-. Two weeks have passed since the events recorded in our last chapter oc- ,curred, and the excitement which had been occasioned by the disappearance of Victor Berthier had somewhat subsided. Still his friends and acquaintances la mented his loss as deeply as ever; for the young man had been an universal favorite in Parisian society, and now that he was gone,' the bright particular star' of their circle had faded and gone down. St. Clair, the dear friend of' the young man, was inconsolable. He mourn- ed the loss of Victor as if he had been his own brother, and, in fact, the ties of brotherhood could not have bound Ntose two friends closer together than they had been while living. No traces of the body, or of the murderer, could be found. The whole country around was examin- ed, and even the bed of the river for sev- eral miles below the city, but no traces of 'Victor could be discovered. TIW spot where the fatal encounter had occured; was plainly distinguishable; and the blood-stained snow, as well as the broken sword of Victor, thld that the strife had been fatal to one at least, and none doubted but that one was Victor Ber- Their. All search for the murderer was useless, he had doubtless escaped, and would probably keep out of the way at present. This Napoleon fully realized --and thought it best not to make search for him. He was well satisfied in his own mind that the offender was Colonel d'Elsey, and he knew his reputation for cunning and ingenuity in escaping from danger so well, that he gave orders that   no search should be made, but that a strict watch should be kept upon all strangers who entered the city, if they at all resembled the description given of Colonel d'Elsey. St. Clair, as he had promised Berthier, had to tell Napoleon of the intentions of the league of conspirators established at La Vendee, and spies were now posted in all parts of the country, and more particularly in the province and village of La Vendee. As yet, Napoleon had taken no decisive measure to apprehend them; but, he had sent messages to all the generals against whom they had sworn vengeance, warning them of their danger, and cautioning them against all persons who might desire audience of them, as it was not known at what hour. or in what manner, the blow would fall, St. Clair had also informed Bonaparte of Victor's dying wish that his dearest friend should succeed to his office of private secretary, and N;epoleon, being somewhat acquainted. with the merits of ;St. Clair, readily complied with the wish, and the office was immediately taken up, much to the discomfiture of Count Lu- cier, and his allies. But they deter- mined to crush Bonaparte in another way, if not in this. What this way was we shall soon see. It was now the second week of February-and the con- spirators, seeing nothing of the impend- ing ruin which was soon to present itself to their foe, still thought their plots progressing finely, and even Captain Lesalle began to have some decided hope of their success. It is true, the fact that St. Clair, a man whom they could not possibly hope to bend to their interests, now filled the office of private secretary was not altogather favorable to them, but as Count Lucier declared that he could poison Bonaparte in .spite of St. Clair, they felt but little anxiety on that    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6822-00000049"/> more, for they knew that when Count Seneier promised he was sure to fufil. It was a dull, chilly afternoon about two weeks after the disappearance of Berthier, that Bonaparte and his private secretary sat alone together in the very room where Eugenie de St. Arnand had saved the life of Victor Berthier, when the daring attempt was made by de'Elsey nearly three weeks before. The face of St. Clair was pale as marble, and a settled melancholly was visible in the depths of his dark eyes, for the death of Victor had made upon his heart an impression that could not easily be eras- ed. Na4oleon sat a short distahee from him,. writing orders and various other messages and documents, which he hand- ed to St. Clair immediately after their completion, and the young man carefully copied them, and then folded the origin- al documents and directed them to their several destinations. St. Clair was a rapid and handsome penman; and, as the orders were copied as quickly as Na- poleon could write them, the First Con- sul congratulated himself that he had secured such a profitable and pleasant seeretaty. At last the documents were all finished and copied; and, as St. Clair folded and directed the last one, he threw down his pen that he had been using so rapidly for the last few hours, with an air of uneasiness and indisposition to use it more. ' You are somewhat wearied with the labor of a private secretary, are you not, St. Clair?' asked Bonaparte, with a pleasant smile. 'Not at ali, general,' was the reply of the youthful secretary, 'but this after., noon I have not been in a mood for writing, for my thoughts were so engross- ed by conjecture as to where that villain d'Elsey, had hid himself. I would give my life to discover his retreat I'   'You take the death of General Ber--- thier too much to heart, my dear St, Clair,' said Bonaparte, kindly. ' It is true, all Paris has been mourn- ing for him. I too have had my share of grief for his loss; but you, my dear St. blair, brood over the bereavement as if you could never be reconciled to it. I wish as much as you can that d'Elsey maybe apprehended and punished for his crimes; but you seem to think of nothing but this.' ' I confess, general,' replied the young man, 'that my thoughts are mostly up- on this subject. I loved Victor Ber- thier as a dear brother-and now that he has been murdered by a villain, I cam think of little else than avenging his death. I would give my life if it would but bring back Victor safe and sound; and I would give my right hand if the sacrifice would be the means of bringing to justice the demon d'Elsey.' 'Ah, my dear St. Clair, you are think- ing of this subject altogether too much for your own health and happiness,' said Bonaparte. 'But come, I'm going to. cheer you up with some news that will doubtless interest you. The Lady Engenie de St. Arnand, who twice saved the life of your departed friend, was, here this morning, and has promised to call again this afternoon, wh'bn, if yor wish, I will favor you with an introduo- tion to her.' 'I should be most happy to become, acquainted with her,' said St. Clair while a slight flush overspread his hand- some countenance, 'for though I have seen her but once, I have become consi- derably interested in her. She is very beautiful.' 'She is said to be the handsomest woman in France,' said Napoleon, while a slight smile overspread his expressive features, and you, St. Clair come but   little short of being the handsomest man.' 'What, general? can it be that you have taken to flattery?' exclaimed St. Clair, with a look of surprise. Not in the least, replied Bonaparte. I only spoke the truth. But, my young friend, he continued, in a more serious tone, 'you must be making your toilet in the best style, for I expect Lady Eu- genie here every moment, and I wish you to appear to the best advantage. If you are only as fascinating and interest- ing as you generally, are, who knows but you may win the acknowledged belle of Paris.' A  faint smile passed over the fine countenance of St. Clair, but he made no reply to this observation. Rising and looking the desk at which he had been writing, he bowed gracefully to Bona- parte, and then left the room. For sev- eral moments the general sat silently, with his head bowed upon his hand, but then rising from his seat, he paced the floor of the room rapidly and excitedly, while his lips moved, as if giving utter- ance to the thoughts that were passing iu his mind. 'Yes,' he murmured, 'this conspiracy is certainly getting to be quite a serious affair, and, from what I have heard to- day, I doubt not General Moreau is en- gaged in It. If the conspirators are as numerous and powerful as Pierre has to- day told me, it is possible they may yet do some mischief. It is true, the great heart of the nation is with me; but there are yet many loyalists in France, who would gladly join the standard of rebel- lion. But my spies are humerous  I think they'will yet ascertain how great is the danger and where it lies, and thus we shall be able to foil them in some of their most cherished plans, and per- chance overthrow them entirely. If on    Berthier was only here, he would be a much more efficient spy than any I have set upon the track of the conspirators. But they have got him out of their way, and my best spy is gone. St. Clair is too much afflicted by his loss, to be very ef- ficient now, but I hope that he will be of considerable worth to me, when he be- comes reconciled to the loss of his dear- est friend. At any rate, these conspira- tors MUST be overcome-for, if they are not, the road to the throne of the nation will be too much hemmed in by obstacles, that will be difficult to surmount. The whole league must be destroyed, and ev- cry one of its leaders silenced forever. This SHALL be done--for without it is, I cannot gain a crown'and throne--and I must and will be EMPEROR OF FRANCE!' His meditations were here interrupt- ed by a slight knock at the door, and, supposing it was Eugenie, Napoleon quickly removed every cloud of anxiety from his face, by-calling to his counten- ance one of his most fascinating smiles, and approached the door 'where the knock had been heard.  Turning the key, he quickly threw it open, but, in- stead of Eugenie, a stranger stood be- fore the entrance. With his usual per- fect good breeding, Napoleon asked the stranger to enter and be seated, and again closing the door and turning the key, he awaited the pleasure of his guest to make known the business that had caused him to seek audience of the First Consul. 'I come, General Bonaparte,' said the stranger, ' to give you some information respecting the supposed murder of your private secretary, Victor Bclthier.' Any intelligence respecting him will be most gratefully received,' said Bona- parte, fixing his dark eyes upon the face of his visitor with an expression that seemed to read his very soul. The stranger was young, evidently not more    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6822-00000050"/> than twenty-five years of age, and would be called most eminently handsome, There was a peculiaily piquant expres- sion about the finely chiselled lips, and a strange brightness of the dark eyes, that did not exactly suit Bonaparte's idea of a trustworthy man; but nevertheless, he did Aot seem disposed to distrust him, but resolved to give him a hearing, and ponder upon the intelligence he should give as its weight and importance deser- ved. 'First allow me to disencumber my- self of this not very agreeable travelling costume,' replied the stranger, rising and throwing off his heavy outside coat. 'I have ridden a long distance to-day, and am thoroughly tired of wearing it so long.' How far have you ridden to-day?' asked Napoleon, with considerable inter- est. 'From Fontainebleau,' replied the stranger. 'Indeed 1' exclaimed Napoleon, 'and have you ridden so far to- day?' ' For the last six hours I have been up- on the road,' replied the visitor. ' You must be considerably fatigued by this time,' replied Napoleon, rising and approaching the door,'" and if you will be pleased to take a seat; I will send a page for refreshments.' The stranger expressed his thanks with the most graceful politeness, and the General, after giving the bell a pretty decisive jerk, returned to his seat. In a few moments a page answered the call. Bonaparte gave orders for bringing in wine and refrpshments. ' By what name are you known, my friend V' asked Bonaparte, addressing the stranger. ' Le Jeffreys,' replied the other. 'Any title?' asked Napoleon. 'Marquis,' carelessly replied thie visitor.   'I believe you informed me, upon your first entrance,that you brought intelli- gence respecting my deceased private secretary, Victor Bertheir. If'you will be so kind as to impart that intelligence I shall listen with the greatest pleasure.' ' I the first place, General,' said the young Marquis. 'Victor Berthier is not dead.' 'I think that assertion will meet with little credit,' answered Napoleon, 'but if you can prove what you sady, I shall be most happy to believe it.' At this moment the page again enter- ed, with wine and refreshments. The silver salver was set upon the elegant ta- ble, and at a motion from Bonaparte the page left the room. Napoleon poured two glasses of the sparkling liquid from the bottle ; and, handing one totLe, Jef- freys, sat the other down upon the table for himself. The Marquis drank off his at a draught, and the glass was again fill- ed with the ruby liquid. 'Now, Marquis Le Jeffreys, said the General,' we will listen to your explana- tion of the assertion which you have made.' 'I suppose you arc aware,' said the Marquis, 'of the strong attachment which Mademoiselle Eugenie de St Arnand en- tertained for your private secretary.' I am,' was the reply of Bonaparte. And are you aware of the result of their last meeting.' 'I an,' was the reply. Then those facts I shall not be obli- ged to acquaint you with. You also know that General Berthier was very melancholy and dejected tfter this inter- view. Itimpressed him very much, and the idea that his presence in Paris, while she remained here, would only increase the misery that she was then laboring un- der, took possession of his mind. He de- termined to absent himself for some   time, until she left, without allowing any one, not even yourself, to know but that he was dead. And the certainty thatif he remained in Paris, d'Elsey his dead- ly enemy, would be sure to take his life if possible strengthened this resofltion. He left his business in the Lands of St. Clair, feeling assured that his place would be well filled by him, and unknown even to yourself left Paris, intending to spend a few months in Italy. On the eve df his departure, he had a long inter- view with St. Clair, in which he informed him of a presentiment of his speedy death by the hand of his enemy d'Elsey, and thus blinded his eyes in such a manner, that when he was not to be found the next morning, you readily supposed that he had been murdered. The finding of a broken sword, with traces of a conflict  near the banks of the Seine, strengthen- ed this opinion. Between whom this t conflict was, and whom it was fatal to- I know not, but it is certain that the i blood spilt was not that of. Victor Ber-  their. He is safe, and, at present, in It- i aly fi ' This is a very strange story,' said Bo- W naparte, more to himself than to the Mar- 1 quis, as he slowly sipped his wine, with ti his thoughts seemingly deeply interested in the narrative to which he had listened. sa Then raising his eyes to the face of Le h Jeffreys, he asked 'But how, sir Mar- as quis,did you become acquainted with  the matter?' 'Four days since I met a man in Na- fo ples whom I knew to be Victor Bertheir, in and addressed him as such. -Ie recorr to nised me immediately, for he was one of m my friends, when we were schoolmates hi together years ago, though for some time bl past we had not met. I was very much surprised to meet him there, when I had die supposed, with the rest of you, that he by had died by the sword of the villian d'El- do   ny sey. I questioned lhim respecting the at matter, and at last he told me all, giving if me leave to impart the intelligence to d- you, but to no one else. He bade me as. fe sure you, that he was alive and safe from n. the powerof the villain,1 d'Elsey. He 3t. bade me charge you not to make it ce known to Lady Eugenie.' n  ' Very strange-very strange indeed,' to said Napoleon, in his usual peculiar man le ner. 'But what has so suddenly attrac- r- ted your attention, Marquis?' he cdntin- d ued, as Le Jeffreys sprang from his seat h and seemed intently gazing unon some d object that was visible from the window. ' Look General 2' exclaimed Le Jef e freys, earnestly,' is not that man thatis tpassing Colonel d'Elsey?' Napoleon sprang from his seat, and gazed intently in the direction which Le Jeffreys designated. While his atten- tion was thus absorbed, the Marquis slip- ped slyly back to the table, and taking from his bosom a small pieceof paper, he emptied its contents-which was a small quantity of black powder-into the half finished glass of Bonaparte. The action was performed in a moment and so silent- ly and slyly, that Napoleon had not no- ticed that Le Jeffreyq had left his side. ' That man does resemble d'Elsey,' said Napoleqn more to himself than to his companion, 'but yet, it does not seem as though it'could be him for he would not dare to be out in the streets of Par- is now, and in full Austrian uniform, too, for he knows that all France is endeavor- ing to discover his place of concealment to glut their vengeance upon him for the murder of Bertheir. Ah, no, he turns his face this way now-it does not resem- ble d'Elsey's-it is not him.' Napoleon turned away with i slightly disappointed air, and again took his seat by the table. Unheard by either, a side door had noiselessly opened while Napo-    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6822-00000051"/> leon was gazing from the window, and t Eugenie de St. Arnand appeared, dress- a ed in pure white muslin, and with a crown of white roses thrown gracefully over her  raven ringlets. She unclosed the door a just as Le Jeffreys was in the act of emp- e tying the contents of the paper into the a -glass. She saw the triumphant expres-  sion upon the countenance of the sup- g posed Marquis, and, as she comprehen- ded the toet that the glass into which it b -tas poured was the one from which Na-  'poleon had been drinking, she seemed to P understand all. A slight smile of tri-  umph flitted over her beautiful counte- e nance, as she realized that it was in her M power to foil the cunning villain. She m silently glided through the door, while t 'both of the occupants were gazing from ( the window, and, concealing her form in  -the shadow of a large curtain which fell in sweeping folds to the richly lined car-' pet, she patientlyawaited the proper mo- ment to appear. Napoleon, again seated himself at th table, and Le Jeffreys followed his exam- ple. For some moments the general ap- peared wrapped in deep thought, and, then raising his eyes to the handsome face of his companion, he asked- ' And as to Bertheir has he acquaint- el Massena, or any of the other member of the Italian army with the fact that he is yet alive land safe?' I know not' replied Le Jeffreys, but think it very probable that he has not.' 'This is a very strange story,' said Napoleon, again relapsing into his med- itative mood. He raised the glass of poisoned wine to his lips. A smile of the most triumphant meaning flitted over the face of the villain, but it was unper- ceived by Bonaparte. The edge of the glass touched the general's lips, but at this instant a form sprang from behind   the curtain, and the voice of Eugenic ex- claimed ' Taste it not, general! It is poisoned!' Bonaparte quickly dropped the glass, and gazed with surprise upon the flush- ed Countenance of Eugenie. There was a look of inquiry in his eyes, and the maiden saw that an explanation was de- sired. 'Yes, general,' said the young girl her eyes flashing fire, and her pale cheek flushed with excitement, 'that wine is POISONED I and that man who sits there, is a traitor, a conspirator and a murder- er! While you were gazing from the window, I saw him step back and mingle with that glass of wine a deadly powder, that it was meant should cause your death. But, thank heaven, I saw the deed, and will foil his base purposes.- And I will unveil his name and charac- ter, too-his name is on the records of crime-it is COUNT LUCIER, THE CON- SPIRATOR!' 'Demon in human shape! You are foiled this time!' cried Bonaparte, leap- ing towards the confounded and bewild- ,ered Count Lucier. All the lion spirit of his nature was roused, and drawing from his bosom the loaded pistol that was his constant companion, he levelled it at the heart of Count Lucier. The villain turned pale as marble, and sink- ing on his knees, raised his hands and eyes in supplication. I  O0, spare me, spare me, General Bo- naparte!' he cried, in a voice of abject I terror and entreaty. But the stern -visage of Napoleon melted not into f mercy for the wretch,-he had detcrmin- f ed that he should die,and nothing could r move him from his determination. -  'Prepare for death immediately ' e said Napoleon sternly, 'for you have t only two minutes to live!' I  And laying upon the table his elegant   watch, he counted the seconds which were to be the last of the doomed con- spirator, still keeping the pistol levelled at the heart of his victim. The coun- tenance of Count Lucier exhibited the most abject terror and despair. O, Lady Eugenie, intercede for me!' cried the terror stricken man, raising his hands in 'earnest supplication, and, fixing upon Eugenie a look of the most supplicating entreaty. But the young girl was firm; she knew it was only jus- tice that Napoleon was about to inflict, and she did not feel that the sentence which had been passed ought to be re- called. ' The time- is passed!' said the stern voice of Napoleon. 'Your time has come, perjured .villain!' An instant passed; and the sounding report of the pistol rang through the room-Count Lucier reeled, fell backwards, and ex- pired without a groan! ' Such be the fate of the whole league of conspirators,' said Bonaparte, as he reloaded the pistol and returned it to his bosom, ready to be used again upon any similar occasion. CHAPTER XIII. The spy-The Conspirators foiled, Hurra! hurra! we'll conquer them now- The sign of defeat is set on their brow, With a willing hand, and a bright keen sword, The blood of our foes shall this day be poured! E. ELLINGWOOD. IT was evening-and again Bonaparte was alone. Ashade of thought, and per- chance a slight shadow of anxiety was resting upon his fine features, and, ocq casionally is lips would move, and an ex- clamation of vexation or displeasure would escape them.  A single lamp shed its pale light around him, and served but to render all' objects more dark and gloomy, or to hide them in im- penetrable shadow. But of this Bona-   1 parte took no notice ; for the thoughts - that were occupying his mind were too I interesting to permit his attention being - claimed by anything else. A slight knock at the door startled him, and, rising from his seat, he un- closed it, and bade the visitor enter.  Ah, Pierre,' said the general, as the 1 man entered, what news do you bring tonight?" Excellent, general' replied the spy, rubbing his hands in high glee, 'the , whole league of conspirators may soon be in our power!' ' Very good indeed,' replied Napoleon, while his keen grey eyes sparkled with pleasure. 'But sit down, Pierre, and let us hear about the matter.' Pierre complied, and, as he took a seat near the only lamp that was in the room, the rays of light fell full upon his features, disclosing them to be those of the dark-looking stranger in the slouch- ed hat, whom we introduced to the read- er in the parlor of the 'Rosy Cross,' on the night when he had seemed to play the spy upon the two leaders of the con- spiracy, Mairn and Georges. 'I shall be obliged to tell you about the matter as quickly as possible,' said Pierre, who was all excitement, ' for it is time we were doing something now.' 'Very well, be as rapid as possible in your details,' returned Napoleon. In the first place,' said Pierre, speak- ing hurriedly and excitedly, ' the whole league of the conspirators will be this night assembled in the large upper chamber of the Rosy Cross. They have not th- least idea"lhat anything of their plans is suspected, much less that all is. known to you. Therefore, the whole band will be present, if possible, to con- coct plans for the future. Now as they will not break up and leave the inn until three o'clock in the morning at least, the    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6822-00000052"/> Consular Guards will have plenty of time to take a, brisk ride over to La Vendee. After they are once there, they can station themselves around the house, and when the meeting breaks up, and the conspirators begin to leave, they can quietly lay hauds on them as they come out of the house, gag them, and bind them. Those that lodge within the house can be easily taken, and thus the whole baud can be quietly secured.' 'A very 'good plan, Pierre,' said the general. 'Give myn orders to the Con- sular Guards, that they take horse im- mediately, and ride with speed for the La Vended, to apprehend the conapira tors which are to be there to-night.- They know and understand their orders. They will obey them.' 'And you-shall not you accompany them?' asked Pierre. 'No,' was the reply of the general, 'I feel somewhat indisposed to-night, an'd the guards will be able to bring the ex- pedition to a successful result, as well without as with me. But you may at- tend them, Pierre-render them all the assistance in your power, and you shall be rewarded' handsomely.' 'I think nothing of any reward, save the consciousness of having served the great General Bonaparte,' replied Pierre, with a look of devoted affection upon his much loved commander. He then pass- ed slowly from the presence of Napoleon, bowing deferentially as he closed the door and departed on his message to the Consular Guards. Fifteen minutes, perchance, had elaps- ed, when the door was again lastily opened, and the spy stood again in the presence of his general. 'Ah, Pierre-what now?' asked Na- poleon, with a look of surptise. j Only I was in such a hurry when I caie in before, that I forgot to tell you   'how I found out about the matter,' re- plied the spy, as, almost out of breath, he seated himself upon the divan for, a moment. 'You know I've been hover- ing about La Vendee this three weeks trying to find out something, but have'nt learned much of anything of importance. This afternoon, I was sitting in the. par- lor of the Rosy Cross, when a sobef, honest looking old fellow, that I had of- ten seen lounging about the streets of ,La Vendee, but had never taken any particular notice of, entered the room, and seemed disposed to scrape acquain- tance with me. There was no one in the- parlor but ourselves, so we could say what we pleased without any danger of being overheard. ITe seemed to have something on his mind that he wished to communicate to me, and I thinking it might be he had found out something about the conspirators, began to ques-. tion him, cautiously at first, and finally drew the whole story from him, after he had first exacted an oath of me that I would not betray him to the band.'. He then told me that he was a member of the league of conspirators, but that, be- coming very much dissatisfied with their plans, and knowing that they could not succeed, he had resolved to leave them entirely. He had suspected that I was a spy upon them, and so informed me of the whole plot, that I might acquaint you of the state of affairs, and you could do as you please with them. He says the organized league now numbers about tgo hundred, as many have been added to it within the last three weeks. They are to meet in the great upper chamber of the Rosy Cross to-night, and decide upon further measures for ypur assassina- tion.' 'Very well,' said Napoleon, while a strange smile passed over his fine fea- tures, 'we have no objection to their r   meeting and concocting as many plans as they please to destroy me. They'll be safe in prison before daylight. But this fellow that told you about it-where is he?' I brought him home with me, and locked him up in my room,' said Pierre. 'I did so, till you informed me what to do with him.' 'Keep him locked up till the guards come back, when, if they are successful, I will give you further orders respecting him; if they are not; lock him up in one of the dungeons, for a day or two, until'we see about the conspirators.- But what is the fellow's name?' 'He calls himself Captain Lesalle.' 'Ah, he is an old royalist. I've heard of lim before. But it is strange-that he should disclose the plot,'for he .cer- tainly is no friend to me.' ' That's true, but he has a spite against Georges, the leader of the conspirators, and he would rather you would succeed than him.' 'Ah' that's the case then. But the Guards-are they gone yet?' 'No, but they are all ready now. I must go with them, for I am'better ac- quainted with La Vendee than they. So, good night, your excellency,' said Pierre, gaily, as he bowed deferentially to the general, and left the room. Five minutes later, he sprang upon his noble jet black charger, and, with the consular guards,and three regiments of cavalry, was riding swiftly in the di- rection of La Vendee. The moon was sinking from view be- hind the western horizon, and gradually withdrawing her flood of silvery light from the spires and tree-tops of the vil- lage of La Vendee. Above, in the cold deep blue of the wintry sky, gleamed myriads of brightly-beaming stars-like the seraphic orbs of a thousand angels,   gazing down upon the sin-stained earth below, and watching over its slumbering multitudes. Dimly their pale light fell upon the village of La Vendee, and disclosed the dark figures of the soldiers, as their silent columns filed noiselessly through the deserted streets, and sta- tioned themselves around the rim of the 'Rosy Cross.' All was dark and silent-not a single light gleamed from any of the windows of the building. The blinds of the great upper chamber were all closed and fastened-and not a ray of light gleam- ed through them into the deep darkness around. Everything seemed wrapped in slumber, and all was so still and si- lent, that many of the soldiers doubted the fact of the conspirators having re- mained to that late hour. But Pierre stoutly affirmed that they were certainly there-and if they would be patient they should soon have a glorious time catching them. An hour passed on-it was now four o'clock, and still no sound had been heard from the inn. The soldiers were getting chilly by standing so long in the cold night wind, andsome were be- coming considerably vexed, while all were more or less impatient. Amongst most of them, the opinion was rife that there wasn't a conspirator in the house, and hadn't:been, that night; and that old Lesalle's story was only a hoax to draw them out, and then have them go back to, Paris with 'the very pleasing consolation that ' the bird had flown.'- But some of them still felt confident that the attempt to trap the conspirators would certainly terminate successfully; and among these few was the faithful spy, Pierre. '"The soldiers are getting decidedly uneasy,' said one of the officers, address- ing Pierre, 'and they will make so    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6822-00000053"/> much noise, that the conspirators will' hear us and be alarmed, if something is not done soon. It is past four o'clock and they will come within half an hour if at all, I think.' 'I expected they would leave before this time,' while an anxious shade' stole over his features, and he turned his eyes searchingly towards the upper windows of the large inn. A hand was laid lightly upon thei shoulder of the officer, and turnirg, he beheld the youthful secretary, St. Clair, standing beside him. Ah, my friend, said the officer, with a smile, 'you have come to aid us in our dilemma, I hope.' 'Perhaps so,' replied the young man, 'as soon as I heard you had come with the intention of taking'the conspirators, if possible, I followedyou. Fearing my horse's steps might arouse the conspira- tors, and perhaps frustrate your design, I left him some distance behind, and come on foot to see you. Have you seen no, signs of them yet?' 'None whatever,' replied Pierre, and what is worse, the soldiers have a decid- ed belief that there is not a conspirator in the building. But Captain Lesalle told me they would certainly meet to- night-and the old fellow looked as though he spoke the truth.' 'I have no doubt but he did,' replied St. Clair, with a pleasant smile at the old spy's earnestness, 'but I will ascer- tain the truth of the matter, if you will be patient for a few moments.' It took but a few moments for St. Clair to draw the long ladder that hehad used on a formei occasion, from itsplace, and to rest it against the window of the upper chambers, in one of the panes of which he had before cut an aperture with his diamond ring. Noiselessly he un- closed the shutter-and through the   thick heavy curtain gleamed a few faint rays of light. St. Clair listened for a moment at the aperture} and plainly dis- tinguished the voice of Georges. 'My friends, said the clear voice of the leader of the conspirators,' It is high time for us to separate. Our plans for the future are deeply laid, and we may rest satisfied that they will succeed. Let us think there is no such thing as failing in our attempt, and I feel satisfi- ed that we shall NOT fail. Before1 we separate, my friends, I shall require one more oath of you-and that is, that you swear Napoleon Bonaparte shall be a corpse, before our band meets again,. three weeks from hence!' For an instant, a silence like death reigned in that vast chamber-and then every sword was raised, and those deep voices were all joined in one sound:- ' WE SWEAR!'  ' And I've no doubt but the oath will be kept,' thought St. Clair, as he closed the shutter,' for Napoleon will doubtless be in his grave, long before you'll meet again!' 'The conspirators are all safe, and will be down here in a few moments,' said St. Clair to the Captain General of' the Consular Guards, as he dgcended the ladder. Two of the soldiers took it' upon their shoulders and carried it back to fts place, while St. Clair reported the result of his stratagem to the Captain General. Every one of the soldiers were soon made acquainted with the good news, by means of low whispered words from the officers. ' Now, my men!' whispered the Cap- tain General,' remember your orders! Do not let a conspirator escape! Re- member it is NAPOLEON for whom you are fighting 1J Not a word was spoken by the sol- diers-but the quick, firm grasp with   which they clenched their weapons, and the sterner light which flashed in their eyes, was enough to prove that they felt what their commander had said. Five minutes more elapsed-when the large door of the inn slowly opened, and a fig- ure, masked, and wrapped in a heavy cloak emerged from it. Before he had time to look up, he was caught by the throat, gagged, pinioned, and placed un- der the guard of a couple of soldiers, whom the captain recognized, in the dim starlight that shone around them, as two of Napoleon's Consular Guards. For a moment he gazed around upon the stern men, dressed -in full French uniform and bearing tlh insignia of Na- poleon u on their brdasts-and, in an instant, hebeemed to realize all.- ' By all th s unlucky!'1 thought the captive,' we Are all done for! These confounded soldiers will take the whole band captive, and then we shall all be at the mercy of that prince of tyrants, the First Consul I By our lady! how I wish I had never got into the scrape.' And this seemed to be the opinion of most of the otfiers, as they were, one by one, caught, gagged, and pinioned and placed in the care of the guards. But it was impossible for them to resist-for taken so by surprise, they were entirely at the mercy of the captors. Silently and surely the work was done-and as yet, not a drop of blood had been shed. As they came from the inn, one by one, they were taken by the four officers who stood on each side of the entrance, and delivered over into the hands of their comrades. Each of the conspirators was masked, and many of them carried dark lanterns, but these were instantly taken from them, and given over into the care of the soldiers. t More than a hundred of them had beep thus taken, without creating any dis-   turbance, and the soldiers were so high- ly elated with their success, that it was with difficulty they could repress the desire to express their delight by shouts of joy. But frequent orders from the Captain General prevented an outhurst from the soldiers, and still the work was 'carried on silently and surely. But now a muffled figure appeared at the entrance, and by his looks and mo- tions, the officers rightly judged that he was the last one that would leave the inn that night. A large slouched hat en- tirely concealed' his features, and in his hand he held a dark lantern, which was partially concealed by the folds of his cloak. He wore no mask, but the abund- ance of hair that fell in matted masses to his shoulders, together with his pro- fusion of greyish-red beard, sufficiently concealed his features, so that he would not have been recognized by any one, even if he had been known to them. He held in his hand a bunch of keys of all sizes, and selecting one of them by the light of his lantern, he placed it in the look of the outer door, and drawing it together after him, was about to close and lock it, when two of the officcrs laid their hands heavily upon his shoulders. The conspirator gave a sudden start,cast one lightning-like glance of his dark eyes around him, and seemed to comprehend all. With a sudden bound he sprang from their grasp, and throwing open the door he had been in the act of closing, he sprang within it. But he was pre- vented from closing it on the inside, by one of the officers, who again threw it open. 'Stand back!' cried the conspirator, it a voice of thunder, as he drew from underneath his cloak a loaded pistol, and levelled it at the officers. 'Stand back, I say!' he continued, raising his slouch- ed hat and fixing upon them an eye that    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6822-00000054"/> flashed with 'such a lightning fire that they cowed beneath it. 'Staqd back,as you value your lives! The first dne that takes a step towards me, is a. dead man ' The fear inspiring tones of the con- spirator, the eye that was bent with such a  ning flash upon them, and more an all, the black mouth of the pistol taned towards them, had its effect upon the officers, and they iesitated, each un- willing to'tke the first step forward.. The conspirator, still holding the weapon with his right hand, and keeping his lightning-like eyesfixed upon the officers, placed with his left a small silver whistle to his lips, and blew a loud and shrill call. St. Clair sprang to the side of the Captain General, and, in a low voice said, ' IT is GEORIGES I' 'How  know you that?' asked the Captain General. I know his voice, returned St. Clair, 'for I have heard it before. I have a scheme in my head to take him--I shall put it into effect immediately. If I fail in the attempt to take him, and fall by his hand, tell General Bonaparte that my last prayer was for him and my country.' And without waiting for an answer from the Captain General, the young hero turned and walked away. With a light and cautious step he approached a low window in the hall, so nearly be- hind Georges that he could not see it without turning his head, and silently and cautiously he raised the sash. It was-the work of a moment-and St. Clair sprang through the open window into the room. Silently he approached Georges, who still stood fronting the officers, with the pistol pointed towards them, not thinking there was any danger behind him. St. Clair stepped noise- lessly up-and with a sudden bound and   spring, knocked the pistol from the hand of the conspirator leader. The officers, who were prepared for the movement, now sprang forward; and after a short, but desperate struggle, in which one of the officers was wounded by the dirk of Georges, the dreaded leader of the secret league of con'spirators was secured. By this time, the remainder of the band, who had been roused by the call of Georges. were now pouring into the hall, and as many of them had heard the loud spoken words of their leader, they had come fully armed expecting that a desperate conflict awaited them. 'There were but little more than thirty of the league remaining4but these few, knowing into whose hands they must fall if con- quered. and feeling fully confident that  Napoleon would show no mercy, fought with a valor worthy of a better cause.- Several of the Consular Guards fell; and Pierre, the faithful spy, received a death-wound from the sword of the trai- tor Delaney. But the deed was soon avenged: for not more than thirty sec- onds after, a bulletfrom a pistol held'in the hands of the intrepid St. Clair, was buried in the heart of Delaney, and dhe fell back--a corpse! After a short but desperate conflict, the remainder of the band were secured, and, after giving directions with regard to the wounded, and also those who had fallen in the melee, the Captain General' arranged those under his command for returning to Paris. The prisoners, firm- ly pinioned, were placed each in the care of a guard; and again mounting their horses, the soldiers turned their faces im the direction of home, just at the day- kirigwas tinging the easterh horizon with a rich rose-glow. St. Clair, tfhe youthful hero, rode leisurely along behind the cavalcade, deeply absorbed in his own me4itatioie.   And well he might be-for among the league of. conspirators which they had taken, the one whom he had most wished to destroy had not been found-the traitor-Colonel d'Elsey. CHAPTER XIV. NAnDLEON'S COrONATION-NEW DEVELOP- MENTS-CONCLUSION. u A thousand hearts beat happily, and when Music arose with'its voluptuous swell Soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake again, -And all went merry as a marriage-bell 1" BYRON It was the 2nd of December, 1804- and a fairer day never rose over the sunny land of France. The eatheral of Notre Danme was the scene of a most glorious pageant. The Corsican Conqu- eror-the man whom all Europe looked upon as possessing powers little less than superhuman, was this day to be crowned -crowned EwPEROR OF FRANCE I A1l Paris, and indeed all France, joined in the'national rejoicings, when it was aanounced that the great conque- ror, who had so often led them on to victory, would soon be the crowned sov- ereign of France. True, Napoleon had enemies; and even now, there' WERE those, in whose inmost hearts, burned a firm resolve that Napoleon should not long live to enjoy the height of glory and power to which he had attained. The Secret League of Conspirators, who had been taken some time before at La Vendee, had been successfully brok- en up-most of them having been 6eiled from France forever, while several of  them had been executed. But the lead er-the almost invincible Georges- though condemned to li shot at an early day, had made good Ihis escape before the time set for his execution, - and all the ingenuity of Bonaparte and his al- lies had not' yet been able to trace him. D'Elsey, the murderer of the youthful   Berthier, had not been seen or heard of since the time when the conspirators had been taken. Neither had any traces been discovered of his youthful and no-' ble victim-and the remembrance of Victor Berthier was fast passing from the minds of those who had once known and loved him. But still there was a few who treasured up his image in their hearts, and in whose souls his memory could not die-a-id amoig 'those were the prospective Emperor, his noble friend St. Clair-and-Eugenic de St. Arnand, the soldier's daughter. The old cathedral of Notre Dame was filled to overflowing, with the proud- est and noblest of the land, who had as- sembled to witness the coronation of the Emperor. Wealth, beauty, and noble birth were there, and as Napoleon's eagle eye glanced over the proud assem- blage, a smile of gratified pride curled his fine lips, and gave a new beauty to his classic features. Such a noble as- semblage had rarely if ever congregated there before; for Napoleon had deter- mined that his coronation should eclipse all others that had ever before taken place in Notre Dame, in point of splen- dor and magnificence. Gorgeous indeed, were the prepara- tions that had been made for the corona- tion. From the lofty carved cornices above the large windows of richly stain- ed glass, fell heavy curtains' of royal purple velvet, splendidly embroidered with gold. In the centre of each cur- tain, was wrought the emblem of the conquerer-the spread eagle, in magnifi- cent style. Two of these curtains were, now drawn aside, and the sunlight strug- gling through the richly stained glass of the windows, fell in rainbow colored bars upon the mosaic floor of the broad aisles, and filled the whole cathedral I ith a soft and rich, yet perfectly clear    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6822-00000055"/> light. The bright beams fell with a softer radiance upon the maghificent al- tar, and were flashed back with a blind- ing brilliancy by the countless gems with which it was ornamented. Above the altar, a splendid eagle, wrought in gold, was placed,-by order of Napoleon, and evidently designed to represent the conquering hero. It was represented as standing on the colors of England and Austria, with its wings half folded, yet seemingly ready to be again spread at a moment's warning.- Its beak was upturned, and its eye fixed upon the French flag, wlhch fell in grace- ful folds above it. Upon the splendid altar, and beneath the emblematic tri- colored flag, lay the CRow N OF FRANCE- the diadem to which the ambition of Na- poleon had so long aspired. The eyes of almost every one in 'that vast assem- blage-not excepting Bonaparte himself -were fixed upon the glittering insignia of royalty-fancying that the one upon whose brow that diademt rested, must surely be the possessor of true happi- ness! Before the. altar, upon the costly car- pet of gold cloth, stood His Royal High- ness-the Pope of Rome, who had been sent forfrom Italy, to assist in the grand ceremony of the coronation. At his right hand, upon a temporary throne of the most gorgeous magnificence, that had been prepared expressly for the occasion, sat Napoleon Bonaparte-and on the the left of the First Consul, sat his wife, the lady Josephine. 'Above them was another beautiful eagle, with both wings spread wide, and bearing in its beak the banner of France. Other gorgeous and tasteful designs, intended to bring to the minds of the spectators the remarkable military talents and war-like powers of him who was so soon to be-their Emnper- or, adorned the temporary throne.   Ar6und the throne, and w h their heads uncovered in the presen e of their sovereign, stood the stern old enerals who had fought so faithfully side by side with the Corsican Conqueror. Nearest to him, and evidently held in the highest regard, stood the elder General Berther, and by his side was Lannes, the brave hero of the bloody field of MontebelloT. Near them stood his late colleagues in the consulate, Cambacires and Le Brun -while in a group directly behind them, Soult, Ney, Davoust and .Murat, were standing with folded arms. Caulincourt and Bernadotte were carrying on a con- yersa^on in low whispers, at a short dis- tance, while near them, Kellerman, Mor- tier and Bessieres were discussing the probable effect of the present measures upon the policy of England. Moncey, Massena, Angereau, Duroc, and anuame her of others, tried and true friends of Bonaparte, were standing near the throne, gazing with listless eyes upon the wealth of splendor and magnificence around. Standing alone at the richly curtained window nearest the throne, and leaning, his head heavily upon his hand, was the youthful secretary, St. Clair. Pale as marble were the finely 'chiselled lips of the young man, and instead of the pi- quant expression that had once charac- terized them, there was now around them a shadow of deep and settled sorrow. And in the dark expressive eyes, the same look of melancholy and grief was visible, plainly showing that there rest- ed upon the heart within a weight of deep and untold sorrow.' The graceful form of the young secretary was attenu- ated almost to a shadow, and the hand upon which he was wearily resting his head, was so thin and white that it seem- ed almost transparent. An anxious glance from the fine eyes of the Eamper-   or was occasionally bent upon'the young c secretary-for Napoleon felt that the c noble St. Clair was fast sinking into the  tomb, beneath a weight of seep heart- sorrow-and the Emperor felt that with  him, he should lose a true and noble  friend.  On the left hand of the throne, stand- ing in groups and couples, were the rela- tions of Napoleon-the IMPERIAL FAMiI- "Y. And standing in the shadow of the splendidly embroidered curtain behind them, and gazing. with' an interested glance upon the face of the youthful sec- retary, St. Clair, was one who seemed to be a stranger to them all-and one whose dress and appearance seemed rather out of place amid such a scene of splendor; It is needless to give the reader a de-' scription of the personage-for he is a character that we have before met in our tale-the conspirator, St. Aubert. There is the same unsightly deformity; the same brilliant dark eyes, and coarse shaggy raven hair-but his dress is some- what different. An ample overcoat, but- toned closely in front, enshrouded his person, and over his shaggy locks was thrown a large Spanish sombrero, with a splendid snow-white p!ume. It was strange that HE should be 'at the corona- tion of the Emperor, but he was there for purposes of his own, which we shall soon be made acquainted with. Near the centre of the cathedral, and directly under a mAginificent silken ban- ner that had been supended from the lofty dome, sat three men, dressed in the rich costumes of Italian nobles. They were not strangers to the company--the tall, elegant, dark-eyed young man, was well known in the higher circles of Par- isian society, as the Count de Lariviere, -an Italian noble of wealth and blood. The one who sat beside him, with the insinuating smile plhying around his well   cut lips, was the duke La Rothere. The other, a large, muscular man, somewhat past middle age, was the Viscount deo Montmarelle. True, there was nothing very singular about these men, that we should bring them before the eye of the reader-but these characters are neces- sary to conclude our story. But the ceremonies of the coronation were now to commen'ce, and every eye in the vast cathedral was turned upon Naipoleon. With a slow and majestic step, Napoleon descended from his throne, leading Josephine by the hand, and stood before the magnificent altar. A silence like death reigned through the vast cathedral, while with his hands upon the Bible, and his eyes upturned, the Emperor repeated his coronation oath. But in the act of coronation itself, there was a marked deviation from the universal custom, characteristic of the man, the age, and the conjuncture. In all other similar solemnities, the crown had beeA placed on the sovereigi's head by the presiding spiritual person, as re- presenting the Deity, by whom princes rule. But not even from the head of the Catholic Church, would Bonaparte con- sent to receive as a boon the golden sym- bol of sovereignty, which he was sensible he owed entirely to his own unparalleled train of military and civil successes. His own great talents had won for him the diadem of France, and he was determined that the head of the See of Rome, whom he had more than once humbled and impoverished, and again r restored to power, should not place upon his brow the diadem of royalty. i  In a subdued and solemn tone, the - glittering crown was now blessed by the, ,Pope, and Napoleon advanced a step forward, and took the diadem from the e altar with his own hands. Slowly he 1 raised the insignia of royalty to the place    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6822-00000056"/> where it was henceforth to rest-and a moment after, the CRoN OF o FRANCE glittered upon the brow of the EMPEROr, NAPOLEONI  Grand and sublime arose the majestic notes of the TE DEUMr upon the air, and as the solemn music filled the vast cathe- dral, a feeling of silent awe wrapped it- self around the hearts of the high-born company assembled. The solemn tones at length ceased-and the heralds, step- ping forth from their places, proclaim- ed- 'The thrice glorious and thrice august Napoleon, EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, is i crowned and installed!' For a moment more, a death-like si- lence reigned-and then a shout from the whole assembled multitude, that shook the very walls of the vast old ca. thedral, rang upon the air- ' V1VE L'EMPEI EUR ur!' And now, for the first time since the ceremony had commenced, the conspira- tor who had stood in the shadow of the curtain, turned his searching dark eyes from the face of Napoleon. Stepping  back farther behind the sweeping folds  of the ample curtain, he slowly unbut- toned the large overcoat, which enshroud-  ed his person. Then throwing it back ] from his shoulders, he drew it off-and t strange to say, the unsightly hump came 9 with it, leaving his form one of perfect  symmetry! Then taking off the plumed a sombrero, and with it the shaggy black i: WIG, he threw them upon the mosaic p floor with the overcot--disclosing a no-  bly shaped head, and classic brow, shad- s ed by short, beautiful crisp curls, of raven blackness. Then drawing a handker- e. chief from his pocket, he removed from si his features the dark dye that had given al him such a southern shade-and -there da stood the conspirator, after the strange transformation, a very handsome young tE   a man, dressed in the rich- uniform of a E French General! r  With a stately and majestic step the young man left his place behind the cur- e, tain, and walking up to the throne on i which sat Napoleon and his Empress, he - knelt gracefully before it, and in a fine ;- rich voice, said- n  'My sovereign! with a full heart I 3 now kneel before thee, and solemnly - promise that now, as ever, I will give my  heart, hand, and sword to protect 'thee and my country!' t  For a moment after he had ceased speaking, the eagle eye of the Emperor was fixed in a soul-searching gaze upon the countenance of the young man be- fore him. Then starting up, he raised the kneeling youth to his feet, and gazing for an instant'into the noble countenance, he exclaimed- 'Good God!  It is VICTOn BERITH- IER ' 'Yes, my   Emperor,' returned the young man, 'it is Victor Berthier.' ' But how-when-where-why, Gen- eral Berthier, we thought you was dead, long ago!' exclaimed a dozen voices. ;But you see I am alive again,' re- plied the young man, with a smile, and Iwill give you an account of my adven- tures, but first I have a duty to perform. That man,' he continued, pointing to the Count de Lariviere, who, as well as the other two Italian nobles, had sprung up in alarm and terror, at the strange ap- paration, 'that man, your highness, is COLONEL D'ELSEY, the traitor and con- spirator!' 'Infamous traitor! cried the suppos- ed Count, in a paroxysm of rage and do spair, as he drew a pistol from his bosom and levelled it at Berthier; 'take thy death you deserve 1' The' sharp report of the pistol rang through the cathedral, and missing its   aim, it whizzed past the young man, and  flying tough one of the small diamond shaded panes of the window behind him, shivered it into a thousand fragments. In an instant a loaded pistol was in the  hands of Bertnier, and levelling it at his  enemy, h fired, and the ball, with uner- ring aim, was buried in d'Elsey's heart!  He fell back, a corpse. 'So perish all enemies to Napoleon!' said Berthier. 'And now these two other villains must be taken care of-for the one whom you have known as the Duke La Rothiere, is GEorGES) the lead- er of the old League of Conspirators! And the Viscount de Blontmarelle is another villainous conspirator ' ' Arrest both the villains i' cried Na- poleon, ia his sternest tone, while his eagle eyes flashed with a lightning fire. Take them to the darkest and strongest dungeons of the city ' His order was obeyed-and Georges - and his confederate were led off by the guards. 'And now, my friends,' said Victor, again turning to the wondering generals, listen to me a very few moments, and I will explain. I shall be very brief-for I need not dwell long upon the incidents. The villain d'Elsey, who has just paid 'the penalty for his mis-deeds, was the cause of my leaving you sq suddenly, now nearly two years since. He met me one night on the bank of the Seine, in- flic ted upon me what he supposed to be a mortal wound, and threw the senseless body into the river. The icy coldness of the water revived me, and I managed to keep above water until the waves floated me to the other side of the river, when I again relapsed into insensibility. In this state I was found by a peasant, and taken to his humble cottage. For three ivceks I continued in :a very criti- cal state-but thanks to the kind care   of thqpeasant's wife, land the excellent surgical knowledge of the peasant him- self, I recovered. The wound given -me by d'Elsey was not such a severe one as he had intended it to be, for his sword glanced against one of the ribs, and did not take the exact course to give me a mortal wound. I did not recover until long after the conspirators had been taken' and G(eorges escaped. 'And now a new plan presented itself to my mind. I resolved to seek out Georges, and apprehend him, before I again presented myself before General Bonaparte. By the merest accident, I found him, and ascertained, also, that he, with d'Elsey, and another reckless villain, were engaged in a deep laid plot for the assassination of Napoleon. Under another name, and a most effectual dis- guise, I became a member of their band, and was admitted to all their counsels. I more readily gained their confidence, for I had been a member of the other league, as aspy upon their actions,though they suspected it not. I have lcarn)t all their plans, all their disguises, and all their secrets-and I decided that TO-DAY was a fitting time to make myself known, and also to crush and destroy th'em.-- Thus, my noble Sovereign, though you knew it not, I have been faithfully ser- ving you, during my long absence 1' The Emperor spoke not, but the glance of pride and affection which he cast upon the young hero, told volumes. Turning to the elder General Berthier, he took from his hands an emblem which was conferred only on the most noble. - Placing the blazoned star upon the breast of Victor Berthier, the Emperir said- 'Well worthy art thou, my noble sub- ject, of the cross of the legion of honor. I place it upon thy breast as a token of my gratitude' for thy noble services.' 'My sovereign,' said Victor, sinking    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6822-00000057"/> t  ^I17IOy on one knee, I *i  ever ba e thee, or -this noble emblem.- : Gi' 'he continued, rising, 'I have one 'more duty to"perform--and a pleasant one it is to me.' ' St. Clir, who at the first appearance of the young general had fainted, but had' now recovered, stepped forward at a sign from Berthier.

Now go and array yourself in the garments befitting your sex, and before the sun sets His Highness the Pope shall join our hands at the altar. And then, with full hearts, we can but join in the swell- ing cry- VIVE L' EMPEREUR -'   THE END.     </p>
