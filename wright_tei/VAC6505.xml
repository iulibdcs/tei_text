               <p>THE happy sunlight of a morning early in July threw itself boldly into the embrace of a cluster of maples, in the tasteful grounds of a ladies' seminary in fair 'New England, and peeping through the veil of trembling leaves with which the stately trees were decked, coquetted gaily with the shadows beneath, and in wanton mirthfulness gazed into the laughing eyes of the lovely cluster of girls grouped in every variety of picturesque attitude upon the green sward below, kissed the rosy lips and cheeks of one and another<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6505-00000005"/> other, and crowned the fair young heads with diadems brilliant as molten gold.</p>
               <p>A soft breeze woke the sighing leaves to music, and lifted the flowing tresses of the happy party of girls, while now and then a rippling laugh, ringing clearly upon the still morning air, rivalled in its sweetness the triumphant songs of bright-winged birds, swinging gaily from their cradles above, and thrilling all the balmy air with witching melody.</p>
               <p>Beyond the extended view of lawn and garden loomed the "argus-eyed" building which had been the dwelling-place of several of them for many years, its white walls glistening in the rays of the morning sun, while the thick dark leaves of the ivy that festooned many of the open casements, glittered as if crested with all manner of precious stones, as the gathered drops of dew caught the reflected glory of the gorgeous old monarch of day, riding serenely above in his chariot of concentrated fire.</p>
               <p>The central figure of the group seated beneath the whispering maples, was a tall brunette, robed like her companions, in the ordinary school-dress of neat print, with small white collar, and coquettish apron of the same snowy hue, in which was gathered a quantity of beautiful flowers still glistening with the dews of morning, and which threatened to leave her dainty apron in anything but a spotless condition.</p>
               <p>Flowers of every hue and variety, whose mingled fragrance rendered the air they were breathing heavy with perfume, reposed in delightful confusion in her hastily improvised basket, but her. slender fingers were rapidly assorting and distributing them to her companions, the while her merry tongue kept time with her active hands.</p>
               <p>Queenly in figure, haughty in feature, and dominant in character, she was a leading spirit in all the mischief that had been planned and executed during the past 'months and years of busy school routine; but, like a number of her fellow pupils, she would, ere the day should close, receive her certificate of graduation, and bidding farewell forever to the merry days of school girl life, anxiously await what the future might have in store.</p>
               <p>She was seated on a large, moss-covered boulder, looking in her proud uprightness of figure every inch a queen, while her companions were disposed around her as fancy or indolence might suggest, awaiting patiently her distribution of the floral treasures with which her lap was filled. Some were leaning carelessly against the massive tree-trunks around, one or two were half reclining on the ground, regardless of the light dew that still gemmed the verdant sward, their elbows buried in the long, rank grass, and their dimpled chins resting on their soft pink palms, while one sweet girl, the youngest and fairest of the group, leaned over the Queen Flora of the occasion, pulling the long tresses that floated over her shoulders, pinching the cheeks already pink with the rosy flushes of health, or snatching from her apron handfuls of the beautiful flowers it held, and shaking the dew-drops that lingered in their cups all over the haughty but now smiling face, while Helen alternately laughed and scolded, as her little favorite<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6505-00000006"/> vorite each moment devised some new method of teasing.</p>
               <p>Fair and fragile as the flower whose name she bore, sweet Lillie Danforth was still full of life and merriment, and a general favorite in the school; while the proud Helen Harrington, although in all respects so totally unlike her, was her bosom friend and confidant.</p>
               <p>"Helen, my Queen," she murmurs, in the midst of a shower of kisses which totally interrupts the sentence on her companion's lips, "violets and rose-buds for me, you know; 'sweet violets heavy with dew.'"</p>
               <p>"Keep still, you saucy girl, or you shall have nothing but a daisy and dandelion. Maud, can't you keep this child quiet for five minutes, while I finish assorting these flowers? She torments me half to death!" said Helen, addressing one of the monitors of the school.</p>
               <p>Maud shrugged her shoulders expressively, but made no reply, while the "child" in question twined her arms around the neck of the scolding girl, and leaning a pink and white cheek against the darker one at her side, said caressingly, "Now, Helen, <emph>don't</emph> be cross with me, and I'll be the goodest little girl as never was; and you shall have poppies and marigolds for your own dusky tresses, but violets and rosebuds for me, you know, my Queen!" and a hug which half strangled the girl completed the sentence.</p>
               <p>"There, there! do take your violets and rosebuds, and give me a minute's peace!" exclaimed Helen, half petulantly and half laughingly, as she began hastily pulling out, and tossing on the ground, rich clusters of the flowers in question.</p>
               <p>"There! Lillie," she added, "that will give you something to do, to pick them up; and you know Satan always provides mischief for idle hands. That's what the trouble is with you, I fancy. Here, Maud, are pansies for you, heliotrope for Annie, and roses for you, my 'queen rose of the rose-bud garden of girls.' Fannie, what will you have, pinks or poppies? By-the-way, where is Berrie Burton this morning, and what shall I keep for her?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Berrie is poring over her lessons, as usual," returned Maud. "The poor child learns with such difficulty, and she is so afraid she will not pass the examination creditably to-day, and receive her diploma. It <emph>would</emph> be too bad if she should fail, she has tried so hard to keep up with her class."</p>
               <p>"Oh! what does it matter if she doesn't graduate with special honor? She is highly accomplished in music, and with her pretty face, and her father's money, her future is certain to be a happy one, whether she knows that two and two make four, or not. Oh, dear! I wish I had been born rich instead of handsome!" with an impatient shrug of her sloping shoulders. "A schoolma'am's destiny is not delightful in prospective, whatever the reality may prove."</p>
               <p>"Beauty and wealth do not always bring happiness, Helen, they say; and your destiny, after all, may prove even more enviable than Berrie's. Some gallant knight will come along and rescue you from the school-room before long, perhaps," laughingly. "Send me an invitation to the wedding, will you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you shall be chief bridesmaid, Miss Maud,<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6505-00000007"/> and the sooner he makes his appearance the better. If you come across any one with plenty of money, who is desirous of throwing himself away, just send him over to me. But I <emph>do</emph> envy Berrie sometimes, her future seems so very bright. But what would she like for flowers, do you think? how will this scarlet geranium do?"</p>
               <p>"Admirably! it will just suit her. But hark! there is the eight o'clock bell, Helen Harrington; we shall be dreadfully late;" and gathering up her dress to protect it from the still damp grass of the lawn, the speaker ran swiftly toward the house, followed speedily by her companions.</p>
               <p>Let us enter the large exhibition hall of the seminary some hours later, and take a quiet view of its inmates and the proceedings then in operation. The visitors' seats are filled to overflowing, and although a large number of extra chairs have been brought in, to accommodate the influx of lookers-on, many are yet standing, and those who were fortunate enough to obtain sittings are crowded to the utter exclusion of comfort; for these annual exhibitions of W—— Seminary have been for many years deservedly popular.</p>
               <p>The dewy loveliness of the morning has developed into a sulky, sunburned day, and windows are thrown to their widest extent to catch the faintest breath of air that may be stirring, while innumerable fans keep in a continual tremulous flutter the floating laces and ribbons that adorn their fair owners. The air is exceedingly oppressive, and heavy with the fragrance that floats from the drooping flowers which not only deck the fair members of the school, but are placed in every available spot in the spacious apartment; while many of the broad window-seats are covered with pots of scented plants or trailing vines, which, climbing to the very apex of the lofty casement, lean down to caress their lowlier neighbors, or bask in the ardent rays of the sun, as it peeps through the open window, and drops its golden gleams athwart the blush and bloom below.</p>
               <p>The pupils of the school are ranged on elevated seats, erected for the occasion on either side the platform, the youngest on the uppermost, while on the lowest yet most conspicuous seats in the room are placed the graduating class, ten in number, awaiting with eagerly beating hearts, flushed cheeks, and sparkling eyes, the awarding of the prizes for the year, and the hardly won diplomas, which should sever forever their connection with the witching days of school-life. For who does not know that even the discipline and routine of school has a subtle charm all its own, and the memory of which no after triumphs can render aught but pleasant and delightful!</p>
               <p>Who looks not back to the days spent in the pursuit of knowledge with a tremulous smile of pleasure at the recollection, a sigh of regret for the bursting of the airy bubbles of fancy which had then seemed as substantial as beautiful, or a tear for the friends then so intimate and dear, of whom "Some are married and some are dead?" Who does not remember with a touch of the old amusement, some daring broach of discipline or mad prank in the hush of night, when<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6505-00000008"/> they were supposed to be sleeping the sweet sleep of youth and innocence; or, with a thrill of the olden pleasure, those golden days when, with trembling hearts and cheeks a-flush with triumph, they proudly stepped to the master's desk to receive the precious prize which amply rewarded them for their previous hours of toil and application.</p>
               <p>At the head of the graduating class of to-day sits our queenly acquaintance of the morning, Miss Helen Harrington; her dark hair bound in heavy coils around her shapely head, her haughty mouth dimpling with smiles of gratification and pleasure, and her regal form robed in simple white, unornamented, save by the broad sash of pink and the lovely carnations of the same hue that loop her dress and nestle among the bands of her lustrous purple-black tresses. Jewels of the purest water and most magnificent settings would become her royally; nor does the simplicity of her present attire proceed from an aversion to the ornaments that most young girls admire and covet. She is no exception to her companions in this respect, but, unfortunately, as she has intimated in the conversation of the morning, her means are limited, and forbid the accessories to beauty which her taste would suggest and crave. Nothing would satisfy her ambition save the rarest and purest gems, and as these are absolutely unattainable, she will wear no ornaments save the beautiful blossoms which Nature, with such lavish hand, showers around her.</p>
               <p>She is the only child of a widowed mother, who was left to a life of loneliness in the flush of youth and happiness, and who has been enabled only by much exertion to give her daughter the necessary education to fit her for teaching, that she may lighten somewhat the burden of poverty which has been theirs for so many years. As may be supposed, the proud girl looked forward with anything but pleasure to the day when she must assume the duties of school-mistress, although at the same time she felt impatient to be able in some degree to assist one who had made so many sacrifices for her, and spared no love or labor that could conduce to her future welfare and happiness.</p>
               <p>Maud Lester, the second in rank in the graduating class, is a brown-haired, brown-eyed, graceful girl, with no claims to the beauty which is the exception rather than the rule, but with a face pleasing for its intelligence and usual expression of grave yet captivating sweetness. Her parents are in comfortable circumstances, and she has never known a real want ungratified; yet her tastes are simple, and her ambitions legitimate and innocent. She is a sweet girl, mild in temper, quiet in manner, and with great depth of character, and truth and firmness of principle. She, also, is simply dressed, in some thin material of a pale-lavender hue, with the pansies Helen had selected for her in the morning drooping from her hair and the bosom of her delicate, close-fitting dress.</p>
               <p>Little Lillie Danforth is not in the group, as she is to remain still another year as pupil in the school her companions are leaving to-day.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the graduating class are all children of wealthy parents, but, with one exception, having<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6505-00000009"/> ing no part to play in the forthcoming narrative, need no particular mention here. They are fashionably dressed and resplendent with jewelry—brooches, ear-drops, lockets, chains, bracelets, and rings flash in the afternoon sunlight, as now and then a stray beam shoots athwart their forms.</p>
               <p>The exception before mentioned is my heroine, Miss Berrie Burton, casually referred to by her fellow-pupils in the morning, but not as yet introduced to the special notice of the reader.</p>
               <p>I can close my eyes now and see before me the face and form of one seen but rarely, yet never forgotten—for the picture I shall paint is no vision of the imagination, however fictitious may be the scenes and incidents related in connection therewith, but the imperfect sketch of one I scarcely knew, and whose face first met my eye in a scene similar to the one I have been attempting to describe.</p>
               <p>A form somewhat below the medium height, yet beautifully moulded and rounded; hands and feet of diminutive proportions; a small, grave face, nearly oval in contour, and of a clear, untinted olive in coloring; a small, sweet mouth, with slightly pouting lips of a vivid crimson, which every one who knew her had an irresistible desire to kiss; and eyes of a lustrous black, large, full, and expressive, shaded by lashes of the same sable hue. Too large for beauty, some maintained they were, yet capable of a softness and sweetness of expression very attractive at least, and to some decidedly captivating. But her crowning beauty was her wealth of soft dark hair, which swept her dusky shoulders in countless numbers of ringlets, bright, and smooth, and flossy as rolls of unwoven silk. No description can do justice to its marvellous beauty, and no other head I have ever seen has been so royally, peerlessly crowned.</p>
               <p>She was dressed in a light plaid silk of neutral tints, with low bodice and short, lace-edged sleeves, and whose severe simplicity was unmarred by ornament of any style or description. Not a jewel glittered on her taper, pink-tipped fingers, on her smooth round arms, or fair uncovered neck; not a flower blushed in her floating hair, or on her pulsing bosom; not a ribbon fluttered from any portion of her attire; but she sat there, that golden afternoon, among her gaily decked companions, ornamented alone by the peerless jewel of her own rare loveliness.</p>
               <p>As has been intimated, she was no scholar, although not wanting in application and a desire to excel, and it was only by continued and extra effort that she had been able to keep pace with her companions, except in music, of which she was passionately fond, and which was as easy for her as were her simplest tasks to her compeers. She had a clear, sweet voice, of no marvellous power or compass, but which she used so naturally and unaffectedly one could not choose but be charmed. The piano was to her a dear companion, and few young ladies of her age and instruction presided at it with so much of grace and skill.</p>
               <p>But the exhibition is swiftly approaching the close. Lessons have been recited, declamations have been appreciatively listened to, essays have been read, songs<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6505-00000010"/> have been sung, and now but a few more exercises intervene before the distribution of prizes and awarding of diplomas to the graduating class of to-day.</p>
               <p>"CARRYING HOME THE SHEAVES.—<emph>Miss Maud Lester,</emph>" announces the master, and the young lady comes forward, and with exquisite intonation, and voice modulated to the plaintive sweetness of the words, reads, amid the breathless hush of the audience, the beautiful little poem: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"List! oh, list to the reapers this quiet summer eve,</l>
                        <l>Gathering in the harvest, binding up the sheaves.</l>
                        <l>List to the rush of the sickle, cutting the golden grain;</l>
                        <l>Sinewy hands and hardy wield them not in vain.</l>
                        <l>Deep in the valley the sunset glows on the glistening leaves,</l>
                        <l>Shines on the dark-browed maidens carrying home the sheaves.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Kissed by the breeze and the sunshine, loved by the flowers and birds,</l>
                        <l>Heart in whose wild recesses beautiful dreams are stirred,</l>
                        <l>Stands the fairest of reapers, red lips slightly apart,</l>
                        <l>While gushes of plaintive music flow from her o'ercharged heart.</l>
                        <l>Sings she, 'Oh, life is dreary here on these summer eves,</l>
                        <l>I grow so weary, weary, carrying home the sheaves.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"'For the whirling rush of the sickles, quivering through my brain,</l>
                        <l>Stirs up a world of fancies, never to sleep again.</l>
                        <l>I dream of courts and castles, gateways of gold and pearls,</l>
                        <l>Laurel wreaths proudly resting on the brow of the peasant girl.</l>
                        <l>Life is so very dreary here on these summer eves,</l>
                        <l>I grow so weary, weary, carrying home the sheaves!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"'Thoughts that are blight, yet painful, struggle within my breast;</l>
                        <l>Life is both sweet and baneful—I am not like the rest.</l>
                        <l>Would I could <emph>word</emph> my longings, sunder this weary chain,</l>
                        <l>Fly from this quiet valley, these sheaves of golden grain!</l>
                        <l>Life is so very dreary here on these summer eves,</l>
                        <l>I grow so weary, weary, carrying home the sheaves.'</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Maiden, thou art not lonely; many like thee there are,</l>
                        <l>Stifling their aspirations, still with their souls at war.</l>
                        <l>All through this life's great harvest wander a sorrowing train,</l>
                        <l>Knowing full well their mission, but wearing a clogging chain.</l>
                        <l>Many the hearts that are saying, this quiet summer eve,</l>
                        <l>'Oh, I am weary, weary, carrying home the sheaves!'</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Maiden, we all are reapers, workers in this great strife;</l>
                        <l>Let us not then be sleepers, but on to the spirits' life.</l>
                        <l>
                           <emph>God</emph> hears our cry, my sister, He will gather the ripened grain</l>
                        <l>Up in His broad heaven-garner, where life will be free from pain.</l>
                        <l>Wait, with no thought of sadness, till on some heavenly eve,</l>
                        <l>Come we with songs of gladness, carrying home the sheaves."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The rapt hush of the audience for some moments after the last word had thrilled with its plaintive music the balmy summer air, testified even more thoroughly to their appreciation of the poem and its exquisite rendering, than did the perfect storm of applause that succeeded. A few strains of music hushed the tumult at last, and after an elaborate prelude, Miss Berrie Burton, with unaffected grace and witching sweetness of expression, sang the then popular and beautiful air, "When the swallows homeward fly." Then followed the valedictory by Miss Helen Harrington, which by its forceful eloquence and touching allusions to the hour of parting won the admiration of all, and drew a tear from many a sparkling eye.</p>
               <p>When the applause which succeeded had at length died out, the master arose, and in a few well-chosen<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6505-00000011"/> words, and voice tremulous with emotion, expressed his gratification at the credit they had done him during the hours of exhibition, and his regret at parting with so many of his pupils, to whom, in the past years of intimate association, he had become so greatly attached. Then announces his pleasure in presenting to the successful competitors the prizes before him, of which Miss Helen Harrington heads the list and receives the first awards for English essay and general scholarship, Miss Maud Lester deservedly receives the Elocutionary prize, and Miss Berrie Burton, to her intense surprise—for in her modesty she has never dreamed of being so honored—is called forward to be presented with an elegantly bound musical album, for her manifest superiority in vocal and instrumental music. Then each of the young ladies of the graduating class receives her diploma, a prayer closes the exercises, and the pupils mingle with the visitors to receive the congratulations of friends on the success of the afternoon's entertainment.</p>

               <p>SOFTLY felt the veil of night over the beautiful town 'of Bristol, R. I., wrapping in its misty loveliness the heaving waters of the bay, the luxurious foliage of the countless numbers of noble old trees, whose branches often interlaced above the broad and regular streets of the handsome old town, the fine residences of the aristocratic portion of its denizens, and the tasteful gardens around them, whose blushing beauties seemed to exhale a richer fragrance as the dews of evening moistened their velvet lips, and the darkness hid from sight their loveliness of form and color.</p>
               <p>In the parlor of a handsome house on one of the finest<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6505-00000012"/> est streets, was gathered a group of persons whose fortunes are somewhat intimately interwoven with the lot of those to whom the reader has already been introduced in the few preceding pages.</p>
               <p>A lady somewhat past the middle age of life, was seated in an easy chair near one of the open windows; her busy fingers occupied with some fancy knitting which seemed to employ her thoughts as well as her hands, as she kept her still handsome dark eyes fixed intently upon her work. A round matronly figure it was, swaying back and forth in the easy rocker, the brow placid and smooth, and the lips wearing a pleasant, but apparently pre-occupied smile. In truth her thoughts were far away from the present scene, with motherly pride and affection dwelling on her absent loved ones; her eldest born and only son, who had left the paternal roof in search of fortune and fame as a lawyer in the distant Tri-mountain city, and her absent daughter, who would that day have completed her education, and whom she might hope, ere the shades of another purple twilight hushed to sleep the hurry and tumult of busy day, to hold in her arms once more with a mother's fondness of welcome and joy.</p>
               <p>At the opposite casement, perched on the low window-seat, was a little girl of some eight or ten summers, betraying in her dusky complexion, her soft dark hair which fell in heavy curls on her shoulders, and the uplifted eyes of lustrous black, her relationship not only to the lady opposite, but to one of the graduates of W. Seminary, at whose closing exercises we were recently present. The little girl was dressed in white, with sash and ribbons as scarlet as her own sweet lips, and betrayed in every word and motion how thoroughly she had been spoiled by every member of the family circle.</p>
               <p>Seated by her, and alternately teasing and talking to her, was a gentleman of about thirty-five years; tall, well-proportioned, and somewhat distinguished in appearance, with an abundance of light waving hair, large, dreamy blue eyes, and a heavy, light-hued mustache, shading lips whose expression and smile were so rarely sweet and fascinating as to soften somewhat the lines of sternness and hauteur which were plainly discernible in other portions of his aristocratic face. Yet a shade of sadness sometimes darkened the blue of his dreamy eyes, and sweeping over the handsome Saxon face, hardened the sweetness of the lips into an expression of rigid weariness and pain, until <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"You marvelled if a face so sad,</l>
                        <l>At any time had smiled."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Just now we see him in his most attractive guise, as he unbends from his usual dignity to his little companion, while smiles of amusement light his handsome eyes, as he listens to her merry prattle and apt returns to his teasing remarks.</p>
               <p>Across the room, seated at the piano and running her fingers carelessly across the keys in an absent or preoccupied manner, is the eldest daughter of the house, Miss Isabel Burton, who, though decidedly attractive in manner, possesses little of the beauty which is lavished so freely on both her younger sisters. Her hair<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6505-00000013"/> is fine and dark, but banded smoothly back from a somewhat low brow; her eyes are less beautiful in form or coloring than those of either of her sisters; and her mouth, though ripe and rosy, is a trifle too wide for beauty. Still, she is pleasing and attractive, and has never experienced a want of friendship or attention from either of the sexes.</p>
               <p>Leaning against the instrument, and conversing with her in low and flattering tones, is a gentleman much younger than the one beside the window, and in every respect totally his opposite. Dark, full bearded, of medium height and size, and with a flattering and deferent manner so pleasing to most of the opposite sex, he was exceedingly popular in society, and for his gay good-humor a welcome guest in nearly every home-circle which he chose to enter.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Adair, if you don't stop pulling my curls, I'll tell my mamma," said the little beauty at the window; "and she'll, she'll—"</p>
               <p>"Well, <emph>what</emph> will she do, do you think, Miss Hattie?" inquired her companion, with another playful pull of the tempting ringlets.</p>
               <p>"Box your ears, I guess, as she threatens to do to me when I step on the flowers, or tear my dress, or drop my jelly on the table-cloth.</p>
               <p>"I suppose she <emph>only</emph> threatens, eh?" returned the gentleman, laughing.</p>
               <p>"That's all!" with a lowered tone and arch glance across at her mother. "Because you see when there is a prospect of anything else, I run away, and the next time she sees me she has forgotten all about it. Belle scolds me too, sometimes, but Berrie never does. Do you know my sister Berrie, Mr. Adair?"</p>
               <p>"I haven't that honor, Miss Hattie! What sort of a berry is she? a straw-berry, black-berry, holly-berry, or what?"</p>
               <p>"She isn't <emph>either!</emph>" returned Miss Hattie, pouting at this ridicule of her favorite sister. "She's a real pretty young lady! prettier than Belle, or Jennie Wardell, or I either! She's the very prettiest of the family, everybody says, and I love her dearly."</p>
               <p>"Prettier than you, is she?" said her companion, highly amused. "Well, that might be and not be <emph>very</emph> pretty, might it not, Miss Vanity?" and again the flowing curls received a gentle pull.</p>
               <p>"Belle Burton, <emph>isn't</emph> Berrie real handsome?" called the indignant child; and her sister arose and came smilingly forward at the summons.</p>
               <p>"What's the trouble, Hattie?" she inquired. "Are you and Mr. Adair quarrelling again, as usual?"</p>
               <p>The gentleman smiled as he returned: "This young lady maintains that she has a sister Berrie who is decidedly the flower of the family, and is highly indignant because I presumed to suggest that she might be even prettier than Miss Hattie herself, and yet not be <emph>very</emph> beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Hattie is very fond of her sister, and has an exalted opinion of her beauty; I believe she <emph>is</emph> generally considered very pretty," replied Miss Burton, smilingly.</p>
               <p>"Then he said, too, that she was a black-berry, or holly-berry, or something!" pouted the child.</p>
               <p>"Well, she <emph>is</emph> rather dark like the rest of us, that's a<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6505-00000014"/> fact!" returned Belle, with a little musical laugh. "And holly-berry wouldn't be so bad a name for her either. So don't pout, Hattie dear! Don't you know Mr. Adair is only teasing you? Wait until your sister is at home, and perhaps he will admire her as much as you desire."</p>
               <p>"Is the young lady expected soon?" he inquired, indifferently.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! we hope to see her to-morrow evening. She has been in Massachusetts at school for some time, and expects to graduate to-day. Mamma and I wished very much to attend the exhibition, but could not leave home very well just at this time. You are sure to like my sister, Mr. Wright!" she continued, abruptly turning to the gentleman who had followed her from the piano, and was then standing near her, playing with her fan, which he had taken from the table.</p>
               <p>"I have not a doubt of it," he returned somewhat lazily. "She must be pretty and agreeable also, to judge from the remainder of the family, whose acquaintance I am so fortunate as to have made. Don't you think so, eh, Miss Hattie?"</p>
               <p>"If I say 'yes,' Mr. Adair will call me Miss Vanity. Oh, there's pa!" and with a bound she was out the window, and running down the walk was lifted up to receive the expected kiss, and then with her hand in his, walked demurely by her father's side as he approached the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton was a tall, pleasant, intellectual-looking man of some fifty-five years, and as he entered the parlor lor, and having greeted his daughter's visitors, drew a chair near his wife and sat down with Hattie on his knee, he said, "Well, wife, I suppose we may expect to see Berrie here with us to-morrow night. I hope she will have passed a good examination to-day. We'll be glad to see her home again, won't we, pet? She has been gone a long time."</p>
               <p>"Pa, may I go to the depot with you? I can't wait till she gets way up to the house before I see her. May I, pa? Oh dear! I wish she was coming to-night! Say, pa, may I?"</p>
               <p>"Why yes, dear. I don't know why you shouldn't, if your mother is willing."</p>
               <p>"Belle, there comes Jennie Wardell and Mr. Malvern," called Hattie, and Miss Burton stepped through the low French window to meet and welcome her friends.</p>
               <p>The new-comers were a tall, light-complexioned, vivacious young lady, about Miss Burton's age, and a gentleman decidedly plain-looking, but with a bearing proud and high, and a manner by turns haughty and suave. Both were well and fashionably dressed, and appeared to be on the best of terms with each other and the world in general.</p>
               <p>"Why, where is Berrie?" inquired Miss Wardell, as she entered the parlor.</p>
               <p>"Oh, we do not expect her until to-morrow eve," was replied. "The school does not close until late this afternoon."</p>
               <p>"Why, I thought she was to arrive to-day, and came up this evening expressly to see her. I expect she has<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6505-00000015"/> grown very pretty since I saw her. You know I was out of town the last time she was home."</p>
               <p>"I do not know that she has changed much," Miss Burton returned, "except that she may be a little taller and more womanly. We always thought her rather pretty, though perhaps we look at her with partial eyes."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes, Berrie was always a little beauty, and when she enters society I expect will create a decided sensation; then you and I will have to stand aside, I suppose," with a little laugh and coquettish glance in the direction of the gentlemen. "I am sorry she has not arrived, but she will be here in time for the sailing party next Tuesday, will she not? You are going, Belle, of course!"</p>
               <p>"I am not so sure! What is it? I have heard nothing about it as yet," Miss Burton replied.</p>
               <p>"What? Has neither of those gallant young gentlemen told you anything about it?"</p>
               <p>She looked from one to the other inquiringly, and Mr. Wright returned in the lazy manner he sometimes assumed: "Scarcely, Miss Wardell! as I, at least, am yet to be enlightened myself in regard to it, and though of course I cannot speak for Mr. Adair, I presume he is as ignorant as I am, or he would doubtless have alluded to it."</p>
               <p>"I have heard nothing of it!" Mr. Adair quietly remarked.</p>
               <p>"Well! I wonder where all you people have been for the last day or two! I have heard scarcely anything else. We are to charter a sloop—a steamer is too fast and modern—and run down to Newport, go on board the old 'Constitution' that is lying there, visit the fort and other places of interest, dine at one of the hotels, and return by moonlight. Won't it be gay! Of course you will all go, and Berrie too! We can't get along without her."</p>
               <p>"Why yes! it would be very pleasant, I should think," Miss Burton replied, "but who has the management of the affair, and how should we all go unless we are invited?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know much more about it myself—you see my own information is soon exhausted—but supposed, of course, all our immediate circle were to go; if not, I am sure I don't care to. How is it, Henry, don't you know something more about it?" Miss Wardell continued, turning to the gentleman who had accompanied her.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Thurston and Frank White spoke to me about it," he replied. "Said it was all arranged, and mentioned those who were to be invited. I believe all the present company were included in the list, and I supposed most of them had been spoken to about it. Doubtless they will send out formal invitations in a day or two."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I concluded that was already done!" remarked Miss Wardell.</p>
               <p>"Why? Have you received one?" inquired Miss Burton.</p>
               <p>"Well—no—not exactly; except from Henry here, and that was not very formal," she returned laughing, but blushing a little also;" but I supposed the<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6505-00000016"/> gentlemen had, and were to invite what ladies they chose."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is a delightful sail, and I presume none of the girls will be averse to accepting such an invitation," said Miss Burton, laughingly.</p>
               <p>"When did you say the affair was to come off?" inquired Mr. Adair.</p>
               <p>"Next Tuesday, I think, wasn't it, Henry?"</p>
               <p>"Next Tuesday morning, at nine o'clock, is the time appointed for rendezvous, I believe."</p>
               <p>After some more discussion of this and kindred subjects, the whole party arose to take their leave.</p>
               <p>"Give my love to Berrie when she arrives, and tell her I shall run up to see her as soon as possible," said Miss Wardell, as she kissed Belle at parting. "How nice it will be to have her home all the time,"</p>
               <p>"Yes! we are all anticipating it very much," said Belle, "especially Hattie, who is very impatient for the time to arrive, and has talked of nothing else all day, scarcely."</p>
               <p>"Really! I have a great desire to see the young lady I have heard so frequently mentioned this evening," said Mr. Wright. "You may count on a call from me to-morrow evening, if my presence so soon after her arrival will not be an intrusion."</p>
               <p>"Oh, not at all, I assure you! And Mr. Adair, shall we not see you also?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Miss Burton, I should be most happy to call, but I intend to run up to Boston to-morrow, consequently it will not be in my power to do so, as I shall not return until the following day."</p>
               <p>"Very well! When you are at leisure then, we shall expect to see you."</p>
               <p>"Thanks! I shall certainly do myself the honor to call soon," he returned.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Belle, give us some music, please, before we go!" and Miss Wardell sat down as if assured that her informal request would be granted.</p>
               <p>"Please excuse me to-night, Jennie. I am not in a musical mood. Berrie will give you something worth while when she gets home, I expect. She is the musical one of the family, you know!"</p>
               <p>"Miss Berrie again!" exclaimed Mr. Wright, laughing. "What an important personage she must be! Aren't you curious to see her, Adair?"</p>
               <p>"Exceedingly!" that gentleman replied, with his fascinating smile, and after a few more last words the visitors took their leave.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair and Mr. Wright walked slowly and almost silently together to their hotel, each occupied with surmises as to the personality of the young lady of whom they had heard so much during the evening; while Miss Burton closed the piano, drew down the blinds, pausing to note the rare loveliness of the perfect night, and having turned out the lights, passed up to her own cosy room, where her little sister, in all the flush and sweetness of childhood's peerless beauty and innocence, lay dreaming away a few of the hours that must elapse before she should see, once more, her long absent and favorite sister, unconscious that ere the heavy fingers of slumber should again close her starry eyes, her little heart would be swelling with the grief of<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6505-00000017"/> disappointed affection and hope, as real and poignant to the loving heart of the child, as would be life's after trials to the maturer mind and sensibilities of the woman.</p>

               <p>THE clock in the hall of the seminary had just struck the hour of nine, and alone in her own little room for the moment, Miss Berrie Burton, still in holiday attire, knelt before her open trunk, placing therein the last of the numerous articles of wearing apparel, which for the last hour or two had been scattered around the room—piled on every available chair and table, while dresses of various colors and textures were thrown in a promiscuous heap on the low, white bed.</p>
               <p>Her fellow pupils had been running in and out all the evening, and she herself had made more than one flying visit to the adjoining apartments, but all seemed to be at present occupied in their own rooms, and Berrie was left alone.</p>
               <p>One or two dresses folded ready for packing still<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6505-00000018"/> lay on the floor by her side; while she, pausing in her occupation, with a dreamy smile on her scarlet lips and in her large, dark eyes, with her elbow resting on the edge of her trunk, and her cheek in her hand, sat dreaming of the home and friends so dear to her, and which she hoped so soon to see, unconscious that her name was on every lip and in every heart in that loved spot, at that very moment.</p>
               <p>How pleasant it is to go <emph>home,</emph> after a prolonged and perhaps unwilling absence! With what a glad, sweet thrill beats the heart at thought of the loving and joyful welcome awaiting it there; the almost tearful kisses of the happy mother, the glad embrace and fervent "God bless you!" of the gratified father, the laughing, loving greetings of sisters and friends, as they all crowd around, eager to catch every tone, word, and smile of the long-absent wanderer. What an infinitude and variety of questions are asked and answered, what an inexhaustible amount of information is imparted, all in the smallest possible space of time, while courtesy is totally disregarded, and every one is speaking in a breath, each seeming more desirous than the other to testify their joy in the glad reunion of hearts as well as hands. Truly, "Be it ever so humble, there's no Place like home."</p>
               <p>Miss Berrie's anticipatory reverie was interrupted by the entrance of her friend, Maud Lester, who, seating herself carelessly on the edge of the open trunk, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Berrie, I have just the nicest plan to propose, and I want you to say yes in advance. Indeed, I shall not take no for answer, so promise before I unfold it, that you will do your part towards carrying it out."</p>
               <p>"I don't know, Maud, about making promises in the dark; disclose your mysterious plan, and if it is <emph>nice,</emph> as you assert, you may be certain I shall say yes to it if I can. What is it? I am all curiosity to know," returned Berrie, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you can if you choose, and you <emph>must</emph> choose," with a little imperious toss of her head. "You know," she went on, "we shall not be likely to see each other again for a long time, and I don't feel like parting with you just yet, so I want you should stop in Boston to-morrow instead of going on home, and spend at least a day and night with me. Don't say no, yet," as Berrie opened her lips to reply. "Ned will be sure to meet me at the depot, and I will send him down to your brother's office to let him know you are in town, and he will come up and spend the evening; and we'll have Alice Havens, and Carrie Andrews, and Tom Harding, and one or two others in, and have a gay time generally; or else all visit some place of amusement, if there chances to be any worth attending just now; or, better yet, perhaps take a moonlight sail down the harbor—you know the evenings are beautiful now. Something at least to remember our farewell to schooldays by. Come, say yes, Berrie, you know I will not accept a refusal."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Maud, I should like it so much!" Berrie returned regretfully. "I always do have such a pleasant time at your house; but they will expect me at home, and I fear be greatly disappointed if I do not<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6505-00000019"/> go. Hattie at least will, and I presume the rest also. So I am afraid I shall have to say no, after all," with a smile and pressure of the hand Maud in her earnestness had laid on hers.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, though, you must not! You can write a note home and tell them about it, and it will be all right You know they will have you all the time when they once get possession of you, so you see I mean to keep you while I can."</p>
               <p>"But perhaps you can't," laughed Berrie.</p>
               <p>"'Possession is nine points of the law,' they say, and if I don't keep you it will not be my fault. Besides, you will see your brother, remember! Isn't that an inducement?"</p>
               <p>"You know I am never disinclined to go home with you, Maudie, I always enjoy it so much! I would like to see Charlie again also, and mother would be pleased to hear directly from him; still I am afraid I ought not. Hattie-will fret so if I do not make my appearance to-morrow night."</p>
               <p>"Oh, she will survive it, I guess. Write a note to her especially, and that will console her perhaps. Little girls always like to receive letters, you know."</p>
               <p>"But I have placed all my note-paper in the very bottom of my trunk," expostulated Berrie.</p>
               <p>"Well, mine isn't packed yet; come into my room and write your note."</p>
               <p>"Wait until I finish putting in these things," as Maud was drawing her away; and she began hastily to place the folded dresses at her side in the already nearly filled receptacle. Underneath them all was one of her school books which she had overlooked, and tucking it down at the side of the trunk, she exclaimed in a tone of relief: "There goes the last of school! If I am not heartily glad I am through with it, no one ever was. I am tired to death of study, and don't think I shall want to <emph>see</emph> a book again, for a month at least."</p>
               <p>"What! you that are so fond of reading, disgusted with books?" laughed Maud.</p>
               <p>"Well, I do like to read, but I learn so abominably hard, that I don't feel as if I could commit to memory another word of anything as long as I live; and I think I'll be content not to read any either, for a time. Well, I believe everything is packed now, excepting the dress I have on, and that I will leave until morning."</p>
               <p>"Come, then, and write your note;" and turning down the light, the two girls left the room, and proceeded to Maud's apartment across the corridor.</p>
               <p>The morning dawned bright and lovely, and the young ladies, having taken a regretful leave of the remainder of their schoolmates, with many a promise of correspondence or future visits, were early <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for Boston. The short and pleasant ride was speedily accomplished, and scarcely later than ten o'clock in the morning, the domes and spires of the lovely Tri-mountain city arose to view, and they were whirled into the Eastern depot, to find, as they had anticipated, Maud's brother Edward, or Ned, as he was always called, awaiting their arrival.</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Berrie!" he exclaimed, soon after their greetings were over, "how do you find yourself after<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6505-00000020"/> the fatigues and triumphs of exhibition? graduated with the highest honors, I suppose! I am really delighted to see you, my bonnie Berrie, but there is no train for Providence in an hour or two yet; you had better go home with us, and wait until to-morrow before you continue your journey."</p>
               <p>"Just what "she intends to do, Master Ned! so put us in a carriage, and run down to Charlie Burton's office; tell him Berrie is in town, and ask him to come up to dinner this evening."</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear sister, do you suppose I can leave you, and our little Strawberry here, so soon after your arrival? There will be time enough to see Charlie after I have taken you home. Here's a carriage, jump in, and then give me your checks."</p>
               <p>He handed them in, and while the young ladies were arranging themselves comfortably for the drive, Mr. Lester walked off to attend to their baggage. He was a very agreeable young gentleman of about twenty-five, very like his sister in personal appearance, although somewhat more lively and jocular in manner, and one of the most audacious of young gentlemen in his intercourse with the ladies, although ever retaining for them a thorough and gentle respect. He and Berrie had always been warm friends, and flirted desperately whenever they were together. Whether anything more serious than a little passing amusement was intended by it, I presume neither had ever thought to inquire. It seemed perfectly natural for them to coquet with each other, and both recognized the other's nobility and purity of heart and character.</p>
               <p>"Well, girls!" Ned exclaimed, when they were fairly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for their home in the Highlands, "what do you propose to do with yourselves this afternoon and evening? How will you exist without your beloved lessons?"</p>
               <p>"Lessons! don't mention them!" returned Berrie, with a laugh, and shrug of her sloping shoulders, "We have forsworn lessons forever; left them all behind us at the seminary; pray do not remind us that we ever <emph>were</emph> school-girls; I for one wish to ignore the fact entirely. So 'Let the dead past bury its dead,' I beg of you!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear Strawberry, please excuse me!" with a comically deprecating manner. "I will never mention school again."</p>
               <p>"See that you do not," laughed Berrie. "For if ever any one was disgusted with it, I am!"</p>
               <p>"May I be allowed to inquire again, <emph>young ladies,</emph> what your plans are for the day or evening?" returned Ned meekly, and twirling his thumbs in pretended bashfulness.</p>
               <p>"We have no settled ones," Maud replied; "have thought of two or three."</p>
               <p>"And those are—"</p>
               <p>"To have some company at home, visit some place of amusement, or take a sail by moonlight down the harbor."</p>
               <p>"The sail would be very pleasant," answered Ned, "but the notice is too short to get up a party and engage a steamer; so we shall be obliged to lay that project aside, unless you like to go in row-boats."</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6505-00000021"/>
               <p>"No, I thank you!" laughed Berrie; for though a salt-water bath might be refreshing this warm weather, I have no fancy for discovering how the bottom of the bay looks on close inspection; at least until I have been home once more, and seen my dear mamma. So count me out on that, please!"</p>
               <p>"The sail is impracticable, then. And as to amusements," Ned continued musingly, "there is a passable entertainment at the Howard now—nothing, of course, like the winter plays, but very good for the season, nevertheless. Then there is—let me see! this is Wednesday, I believe—yes, there is a band concert on the Common this evening. Gilmore's band officiates, and they have a fine programme advertised for the occasion."</p>
               <p>"Oh, let it be the concert, by all means!" exclaimed both the girls in a breath.</p>
               <p>"It will be much pleasanter than to be shut up in a warm, lose theatre. We will leave home early, and take a stroll around the Public Garden previous to the concert; it must be lovely now, and you know we haven't seen it since we went skating there last winter!" concluded Maud, "And Ned, you had better tell Charlie to come up at half-past five. I will coax ma to have dinner a little earlier than usual to-night, so we need not be obliged to hurry."</p>
               <p>"Yery well! do you mean to take any-one else along?"</p>
               <p>"Why yes,"—hesitatingly, "Alice Havens and Tom Harding I guess, if they are not engaged."</p>
               <p>"Strawberry, I shall have the pleasure of escorting you, of course!" with a killing look from his merry brown eyes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I suppose I shall have to take you, or be beauless!" was the saucy reply, as the driver drew up before a neat little cottage, half-covered with climbing roses and honeysuckle, and surrounded by tasteful and well-kept grounds, on one of the pleasantest streets of the beautiful Highland district, then called Roxbury; while hasty feet ran down the gravelled walk, impatient hands threw open the carriage door, and loving arms clasped the necks of both the girls in equally joyous" greeting.</p>
               <p>"Maud, dear, you have come at last, haven't you; I have been waiting so impatiently for the past hour. And Berrie, I 'am ever so glad to see you!" exclaimed Maud's younger sister Emma, a pretty, sprightly young girl of fifteen, while within doors a welcome awaited them from Mrs. Lester, equally warm and earnest, if somewhat less demonstrative.</p>
               <p>The day passed very pleasantly and swiftly, bringing the early dinner hour, and with it Ned Lester and Berrie's brother Charlie;—the latter a tall, well-formed young man of some twenty-eight years, with the same waving dark hair, lustrous eyes, and dusky complexion which characterized the rest of the family, but with the addition of a heavy moustache and imperial of the same sable hue as his hair. He was very like his sister in appearance, for, as Berrie was wont to say, "there was no variety in their family, they all looked alike, especially in the dark." He was somewhat indolent and nonchalant in manner, with just<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6505-00000022"/> sufficient indifference in his air to the other sex, to make him irresistibly fascinating, and was fast winning an enviable reputation in the profession which he had chosen.</p>
               <p>Dinner over, the four sallied out to take their evening amusement; the couple invited to accompany them being engaged. Charlie took immediate possession of Maud, and Ned drew Berrie's hand in his arm, with a mischievous squeeze of her soft white fingers, ere he released them from his clasp.</p>
               <p>After a pleasant walk around the Public Garden, which was in its height of bloom and loveliness, a pause on the rustic bridge that spans the miniature lake, a stroll through the hothouse, admiring its tropical beauties, and inhaling its rare and odorous sweetness, they crossed the street, and entering the noble old Common, were soon ensconced on the seats arranged for the accommodation of interested listeners around the music stand, where the members of Gilmore's unrivalled band were already stationed to discourse sweet music to those assembled beneath the starry arches of God's azure-vaulted temple.</p>
               <p>A capital time and place for flirting, as the heavy shade of the great trees around rendered them almost invisible to those even in the immediate vicinity, and Master Ned improved the occasion to the full; whispering in the pauses of the music, sweet speeches in the rosy ear so near his lips, as he bent his head to a level with the beautiful, peerlessly crowned one at his side, audaciously pressing or raising to his lips the fingers he contrived more than once to ensnare in his mischievous chievous clasp, while Berrie blushed, laughed, scolded, and once succeeded, unobserved by the others in the indistinct light, to soundly box the impudent fellow's ears, knocking off his hat in the attempt, which in the darkness he found it exceedingly difficult to recover, while his companions were indulging in a hearty laugh at his expense.</p>
               <p>"Did it pay?" whispered Berrie mischievously, when Ned again took his place at her side; which so exasperated him, that he exclaimed, "If it didn't it <emph>shall,</emph> you tantalizing girl!" throwing his arm around her waist, and ere she was aware of his intention pressing his moustached lips to her cheek.</p>
               <p>"You saucy fellow!" she pouted, "I'll not sit by you another moment!" and she attempted to rise, but Ned, with his arm still around her waist, held her down, while at every new attempt his clasp was only tightened, until in desperation she proposed a truce, and agreed to remain in her seat if he would release her waist from his clasp.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I am perfectly satisfied, as it is!" he returned coolly.</p>
               <p>"Well, I am not, if you are! Charlie, won't you make Ned behave?"</p>
               <p>"I don't see how I can, Berrie, if you are powerless," Charlie returned indolently. "I am sure your influence is far more potent than mine."</p>
               <p>"Does it pay to be saucy, my sweet Berrie?" whispered Ned tantalizingly in her ear: but Berrie, not caring to hear more about that, exclaimed petulantly, "Do be quiet! I want to hear the music," as the exquisite<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6505-00000023"/> quisite strains of an air from Il-Trovatore floated out on the echoing hush of the evening air.</p>
               <p>The concert closed at last with a grand medley of national airs, and their subsequent careless stroll down Tremont Street was ended at Copeland's, which was already nearly filled with lively, chatting groups, discussing strawberries, creams, and other delicacies of the season.</p>
               <p>Our party took their places at an unoccupied table, and while waiting to be served by the busy waiters, amused themselves by laughing and sarcastic comments on the various groups around them.</p>
               <p>"That young green-horn over there," said Ned, "that acts as if he hardly knew what to do with his cream, reminds me of a country acquaintance of mine, who was in town here last summer. It was his first visit to the city, and of course he was fearfully green, and everything new and wonderful to him. I had more fun in showing him the lions, than I ever did before in my life; and as he did not mind being laughed at I indulged my amusement to the full. I tell you, Charlie, I gained nearly a pound a day while he was here. Fact—all because I laughed so much, you see. Well, one evening we had been to Morris' Brothers—it was early in the season, before they left town—and I had made my throat sore with laughing, not so much at them, as at my comical companion, and his original, 'deown east' remarks, so I thought we would go in and have some cream, and try and cool off a little. I suppose the fellow never saw any before in his life, but he took a liberal spoonful at the first taste, and as it was very solidly frozen, he found it rather cool for his teeth, some of which were not of the best. Clapping his great, brawny hand up to his face, he exclaimed, 'Golly! that's as cold as ice! can't you send it back, and have it warmed?' I thought I should die with laughing; he did look so comical, squinting and grunting over his aching tooth."</p>
               <p>While Ned was talking, a waiter had drawn near unperceived, and enjoying the story as much as the rest, forbore to interrupt the narrator; but, when it was ended, he touched him on the shoulder, and asked him what he would like.</p>
               <p>"Creams for four!" he returned. "What will you have, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>Pine-apple, vanilla, and chocolate were chosen, and Ned repeated the order for them, wholly forgetting himself.</p>
               <p>"And you, sir?" suggested the waiter.</p>
               <p>"Me? oh, <emph>strawberry,</emph> of course," with a wicked glance in the lovely face opposite.</p>
               <p>The creams were brought, and silence for a time ensued; until Ned, casually looking up, exclaimed; "Why, Berrie, what are you blushing at? your face is as pink as the contents of my saucer."</p>
               <p>Berrie laughed and answered: "Hush, Ned! I wasn't aware that I <emph>was</emph> blushing, I only happened to glance up and meet a pair of very handsome blue eyes, fixed intently upon me; rather dreamily than impertinently though."</p>
               <p>"And your heart answered to the glance, and sent<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6505-00000024"/> the tell-tale blood to your cheeks, eh?" laughed Charlie teasingly.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Berrie petulantly, but blushing still more rosily, as one will do when attention is called to it.</p>
               <p>"Which one is it, Berrie? shall I shoot him!" inquired Ned, tragically.</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't trouble yourself!" returned Berrie, laughing; "you might get knocked over yourself."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the gentleman in question, a tall, light-complexioned, fine-looking man, recalled to himself by the suddenly vivid coloring of the face on which his gaze rested, had arisen and left the saloon, and our party soon after followed his example, and took a car for home, well pleased with their evening's entertainment.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, at Berrie's home, much disappointment was felt and expressed at her non-arrival. Hattie went to the depot with her father, and Mrs. Burton, almost as impatient as the child, for her daughter's arrival, stood on the piazza awaiting their coming, when Hattie made her appearance alone.</p>
               <p>"Pet, where are your father and Berrie?" she called, as Hattie came slowly up the walk, supposing they had paused to speak with some acquaintances, and sent Hattie on.</p>
               <p>. "Pa stopped at the post-office, and Berrie—Berrie didn't come!" and the child threw herself sobbing in her mother's arms.</p>
               <p>"There, there, dear! don't cry so!" said the lady soothingly. "Your sister will come to-morrow, probably, and then you will be just as glad to see her!"</p>
               <p>"She won't either, I know! She'll stay in that hateful old Boston with Maud Lester for a week. She <emph>always</emph> makes her stay!" and the child's sobs grew more violent at the dark prospect she had conjured up.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burton drew her in the house, and sitting down, took her on her lap, endeavoring by soothing words and caresses to quiet the grieving child, until at last the passionate sobs ceased.</p>
               <p>"Why, what's the matter with Hattie? Didn't Berrie come?" inquired Belle, as she entered the room just as Mr. Burton appeared at the gate.</p>
               <p>"It seems not," returned her mother, "and Hattie is inconsolable."</p>
               <p>"Well, it <emph>is</emph> too bad! I am disappointed too. But never mind, dear, perhaps she will have written. Pa, have you a letter from Berrie?" as Mr. Burton at that instant entered the room.</p>
               <p>"Here's a note for Hattie, and the handwriting looks wonderfully like Berrie's. I am sorry she did not come."</p>
               <p>"Just look, Hattie! Here is a letter from Berrie all for yourself. Don't that make up for her not coining? Shall I read it to you?" inquired her sister, as she took the note from her father's hand.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" was the faint reply, and Miss Burton opened the envelope and read as follows:</p>

               <p>The letter seemed to have the desired effect, and Hattie was soon chatting as gaily as ever. Mr. Wright called during the evening, as he had expressed his intention of doing, and also professed to be disappointed at not seeing the young lady of whom he had heard so much, the preceding evening, and whom he was really quite curious to see and know.</p>

               <p>THE following afternoon, not far from three o'clock, a carriage rolled swiftly down Boylston Street, and drew up at the ladies' room of the Providence Depot. But before the driver could assist the occupants to alight, two gentlemen stepped up, and throwing open the door, handed the ladies out.</p>
               <p>"Come in, and I will get your ticket!" said Charlie. "There is not much time to spare. Ned, you had better take her round to the cars."</p>
               <p>Ned obeyed orders, and they were standing on the platform when Charlie came up.</p>
               <p>"Here are your ticket and checks, Berrie. Give my love to all at home."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6505-00000026"/>
               <p>"Good-by, Charlie! take care of yourself, write often, and come home as soon as you can." And Berrie threw her arm found his neck for a moment as he stooped to kiss her.</p>
               <p>"Good-by, Maudie dear; don't forget me, and mind, I shall expect to see you in Bristol before the Summer is over, and I will send for Helen Harrington also." And two or three kisses fell warm on her friends lips.</p>
               <p>"Farewell, Ned; my heart is almost broken at parting!" she laughed, and giving him her hand, was turning away, when he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"See here, Berrie! I am not going to have any such partiality as that!" and suddenly drawing her close, he left a kiss on the girl's sweet lips.</p>
               <p>Berrie pouted, the rest laughed, and Ned smacked his lips with evident satisfaction, exclaiming, "That's good! I tell you, Berrie, stolen fruit is sweet, particularly <emph>strawberries!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Maud, what is the matter with Ned? he gets more impudent every day! I hope now you are at home, you will teach him better manners, and a little more propriety," pouted Berrie.</p>
               <p>"I shall take him in hand, I assure you, Berrie," Maud answered laughingly. "And I expect when you see him again, he will be a pattern of propriety."</p>
               <p>"Not if there are any tempting strawberries around, I am afraid," Ned returned, and Berrie hastened into the car to escape his teasing.</p>
               <p>A few moments later, when she sat chatting with the trio who still stood on the platform, she suddenly exclaimed: "Maud, look around! There is my blue-eyed admirer of last evening—the gentleman you wanted to shoot, Ned; this might be a good opportunity. I wonder if he is going on the train! he looks as though he might be. Isn't he splendid, Maud?" with a teasing glance at Ned, who was looking daggers at him.</p>
               <p>At this moment the forward car started, the gentleman leaped on the platform of another, and Berrie waved her last adieus to her friends, as the train moved slowly out of the depot, and she found herself fairly en-route for home.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding her expressed aversion for books a day or two previous, she soon drew one from her bag, and for-a time was wholly absorbed in its contents; but wearying of it at length, she let it drop in her lap, and looked up, only to encounter again the gaze of the blue-eyed stranger, whose seat was directly opposite her own. Berrie colored and turned to the window, while the gentleman, ashamed of his apparent rudeness, took refuge in his paper, and Berrie was at liberty to look where she pleased.</p>
               <p>Wondering who he could be, and admiring him more than she would have confessed, the romantic school-girl beguiled the time with weaving many a romance, in which a gentleman with fair hair and handsome blue eyes figured conspicuously, although the modest girl herself took no part in them, save as a casual, but interested observer.</p>
               <p>Thus the time quickly passed until they reached Providence Junction, where she Was obliged to change, and where she expected to lose her opposite neighbor,<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6505-00000027"/> never doubting but Providence was his destination, or some still more distant city.</p>
               <p>She had not noticed his leaving the car, and was therefore much surprised, when, as she was stepping to the platform, burdened with her shawl, bag, and book, a hand was extended to assist her, a musical, gentlemanly voice exclaimed, "Allow me!" and she looked up to meet again the glance of the fine blue eyes of her fellow-traveller.</p>
               <p>Remarking that it was "very unpleasant there for a lady," and relieving her of her shawl and bag, he led the way to the Bristol train, ensconced her in a comfortable seat, and bowing, walked off to the farther end of the car, before, in her confusion, she had hardly audibly expressed her thanks for his kindness. She saw no more of him during the remainder of the journey, and frequently caught herself wondering if he had returned to the train he had previously left.</p>
               <p>About eight o'clock of the same evening, Miss Berrie sat in the pleasant dining-room of her own dear home, with Hattie, whose arm was around her neck, leaning against her chair; while Belle, still at table, sat playing with her napkin and ring, asking and answering innumerable questions, and chatting gaily of the many trifling events which had occurred during Berrie's absence.</p>
               <p>"Are there many strangers in town this summer?" carelessly inquired Berrie, after a few moments' silence.</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite a number."</p>
               <p>"You know some of them, of course?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, several; some very pleasant people. There are two or three young gentlemen staying at one of the hotels, who form very pleasant accessions to our society."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I must tell you about a gentleman who came on the same train that I did, at least as far as Providence; possibly you may know him! I saw him first last evening at Copeland's, and he sat right opposite me in the cars, and when we exchanged at the Junction he assisted me and procured a seat for me; but after that he disappeared, and I do not know whether he went back to the Providence train, or came on to Bristol; at least I saw no more of him. He was gay, Belle, I can tell you; just my style;" and Berrie laughed merrily.</p>
               <p>"Well, but how did he look" inquired her sister.</p>
               <p>"'Out of his eyes,' Ned Lester would say. Oh, Belle, he's a worse tease than ever; and the most impudent fellow you ever saw! He actually kissed me two or three times while I was there, and it wasn't the slightest use to get angry, for he was just as likely to repeat it until I was pleased again. He's a fearful tease!"</p>
               <p>"Well, about your travelling companion!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! He was tall, very light-complexioned, with a heavy mustache, and lovely blue eyes, with such a dreamy look in them; and he speaks very prettily indeed. He is quite, aristocratic-looking, and a little haughty as well.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe I know him," said Belle musingly, "unless it is Eugene Adair. He is somewhat like<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6505-00000028"/> what you have described; indeed, <emph>very</emph> like, come to think of it, and I believe he was to be in Boston yesterday, and return to-day. I would not be surprised if it were he."</p>
               <p>"Eugene Adair!" repeated Berrie. "What a pretty name! and it would just suit him too."</p>
               <p>At this moment the door-bell rang, and Miss Burton said, "There's the bell! Hattie dear, run to the door, won't you?"</p>
               <p>Hattie obeyed and returned in a moment, saying, "It was Mr. Wright and Mr. Adair, Belle; they are in the parlor, and the gas isn't lighted."</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind, I can light it myself. Come, Berrie, come in and see if our friends are identical."</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't ask me, Belle! my hair is all in a muss, and my dress all dust, to say nothing of my collar and sleeves. I can't go in to-night."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you can run upstairs and dress in five minutes, or come in as you are; you look well enough; they will know you have just returned home."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps I will come in by and by, and show them what a dowdy sister you have got. Where is ma, I wonder!"</p>
               <p>"Upstairs, I presume; come soon, Berrie;" and Miss Burton ran out of the room, while her sisters proceeded upstairs to look for their mother.</p>
               <p>They found her in her own sitting-room, and after chatting awhile on various topics of mutual interest, Berrie said: "Well, I promised Belle I would go down after a little. They say everything depends on first impressions, but I fancy I shall not make a very favorable vorable one to-night," with a little laugh, and careless smoothing of the tumbled curls as she passed the mirror.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you are well enough, my child!" said the proud mother, looking at her with eyes that could see no fault in this her favorite daughter.</p>
               <p>Hattie had kept close at her sister's side all the evening and now begged to accompany her downstairs, and though her mother suggested it was bed-time, she was allowed to go, and entered the parlor clinging to Berrie's hand.</p>
               <p>"My sister Berrie, Mr. Wright!" introduced Miss Burton, and the gentleman, who was near the door at Berrie's entrance, bowed low over her hands saying in his most winning tones: "I am <emph>most</emph> happy to meet you, Miss Burton, and already feel somewhat acquainted with yon, from hearing you so frequently mentioned by your sisters."</p>
               <p>"Yes?"she replied smiling, but blushing a little also, "then you have the advantage of me;" and she passed on down the room with Belle.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adair, allow me to present my sister; Berrie, Mr. Adair!" and as he clasped the little soft hand of the girl, and in low, cultivated tones, expressed his pleasure in the meeting, she looked up to meet the familiar glance of the dreamy blue eyes of her late travelling companion, and the smile which on his lips seemed so fascinatingly sweet.</p>
               <p>"I think <emph>I</emph> also may claim acquaintance with Miss Berrie, may I not? Not alone on the grounds that Mr. Wright mentions, but on those of previous companionship<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6505-00000029"/> panionship as well, even though it may have been somewhat silent," said Mr. Adair, gently.</p>
               <p>Berrie smiled, and hardly knowing what to reply, sat down without answer, while the gentleman, turning to her little sister, exclaimed, "Good evening, Miss Hattie, it is an age since I saw you!" bending as deferentially over the tiny, dimpled hand of the child as he had done over that of her young lady sister.</p>
               <p>"Why, you saw me at the door, a little while ago, said Hattie, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Oh, so I did! but scarcely long enough to say how-do-you-do; so please pardon my forgetfulness." And resuming his seat on the sofa, from which he had just arisen, he drew Hattie down beside him, and for a time seemed to be wholly occupied by the lively prattle of the little girl, while Berrie entered into conversation with her sister and Mr. Wright; the latter of whom was in his most suave and flattering mood, while he glanced from one to the other of the three sisters, soliloquizing:</p>
               <p>"So this is the beauty of the family, eh? Well, I must say their enthusiasm is thrown away, for I cannot see but either of the others will compare favorably with this newly-fledged young lady, just from boarding-school. To be sure, her hair might be very handsome, if the curls were not quite so tumbled, the mouth is certainly very sweet and kissable, and her smile reveals white and beautiful teeth. But her eyes are rather too large to suit my fancy, and her dress, to say the least, is decidedly unbecoming. After all, that may be the trouble. I will wait until I see her in evening-dress dress, and recovered from the fatigue of travelling, before I judge of her beauty. She is certainly very easy and graceful in manner, for so young a girl, and I presume I may like her much on longer acquaintance."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Adair, having seen her in one of her happiest moods the night before, was thinking that Miss Berrie was not so lovely in travelling costume as she had appeared to him in her pretty toilet of the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>A tasteful and becoming dress enhances the charms of even the most beautiful; and probably Berrie had never looked so plain in her life as she did this evening, in her high-cut travelling dress of plain grey poplin, unrelieved by the slightest vestige of color; the narrow collar and sleeves of unornamented linen, being fastened alone by small gold studs and pin. While her sisters, both dressed in fleecy robes of white, with vivid scarlet ribbons, which were exceedingly becoming to each, were undoubtedly looking their best; and Hattie's handsome, drooping curls, although not to be compared to the wondrously beautiful hair of her sister, being this evening carefully and prettily arranged, presented a pleasing contrast to Miss Berrie's tumbled ringlets.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Adair, at least, could but admire the freedom from vanity the young girl had shown by making her appearance in the presence of two gentlemen, whom she met that evening for the first time, without spending a previous hour or two before her mirror, arranging her toilet, and attempting to render herself attractive to the eyes of her sister's gentlemen guests.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6505-00000030"/>
               <p>"Well, Miss Berrie, are you glad to be through with school?" inquired Mr. Adair, in a pause of his animated conversation with her little sister.</p>
               <p>"I assure you, yes," she laughed. "Although my school-days have been very pleasant, yet I am exceedingly tired of study;" with a little arch toss of the pretty head.</p>
               <p>"But not of books in total, I conclude, to judge from your apparent absorption in the one you were reading on your homeward journey. May I ask what interested you so deeply?"</p>
               <p>"A volume of Owen Meredith's poems, presented to me while in Boston," she returned.</p>
               <p>"'Lucile?'" he interrogated, briefly.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, the 'Wanderer'; I had perused it previously, and was merely looking over favorite passages."</p>
               <p>"You have read 'Lucile'?"</p>
               <p>"Not as yet, but I intend to soon, and expect it to surpass even the 'Wanderer,'" she returned, warmly.</p>
               <p>"You like him?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Exceedingly!</emph> More than any other living poet. And you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I admire him. He is very gifted, and expresses his sentiments gracefully and musically," returned the somewhat less enthusiastic gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Berrie hesitatingly, "but I do not think in that lies his greatest charm or power."</p>
               <p>"No? May I ask the expression of your views on the subject? your opinion as to the secret of his power?" said Mr. Adair gently, delighted to draw forth the fresh, unbiased views of this fair, young, guileless girl.</p>
               <p>The flush on her usually almost colorless cheek deepened perceptibly as she replied with girlish timidity:</p>
               <p>"A gentleman once said to me, that he liked Lord Byron, because he was so exceedingly <emph>human;</emph> and I think the same may be said of Owen Meredith. He seems to have realized to the full, all the depth and power of the various passions he portrays so well—to have suffered as well as enjoyed. The 'Wanderer,' particularly, seems to me very earnest, and full of the author's own heart."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you may be right; I think you are. But I should judge one must have experienced those same passions of which he writes so eloquently—love, jealousy, hate, and so forth, in order to be able to appreciate his expression of them."</p>
               <p>"What comes from the heart is likely to reach the heart, they say."</p>
               <p>"True, true; and so you like him!" returned the gentleman, musingly, while a shade of exquisite sadness swept over his handsome features, and he looked absently down at the tiny hand he held,—Miss Hattie, unaccustomed to the late hour, having fallen asleep on the sofa, with her hand in his clasp.</p>
               <p>Pretty as a picture the little girl looked, in her snowy robe, with the dark curls sweeping her crimson cheeks—whereon the heavy lashes lay—and flowing over her bare and dimpled shoulders. But Eugene Adair, artist though he was, left unnoted the beauty<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6505-00000031"/> of form and coloring which was presented to view in the flush and pose of the sleeping child.</p>
               <p>Pleased with the girl's clearness of expression, and the depth of thought for one so young, which her answer betrayed, and pained at the recollections her words had awakened, he gave no thought at the moment to aught beside.</p>
               <p>"And so you like him," he had said, with the dreamy look in his eyes which they had worn when first their glance met hers.</p>
               <p>"And so I like him, yes!" she laughed a little, colored to the tips of her dainty ears, and continued hesitatingly: "I confess he always seems to me to have written with his hand on my heart-strings."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair looked up with an appreciative glance, and a smile of rare sweetness, but before he could reply—as perhaps he had no intention of doing—Mr. Wright, who with Belle had been standing at a distant window for some time, and had just returned to their immediate vicinity, interposed with, "Miss Berrie may I have the pleasure of leading you to the piano?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Mr. Wright, you must excuse me this evening," she returned. "My music is not unpacked, and I am somewhat fatigued as well. At some other time I shall be happy to oblige you. Belle will favor you, I am sure;" and forced to be content with this reply, Mr. Wright opened the piano, and placed on the rack a favorite song, which Miss Burton, after a short prelude, sang simply, but sweetly and gracefully; soon after which the gentlemen took their leave, and the sisters were left alone.</p>
               <p>"Well?" said Belle inquiringly, when their steps had died away in the distance. "Was Mr. Adair your fellow-traveller of to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Rather singular, wasn't it?"</p>
               <p>"I concluded he was, from what he said. How do you like him? you seemed to be conversing quite earnestly."</p>
               <p>"very well, thus far; one can hardly judge on so short an acquaintance. He is fine-looking."</p>
               <p>"Yes," returned Miss Burton briefly, as she bent over her sleeping sister to arouse her; and after a half hour's confidential chat, such as sisters are likely to indulge in after an absence of one of them, the angels of silence and slumber hushed the household to repose.</p>

               <p>EVENING had again festooned her spangled banner across the vaulted arches of heaven's azure dome, dropped her misty robe of silver sheen and twilight purple upon the weary earth, and with her fragrant, sea-born breath cooled the throbbing summer air, when on the vine-wreathed piazza of their pretty home, Miss Burton and her sister were slowly pacing arm-in-arm, while Berrie gaily related some of the numerous adventures with which all school-girls' lives are varied, and which to most persons are entertaining and amusing, recalling vividly some similar passages in their own experience.</p>
               <p>All of us are more or less egotistical, and aught that appeals to the inner life of the self we adore, be it memory, hope, or desire, is received with favor, and listened to with the most gratified and gratifying interest.</p>
               <p>Both the girls were in evening attire, and looking exceedingly well, as the light that streamed through the open windows of the brilliant parlors testified, as they in their restless pacings frequently passed athwart its gleam.</p>
               <p>Miss Burton in a gauzy black grenadine, relieved by her favorite scarlet ribbons, and her sister in a flowing dress of the palest pink barège, the voluminous flounces sweeping the floor, and with low corsage and sleeves that barely reached her rounded elbow, while the gleaming coils of a heavy gold chain—which, with the tiny watch in her belt, had been that morning given her by her father—encircled the slender, dusky neck, and her lovely hair, in its most elaborate arrangement, floated over her polished shoulders, or <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-2">"—rested redundant above</l>
                        <l>Her airy pure forehead and throat."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Innocent, joyous life sparkled from every feature of the lovely face; happy trust, pleasant anticipations, and care-free enjoyment filled the heart which had as yet never been chilled by treachery or unkindness, and knew nothing of disappointment or grief, save by their names alone.</p>
               <p>It is said <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The beautiful are never desolate,</l>
                        <l>For some one always loves them;"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> and whether at school or home, surrounded by friends<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6505-00000033"/> who knew her well, or by those she could scarcely claim as acquaintances, never yet had she experienced aught but kindness and admiration, ever had arms of love and tenderness encircled her, and care for her happiness, tenderest regard for her welfare, and many prayers for her future good, rested like a halo of beauty above her flower-strewn pathway. Childhood, youth, and girlhood, had been singularly free from sorrow, or days of darkness and gloom; but she now stood on the threshold of a new life, her <emph>woman's</emph> life; her feet were just about to enter new and broader paths, in which it were impossible that no obstructions should arise, no rain should fall, no pangs of poignant grief should pierce the heart so joyous and intact as yet. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-2">"Sorrow comes to all!</l>
                        <l>Our life is checked with shadows manifold;</l>

               </p>
               <p>And she who in her youth escapes the heavy hand of grief, must perforce feel it laid with crushing pressure upon her after life, bowing her head with anguish, filling her saddened eyes with bitter, scalding tears, and sweeping the tensioned strings of her quivering heart, until they threaten to break beneath the heavy, torturing touch.</p>
               <p>But for this fair girl life hath as yet no seriousness, and only spreads before her its sunny walks, its lovely, joyous gala-days, and the beauty and blush of the fairest, sweetest flowers with which its lap is filled.</p>
               <p>"How well you are looking to-night, Berrie," said her sister laughingly, as in passing the window she chanced to glance at the sparkling oval face at her side, just as the brilliant light from within touched with wondrous beauty the floating hair and delicate olive features. "I can hardly believe you are the same girl that sat in the parlor there last evening conversing so demurely with Eugene Adair."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I am not," laughed Berrie. "Who knows but some fairy came along in the night and metamorphosed me into some one else?"</p>
               <p>"I do," said Belle. "I am sure you are my sister Berrie, although you <emph>are</emph> so wonderfully improved. But I am afraid there will be no one here to admire you to-night but myself. People always come when one cares least about seeing them; it would not have broken my heart if the gentlemen had remained away last evening, when you had just arrived."</p>
               <p>"And now that you have become a little weary of <emph>my</emph> society, you are ready to see some one else! Is that it?" laughed Berrie.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>know</emph> better, Berrie! I thought Jennie Wardell would have been up to-night, she is so anxious to see you."</p>
               <p>"Time enough yet! But look!" exclaimed Berrie, "isn't there some one at the gate?" and after a moment, as two figures came up the shaded walk, she added, under her breath: "Mr. Wright and Mr. Adair, Belle, are they not? Frequent visitors, truly! I think there must be an attraction here; eh, Belle?" and she laughed softty. "Which one may <emph>I</emph> have?"</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6505-00000034"/>
               <p>And Belle had only time to murmur, a little confusedly, "Which you please, Berrie," when the gentlemen came up the steps.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, ladies! May we be permitted to join your promenade?" said Mr. Wright gaily, while Mr. Adair silently bowed his greetings.</p>
               <p>"I think we will go in, instead," replied Miss Burton. "I believe we are tired of walking, are we not, Berrie? And the air is becoming rather chill." And Belle leading the way, they entered the pleasant parlor, which evidenced Berrie's presence in the profusion and careful arrangement of flowers, which graced tables, mantel, and piano, showing in their skilful grouping, not only the taste, but the love of the gatherer for the frail and fragrant beauties.</p>
               <p>"By George!" thought Mr. Wright, as Berrie sat down in the full blaze of the chandelier. "Miss Berrie has improved wonderfully since she sat in the same place twenty-four hours ago. She bears off the palm of beauty to-night, truly, although Miss Burton is looking unusually well. What magnificent hair! What plump, round shoulders! What a pretty hand and arm, and how exceedingly becoming her dress! Egad! she <emph>is</emph> lovely, that's a fact! Who would think dress could make such a difference?" and his manner assumed a shade more of respect for, and flattering deference to, the girl whom the arts of the toilet had so greatly improved.</p>
               <p>As to Eugene Adair, <emph>his</emph> manner, if in any way altered, seemed a little more reserved and distant, a trifle less winning and fascinating than it had been on the previous evening. He did not choose his friends for their beauty or elegance of person, arid though his artist eye ever dwelt with pleasure on that masterpiece of a Divine Sculptor, a perfectly beautiful woman, mere surface loveliness had no power to win from him either respect or regard for its possessor. He had learned by bitter experience that a lovely face may hide depths of deceit, vanity, and untruth below, may be but a beautiful mask to conceal corruption and heartless cruelty beneath.</p>
               <p>"We received tickets to-day for the excursion of which Jennie Wardell spoke a few evenings since," remarked Miss Burton in a pause of the conversation. "You were also favored, I presume?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. That, in fact, was our object in coming up to-night—to ask that we may have the pleasure of carrying your shawls, holding your parasols, and taking care of you generally. Wasn't it, Adair?" said Mr. Wright, laughingly.</p>
               <p>"I believe your statement is correct," Mr. Adair quietly returned. Then turning to Berrie with his winning smile: "I think Mr. Wright has appropriated your sister for the excursion, in anticipation at least. Shall I have the pleasure of attending you?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mr. Adair; I shall be pleased to accept your escort if I conclude to go, which I have some doubt about doing."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? I should think you would find it pleasant, you have been absent so long."</p>
               <p>"That is partly the reason why I think of declining the invitation," said Berrie, laughing a little." Many<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6505-00000035"/> of my old acquaintances seem almost like strangers, and I have no pleasure in the society of persons to whom I feel indifferent."</p>
               <p>At this rather pointed remark Mr. Adair turned coldly away, and Miss Burton interposed with, "What is that Berrie is saying?"</p>
               <p>"That she thinks she will not join the excursion, as she does not like strangers," returned Adair quickly.</p>
               <p>Berrie saw at once that he had taken her random remark personally, and blushingly attempted to explain or apologize, but, of course, only made the matter worse.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Mr. Adair, you thought me personal in what I said. I assure you—"</p>
               <p>"No apology is necessary," he coldly interposed. "You are not to be blamed for disliking those whom you do not know."</p>
               <p>"I was merely attempting to explain, not apologize," said Berrie, a little haughtily, vexed that he should so misconstrue what she considered an innocent remark, and privately determining that she would not accept of <emph>his</emph> escort after that, if she decided to go at all.</p>
               <p>It was evident a quarrel, or misunderstanding, to say the least, was imminent, even in this early stage of their acquaintance; but Miss Burton, who did not appear to notice any unpleasantness, again came to the rescue.</p>
               <p>"Not going? Of course you are! She has been attempting to talk like that all day, Mr. Adair, but I would not allow it. Strangers, indeed.! the friends she has known all her life! Berrie always was afraid of strangers," she concluded, laughing.</p>
               <p>"I am not <emph>afraid</emph> of them," Berrie returned, still a little vexed; "but I confess I can see little pleasure in spending a whole day with a set of people one does not care for. If I go it is only on your account, Belle, and you must not urge me to be over-agreeable to any but our immediate friends."</p>
               <p>"Excepting your escorts, of course. Or may we hope that you class them also with your immediate friends?" said Mr. Wright, suavely.</p>
               <p>"Making the exception you have named, of course/' returned Berrie politely, but utterly ignoring the latter clause of his remark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wright smiled and slightly shrugged his shoulders, but made no reply; and Mr. Adair was just then exceedingly occupied with a book of photographs he had taken from the table.</p>
               <p>"I think we shall go," remarked Belle. "Berrie will change her mind before then."</p>
               <p>"My mind is not settled as yet returned Berrie, "so there will be no necessity for a change. I merely intimated that it was doubtful about my going, rather than decidedly declared that I should not."</p>
               <p>"By the way, it seems it is postponed until Thursday, I believe Mr. Malvern said it was to come off on Tuesday, did he not?" inquired Miss Burton.</p>
               <p>"Yes. But they were so late in sending out their invitations, that they decided to defer it a few days—supposing you ladies might desire to make some preparations, I presume," replied Mr. Wright.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6505-00000036"/>
               <p>Eugene Adair had by this time concluded that he was somewhat hasty and unreasonable in appropriating Miss Berrie's careless remark to himself, and thought it time to make some amends. Therefore, looking up with a pleasant smile, he inquired, "Is this your brother, may I ask, Miss Berrie?"</p>
               <p>She glanced at the designated page of the open album he held, and answered briefly in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>"I saw him with you at Copeland's on the evening preceding your return home, did I not?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly. We were both there," she returned somewhat more pleasantly, her vexation having in a measure passed away, and recalling with a heightened color, the peculiar glance her eyes had at that time carelessly met.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair noted the rising flush, and with a little pang thought of the merry fellow who had seemed so devoted to the girl on the evening referred to, but his voice did not betray it as he returned: "Do you know I was certain it was you when I first saw you, from your resemblance to your sisters, whom I already knew, although I was aware that you were expected home on that evening. Your brother is very like you."</p>
               <p>"Yes!" she returned, "we all resemble each other, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Exceedingly!" said Mr. Wright. "The resemblance is very striking; between yourself and Hattie it is the most marked, however."</p>
               <p>"Oh, where <emph>is</emph> my little friend, to-night?" inquired Mr. Adair. "In bed, I suppose!" he added. "I have not had a down-right quarrel with her in some time; not since we quarrelled about you, Miss Berrie, I believe."</p>
               <p>Berrie's curiosity was excited to know what he could have said of her before seeing her, but she would not gratify him by manifesting it, and Belle remarked, laughingly: "If you are in a particularly belligerent mood, this evening, Mr. Adair, perhaps Berrie might be induced to quarrel with you."</p>
               <p>"I assure you, no!" returned Berrie, quickly.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Adair said gently, "We have no cause for quarrelling, I am sure! I Am I not right?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly! No cause nor inclination, I presume."</p>
               <p>Berrie was becoming haughty again, and Mr. Adair begged for music. Mr. Wright was positive her music must be unpacked by that time, and trusted she was recovered from the fatigue of last evening. Belle suggested she should sing the piece she sang last at exhibition, and she could do no less, she felt, than to comply.</p>
               <p>Softly, sweetly, yet clearly, rang out the exquisite air, and warm and sincere were the commendations she received. Then one piece after another was called for, until the evening was far spent; and when at last they arose to go, and Mr. Adair took Berrie's hand in farewell, he said, with the peculiar grace of manner which rendered him so exceedingly pleasing: "I have been highly entertained this evening, Miss Berrie, and if you do me the honor to accept my escort for Thursday, I assure you I shall do my best to make it pleasant for you, notwithstanding I am a stranger."</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6505-00000037"/>
               <p>Berrie's lingering vexation vanished beneath the charm of his words and manner, and notwithstanding a short time previous she had resolved not to allow him to attend her upon any terms, now with woman's inconsistency she answered sweetly: "I do not doubt it, assuredly, Mr. Adair; and if I decide to go, I shall be happy to permit you to 'carry my shawl,' as Mr. Wright expresses it. We shall doubtless see you again ere that?" she concluded.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly!" he returned. "I wish you a very good night," and Berrie, bowing in reply, turned to receive the adieus Mr. Wright was desirous of making.</p>
               <p>"Really, Berrie! I was seriously afraid you and our noble Eugene were about to quarrel, <emph>so</emph> soon!" said Belle, playfully, when they were at last gone.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't care!" pouted Berrie. "He was too provoking and unreasonable!"</p>
               <p>"My dear child, did you ever see a man that was not?"</p>
               <p>"Never!" said Berrie, energetically. "But, Belle," she added after a moment, "what did he and Hattie quarrel about me for?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is always teasing Hattie, and one night she asked him if he knew her sister Berrie; and he said he had not the honor, and wanted to know what sort of a berry you were, strawberry, blackberry, or hollyberry; and Hattie was indignant, of course, as she always is when any one says anything about you. <emph>I</emph> told him," continued Belle mischievously, "that you <emph>were</emph> rather black, and that hollyberry wouldn't be a bad name for you either; and I might have added, particularly if he took into consideration the prickly leaves. I guess he found you rather thorny to-night, didn't he, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>And Miss Burton sat down, laughing, as Berrie, pinching her arm, exclaimed: "You saucy girl! I am no blacker than you are, you know! Let him call me blackberry if he dares! Ned Lester calls me strawberry, and teases me to death besides."</p>
               <p>Several days passed on, arid Wednesday evening arrived. Berrie was just putting on her hat, preparatory to a short walk, and absently humming a favorite air, when Hattie entered her room, saying, "Berrie, Mr. Adair is down stairs, and wants to see you," and was rushing out of the room again when Berrie caught her, and exclaimed hurriedly: "Stay, Hattie! Did he ask for me particularly, and is he alone?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" returned Hattie, hastily; "he is at the door; he would not come in. Let me go, Berrie, Mamie Waldron is waiting for me."</p>
               <p>"Well, run on, and tell Mr. Adair I will be down in a moment."</p>
               <p>Hattie ran out, and Berrie turned to the mirror again, with a heightened color on her dusky cheek, and a little smile of pleasure wreathing the rosy, kissable mouth. Giving the shining ringlets another careful touch, setting her coquettish hat a little more jauntily above the drooping curls, and with fingers that slightly trembled, drawing a sprig of heliotrope and a lovely carnation pink from a vase on her dressing bureau, she fastened them in the bosom of her soft white dress, took her gloves In her hand, and with one more glance at<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6505-00000038"/> the mirror, turned to the door. With her hand on the knob, she paused for a moment, bent her head as if in speculative thought, then passed slowly from the room, and down the stairs.</p>
               <p>Her light step on the carpet made no sound, her simple dress of soft, white muslin gave no rustle, as she crossed the hall and paused in the open doorway. Mr. Adair was slowly pacing to and fro on the piazza, awaiting her coming, and at the moment was turned away from her, while with head bent low, and hand absently stroking his mustache, he seemed in a reverie scarcely pleasant, to judge from the close-set lips and the look of pain his handsome features wore. But when, turning at last in his promenade, his eyes encountered the pretty figure in the open door, standing in demure silence, drawing on leisurely her delicate, neatly fitting glove, the shade quickly vanished from his haughty face, and the rigid lips relaxed into his own fascinating smile, as he met the merry glance of the large, dark eyes bent directly upon him.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Mr. Adair! 'A penny for your thoughts!'" she laughed, as she placed the yet ungloved in the one eagerly extended in greeting.</p>
               <p>You bid too low!" he returned softly, still absently retaining the hand he had taken. "The object of them deserves a higher price."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? You excite my curiosity! Is it permitted to advance on the bid?" she asked, still smiling, and withdrawing the hand the gentleman seeped to have no idea of relinquishing voluntarily.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me!" he murmured, deprecatingly, as her act arrested his attention. "I fear no price you could offer would reach the object's deserts."</p>
               <p>"Really! She must occupy an exalted place in your mind," she returned, a little piqued, and with girlish audacity assuming the object of so profound a revery to be that instigator of all witchery and mischief, a woman.</p>
               <p>He smiled amusedly, and said softly, with a meaning glance in the eyes uplifted to his face: "She does, indeed, I assure you."</p>
               <p>Berrie dropped her eyes without replying, slightly confused by his look and manner, and he continued, "Some day, Miss Berrie, I may tell you of her, if you will permit," adding, before she could have replied had she wished, "were you going out?"</p>
               <p>"Only to the post-office," she returned, "but I am in no haste; will you come in?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, no! if you will allow me to accompany you in your walk a short distance."</p>
               <p>"Certainly!" she replied briefly, and they passed down the steps.</p>
               <p>"I came up more particularly, this evening, to know if I might do myself the honor to call for you to-morrow morning?" he resumed at once.</p>
               <p>"Thanks! I believe you may. I have about decided to go—indeed, Belle will not allow me to make any other decision; and my shawl and parasol will be ready for you at the appointed time, if I Can succeed in getting up sufficiently early."</p>
               <p>He bowed and remarked: "I hope we may have a pleasant day. Did you notice the sunset this evening?"</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6505-00000039"/>
               <p>"I did, indeed! Was it not magnificent!"</p>
               <p>"Exceedingly! But if you admire such things, you should see an ocean sunset; and sunrise also for that matter."</p>
               <p>"Which I desire to do, more than I can tell you!" she returned warmly.</p>
               <p>"And hope to, some time?"</p>
               <p>"And hope to, some time, yes! Hope to, whether there is any prospect of my doing so or not," she laughed.</p>
               <p>"I see no reason why you should not."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma would never consent. She has a great horror of the sea, and would not have a happy moment. while I was absent, were I to cross the ocean. I shall never visit any land but my own while she lives, and I hope that may be as long as I do," she concluded, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Notwithstanding your desire to witness a sunset at sea?"</p>
               <p>"Notwithstanding that, yes! I could not live, it seems to me, without my mother."</p>
               <p>"So I would have said at your age," he returned sadly. "But 'the years are sad and many since she went to sleep, and I am living yet. It is not so easy to die as we sometimes think in youth, nor will death come at our bidding, else I should not be here, Miss Berrie."</p>
               <p>She looked up, touched at his sad quotation from her favorite "Wanderer," and the exceeding bitterness of the tone in which he closed the sentence, and said softly, "Is life so dreary to you as that, Mr. Adair? It does not seem to me one could ever wish to leave this beautiful world."</p>
               <p>"There is another beyond, far more beautiful, my child; a glorious temple, to which this world is but a stepping-stone; and life to me <emph>is</emph> indeed <emph>very</emph> dreary at times; more so than you, in your innocence and care-free happiness, can imagine." And he looked down at her with eyes darkened with a nameless pain, with every feature eloquent of a strong and abiding grief.</p>
               <p>Every line of the girl's fair face expressed the sympathy her lips dared not utter, and he added with emotion: "God grant, dear child, you may never experience the unutterable misery of having your only conscious desire one for 'oblivion of time, escape from yourself;' of feeling that the rest of the grave would be sweeter than slumber to a weary child, and knowing that you must still live on, and <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Endure whate'er shall come; without a sigh</l>
                        <l>Endure; and drink, even to the very dregs,</l>
                        <l>The bitterest cup that Time could measure out.'"</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There was a pause of some seconds, then Berrie said softly; "I can think of nothing that would be more bitter than a long separation from one who is dear to us; of knowing that miles of ocean wastes divide us from each other, and that years must yet elapse before we could meet. Of course I know nothing about this or any other grief, as yet, by experience, but it seems to me that must be very hard—almost, if not quite, as bitter as death."</p>
               <p>"Not quite, oh no! for 'while there is life there is<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6505-00000040"/> hope,' and so long as we know that the world contains our loved ones, we still have hope that some happy chance, or <emph>Providence</emph>"—he corrected reverently, "may give them back to us; but when Death takes them, we know we must never hope for reunion until we meet where there are no partings or sorrows, no bitterness of desolation, no pangs of hope deferred."</p>
               <p>"Life is so short, it seems to me a sad thing to be separated for years from one we love," coining back to her previous stand-point, and able to compute a grief like that, better than one of which, as she had said, she as yet knew nothing by sad experience—death's grievous sorrow, and the deep desolation of heart such bereavement leaves behind.</p>
               <p>Or did some premonitions of her coming fate influence her thoughts and dictate her words? Some fore-shadowing of the days to come, when her heart should sink beneath the despair of long and weary separation from those best loved, and faint from the dreary sickness of hope deferred. Do not such chill presentiments frequently strike our hearts, even in our gayest and most care-free moments? Will not a casual word from one who has no seeming influence over our present or future life, awake some faint forebodings of what the coming years may bring, some dreary fears that life may not be always as bright and joyous as then?</p>
               <p>"The whole of life is sad, it seems to me," he re-turned, in answer to her last remark. "I look sometimes at those who seem to find no thorns beneath the roses of gayety and happiness they so eagerly gather, and wonder if the same Hand created us all? If I never did or can look at life through such rosy lenses? if I ever really have known what joy and happiness mean, save in the abstract? But I am saddening you by this retrospect of my own saddened life, and the nettles of sorrow will come full soon to you, pretty child, if only blossoms of joy are pressed into your hands while those you love have the power to give them to you. Forgive me for allowing the conversation to take such a turn, and farewell until the morning." And bending low over her hand, he passed on up the street, while she entered the office for the evening mail.</p>
               <p>Many times during the remainder of the evening did she review the conversation of a few hours previous, wondering with a sympathetic curiosity what form of grievous, desolating sorrow could have swept over the life of one so seemingly worthy of fortune's best and rarest gifts; so evidently calculated by the graces which nature and culture had bestowed upon him, to win for himself any meed of love or honor or fame that the most restless or ambitious heart could desire. Deciding at last, as <q>

"Pity is akin to love;" and with the profound pity which filled her heart for the lonely man, crept in a longing desire for the power to soothe the grief which to her was nameless, to erase from the stricken heart the lines that stern, unrelenting sorrow had traced thereon, and teach him to leave in the vault of forgetfulness the darkness of the past, and look forward with hope and trust to a future which might gleam with marvellous peace and happiness for him whose feet now dragged so wearily through the "slough of despond," and the mire of intense, heart-breaking despair.</p>

               <p>But conscious only of the "pity that filled her soul, unthinking of the passion which is so near of kin, and half murmuring to herself "Comfort him, comfort him, all things good," she drifted slowly off to the mazy land of dreams, to which sweet slumber is but the shining, golden portal.</p>

               <p>PROPITIOUS as had seemed the royal sunset of the preceding evening, the morning dawned grey and cloudy, ushered in with one of those provoking fogs which prevent one from determining, with any degree of certainty, whether it is a foreshadowing of rain, or of a burning, sunlit day.</p>
               <p>But youth is hopeful, and ever inclined to look on the brightest side of a picture; therefore the hour appointed for the meeting found a group of both sexes, gathered on one of the wharves in the lower part of the town, awaiting the readiness of the sloop that was to accommodate them, and minister to their day of pleasure.</p>
               <p>"Come, Berrie!" her sister had said, as she entered her room and drew up the shade somewhat early that morning. "It is nearly half—past seven, and quite time<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6505-00000042"/> you were out of bed, if you intend going on the excursion to-day."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! must I get up? I don't believe I will go," yawned Berrie, half settling herself for another nap.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! yes, you will go I Come, get up right away, will you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, if I must. Is it pleasant?"</p>
               <p>"Not very, but I dare say it will clear by and by. Come! breakfast will be ready by eight o'clock, and you have no time to spare. We don't want to keep the gentlemen waiting."</p>
               <p>"What gentlemen?" asked Berrie, still half asleep; adding, as Belle made an impatient gesture, and she recalled the events of the preceding evening—"Oh, yes, I know! Well, if I must, I <emph>must,</emph> I suppose; but it is a nuisance, any way!" and she stepped lazily out of bed, and prepared very deliberately to make her morning toilet.</p>
               <p>Belle laughed and exclaimed: "Well, Berrie, if you go at work in that indolent manner to dress, I fancy we shall have to wait breakfast for you one while. Come, do wake up, sleepy-head, and make haste," and she dipped her hand in a bowl of water that stood on the marble sink, and threw it mischievously in her sister's face.</p>
               <p>Berrie gasped, and exclaimed half-laughing: "Belle Burton, if yon don't leave the room, I won't dress at all—there!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I'll go," laughed Belle; "but do be quick, Berrie!" and she ran hastily downstairs to assist in preparing the lunch which it was decided they should take, lest they should not reach Newport as early as they had anticipated.</p>
               <p>Berrie came leisurely into the breakfast—room, in her pretty cambric dress, when the rest of the family had nearly finished the morning meal, and as leisurely proceeded to partake of the repast before her. Therefore as a matter of course, the gentlemen made their appearance somewhat before she was prepared to receive them. They were standing in the hall with Belle, when she came out of the breakfast-room a few minutes after their arrival.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, Miss Berrie," said Mr. Adair, taking her hand in greeting; "I trust you rested well the last night?"</p>
               <p>"Better last night, thank you, than this morning," was the half-laughing response. "I believe I am not fairly awake as yet."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>do</emph> look rather sleepy, that's a fact!" remarked Mr. Wright. "But I presume we shall find you sufficiently wide awake by and by."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I dare say; I usually am by noon. But, dear me! it is going to rain, isn't it? It looks enough like it, I am sure."</p>
               <p>"Not to-day, I think; the fog will lift by and by, and give us a peep of the sun's shining face. Don't be alarmed about the rain, Miss Berrie; we have bespoken fair weather to-day. Have we not, Adair?" said Mr. Wright, gaily.</p>
               <p>"Do not appeal to me," returned the other; smiling; "I never dispute a gentleman's word. But I really do<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6505-00000043"/> not think you need have any fears, ladies; the wind seems to be favorable for a fair day."</p>
               <p>"It would be delightful to have a pouring rain all day!" remarked Berrie, with a shrug of her shoulders, as she ran upstairs to put on her hat, and bring the shawl and parasol which she had promised her escort should be in readiness.</p>
               <p>Therefore notwithstanding the prospect of a stormy day, our quartette joined the group gathered on the wharf, just as the sloop was announced to be ready for occupation; and soon after, when all were comfortably seated on board, the moorings were loosed, anchor weighed, and the little vessel glided slowly away from the wharf, firing a salute from her one little cannon, which for the moment half deafened the party on board.</p>
               <p>The time passed on quickly and pleasantly for an hour or two, and then, as the principal buildings in the town still arose conspicuously before their eyes, one and another began to murmur at their slow progress, and wonder why they had not made better time. But the murmurs passed, and merriment was in the ascendancy again, when Berrie, looking at her watch, exclaimed: "Twelve o'clock, and Bristol still in sight. We shall take breakfast, instead of dinner, at Newport at this rate!" and a gentleman was sent forward to know what was the cause of their want of speed.</p>
               <p>"No wind, and tide against us, sir!" was the cheering response; which was duly communicated to the rest of the party, and a consultation held.</p>
               <p>Ere this, the sun had dispelled the "mists of the morning," and the day was as fair and bright as one could desire. The waves danced and sparkled in the rays of the ardent day-god, but were altogether too tiny to suit the pleasure of the gay party on the awning-covered deck of the little yacht; and the spires and tasteful dwellings nestled lovingly among the fine old trees of the handsome town, formed a pretty and pleasing picture, seen across the plain of dimpling blue water, stretched between. A picture they would fain, at the moment, have viewed from a greater distance.</p>
               <p>However, they were bound for a day's sport, and as the weather had favored them so propitiously, they could not think of turning their faces homeward, but resolved, if they were to pass the greater portion of the day in their circumscribed quarters on the deck of the yacht, instead of among the romantic nooks of lovely old Newport, they would at least endeavor to make the best of it, and like the "Duke-de-Louvois," enjoy what they could.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, the greater portion of the party had come provided with refreshments, anticipating that the bracing air of the sea might supply an appetite for the delicacies they held in store; and a gayer party never sat down to an informal dinner like the one set out on the deck of that little barque, than were they. Laughter, wit, and vivacious repartee seasoned the sandwiches, cakes, pastry, fruit, and so forth, with which their hastily improvised table was loaded, and gay good-humor rendered the otherwise tedious hours not only endurable, but to most of them exceedingly<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6505-00000044"/> pleasant. Still, even the most extravagant spirits must perforce lull at last, and when two o'clock came, impatience and restlessness took the place of the former hours' gay hilarity and cheer.</p>
               <p>"How provoking it is!" "Just our luck!" "Dear me, I wish I had stayed at home!" "I wonder if we are <emph>never</emph> going to have any wind!" "Well, this is tedious enough!" were some of the expressions which fell impatiently from nearly every lip. The least breath of air was joyfully hailed as the first instalment of the breeze so longed for, but when it failed to be followed by fuller puffs of wind as anticipated, disappointment was both felt and freely expressed, to the vexation and discomfort of those easy-going souls who always make the best of everything, and are determined to enjoy themselves let what will come.</p>
               <p>At last the captain said decidedly that it was useless to think of reaching Newport before night, and if they were still inclined to finish the day, the best thing they could do was to tack and run up to Rocky Point instead, known to all of the company as one of the most picturesque and delightful of summer resorts. Therefore his very sensible advice was acted upon, and the little vessel soon headed in an opposite direction to which it had thus far pointed. But as such things usually go by contraries, scarcely had their minds become settled upon that, when a strong, fresh breeze sprang up, and after a short but eager consultation, the sloop was again put about, and Newport was once more the goal of their hopes. Still, they were struggling against head winds, and their progress in beating ing was so exceedingly slow, that the project was at last abandoned entirely, as wholly impracticable, and again the fickle barque was headed for Rocky Point.</p>
               <p>About four o'clock p. M., after having passed nearly seven hours on the deck of the little yacht, they stood once more on <foreign xml:lang="LAT">terra-firma,</foreign> thoroughly wearied, for the time, of the coquettish, inconstant sea.</p>
               <p>As to Berrie, the hours had passed much more pleasantly than she would have believed possible. Eugene Adair exerted all his powers of fascination—and they were many and rare—to please and amuse her; their two companions were in their gayest and most entertaining moods, other and mutual friends gathered around them, and no group in the party was a merrier one than that of which Berrie was the attractive centre.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair had thrown off the shade of sadness which seemed to have settled over him on the preceding evening, and Berrie often gazed at him, wondering if that gay, fascinating, apparently care-free gentleman, was the same that had looked down at her the previous night, with a face shadowed by a heavy grief, and whose lips had uttered words and tones of such exquisite, heart-weary sadness.</p>
               <p>How little the casual observer can guess of what sleeps beneath the smiling surface! How many wear a mask of gayety to hide a tumult of anguish or a yawning chasm of desolation, and smile with a sweetness almost divine, while the heart within is weeping tears of blood!</p>
               <p>Not in scenes of pleasure can one judge of a man's<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6505-00000045"/> inner life;—his motives, aspirations, desires, or griefs. Down deep in his heart they lie, hidden from mortal sight, shielded from mortal ken, shrinking with morbid sensitiveness from mortal touch, until the gentle hand of love or sympathy shall rend the veil that covers them, and draw them forth, to assist, heal, or sympathize with, as their deserts shall demand.</p>
               <p>But if Berrie had not forgotten the moment of confidence the. previous evening, neither had Eugene Adair, as the smile with which he answered the earnest, but somewhat perplexed gaze, which more than once he had caught fixed on his face, had testified. A smile that had brought a provoking flash to the fair girl's cheek, and quickened the pulsations of the heart that beat so modestly within her gentle breast. A smile which had in it such a blending of sweetness and sadness, of secret sympathy and fond regard, that the tender, pitying heart of the girl could not fail to respond to it, and "translate itself in silence on her cheek."</p>
               <p>Who has not felt, with indescribable vexation, that rush of color from throbbing heart to burning cheek! That flushing crimson one would fain control, but which, bursting all barriers of restraint, leaps to the outer surface of the being, covering brow and cheek and throat with the tell-tale color; and a consciousness of which but enhances and increases.</p>
               <p>Blushing easily at all times, Berrie could hardly do less under such a glance; and bit her lips with vexation that she could not meet that peculiar, conscious smile, without such an eloquent response. But the fact remained mained the same, and the utmost that she could do was to resolve not to encounter it, if she could by any possibility avoid it.</p>
               <p>Presuming most of our readers have stood on the rock-fretted shores of this once popular watering-place, and gazed with admiration at the heaving waters of the bay, rolling in crystalline azure waves to their very feet, we will not enter into any detailed description of the scene that met the gaze of our weather-bound party, as with sighs of eager relief, they left their somewhat uncomfortable quarters, and stood once more upon the solid, substantial. land.</p>
               <p>"Are you tired, Miss Berrie?" asked her companion, as he assisted her to gain the wharf.</p>
               <p>"I believe I am, somewhat; it is so tiresome remaining in one place for such a length of time, although. the hours have passed more rapidly than I would have deemed possible;—thanks to our agreeable company!" she finished smiling.</p>
               <p>The gentleman bowed and responded earnestly, "I am exceedingly glad if you have been entertained, and not found a day in the society of strangers so formidable and wearisome as you had anticipated."</p>
               <p>"Will you <emph>never</emph> forget my careless speech, Mr. Adair, or believe that I had no reference to you when making it?" said Berrie a little confusedly, but wholly in earnest.</p>
               <p>"I do not refer to it maliciously, Miss Berrie, I assure you! Do not think it! Nor do I really believe you intended to be personal in what you said, although at the moment, I confess, I felt piqued," returned her<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6505-00000046"/> companion gently, adding; "But since you desire it, I shall think of it no more, and shall consider myself as coming under the head of stranger to you no longer, if you will permit. For although our acquaintance is as yet somewhat slight, I trust that some time I may have the pleasure of knowing that you class me among your friends. May I not, Miss Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Assuredly, I trust so!" she returned, hardly knowing what reply to make, but feeling indeed that she could no longer with truth denominate him a stranger. His evident kindly feeling for her, his efforts to amuse and entertain her, the flattering deference with which he ever seemed to regard her, to say nothing of the rapidity with which such informal intercourse as is a natural consequence of an excursion like that, annihilates all feelings of restraint, and leaves those who were mere passing acquaintances before, often more than friends, had taken away from her feelings, even more than her acts, all thought of strangeness. Besides, she had been greatly prepossessed in his favor since first their eyes had met, and finding him under all circumstances so truly the gentleman, she could not but respect as well as admire him.</p>
               <p>True, she knew nothing of his antecedents, his life-history, his future prospects;—neither, my reader, do we; although like her we may do so in the time to come,—but that did not hinder her interest, nor form any barrier, she considered, to the simple friendship he asked, and that she felt inclined to accord. Looking up to him as she did, idealizing him a little, as women are so apt to do those to whom they are attached, she could but feel flattered that this man, so greatly her superior in age, culture, and attainments, with a manner so polished and fascinating it could but win the admiration of all, and a character calculated to command any amount of adulation or affection he might desire, should be thus evidently anxious for her regard, should express so strong a wish to call her, a simple, young, unsophisticated girl, his <emph>friend.</emph> Had he asked for a warmer place in her heart, doubtless she would have felt less complimented, less inclined to accord what he desired; but to have a friend like this she felt would be a great good in her life, and she had not yet learned that a man's friendship for a woman is oftenest but "love in disguise," and that the pretty fallacy of friendship between the sexes was long since utterly exploded, and proved to be indeed but a myth of fancy.</p>
               <p>After a silence of some moments, he continued, earnestly, and with a touch of the sadness which had marked his bearing the preceding evening,—"I do not seek or desire many friends, Miss Berrie; in fact I am exceedingly distrustful of friendship, and have learned through bitter lessons of trust betrayed, to place but little confidence either in man or woman. But since first I saw you in a Boston saloon, gay and happy, and accompanied by friends as lively as yourself, notwithstanding the contrast in our lives seemed so great and marked, I have felt a desire to be permitted to call you my little friend, and know that you will ever look upon me, or think of me, rather, as one who has your happiness and future good near at heart. Perhaps this may seem to you premature, considering the<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6505-00000047"/> brevity of our acquaintance, but you know that some persons select their friends by instinct, and feel intuitively what hearts are linked with theirs by the chains of sympathetic friendship. Therefore, shall we be friends, Miss Berrie, henceforth and forever?" he concluded, more lightly.</p>
               <p>Forgetting her resolution not to meet his eyes, she glanced up at his face, and encountered a gaze so earnest, and almost impassioned, that with another provoking rush of color to cheek and brow, she murmured, "Yes, if you please!"</p>
               <p>"True friends are very rare, Miss Berrie," he continued, smiling a little at her confusion; "and I may prove as fickle as the majority of the world; but until I do, trust me, little girl, and I will endeavor to merit your confidence."</p>
               <p>Ere this they had reached the dancing hall of the hotel, and Mr. Wright, who with Belle had been considerably in advance of them, came up at this and inquired: "Miss Berrie, will you dance?"</p>
               <p>There were several sets already on the floor, and another forming which some of their own party had joined.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I think not, here; it is almost too conspicuous!" she laughed in response to his question.</p>
               <p>"Your sister made the same reply when I asked her, so I concluded to come and see if I could not persuade you!"</p>
               <p>"You are very kind; but I could not think of it in a public place like this."</p>
               <p>"Then I must look farther, I see! My feet ache to be keeping time with that music," he said laughing, as he. turned away.</p>
               <p>"Let us find Belle, and go outside!" said Berrie. "It is rather warm here. How provoking it is that we could not have reached Newport."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed; although it is very lovely here."</p>
               <p>Miss Burton Was soon found, and after strolling around for a time, watching the groups entertaining themselves with the various facilities for amusement, of which the place boasts so many, Berrie exclaimed, "I have a fancy I would like to climb to the top of those rocks. The ascent does not appear difficult, and I should judge the view from the summit might be fine. Come, Belle, let us go, will you?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank you!" laughed Belle, "I have no desire to break my neck to-day, and I never could climb."</p>
               <p>"I can, like a sailor!" was the laughing response. "Come, Belle, do!"</p>
               <p>"No! you and Mr. Adair can try it if you like, and I will go over there where Jennie Wardell is."</p>
               <p>"I do not like to trouble Mr. Adair; perhaps he has no fancy for climbing."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I should like it exceedingly! I am fond of lovely views. I promise to take care of your sister, Miss Burton;" and Belle walked off, assuring him gaily that she could trust him.</p>
               <p>"Come, my little friend!" with his most winning smile, and extending his hand, which Berrie quietly ignored, saying, "Lead on, then!" <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>And over the hills, and far away,</l>
                        <l>Beyond their utmost, purple rim,</l>
                        <l>Beyond the night, beyond the day,'—"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6505-00000048"/> quoted Berrie, when they had proceeded about half the distance, and were toiling slowly over the rocks, she still declining his frequently offered assistance; but at the fourth line she paused abruptly, coloring to the tips of her fingers as she recalled the closing line of the quotation she had thoughtlessly repeated. <q>
                     <l>"Through all the world she followed him'?"</l>
                  </q> finished her companion interrogatively, as she paused, and turning around with a mischievous smile on his mustached lip. But his smile was exchanged for a look of concern, and he exclaimed hastily: "Take care, Berrie!' forgetting in his anxiety the formal "Miss," as Berrie, in her confusion, careless of where she was stepping, placed her foot on a rolling stone, and would have fallen but for his timely assistance.</p>
               <p>"I shall not permit you to be so independent again," he smiled, "or my pledge to your sister will not be fulfilled. Allow me to take your hand, Miss Berrie;" and she reluctantly obeyed his behest.</p>
               <p>My reader, have you ever noticed what a difference there is in the touch of a hand? Not alone the effect which it has on the nervous system—striking with a strong sense of physical repulsion, sending a feeling of quiet content and confidence through the being, or transmitting little thrills of delicious pleasure through every drop of the sensitive current that flows so rapidly to and from the throbbing heart—but in the merely physical touch as well. That of the cool and clammy hand, which holds your own in a loose, easily relaxing pressure; of the hard, dry palm, which would seem impervious to the tender sensations of a clasp of affection; of the hand warm and moist, which you could scarcely fancy capable of a pressure expressing more than indifference; and of the soft, smooth hand, dry, and warm, and firm in clasp, indicating to you a master-mind in its owner—a hand formed to wield a sceptre, or rule with its magic touch a kingdom of hearts.</p>
               <p>Such was the hand which took the delicate palm of the girl in a strong, firm, sustaining clasp. No passion was in the pressure, only the warm clasp of a friend, the firm hold of a helper, the strong, protecting grasp of a man. And yet the girl felt in every fibre of her being the magic touch, felt the ruling power of a great soul, a mind far above her own in scope and exercise, in every tightening hold of the manly, ungloved hand.</p>
               <p>They reached the summit at last, and paused in breathless admiration of the scene which stretched before their gaze, and the variety that the lovely view presented. High-piled rocks, wooded slopes, sandy beach, and the gleaming, crested billows of the sea rushing to kiss the naked feet of the beautiful land; while here and there the hand of man had joined with that of Nature to beautify the scene.</p>
               <p>"It is worthy the toil, is it not?" said the gentleman at last, breaking a silence of some moments.</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed! Lovely beyond description!" was the earnest reply. "A beautiful, beautiful world!"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever attempt to realize," said Mr. Adair dreamily, "the vastness of the intellect, if such we can<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6505-00000049"/> call it, which could plan and execute so marvellous a piece of work? Combining strength and solidity with the most perfect grace and beauty? Look at the mountains, strong, and firm, and massive, seeming to our bounded sight to tower to the very clouds which bend from His own starry heavens; the vales, robed in all the beauty and softness of Nature's exquisite dress; the vast, impulsive sea, ebbing, and flowing, lashed into fury or sleeping in undisturbed calm at the behest of its divine Master; the massive rocks unchanged and unchanging; the wealth of verdure which seems to die at the breath of Winter, only to be revivified by the touch of balmy Spring into new life and beauty, and a thousand other as grand and noble works. And yet, after creating so much that was mighty and wonderful, He could stoop to form the simplest flower that decorates the earth, or this little insignificant worm which I could crush with one touch of my foot. I lose myself in admiration and wonder when I attempt to realize such greatness."</p>
               <p>"I am too young, perhaps, to have thought very deeply on scarcely any subject of much magnitude," the girl returned modestly; "but I have often wondered how <emph>any</emph> one can look upon all these beautiful and wonderful things and believe that there is no God. It seems to me they must be very ignorant or possessed of a very narrow soul."</p>
               <p>"It is not of ten the ignorant that are sceptics. The less of education a man possesses the more of that sublime quality which some find it so difficult to exercise, he seems to have—<emph>faith!</emph> without which there is no comfort for us here and no blessed rest hereafter. But it is not common in these days to meet one who <emph>really</emph> does not believe in the Deity; but alas! there are too many even yet who reject our divine, our matchless Saviour, and even in this enlightened Christian land."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me such persons <emph>cannot</emph> be sincere."</p>
               <p>"I confess it does to me also sometimes. And while I would advocate the utmost liberty as far as forms and sectarian opinions are concerned, I have little toleration or patience for a man who professes not to believe in the divinity of Christ."</p>
               <p>"I could have no respect or regard for such a person, I am sure, no matter how nearly related to me by the ties of blood he might be. Our blessed, lovely Saviour!" she continued musingly. "Whose career was one long triumph of divinity over humanity, and whose glorious ascension set the seal to his claim to be the 'Son of God'! Whose life was perfectly lovely, blameless, and without guile."</p>
               <p>"The world has not changed, my little friend, and now, as ever, there are some who scoff at the gentle Nazarene. I always wish to pray for such to feel His power in their souls, and let their hearts convince their intellects, until, like the faithless Thomas, they cry, 'My Lord and my God!'"</p>
               <p>They stood in silence for a few moments longer, gazing at the lovely panorama spread before, and then began to retrace their steps, as dinner had been ordered at the hotel, and they did not care to miss it, or encounter the questions which their absence would be<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6505-00000050"/> certain to excite. But in the descent, Berrie, again asserting her independence of her companion's assistance, turned her foot upon a low but narrow ledge, and, with a little cry, had fallen before the gentleman, who was a few steps in advance, could prevent.</p>
               <p>"Are you hurt, Berrie? I am afraid you are," said Mr. Adair anxiously, as he bent over the prostrate girl, and assisted her to her feet.</p>
               <p>"I have sprained my ankle a little, I believe," her white lips testifying to the pain she was suffering from it. "If I can sit down for a moment, I think it will be better; it is not serious, I presume," she said bravely, and soon professed her ability to proceed.</p>
               <p>"This comes of your being so exceedingly independent, Berrie. What will your sister say to my permitting you to get hurt in this manner? Lean as heavily as you like, child," he added, as he drew her hand within his arm.</p>
               <p>"Belle will say nothing that can reflect upon you, Mr. Adair, I assure you! She knows how wilful I am, and you certainly are not in the least in fault. Do not blame yourself, I beg."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>should</emph> have walked after you instead of in advance; then I might possibly have prevented it," he returned regretfully.</p>
               <p>"I do not think it! I have only my own carelessness to blame. But it is better now; I can walk with comparative comfort."</p>
               <p>"I could carry you with ease, were it not for the 'eyes of lookers-on,'" he said.</p>
               <p>"I could not permit it!" she returned quickly. "Not, at least, while I am able to take a step. You are very kind," she added, gratefully.</p>
               <p>"Not at all! I wish I could make it easier for you. I am afraid it pains you more than you will own; you look rather white."</p>
               <p>"Do I? It is the first time in my life, then, I fancy!" and her laugh dispelled for the moment his anxiety.</p>
               <p>They reached the hotel at last, and there was the usual quantity of questions and comments, from which Berrie shrank with more discomfort than her swelling ankle caused. A shower of cold water relieved the latter somewhat, and dinner over, she succeeded in getting on board the yacht with comparative comfort, although it had already commenced swelling considerably.</p>
               <p>It was about seven o'clock when the little vessel weighed anchor, and with her merry party of the morning glided from her moorings at the wharf. The clouds in the far west were glowing with all the splendor of an American summer sunset, and, bending over the heaving waters, left therein their own fair reflection. But the brilliant colors, after lingering for a while, slowly faded into cold gray and scarcely less cold blue; the stars peeped shyly out, one by one, from behind the azure curtains that veiled the heavenly windows; and the moon, riding triumphantly and serenely above in her chariot of state, tipped with silver the reaches of dark water in the distance, while phosphorescent lights tinged the nearer waves with gleams of living fire. The air was clear, and soft, and cool,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6505-00000051"/> wind and tide condescended to be propitious, and the little craft bounded gaily along over the sparkling waters; while the curtains of darkness, through which stole gleams of silvery moonlight, wrapped them in their sable, impalpable folds.</p>
               <p>"Sing, Berrie, sing!" cried Jennie Wardell, as the gay conversation flagged for a moment. "Music on the waves is so exquisite! Sing, please, my dear."</p>
               <p>"Do not urge me, Jennie, ask some one else. I cannot sing where there are so many."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! are there more here than there were in the exhibition hall at school, when you graduated? We cannot excuse you, please, sing!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, but that was different!"</p>
               <p>"Come, don't require urging, like most of the young ladies. 'Birds that can sing, and won't sing, must be made to sing,' you know."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you would find that difficult. I am not accustomed to compulsion. But what shall it be?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, what are you familiar with? Oh, 'Murmuring Sea' is pretty and appropriate also. Can you sing it?"</p>
               <p>"I can sing my part, but it is a duet you know, and I do not think I could sustain both parts very well."</p>
               <p>"Oh surely! Let's see! Who of the gentlemen in the party sing? Mr. Wright?"</p>
               <p>"Never! I assure you, Miss Wardell!"</p>
               <p>"No? Well, Mr. Adair, you do! I am positive I have heard you."</p>
               <p>"Indeed?" he quietly returned.</p>
               <p>"I was not aware that you sang, Mr. Adair. Can you take the other part to the duet in question?" inquired Berrie.</p>
               <p>"I will do my best to assist you, Miss Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Very well; you take the lead, I believe!" and in a pure cultivated tenor he began the beautiful air, Berrie joining in her turn with her clear, sweet soprano, while the vibrating sea-born echoes added their accompaniment to the charm of the blended voices. Other songs followed, in many of which the greater portion of the party joined, and as the nine o'clock bells struck their first peal, the vessel touched the wharf, and their excursion was among the scenes of the past.</p>
               <p>A cry of pain escaped involuntarily from Berrie's lips as she attempted to use the injured limb, and she soon found it would be impossible to reach home by walking. Some lads were standing idly on the wharf, and Mr. Adair despatched one of them for a carriage, which speedily made its appearance, and Berrie was lifted carefully in, followed, of course, by her companion.</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you," said Mr. Adair just as they reached the house, "how much I regret that such an accident should have happened to you at all, and more particularly while under my protection. I am afraid your mother will never trust you with me again."</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not think it, Mr. Adair, nor reproach yourself in the least. I cannot bear that you should, as you were in no degree in fault."</p>
               <p>"I cannot cease to do so, nevertheless! I shall call in the morning to see how you are!" and when he<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6505-00000052"/> lifted her from the carriage, notwithstanding her protestations, his strong arms carried her gently and easily up the walk.</p>
               <p>Belle had returned home immediately after their landing, to prepare her mother for Berrie's accident, lest she should be alarmed at her manner of returning home, and as Eugene Adair placed her on the sofa in the parlor, Mrs. Burton said to him: "I am afraid my wilful little daughter here has given you a great deal of trouble to-day. She is so venturesome and independent that I wonder she is alive. She was always in trouble for her recklessness when a child, and I am afraid she has not outgrown all childish things. But I am thankful the matter is no worse."</p>
               <p>"As I am also, I assure you! I regret the accident more than I can say!" returned the gentleman earnestly.</p>
               <p>"But it was all my own carelessness, and no one else is at all to blame," protested Berrie.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I dare say! I am sure Mr. Adair took quite as good care of you as you would allow," said her mother. "But I will doctor it for you, and it will be better in a day or two, I presume, dear."</p>
               <p>"I hope and trust so!" said Mr. Adair, as he bent over her to bid her good-by. "Good night, my little friend!" he added softly. "I shall hope to see you <emph>much</emph> better to-morrow. You are a brave little girl," and bidding the others good evening he took his departure.</p>
               <p>Berrie with much difficulty and some pain succeeded in getting upstairs, and was soon in bed, and while the strong arms of her "friend" seemed still lingering around her, and his low, cultivated tones yet ringing in her ears, the angel of sleep bent lovingly over her, soothing the unquiet nerves, quelling the spirit of restlessness which seemed in possession of her, and bringing for a time, unconsciousness alike of pleasure and of pain.</p>

               <p>HATTIE, dear, run down and ask Belle if she will come up and help me dress. I believe I will get up, and I do not think I could make my toilet without some assistance. If she is busy tell her I am in no hurry," said Berrie, on the morning following the excursion, as her little sister was leaning on her pillow playing with the unconfined but tumbled ringlets, and interspersing her lively chat with many loving kisses.</p>
               <p>Hattie obeyed, and Miss Burton soon after made her appearance, carrying in her hand a beautiful bouquet of water-lilies.</p>
               <p>"So you think you will get up, do you, my pretty invalid?" said Belle gaily, as she entered the room. Adding: "Our handsome Eugene was here a few moments ago, to know how you were; and see what he brought me!" with a mischievous sparkle in her fine dark eyes. "Are they not lovely? Don't you wish they were yours? Oh, I'll let you have one scent of them," and she held them to her sister's face, and then drew them tantalizingly away.</p>
               <p>"Oh, give them to me! I know they are for me!" exclaimed Berrie, instantly detecting the ruse. "People always send flowers to invalids, you know!" she continued laughingly.</p>
               <p>"For you? the idea! Do you suppose that Eugene Adair would send anything of the kind to a little girl like you? Haven't I known him longer than you have, ever so much?"</p>
               <p>"I don't care if you have! I know he sent them to me; he likes little girls!" she added, blushing a little as she thought how soft and low had been the tones in which he had called her thus the previous day.</p>
               <p>"Does he? indeed! perhaps he meant them for Hattie then. Are they not lovely, Berrie?" and she held them tantalizingly just out of reach.</p>
               <p>"You provoking girl!" exclaimed Berrie, laughing, making an attempt to grasp the hand which was holding the flowers, and succeeding at length in rifling it of its fragrant dewy contents. "I don't see where he procured them? Do you, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, what a thief! I'll tell him when I see him that you stole all the pretty posies he gave me to-day," said Belle, pretending to feel greatly aggrieved.</p>
               <p>"Well, do! I don't care as long as I have the<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6505-00000054"/> flowers. But what did he say?" she asked, blushingly, and hiding her tell-tale face among the fragrant lilies she held.</p>
               <p>"Say? He said you were the naughtiest girl he knew, and he'd never take you on such an excursion again; that he didn't wish to be remembered to you, and he should call this evening, but hoped you wouldn't be downstairs. There! are you satisfied?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you are like the most of your sex, Belle; your no means yes; and I may take what you say <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au contraire,</foreign> may I not?" returned Berrie laughing, but still averting her face.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I dare say your vanity would suggest that you may. But you will see to-night how disappointed he will be to find you downstairs, when he was hoping for a tête-à-tête with me."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there would be no chance for that, as Mr. Wright would be certain to be around," Berrie replied mischievously, while it was her sister's turn to look confused.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wright is going to Boston to-day," Belle answered more quietly.</p>
               <p>"Indeed? how <emph>will</emph> you get through the evening without him, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know, I am sure! But Eugene would console me, if you only were not in the way."</p>
               <p>"'Eugene!' how familiar we are getting! But you need not be so certain that I shall be down. I think I will play invalid, and remain up-stairs to-day."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! you will do nothing of the kind. You must go down, if I have to carry you," Belle replied, more earnestly.</p>
               <p>"I fancy you would not care to try that more than once. But I do not wish to prevent your anticipated tête-à-tête."</p>
               <p>"Well, it <emph>is</emph> a shame that you should, I know; still I don't see how it can be avoided. But, Berrie, it seems to me that Adair is getting very attentive," and Belle glanced furtively at her sister, as she prepared to assist her to arise.</p>
               <p>"Attentive to whom? yourself, Belle? Well, is not that what you desire?" the girl returned, her confusion painting a world of crimson roses on the olive cheeks still bent above the waxen lilies.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how innocent we are! Don't devour the flowers, Berrie, if your devoted did send them to you."</p>
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> devoted! Don't talk nonsense, Belle; he is old enough to be my father."</p>
               <p>"'Love counts time by heart-throbs, not by years!' and <q>

               <p>"I shall be very glad to, I am sure! But here! place these lilies in water, please. Are they not perfect!" with one more admiring glance and inhalation, ere she released them from her clasp.</p>
               <p>"I wish Belle wouldn't put such ideas in my head, or get them in her own, either!" mused Berrie, as she prepared to make her toilet. "Of course he does not<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6505-00000055"/> or will not care for a 'little girl' like me, except as a friend, as he said he did yesterday. He is so grand and noble, and so much older and wiser. If he were a younger man I should not feel so free With him; but of course his attentions do not mean anything, and he will go away by and by, and I probably shall never see him again," and more of regret than she would have been willing to confess mingled with the closing thoughts, which Belle interrupted by inquiring, "What dress shall I bring you Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know!" she replied. "Something pretty, I suppose, as it will have to suffice for all day."</p>
               <p>"All day! I should think it might. Why, what time do you think it is, Miss Indolence?" and she held. Berrie's watch, which was lying on the bureau, before her face.</p>
               <p>"Half-past twelve! Is it possible, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, Miss Berrie! Well, what dress?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, anything you like! I don't care! That pink wrapper, I think, with the white trimmings."</p>
               <p>"The most becoming dress you have! That looks as if you didn't care."</p>
               <p>"Well, I do not; I would as soon have anything else."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I suppose you wish to look the interesting invalid this evening, so I will let you have it. But novel-invalids always wear white or crimson, you know."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am not in a novel, and the pink is near enough to crimson, I presume. A lace collar, Belle, the linen are not 'becoming' you know!" with a little laugh.</p>
               <p>"Will you have your watch?"</p>
               <p>"No, I don't care about it! Yes I will, too, I think."</p>
               <p>"You may wish to count the hours until to-night!" said Belle, teasingly.</p>
               <p>"Surely! so bring it along," and her sister threw the gleaming chain around her neck, and tucked the watch in the embroidered belt of her wrapper.</p>
               <p>"There! I you are as sweet as Eugene's lilies!" said Belle, kissing her.</p>
               <p>"Flatterer! But take them down to the parlor, Belle; or stay, leave two or three of them up here."</p>
               <p>"Pa will be home soon; you had better wait until he comes before you go down." And Miss Burton left the room, carrying in her hand the fragrant bouquet of lilies. Some late blush-roses were added, with geranium leaves, a few sprigs of heliotrope, and some trailing myrtle and ivy, and the whole, tastily arranged in a handsome vase, greeted Berrie as she entered the parlor, leaning heavily on her father's arm.</p>
               <p>"What will you have, Berrie, to amuse yourself with?" inquired Belle, entering the room a few minutes later.</p>
               <p>"Oh, a book, I suppose! Give me my 'Wanderer' until you are dressed, and then I expect <emph>you</emph> to amuse me!" archly.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! just as if I had nothing else to do!"</p>
               <p>"And, Belle," she called as her sister was leaving the room, "bring down that little sacque I am embroidering for Hattie, please, when you come; I will sew a little, I think."</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6505-00000056"/>
               <p>"Very well;" and Miss Burton passed on up the stairs.</p>
               <p>For an hour or two, Berrie was left alone, half reclining in the depths of her easy chair, drawn close to the open window of the darkened parlor, reading favorite passages in the little book she held, or leaning her soft cheek in her hand, musing—of what? Something pleasant, to judge by the dreamy smile on her lips, and the flush which warmed the olive of her dusky cheek, until it rivalled in color the rose of her high-cut embroidered dress.</p>
               <p>How delicious is the dreamy languor that gently steals over one, on a warm, sultry afternoon in midsummer, when, disregarding all calls to duty or labor, one lounges indolently in the depths of a luxurious chair, where close-drawn blinds shut out the gleaming golden sunlight, while without the summer breeze in gentle sighs floats lazily past, and the hum of insects, the song of locusts, and the warble of happy birds, blend in one harmonious chorus, or with dreamy monotone lull the senses to even deeper oblivion. And when to this are added the rose-hued dreams of youth, thrilling with their perfect beauty and sweetness, the untried heart of the dreamer,—a heart that has yet learned no lessons of distrust or regret,—how blissful seems the spell!</p>
               <p>I would fain linger over the record of this summer, which to the gentle girl was one glittering chain of "linked sweetness, long drawn out," while she was yet <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Standing with reluctant feet,</l>
                        <l>Where the brook and river meet,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> before womanhood's consciousness had come knocking loudly at her awakened heart, ere her lips had tasted the bitter draught of sorrow, or her fair young head was crowned with woman's coronet of aggravating and impotent despair.</p>
               <p>But the happy reverie of the girl was interrupted at last by the entrance of her sister, looking fresh and cool, in her delicate flowing robes; and while the fingers of each were busied with some pretty needle-work, the gay conversation never flagged. Jennie Wardell ran in for a few moments, to talk over the events of the preceding day, and learn how Berrie was after her accident; then came the early tea, and Berrie was assisted out to the dining-room,—which was in an extension on the same floor—and was barely ensconced again in her easy chair by the window, when the doorbell rang.</p>
               <p>Miss Burton replied to the summons, and found, as she expected, Eugene Adair awaiting admission.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Mr. Adair; walk in the parlor, and please excuse me for a few minutes; you will find Berrie there," and she opened the door and ushered him into her sister's presence.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Good evening, Berrie! So you are sufficiently recovered from the effects of your accident to get down stairs! I am <emph>very</emph> glad, I assure you." And he bent over the little hand of the girl, as laughing and blushing she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I am better, thank you! but you will please excuse me from rising."</p>
               <p>"Certainly! do not attempt it," and he drew a chair<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6505-00000057"/> near her own, and sat down, remarking absently: "So you are much better!"</p>
               <p>"Much better, thank you, yes! although not able to use my foot much as yet."</p>
               <p>"I presume not, but trust you will be soon. I see you received my lilies!" drawing the vase toward him to inhale their fragrance.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, and thank you so much! How very lovely they are!"</p>
               <p>"Exquisitely! I am glad you were pleased. You like flowers?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, so very much! I am teasing Pa to add a conservatory to the house, that we may have them all the year."</p>
               <p>"Bristol people generally seem very fond of them, to judge from the numerous gardens one sees."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe they are!"</p>
               <p>"And what is your favorite?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I scarcely know! I love and admire so many. Pansies, fuchsias, geraniums, carnations, lilies—oh, everything in the shape of flowers!" she continued, laughingly. "I am most partial to sweet-scented plants, however."</p>
               <p>"Then you like the tube-rose, and this beautiful wild lily queen!" he remarked, touching caressingly the waxen petals of the flowers in the vase.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, of course! Pond-lilies are almost peerless. I am particularly fond of wild flowers, if I may gather them myself; and of all climbing plants or shrubs, I think the wistaria the most beautiful. I have gazed at the graceful, delicate clusters in admiration, until I longed to lay my cheek to the lilac beauties, or press their dewy, fragrant clusters to my very lips."</p>
               <p>"You are enthusiastic!" he smiled.</p>
               <p>She laughed a little confusedly and returned: "I am afraid I am! but my love for flowers amounts almost to a passion."</p>
               <p>"A very innocent and beautiful one, my little girl, and I trust you may not find that <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'The heart that is soonest awake to the flowers,</l>
                        <l>Is always the first to be touched by the thorns.'</l>

                  </q> But do you understand their language?"</p>
               <p>"Very little, although I have one or two books on the subject."</p>
               <p>"Then if I should present you with one of these fair blush-roses, a leaf of rose-geranium, a sprig of heliotrope and myrtle, thus forming a bouquet"—drawing each from the vase before him as he spoke—"you would not know what sentiments I wished to convey?" and he glanced furtively at the down-cast 'face as he presented her the bouquet thus formed.</p>
               <p>Lower drooped the fair, young head over the dainty embroidery she held, and the fragrant cluster of flowers, until the flossy curls hid the crimsoning cheeks, as she replied softly, "I fear I should not; no!"</p>
               <p>"Shall I read them to you?" in a tone as soft and low as her own.</p>
               <p>"If you please!"</p>
               <p>"The rose is an emblem of your own fair youth; the geranium suggests that though many are lovely you excel all; the heliotrope whispers of devoted attachment<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6505-00000058"/> ment, and the little sprig of myrtle assures you that absence cannot conquer affection. Is not that comprehensive for an impromptu boquet?"and he laughed softly as the fair face still remained hidden and the rosy lips unclosed for no reply, smiled also to think that he had so far renewed his departed youth as to be talking thus to a young and lovely lady in the mystic language of flowers.</p>
               <p>He took her hand and attempted to look in the averted face, saying softly, as she drew her hand away and turned still farther from him, "What have I done, Berrie, that you will not look at me? Do you not like your flowers?" Then laughing again, the low, conscious, significant laugh, which the girl thought so provoking, as he still received no answer from her lips.</p>
               <p>Berrie was painfully embarrassed, and thought longingly, "Oh, if Belle would only come in! What <emph>can</emph> keep her so long away!"</p>
               <p>A silence of some moments succeeded, and then Mr. Adair said gently, as he drew from his pocket a little blue-covered book, and placed it in her lap, among the embroidery and flowers; "Berrie, I have brought you something to amuse you during a few hours of your confinement to the house; will you not look up and tell me if you are pleased?"</p>
               <p>With a little sigh of relief at the change of subject, she glanced down at the, book she held, and exclaimed as the title met her eye: "Lucile? Oh, thank you! I have so much wished to peruse it; I do not know but I shall be thankful for my accident, since it procures me such a pleasure," and she looked up gratefully, and with a laugh wholly unembarrassed, although her confusion's sweet blushes still lingered on her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I wonder you have never read it previously, as you admire the author so much."</p>
               <p>"I had no opportunity while at school, and supposing I could obtain it here, I neglected to purchase one in Boston. But when I reached home, I found it was not to be procured in Bristol. I intended sending to Providence for it soon."</p>
               <p>"What is this you have been reading/?" and he took from the table a book similar in size and binding to the one he had brought.</p>
               <p>"Only my Wanderer!" she returned, without looking up, and glancing eagerly over the pages of the book she held.</p>
               <p>He opened it, and the first thing that caught his eye was the inscription traced on its fly-leaf:</p>

               </q>
               <p>Backward flew his thoughts to that lovely evening not yet two weeks previous, when first his eyes had dwelt with pleasure on the lovely face of his companion, recalling with a painful thrill the merry brown eyes that had looked with such audacious mischief in those of the girl, and the laughing voice which had addressed her in such familiar and affectionate tones. "Devoted" to her, without a shadow of doubt, was the gay young man; but was his evident attachment<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6505-00000059"/> ment to the girl reciprocated, or was it with friendly eyes alone that she met the impassioned glances of her friend?</p>
               <p>But really, what was it to him in either case! Why should he care to whose heart her own girlish one responded, or who held the magic key to the storehouse of her innocent affections! Not a brief two weeks had elapsed since he saw her first; and was his heart already swelling with jealousy, lest some other face than his was enshrined in the holy of holies of the fair girl's mind? That heart which he had for so long deemed impervious to all emotions of love, desire, regret or jealousy? Had this little girl, with her gentle voice, beguiled his peace from his keeping; with her soft, fair hand struck down the barriers of coldness or distrust that the past years of treachery had thickly reared around the inner sanctuary of his tortured soul?</p>
               <p>Alas! in those few brief moments that he sat with the open book in his hand, in which was traced the inscription that had so startled him, he had looked his future in the face; had realized that with a life's only love, the strong, unconquerable passion of mature manhood—to which the loves of his earlier days were but as a zephyr's breath compared to the might of a tempest—he worshipped this gentle little girl, and that in all probability it would prove as hopeless as it was impassioned. It seemed to him impossible that she, in all the flush of her lovely girlhood, with the rich, warm life of youth bounding strongly and sweetly through her veins, with all before her the bitter-sweet dreams of womanhood, and the crowning loveliness of a sanctified and reciprocal attachment, could voluntarily bestow a thought of love upon him, who had left behind him his own long faded youth; or ever gladly link her own bright, joyous life, with one shadowed by a past's yet unconquered sorrows, and the "harvest of barren regrets "which he had reaped from the carelessly sown seed of his early manhood.</p>
               <p>"What was there in common between them, he bitterly asked of himself! He, a man, when she, an unconscious babe, lay cradled in her mother's arms: he who had drained the cup of worldly pleasure almost to the very dregs, before the glittering chalice had reached her innocent lips, and had waded far through the stream of aggravating sorrow, ere her dainty feet had touched the tiniest waves of the turbid, swelling waters.</p>
               <p>No! a life like his, so dark, so unattractive, could hold no magic to draw that bright one from her own dear home of peace and love. She would doubtless listen to his tale of a strong, o'ermastering passion with pitying kindness, then turn aside to smile with heavenly sweetness on one who was yet crowned with the diadem of youth and gayety, and could respond to all the joy and mirthfulness of her own happy heart.</p>
               <p>The picture stood clearly before him. Would he not be blindly foolish to take of it any other view than this?</p>
               <p>Yes, he would be generous; and by and by, after he had lingered a little longer in the sunshine of her presence, would go away, without distressing the tender<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6505-00000060"/> heart of the girl by the knowledge that the wealth of a strong man's passionate and adoring love had been lavishly poured upon her in a sweet but "a wasted shower."</p>
               <p>The opening door and Hattie's subsequent entrance interrupted his train of painful, self-sacrificing thought, and aroused Berrie to a consciousness of her rudeness in allowing herself to become so absorbed in a book, to the utter neglect of her visitor.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Adair!" she said deprecatingly, as she looked up with a little sigh of regret at leaving the fascinating narrative. "I am afraid I have been rudely inattentive. I forgot everything but 'Lucile' and the result of her letter to 'Lord Alfred,'" laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Did you?" with a little pang that his presence was of so little moment to her. "Well, I was so absorbed in this little book I hold, that I did not notice how you were occupied; so I do not see that there is aught to excuse, else I must beg for forgiveness also. And how is Miss Hattie this evening?" taking the little hand of the child as she came close to his chair.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am well, thank you!" with a toss of the flowing curls. "But I don't think you took very good care of my sister Berrie yesterday; did you, Mr. Adair?" archly glancing up into his face.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I? indeed! ask your sister what she thinks about it," said the gentleman, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Hattie dear, you shouldn't speak so to Mr. Adair," reproved Berrie.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hattie and I are very old friends Miss Berrie, and are privileged to say anything we like to each other; are we not, little one?"</p>
               <p>"Hattie is a spoiled child at all events, I am afraid," said Berrie, smiling to note how careful he was to supply the formal "Miss" when others were present, though since their scramble over the rocks the previous day, he had never used it when they were alone together.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I suppose we are!" returned the child in answer to his inquiry. "But, Mr. Adair, have you found out yet what sort of a berry my sister is?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair laughed, and gently pulling the tempting ringlets of the little girl, said; "So you have not forgotten our old quarrel as yet! Well, I do not know that I have come to any decision in regard to the matter; can you not help me to do so?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> think she is a strawberry, if anything," said the child, "because they are real nice, and so is she," nestling up to her sister's side, and resting her head caressingly against Berrie's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair thought with a pang of the merry fellow who thus addressed the girl, but repressing all evidence of it, returned: "Well, I do not deny that she is as fair and sweet as the luscious berry you have named, my little girl, but still I think holly-berries most suited to her, and would choose them for her emblem, instead. So you may call her Strawberry if you will, and I will think of her as a peerless, beautiful holly-berry."</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Adair, don't you think <emph>black-berry</emph> would be more suitable still?" inquired Berrie mischievously; but blushing at this flattering discussion of her in her very presence.</p>
               <p>"I cannot say that I do!" he returned, 'laughing<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6505-00000061"/> also. "I would like to see you decked and crowned with holly-berries, they would become you royally." With a glance of undisguised admiration.</p>
               <p>"Come and eat your Christmas dinner with us then, and possibly you may be gratified," interposed Miss Burton gaily, coming forward at that moment, she having entered the room unperceived in time to hear the last remark.</p>
               <p>"Thank you. Miss Burton; it would give me more pleasure than I can say to do so, but I fear that ere that I shall be far distant from here."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? I am very sorry!" returned Belle, quietly. "Hattie, ma wants you."</p>
               <p>"Good night, Berrie!" and the little girl's red lips were pouted to receive her sister's kiss.</p>
               <p>"Good night, Mr. Adair!" giving him her hand, and at his request shyly allowing him also to touch her lips with a good-night caress.</p>
               <p>"Was that your sister's kiss or your own that you gave me, Hattie?" he murmured so low that no one else heard the inquiry.</p>
               <p>But she answered aloud, laughing archly. "Oh, Berrie's, I think, Mr. Adair!" and ran lightly from the room.</p>
               <p>Belle smiled, half guessing what had elicited Hattie's reply, and the conversation became general.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair, at their request, sang for them, Belle playing his accompaniments, and early arose to take his departure.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Miss Berrie; I trust you will be wholly recovered soon. You have amusement for a few tedious hours in the book in your lap. You will find it a rare treat."</p>
               <p>"I am sure of it! it is charming, I know, and I thank you so much for bringing it to me."</p>
               <p>"I owed you some amends for not taking better care of you." And bidding Miss Burton good-evening, he hastily took his departure.</p>

               <p>MR. ADAIR, I am happy to return you your copy of 'Lucile,' with many, many thanks to you for the pleasure its perusal has given me," said Berrie, as she entered the parlor one evening about a week later, to find, as she expected, the gentleman there.</p>
               <p>Her recovery from the effects of her accident had been rapid and entire, and it was with her usual light and graceful step that she entered the room. The gentleman addressed, had, during her confinement to the house, been a frequent and welcome visitor; thus their acquaintance had most amicably progressed, and their friendship become a settled thing.</p>
               <p>Many an ache had the strong, passionate heart of the man endured, as he watched the lovely girl, and realized that it would be folly to aspire to her hand, questioning, even should she listen with favor to his suit, if he could trust the future constancy of one whose heart had never yet been tried, and whose affection for him—did it exist—might prove but a passing fancy, a romantic girl's first preference, that fleeting emotion which so nearly resembles the sweet "grand passion," but is to that as the rippling waves of the tiny streamlet are to the mighty swellings of the throbbing, impulsive sea.</p>
               <p>"You liked it then, of course!" the gentleman returned smilingly, in answer to her remark, as he took the book from her hand.</p>
               <p>"More, far more than I can tell you! I am bankrupt for words to express my admiration!" was the laughing, but earnest response. "I thought I had read beautiful things before, but nothing to compare with this."</p>
               <p>"Not even your favorite 'Wanderer?'"</p>
               <p>"Not even that, no! That is lovely in its way, and charms with its very vagueness, had it no other attractions; but 'Lucile' is perfect! I would not have it altered, I think, in any respect."</p>
               <p>"What an enthusiastic little girl you are, Berrie!" he said with his rarely sweet smile, and in a low and almost tender tone.</p>
               <p>"Am I?" she laughed. "That is because I <emph>am</emph> a 'little girl' I suppose, is it not? Will time wear away<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6505-00000063"/> my enthusiasm, do you think, <emph>my friend?</emph>" with such a bewitching glance, and intonation of the two last words, that, had they been alone together, I could not have answered for the man's self-control. How he longed to fold in his arms the rounded, girlish form, and press with love's sweet kisses the rosy, smiling mouth!</p>
               <p>But he only answered softly and a little sadly: "I fear it may, my dear little girl; but I would pray most earnestly that it may never be damped by sorrow's heavy, unrelenting rain,—that your love for, and joy in the beauties of music, poetry, and nature, may never be dimmed by life's sternest, bitterest trials."</p>
               <p>"Thanks for your kind wishes," she murmured; "but I suppose I must have my share of the troubles of life. No one escapes wholly, do they, Mr. Adair?"</p>
               <p>"No one, my child, believe me! are they seemingly never so prosperous and happy. 'Every heart knoweth its own bitterness,' you know. So you think 'Lucile' quite perfect, do you?" he concluded, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I consider it so, yes! What a lovely character is hers. Do you not think so?"</p>
               <p>"I do, indeed! Thoroughly human, yet such as one rarely meets. But would you not have liked it better had she married the Duke?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no! that would have spoiled her character entirely!"</p>
               <p>"But he loved her so well, and with her royal nature she could have been so true to him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but false to her first and only love. How <emph>could</emph> she marry him, not caring for him save as a friend! Besides, she was too good for him; far above him in life and character. I did feel so vexed, when he was taunting her with being the cause of his wasted life, that she did not remind him of how he had wrecked <emph>her</emph> happiness as well."</p>
               <p>"Which she did at the last!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but only in sheer desperation at his failure to comply with her wishes for Alfred's son, and then merely telling him that but for him, she might have been pleading for her own boy instead of another's."</p>
               <p>"Do you like Lord Alfred—and his wife?"</p>
               <p>"Not over well! Matilda was Lucile's rival, and I believe I was a little jealous for her—" smilingly, "besides, she has too little force of character. And Lord Alfred is too inconstant and suspicious. I have no sympathy for him in any sorrow. He was not worthy the noble woman he resigned so lightly, not only once but twice; while she, through all, was true and constant to her love for him."</p>
               <p>"Like a true woman?" smilingly.</p>
               <p>"Like a true woman, yes!" she replied archly.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, have you those elements of truth and constancy in your own nature?" he asked abruptly, in a tone so low that no one else could have distinguished the words, and with so much of concentrated earnestness in eye and voice, that as she looked up half-startled, she answered hesitatingly:</p>
               <p>"How should I know? I have never been tried; but, Mr. Adair, I believe I have!" with a far-off look in the uplifted eyes, as if she was attempting to divine the tests and conquests of the future.</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6505-00000064"/>
               <p>"I believe it too, my little friend!" he returned, and eyes and lips smiled his gratification in the belief.</p>
               <p>At this moment Miss Wardell was announced. After a time she inquired abruptly: "By the way, Berrie, did you know your old friend, Ella Spencer, was married?"</p>
               <p>"No indeed! is that so? to Charley Andrews?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, of course! He is in the Navy, you know, and received orders to sail the very day appointed for the wedding; so they were married about an hour before he left."</p>
               <p>"She remaining at home?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! He thought he would secure her, I suppose, lest some one else should take his place before his return," laughingly.</p>
               <p>"I do not think I should care to marry one I could not trust better than that. If she was capable of being inconstant to him, she could not make him a desirable wife," said Berrie.</p>
               <p>"You think, Miss Berrie, that if she loved him she could not have been untrue—that absence would make no difference" Mr. Adair asked a little eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I think so, yes!" returned Berrie, blushing.</p>
               <p>"As I do also!" he said, earnestly and bitterly.</p>
               <p>"You are forgetting your book, Mr. Adair," said Berrie, as he was leaving the room somewhat later in the evening.</p>
               <p>"Surely!" he returned, taking it from the table, and after a moment's hesitation again laying it down, saying carelessly as he turned to the door, "You may as well keep it, Berrie, I have another copy at home," and ignoring her confusedly murmured thanks, he hastily took his leave.</p>
               <p>Several weeks passed rapidly along, diversified by engagements and amusements of various kinds, suited to the place and season, and making this summer to the lively girl the happiest of her brief, sunshiny life. And yet it was a happiness somewhat fitful and feverish, full of restlessness, gayety and excitement.</p>
               <p>Messrs. Wright and Adair still lingered in the lovely old town, and were, as usual, frequent visitors at the Burton mansion; and though the latter was ever a welcome guest, a favored escort, it would not be supposed that he alone paid court to the pretty girl, or attended her to the entire exclusion of other and younger men. He did not himself expect it; and though he gazed at her with longing eyes, and suffered tortures of jealous pain as she coquetted with other of her gentlemen acquaintances, no thought of censure or hardness toward her dimmed the brightness of his love for her, no word of unkindness or coldness ever passed his lips to one who thus played with the happiness of a heart whose every pulsation answered to her magic rule alone. Outwardly calm and serene, ever in his bearing to her the tender, gentle friend, he had succeeded in persuading her, at least, if he had not himself, that only thoughts and feelings of friendly regard actuated him, that only a friend's indifferent place could she ever occupy in a heart whose aspirations evidently could but reach far above her humble self.</p>
               <p>That she loved him, she did not acknowledge even to her own heart; nor did she attempt to analyze<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6505-00000065"/> the feeling of perfect content and happiness which she experienced in his presence, or the restlessness and vague disatisfaction that she felt when others claimed her attention and smiles. Coquet as she might with those who gathered around her, bright as was her smile and gay her retort to others' lively sallies, it was with a subdued but thrilling pleasure that she turned from them to him, to read in his kindly eyes the tender regard for her that never wavered, to feel that in him she had ever, as he had pledged himself to be, a true and tender friend. And yet she turned from him also, sometimes, with a sigh of vague and undefined regret, whose occasion she could not herself have explained,—a sense of something wanting, a distance or coolness in his bearing to her that chilled and disappointed her. She did not dream that the icy manner which so wounded her sensitive heart, was but the snowy crust that concealed below the raging fires of a living volcano; but the calmness which hid the utter blackness of a hopeless despair;—that at that very moment he was longing with almost unconquerable vehemence to take her to his passionate heart, and murmur in her ear all the vast wealth and power of the love for her whose outward repression was sapping the vital forces of his grand and noble heart, and giving to his manner a distance and coldness which could alone conceal the struggle and triumph that was daily and almost hourly renewed;—had not learned as yet, to "so read that strange book, man's heart, as to recognize in his self-control the strongest evidence of <emph>his</emph> love, and her, power."</p>
               <p>In those days she could not reason—could not discuss, even in her own mind, the motives and acts of others—could only <emph>feel;</emph> and, blindly swayed by impulse, guarded, as well as might be, by maidenly reticence, by laughing repartee, by reckless gayety, the inner sanctuary of her soul, which was, even to herself, a chasm filled only with chaos and disorder.</p>
               <p>Intimate as was their acquaintance, frequent as was their friendly intercourse, she could never hear his name without a provoking rush of crimson to her telltale cheek, could never meet his glance without a drooping of her own dusky eyes, never feel the pressure of his manly hand without an answering thrill which tingled from her finger-tips, through every fibre of her being. Others, though more attentive, far more eager for her favors, treating her with much more of flattering deference, and evidencing far greater anxiety for her regard than did he, had not the slightest power over her passions or impulses, could not touch with one vibrating thrill the innermost recesses of her royal nature, or win from her a single concession to their pleas for unwonted favors.</p>
               <p>Of the time when her friend should leave her, she did not allow herself to think. That such a time must come she knew full well; but putting far from her the evil day, she glided on, with no thought but for the present moment, no desire save for the happiness and pleasure of the day.</p>
               <p>But a time of awakening was at hand! Mr. Adair was sitting, late one evening, after his return from a visit to her, in the reading-room of his hotel, carelessly<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6505-00000066"/> glancing through the columns of a Providence evening paper, when one of the boarders, a somewhat intimate acquaintance, entered, and taking a seat near him, commenced a careless conversation on the topics of the day.</p>
               <p>Neither was very much interested that evening in the subjects they were discussing, and the conversation was flagging somewhat, when after an indolent yawn, the man inquired abruptly, and laughing archly, "Well, Adair, when is it to be?"</p>
               <p>"When is what to be?" he returned in surprise, glancing up at his interlocutor.</p>
               <p>"What? why the wedding, to be sure!"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you! I have heard of no prospective wedding of late."</p>
               <p>"Why, when is Miss Berrie Burton to be married?"</p>
               <p>The man's proud heart stood still for a moment in consternation and deadly pain, but he answered calmly, "I do not know, indeed! How should I? You will have to ask some one else besides me,"</p>
               <p>"Why, Adair! I am sure you ought to know, if any one," his friend returned laughingly.</p>
               <p>"I cannot see why!"</p>
               <p>"Why, haven't I been hearing from all sorts of sources, that yor were paying her particular attention; and heard this and that one of the fellows grumbling, that they stood no chance at all with the girl when that proud Adair was around? that he was evidently the favored suitor, etc. etc? I suppose the day isn't set yet; eh, Eugene?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is not, as far as I am concerned," he answered gravely, "and probably never will be. I have no reason to think myself preferred by the young lady, and have no intention of marrying any one, at least for the present. So do not mention the lady's name in connection with mine again, if you please. She is too young to be talked of in that manner, and it will do her no good. I am going to Washington in a few days, and expect to go abroad in October," and bidding his friend good-night, he retired to his room—but not to sleep.</p>
               <p>Back and forth in the large apartment he paced, his arms folded behind him, his head bent on his chest in deep and bitter revery, reviewing the unpleasant scenes of the past, revolving the prospects of the future, and with the facts and fancies of the present staring him in the face, until the grey dawn of the morning peeped shyly through the half-closed blinds; then throwing himself in a chair by the table, he bent his head on his folded arms, while tempests of hard, convulsive sighs shook his manly breast.</p>
               <p>During the troubled hours of that weary night, he had recalled in fancy's light every episode of his acquaintance with the little girl who had beguiled his heart from his keeping; every word, look or tone that could evince a perference for, or aversion to him; attempting to judge dispassionately of his chances with her, of the probability that her affection for him was a true and perfect love, which could stand any test of silence, absence, or other trial, which the circumstances of the future might impose. For, well as he loved her, necessary as she seemed to his happiness, he yet cherished<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6505-00000067"/> ished a slight distrust of her powers of constancy, a shrinking fear lest if he should succeed in winning the prize he coveted, it might prove to him a bane, rather than a blessing. Nor could one who knew his past, blame him for that. Its trials and experiences had not been such as to teach him faith, either in man's friendship or woman's constancy.</p>
               <p>At last his resolve was taken! He would spend one more evening in her society, mark every action and word of hers, attempt to divine the nature of her feelings for him, to rate the degree of his influence over her, the chances of his success as a suitor for her hand, and then to act accordingly. Did he see aught to encourage such a step, he would tell her of his love, explain the prospects of the future, attempt to make her understand what trials a reciprocity of his affection might impose upon her, and if she could respond to his passion, and was willing to bide whatever consequences it might bring, he would bless God for the precious gift, and trust in His hands the happiness of the future. But if, on the contrary, he should see nothing in her bearing to him to warrant such a step, or should she refuse to listen with favor to his plea, he would go away, and in a foreign land steel his heart to endure one more disappointment, the bitterest and cruelest of all his wretched life.</p>
               <p>To <emph>endure,</emph> not to conquer and forget! Alas! that is a task which no heart that has once been taught a lesson of true and enduring love, can ever perfectly learn. Time may ease a little the sharpness of the primary pain, lull, with the charms of other scenes and other interests, the tempest of the first great anguish, but there will still be days when the record of the past shall perforce be backward read, when the waves of the old stream of sorrow shall surge irresistibly over the levees which Time and Will have built to guard the citadel of the heart from the power of the undermining waters, and the howling tempest of desolation shall rage with renewed violence around the closely barred windows of the poor, weak human soul.</p>
               <p>Perchance a casual word once familiar to the loved one's lips, perhaps a strain of music, fraught with the old perilously sweet associations, or the perfume of a simple flower, whose fragrance almost intoxicated us in the old bewitching days of happiness, may waken the spirit of recollection, and annihilate all the hardly won serenity of the present days, all the fancied conquest of the old, old, desolating pain.</p>
               <p>The day wore wearily on, and evening found him again in the parlors of the Burton house. Berrie received him with her usual shy cordiality, but other visitors were present, and it chanced she had that day been so unmercifully rallied on her preference for the handsome Eugene, that with a woman's natural desire to prove their surmises false, and instinctive wish to shield from sight the preferences or passions of her girlish heart, although she treated him with her usual politeness, never during the progress of their acquaintance had she manifested so much indifference to him, betrayed in her manner so much of reserve or distance as on this evening. In vain he attempted to draw her into conversation; giving to his remarks only monosyllabic<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6505-00000068"/> syllabic replies, she turned from him with evident relief whenever she was addressed by others. At last he gave it up, and with such pangs of pain as few ever experienced, told himself that his fate was decided, and that it would be indeed utter folly to make to her any further advances.</p>
               <p>Poor little girl! she did not dream how much was pending on the acts of that one evening: that all her future happiness was hanging in the balance, and one touch from her careless, impulsive finger might turn the scales in favor of future wretchedness and despair.—Did not know that she had almost been crowned with the offered love of one her heart esteemed above all others, and by her acted coldness had cast it from her—never to be regained? We shall see!</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair early took his departure, and was the first to leave. Berrie at the time was absent from the room, but chancing to return at the moment he was taking his hat from the rack, met him in the hall.</p>
               <p>"What! going so soon, Mr. Adair?" she said gaily, realizing with a feeling of profound relief, that for the moment no curious eyes of others were upon her, marking every word and look.</p>
               <p>"Yes, going!" he returned smiling, although somewhat sadly. "Why should I not? Besides, I have some writing which must be done this evening. Goodnight, my <emph>little friend!</emph>" with a lingering emphasis on the last words, and extending his hand in farewell.</p>
               <p>"Good-night, if you <emph>must</emph> go!" she returned softly, and a little regretfully, placing her hand in his.</p>
               <p>He held it for a moment in both his own, looking down at her with eyes that told a tale which would not be repressed, and compelling, by force of magnetic attraction, the shy, conscious eyes of the girl to meet the thrilling glance of his. With cheeks flushed to a vivid crimson, lips that parted to emit the panting breath, a trembling form, and eyes filled to overflowing with a passion to which she had never given a name, she looked up to the equally conscious face of her companion.</p>
               <p>An eloquence so bewitching, an agitation so fascinating, a beauty so warm and brilliant, was more than the man, in his state of mind and heart, could withstand. With a sudden motion he dropped the little hand he held, drew the trembling form within his close embrace, and pressing with passionate kisses the tempting lips of the girl he adored, he murmured in the low and tender tones which love teaches to the human voice, "God bless you, my peerless Berrie!" released her as suddenly as he had clasped her, turned to the open door, and was gone,—shut from her sight by the curtains of darkness that fell behind him.</p>
               <p>For a moment she stood where he had left her, trembling with the consciousness of a new happiness, with the memory of the scene enacted but a moment before; realizing with regret that other guests were in the parlor, demanding her presence and attention, and feeling, with shrinking sensitiveness, that she could not go in at present and show them a face beaming with her newfound happiness, and flushed with the rosy dyes which the magnetic glance of her "friend" had called there. With a soft and silent step she ran lightly up the stairs,<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6505-00000069"/> and sat down for a moment by the open window of her darkened chamber, burying her face in her trembling hands, and endeavoring to calm the riotous pulses of a heart which had this evening been stirred to its very depths.</p>
               <p>This, then, was what it all meant! Not the cool, even pulsations of friendship, but the hot, impulsive throbbings of an o'ermastering love. Not the tranquil calmness of indifference, but the tumultuous restlessness of awakened and all-potent affection.</p>
               <p>Yes, she loved him! loved him with all the poetry, power and passion of her sensitive nature. Loved him with an affection which should never know shadow of change of diminution; which should but increase, and become more and more deep, sweet and enduring, as the passing years should glide swiftly along.</p>
               <p>Of course she believed it to be so! Who, under the spell of the divine passion, does not? Who, however fickle may be their natures, would confess, in the first flush of acknowledged affection, that it were possible they could change; that the emotions which were thrilling them to the very heart's core could grow fainter and fainter, until they were lost in the former calm of indifferent friendship. (Few natures are capable of a love that can stand <emph>any</emph> test;-silence, absence, coldness, distrust, estrangement, indifference, or contempt. Was hers such an one? Time alone would show.)</p>
               <p>Her sister's voice calling her from the hall below, aroused her to a sense of the matter-of-fact things of the present, and answering that she would be down immediately, she lighted the gas, smoothed her tumbled ringlets, bathed her still flushed cheeks, and after a moment passed slowly down the stairs.</p>
               <p>How her life had changed since she stood last within that familiar room! how sweet and significant it had become, bright and fair with the hopes of a newly acknowledged love. How could she tolerate these common-place people for the remainder of the evening!" Music, music!" was the cry as she entered the room, and without a remonstrance she submitted to be led to the piano, relieved that thus she could entertain the friends whom she felt it were impossible to talk to with any degree of connected and coherent conversation.</p>
               <p>Mechanically she sang and played whatever was called for, while ever before her was a face eloquent of a strong but undeclared passion, and the echo to all her songs was the tender "God bless yon," of the man she loved.</p>
               <p>As for him, with his thoughts all in a tumult, with his future course more than ever undecided, he reached his hotel to find a despatch awaiting him, demanding his immediate presence in Washington. Hastily packing some necessary garments in his portmanteau, preparatory to an early start in the morning, he quickly disrobed, and, not forgetting to thank the Author of all good for the blessings of the day, was speedily seeking the repose which he so much needed.</p>
               <p>But to him, as well as one other in that peaceful town that balmy summer night, sleep was a coy and unwilling guest; and in the broken slumbers of the one mingled a fair and sweetly flushing face, betraying the<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6505-00000070"/> love it had hitherto guarded so well, and in the fleeting dreams of the other manly lips took sudden, but not unwilling kisses from a trembling mouth, and a tender voice murmured words of fond endearment to one whose heart gave an instant and eloquent response.</p>
               <p>To the one it was the dawning of a girl's first sweet dream of love! To the other it was the fruition of a man's mature and over-mastering passion.</p>

               <p>WITH the happy consciousness of something pleasant having occurred on the previous day, Berrie opened her eyes upon the golden light of another morning, and then as the magic waves of recollection rolled over her soul, flooding it with sweet waters, she pillowed her flushed cheek in her hand, and with closed eyes and smiling lips, reviewed the events of the preceding evening, while every nerve thrilled with a new delight, as she recalled the impassioned demonstration of her hitherto reserved acquaintance; thrilled with the consciousness of the reciprocal passion which filled to overflowing her tender, youthful heart,<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6505-00000071"/> —that first young dream of love which is indeed so passing sweet.</p>
               <p>Again she felt the touch of his bearded lips upon her own, and seemed to hear still ringing in her ears his tender, heart-full "God bless you I" as he released her from his clasp, and vanished in the darkness of the night. Then pictured to herself his next coming; the words that could but follow what was so significant, the perfect delight of a fully reciprocal attachment. Longing for the hour that she felt certain would bring him, yet shrinking with maidenly modesty and diffidence from the first embarrassing moments which must succeed their next meeting, and blushing to the very roots of her beautiful hair, here, all alone by herself, at thought of being wooed in lover-fashion by this man whom she so much esteemed aud admired.</p>
               <p>Never doubting for an instant, in the guileless trust of her unsuspecting heart, which was yet untainted with experiences of deceit, yet untaught in lessons of distrust and disappointment, that the shades of evening would bring him to her side to complete the thrilling story so eloquently begun the previous night; never distrusting for a moment the purity and earnestness of the affection whose first expression had shaken her being to its very core, and robbed her of the last vestige of careless, unconscious girlhood, crowning her in a single moment with the diadem of perfected womanhood—that golden wreath of "bitter-sweets" which is, alas! so often baneful as well as beautiful.</p>
               <p>The day dragged, but not wearily; the hours moved so slowly onward that the previous night seemed to be far back in the sheaves of the reaper Time, but happy anticipation brightened every one as they passed, and lent to eye and lip a new brilliance and beauty.</p>
               <p>More than once her sister remarked: "What has come over you to-day, Berrie? you look as if you were brimming over with happiness." And each time she laughed an embarrassed little laugh, and changed the subject, or ran hastily away. It chanced to be a very busy day to both of them, therefore there was really little opportunity for confidential conversation, until, as night fell, they met in the parlor to welcome and entertain whoever might chance to call.</p>
               <p>My reader, if you are a woman, doubtless you still remember, be it ever so far back in the annals of the past, with what emotions of tremulous pleasure you arrayed yourself in dainty and beautiful robes in anticipation of the coming of one you loved, in the early days of acknowledged or unacknowledged attachment, before familiarity had led to carelessness, accustomed intercourse had worn away the charm, or security had diminished scrupulousness to use every art to render yourself attractive to the man you loved.</p>
               <p>Doubtless you still recollect how you stood with finger on your lip, and head bent thoughtfully, deliberating which of two beautiful dresses would become you best, which would enhance or detract from your beauty, in which your expected visitor would admire you most. How, minute by minute, you stood before the mirror, calculating effects; how carefully and becomingly your abundant tresses were arranged; with what trembling fingers you placed the flowers in coiffure or corsage,<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6505-00000072"/> and stepped back, with smiling lips and eyes, to contemplate a whole you had spent so much of time and thought to render attractive; perhaps feeling with sickening disappointment that no arts of the toilet could make you beautiful, or triumphing in a loveliness which was never more regally grand or delicately fair than then; and finding at last that if there was true and mutual love it did not matter whether your dower was queenly beauty or plebeian plainness of figure and feature.</p>
               <p>Thus, I need not tell you with what deliberate care and tremulous pleasure Miss Berrie's toilet was made, on what she considered would be to her so eventful an evening, or how sweet and lovely she looked in the flowing dress of white which was at length chosen; her only ornaments delicate clusters of tube-roses, which fragrant beauties, relieved by trailing sprays of myrtle, nestled in her perfect hair, and on the bosom of her low-cut gossamer dress. She needed no color to impart rosy flushes to her rounded cheek, for expectant Love had touched it with his dimpling finger, and dyed it with the warmest and brightest of his roseate hues.</p>
               <p>It was scarcely seven o'clock when she entered the parlor in her pretty evening dress, and seated herself at the piano to while away the time until her friend should arrive; little guessing that though in thought he was indeed with her, yet in person he was many, many 'miles distant, while she with impatient heartbeats awaited his coming.</p>
               <p>He thought of her, it is true; he would fain have been with her as on the previous evening; yet probably had he been permitted to visit her, the words that she expected to hear might, as then, have still remained unsaid. He was too skilled in ways of the world, and of women in particular, to attach much meaning to, the pretty agitation she had betrayed in the few moments that they were alone together; and some more convincing proof of her preference for him, he told himself he must have, ere he could risk a refusal of his suit. He regretted that he had allowed the impulse of the moment to betray him into such a passionate demonstration, but what was past could not be recalled—he would try to be more self-contained in future, and after all, doubtless she thought no more of it than did he.</p>
               <p>Alas! what is so much to a woman is often of such slight importance to the opposite sex! Love, which is to her a necessity, is often to him merely a relaxation; and tender demonstrations of affection, which mean so much to her, which are the food, the very life of her heart, are to him but a "thing apart" from his daily existence,—a moment's yielding to a passion which has frequently neither depth nor sincerity. Too often does she <q>

               <p>But though this was not the case with Eugene Adair, still he did not feel as assured of her love for him, as she did of his attachment to her. Truly! her perfect<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6505-00000073"/> trust in him deserved a speedier and more full reward than it received.</p>
               <p>Time dragged! slowly along until the usual time of his coming was reached and passed, which Berrie ascertained by furtive glances at her watch when she deemed herself unobserved, and disappointment was beginning its cruel work at her heart-strings, when there were steps on the walk, and a loud ring at the door-bell. Although the peal had sent the blood in tingling waves back to her heart, yet she made no sign, but with fingers that trembled perceptibly continued the noisy march she had been playing. Miss Burton was reading by the centre-table, but did not lay down her book until Miss Wardell and her frequent companion, Mr. Malvern, were ushered in.</p>
               <p>One choking gasp to crush down the sickening sense of disappointment which she felt as the sound of their voices reached her ear, and Berrie turned with her usual gay manner to greet them.</p>
               <p>All the eve, the merry laugh, the saucy repartee, seemed to come readily from her lips, although with every nerve strained to its utmost tension, she listened for the slightest sound that should indicate the coining of the expected one; hearing, above all the gayety that reigned within, the least breath of noise that stirred without, and paying in that seemingly endless evening, the first tithe to her love-crowned womanhood, in the current coins of disappointment and hope-deferred, wrung from her while on the rack of torturing suspense.</p>
               <p>As the evening waned, and still the light conversation tion never flagged, and their guests gave no sign of taking their departure, the color died from the girl's fair cheek, her laugh came less and less frequently, and with unutterable longing for quiet and solitude did she await their departure. 'At last they were making their adieus, to Berrie's profound relief; but the evening was not doomed to end without one more torture to the proud and sensitive heart of the girl.</p>
               <p>"By the way, where is Mr. Adair this evening?" Miss Wardell inquired teasingly, as she put on her hat.</p>
               <p>The color rushed to cheek and brow of the lovely face, but she answered calmly, "You ask too much; how should <emph>I,</emph> know, indeed?"</p>
               <p>"He was in last evening, you know, Jennie; you would not expect to always find him here, would you?" Belle inquired, carelessly.</p>
               <p>But Miss Wardell continued archly, "I wouldn't blame him if he did not come any more, the way you treated him last night, Berrie! you didn't say scarcely a word to the poor fellow, and he looked terribly down-hearted after you left the room."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" returned Berrie impatiently. "Mr. Adair has more sense."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I presume <emph>you</emph> think so!" still laughingly; "but I am sorry to see you such an arrant little coquette, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"You had better refrain from looking at me then!" haughtily.</p>
               <p>"But you shouldn't treat Mr. Adair so; he's worth winning."</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6505-00000074"/>
               <p>"Indeed? then perhaps you had better try for him yourself; you are more accustomed to such things than l am."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I do not wish to interfere with you!" with a little embarrassed laugh, as if the last shot had hit.</p>
               <p>"Do not alarm yourself about me! I make over any claim to him which you fancy I possess. I am not so anxious for a settlement as some young ladies!"</p>
               <p>"Come, Jennie, you had better let Adair and Berrie alone," interposed Mr. Malvern, laughingly attempting to draw her away. "You may get the worst of it"</p>
               <p>"Well, good night, girls! come down soon," and Miss Wardell gladly took her departure.</p>
               <p>"Can't you stand a little teasing, Berrie?" asked her sister when the guests were gone.</p>
               <p>"A moderate amount, yes; but I am sick and tired of hearing about Mr. Adair. One would think that no other gentleman ever paid me any attention."</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't think you <emph>did</emph> treat him very well last night, and, as Jennie says, he looked very grave after you left the room."</p>
               <p>"As if that was anything unusual! But it seems I can't please you anyway; yesterday you were all talking to me about manifestly preferring him to any one else, and now scold me because I don't. I am disgusted with the whole thing."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that was all in fun yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am tired of such fun!" and with a cool "good night," she left the room.</p>
               <p>Berrie was undeniably cross; but had any one known how heavily her heart was beating with mingled emotions of pride, disappointment, vexation, and suspense, they would have pitied rather than censured. "A good cry" relieved somewhat her over-wrought feelings, and a night's repose restored in a measure the freshness and tone of her spirits.</p>

               <p>SEVERAL days of alternate hope and disappointment passed slowly along, and Berrie realized the full meaning of what had been before but empty words.</p>
               <p>For a time, with each succeeding day, she had felt certain that ere it closed she should see him, but the evening brought only another disappointment in place of "hope's fruition," until at last she forced herself to believe that he was trifling with her, and distrust and indignation took the place of her former warm regard. Not that she ceased to care for him,—his image was set too deeply in the sanctuary of her heart, but Pride, came to the rescue, and suffer as she might in secret, her smile was bright and sweet as ever, and she coquetted as gaily with others as if her former admirer was there to see; although often wearying of it all, and growing each day more and more restless and captious.</p>
               <p>Thus a week passed before she learned of his absence, which would of course explain the sudden cessation of his visits. Mr. Wright had been in Boston for some days, but on the evening of his return, he hastened to the place which was so pleasant to him, and received a very kind and cordial welcome. Berrie felt assured that he must know something of the truant, but much as she longed to know the reason of his desertion, she felt she could not trust herself to mention his name; felt certain that did she attempt it her voice would falter, and the tell-tale color, rushing to cheek and brow, would betray how deeply she was interested in the question she would fain have proposed so naturally. Therefore she remained silent, hoping that some happy chance would give her the information she so much desired. Nor was she disappointed.</p>
               <p>"By the way, Adair left town quite suddenly, did he not?" Mr. Wright inquired carelessly, in the course of conversation.</p>
               <p>Berrie's cheek paled, and she held her breath to listen, thankful that at the time she was secure from observation, as the question had been asked while she was bending over the music-stand, arranging some loose sheets of music lying thereon.</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6505-00000076"/>
               <p>"We had not heard that he was gone. Has he really left?" Miss Burton asked in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Why yes! he went to Washington about a week ago; did he say nothing of it to any of you?"</p>
               <p>"No—I think not. Not to me at least. Berrie, did Mr. Adair tell you he was going away?"</p>
               <p>"No I" was the quiet reply from the piano.</p>
               <p>"Well! I <emph>am</emph> surprised! I wondered he had not been up of late."</p>
               <p>"How long since he was here?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know; about a week, I think. Do you remember what evening he was here last, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>Did she <emph>not</emph> remember only too well! Did not his last words still ring in her ears, and his kisses seem still burning on her trembling lips. As if she <emph>could</emph> have forgotten!</p>
               <p>She hesitated a moment as if in deliberation, but really to control her voice, then answered, as quietly as before: "Last Wednesday, I think!"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I remember now; the night there were so many in. When did you say he left?"</p>
               <p>"On Thursday morning early, I believe our landlady said. It is singular he should not have mentioned it, and have bidden you good~by."</p>
               <p>"I think it is!" returned Belle musingly; "but perhaps he was called away suddenly."</p>
               <p>"Very likely! I know he has been expecting to go to Washington for some time."</p>
               <p>"Has he really left town permanently?" Belle inquired.</p>
               <p>"It is uncertain, I think. Mrs. B. said that he told her he might be back in two or three weeks, and he might not be able to return at all; in which case he would write her where to send the baggage he had left in his room."</p>
               <p>"Well! I think as much as he has been here this summer he might have had the grace to say 'good-by' at least."</p>
               <p>"I must say I think so too! But perhaps he has some good reason for his abrupt departure; in fact, I am positive he has; for Adair is a perfect gentleman, as you all must know ere this. I presume he will be back before long."</p>
               <p>Berrie left the room as soon as she thought she could do so without exciting comment, but Belle and Mr. Wright were too much engrossed with each other to notice or regret her departure.</p>
               <p>Alone in her room she looked at the matter in the new light that she had gained; at first feeling greatly relieved that he had not been in town all this weary time without visiting her, then indignant that he had not managed in some way to let her know of his departure, had it been so unexpected that he knew nothing of it himself on his last visit just one week ago.</p>
               <p>How long that week had seemed! how much she had lived in it; how essentially her heart and life had been changed by those few days of suspense and disappointment.</p>
               <p>Had he been going away, why could he not have gone quietly without shaking her heart to its very depths, by the tale he had told so eloquently, in the<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6505-00000077"/> few brief moments they were alone together, on that fatal evening!</p>
               <p>Thus indignation mastered for the time her affection for and trust in him, and with a determined look on her fair face, a painfully close setting of the pouting lips, she prepared to make her night toilet, resolved if he could give her up so lightly, she would at least not grieve for him, but summoning pride to her aid, would so conduct that the world should never guess how nearly her happiness had been wrecked, how closely had the "rosy god "swept by her, brushing her cheek with his downy wings, and leaving in her heart the remembrance of one soft look from his bewitching, dangerous eyes.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, what has become of your old admirer, Eugene Adair?" inquired Charlie Anderson, a few evenings later, as he stood by the piano where she sat, idly running her fingers over the keys, striking exquisite chords at every careless touch.</p>
               <p>He was a fine young man of about thirty years, not particularly handsome, but exceedingly good principled and pleasing, one of those rare gentlemen whom ladies feel almost as free with as with one of themselves, and who take no advantage of the familiarity with which they are treated. It was evident, however, that he admired Miss Berrie extremely, and she in turn regarded him with more favor than any of her other gentlemen acquaintances, excepting, of course, Eugene Adair, and ever felt a cordial pleasure in his society.</p>
               <p>Berrie's heart stopped beating at this careless mention of a name which she could never hear unmoved, and she bent, her head a little that the drooping curls might hide the flushing cheeks, as she answered gaily: "Oh, he has deserted me, I expect! Don't you feel sorry for me, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"More so for you," he laughed, "than for myself. We gentlemen consider him a dangerous rival, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? why should you?" and the little coquette looked up with her most bewitching glance in the violet eyes of the man at her side.</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is so confoundedly cool—excuse me, Berrie—and so handsome and fascinating as well."</p>
               <p>"Yes,—but he is so old, Charlie!" and again the lustrous eyes did duty.</p>
               <p>"Not so very, and that is no objection to many young ladies, other things being satisfactory."</p>
               <p>"No—but then—. Are <emph>you</emph> pleading his cause, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"Not I! I assure you!" and he laughed softly. "I am too glad to have him out of the way. But where has he gone, really, Berrie? His home is in Boston, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"I think so, yes! but he is now in Washington, I believe; at least Mr. Wright said so a few evenings since."</p>
               <p>"And when is he coming back to continue his wooing, and cast us poor fellows in the shade again?"</p>
               <p>"As if he <emph>could</emph> do that, Charlie! I do not know, indeed, if he expects to return at all. He was here the evening before he left, but said nothing about going away."</p>
               <p>"I expect you were so cruel to him, just as you are<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6505-00000078"/> to me sometimes, that he left in sheer desperation. Is that it, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>The girl remembered with a thrill <emph>how</emph> cruel she had been in the last moments they were together, but she looked up in well-feigned surprise and said, "<emph>I,</emph> Charlie? Am I ever cruel to you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are, Berrie, to flirt so with others when you know—"</p>
               <p>"Have you ever heard 'Tam O'Shanter,' Charlie?" she interposed, and with a crash that drowned all other sound she commenced the beautiful piece.</p>
               <p>Charlie was effectually silenced, as he had been many times before;—led on by the bewitching glances of the little flirt, until a declaration of love trembled on his lips, then annihilated with one sweep of her dainty little hand.</p>
               <p>Thus she took her revenge for the disappointment one of his sex had imposed upon her, and proved to the world that she was still "heart-whole and fancy-free."</p>

               <p>BELLA, I am going out for a few moments if any one calls to see me tell them I will be back soon," said Berrie, one evening about four weeks after Mr. Adair's abrupt departure for Washington, he passed the partially opened door of the parlor, on her way through the hall.</p>
               <p>But some one has called already!" returned Belle. Come in, Berrie; didn't Hattie tell you?"</p>
               <p>"No! but they will please excuse me for a few minutes; I will not be long." But before she reached the door she was stopped by Charlie Anderson.</p>
               <p>"Stay, Berrie, let me accompany you; it is too late for you to be out alone."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is you, is it, Charlie? I am not afraid, and prefer to go alone."</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6505-00000079"/>
               <p>"But I cannot allow you to!" and he reached for his hat.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" was the laughing answer. "But suppose I should say that I should not allow you to go."</p>
               <p>"You will not, of course?"</p>
               <p>"Don't be too sure! Didn't I say that I preferred to go alone?"</p>
               <p>"But some one will carry you off!" laughingly, supposing her to be only fencing.</p>
               <p>"No danger of that as long as <emph>you</emph> are safely housed!" was the gay reply.</p>
               <p>He put on his hat, and taking hold of her arm said: "Come along, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>But she resisted, and exclaimed laughing, "But I don't <emph>want</emph> you to go, Charlie!"</p>
               <p>He looked at her a moment in surprise, without speaking, but she continued: "I am not going far, and I don't want any protection at all. Don't you see that the longer you detain me, the later it will be before I am back? Come, go in the parlor, like a good boy, Charlie, and stay until I return," laughing again to see how crest-fallen he looked at her refusal of his escort.</p>
               <p>"You had better not go at all! there is some one in the parlor that you will like to see."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? Well, it will be time enough when I am back. Come, let me go, Charlie," and she took his arm, led him to the parlor door. and pushing him playfully within, exclaimed, without looking in the room: "Here, Belle, keep this naughty boy safe until I return; I can't have him with me!" and closing the door, she ran hastily through the hall, and the vestibule door speedily clanged behind her.</p>
               <p>As has been previously intimated, about four weeks had elapsed since Mr. Adair had taken his departure, and Berrie had some time since come, to the conclusion that he would not return, and that the sooner she dropped him from her recollection, the better it would be for her peace of mind.</p>
               <p>She had also learned that it was not so easy a task as she had imagined. His image <emph>would</emph> rise before her on the most inauspicious occasions; and laugh, and sing, and coquet as she might, there was always a little sigh in her heart, and with the reaction which was certain to follow in the silence of her own room, hot, bitter tears came but too frequently also. Her life seemed hollow, aimless and unsatisfactory, arid robbed of the meed of love which would have made it so full and sweet; she longed for something to fill the void, more substantial than the round of wearying pleasure that she had of late pursued.</p>
               <p>Almost giving up the hope of his return, she did not dream that the guest whom Charlie assured her she would "like to see," was the very one of whose coming she had nearly despaired; while he sat there in the parlor of her home, seemingly occupied with a book of engravings which he had taken from the table, but really listening with a thrill of pleasure to the light, familiar step in the hall, and with a touch of pain to the gay tone and words which seemed to tell him, not only that he had not been missed, but that another had supplanted him in the heart of the girl he loved.</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6505-00000080"/>
               <p>Man of the world as he was, capable as he considered himself of calculating the evidence of preference which came before his eyes, yet the glamour of a true and passionate love had so blinded him that he could not look below the surface, had lent him so much of modesty and diffidence that he failed to appropriate looks and words that really belonged to him, and caused him to forget that women, like dreams, "go by contraries," and that their acts must often be accordingly estimated.</p>
               <p>Probably about an hour elapsed ere Berrie returned from her independent walk, while Mr. Adair was silent and distrait, and Charlie Anderson restless, and evidently impatient for her return.</p>
               <p>At length her step sounded on the piazza, and the click of her key in the door, and Belle remarked to Mr. Adair: "Berrie will be surprised at seeing you."</p>
               <p>"Yes!" he returned smiling, just as Berrie opened the door and paused on the threshold, almost blinded by the brilliant light within, in contrast with the darkness without.</p>
               <p>She placed her hand before her eyes for a moment, exclaiming: "How light you have it here, Belle! it is fearfully dark out of doors. I almost wished I had taken you along, Charlie," and she removed her hand and turned to look for him, when her careless glance fell on the face of her long absent friend.</p>
               <p>For an instant she stood as if spell-bound, the blood seeming to stand still in her veins, then bounding madly on as he arose and came smilingly forward, saying in the low, cultivated tones she had thought never to hear again: "Good evening, Miss Berrie, I am very happy to see you once more."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Adair! you are indeed a stranger," she managed to stammer confusedly, as he took her hand in greeting.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" he returned in his usual self-possessed manner. "I have been absent longer than I hoped, indeed I did not know that I should be able to return at all. I was sorry to be obliged to leave so abruptly," he went on, to give her time to regain her composure, and resuming his seat, "without an opportunity of saying 'good-bye' to the friends to whom I am indebted for such a pleasant summer; but I received an imperious dispatch on the last evening I was here, which obliged me to leave by the first train. I should have written had I not been able to come back, but am very happy to return to make my adieus in person."</p>
               <p>While he had been speaking, the old sweet confidence and love surged back to the tender, unskilled heart of the girl, but with the last words it all died out again.</p>
               <p>"He has only returned to say farewell; he does not love me after all!" she thought to herself, and stung and hurt to the core, she returned calmly and coolly: "We supposed you were called suddenly away."</p>
               <p>Then turning to her other guest gaily—"Well, Charlie, did you think me very long away?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and was afraid the fate I prophesied had befallen you."</p>
               <p>"What? That I was carried off?, Oh, I told you there was no danger of that."</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6505-00000081"/>
               <p>"I didn't think, Berrie, you would give me the mitten in that way."</p>
               <p>"Didn't you?" laughing. "Well, I'll be good next time and let you go. You see my business was very private, and I was afraid you could not keep a secret."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I can, I assure you!" eagerly. "Try me and see; I am not a woman."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I dare not! I am afraid you would prove worse than a woman, and betray me."</p>
               <p>"Never! Tell me, for instance, what I wish to know, and I promise sacredly that I will be as silent as the grave."</p>
               <p>"What do you wish to know?"</p>
               <p>"Whom do you love best?" in a tone so low no one else could distinguish the words.</p>
               <p>She glanced at him saucily and coquettishly, replying as she arose and went towards the piano: "I never answer impertinent questions! Have you heard my new song, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>She sang the one in question, not delaying for a reply, but no persuasion of either of her guests could induce her to sing again. She was obstinate, coquettish, changeable, and saucy the whole evening, laughing and talking much more than her wont, exceedingly gracious to Charlie one moment, and quarrelling with him the next on the slightest provocation, saying in the meantime very little directly, to her just returned friend, Eugene Adair.</p>
               <p>More puzzled than ever, he early took his departure, unable to guess whether it was indifference or pique that dictated her exceedingly contradictory actions.</p>
               <p>Several days passed on, and although they met frequently, Mr. Adair was still as much puzzled as on the first evening of his return to understand the wayward, changeable girl. Never had she been so gay and attractive; and though she did not seem to avoid him, and met him as pleasantly as ever before," yet her attention was so much occupied by others more young and lively than himself, that when a week had passed, he could not recall a single ten minutes' conversation with her since his return.</p>
               <p>He little dreamed that scarce a night passed by, but she sat, sometimes for hours, with head bent on her hand in sorrowful musing, in which he took a conspicuous part, at times with close-set lips and a hard, despairing look in her eyes, at others with tears raining down her cheeks, while tempests of sobs convulsed her rounded, girlish form,—the mask of pride which she had worn so gaily, torn off and thrown aside, and the echo to all her musings, "he does not care for me, he does not care for me!" For he, too, was proud; and, almost convinced of her indifference to him, he would not seem to woo one who evidently preferred others' society to his.</p>
               <p>Thus playing at cross-purposes, day after day passed by, and the first week of October was already gone, when quite a party met accidentally in the hospitable mansion of the Burtons. Among the others were our old acquaintances, Messrs. Wright, Adair, and Anderson, with Jennie Wardell and her devoted attendant, Mr. Malvern. Belle of course was present, and Berrie, seemingly in her gayest mood, chatted, and laughed,<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6505-00000082"/> and sang, and coquetted, as usual the belle of the party.</p>
               <p>She was looking unusually well in a trailing skirt of sea-green silk, and a high-cut waist of white muslin, the low lining and filmy texture revealing the rounded shoulders, whose beauty the delicacy of the fabric which covered them but enhanced. As usual she was without a jewel of any description, and her watch, which had lost its novelty, was lying unheeded in its case on her dressing bureau. A rose-colored bow fastened the lace collar at her throat, and heightened the flush which excitement had imparted to her cheeks, while her eyes shone and sparkled with gayety, and her lovely hair flowing over her shoulders, contrasted pleasingly with the snow of her delicate waist.</p>
               <p>Eugene Adair watched her with hungry eyes, although seldom attempting to engage her in conversation, knowing well, from past experience, how difficult it would be; but resolving at last that he would not give her up so easily, that in the few remaining days of his stay he would make every effort to win a heart he had once thought almost within his grasp. That fatal visit to Washington! He wished sometimes that it had never been made; and yet in the same breath told himself that if she could not be constant just those few short weeks, he surely could not trust her faithfulness for the years to come. With man's unreasonableness, reproaching her for fickleness, and forgetting that <emph>love</emph> even must have something to feed upon—something either to hope or remember—else, however ardent the fire, it will at last burn itself out; ignorant that he had taken just the means to alienate her from him, at least in seeming, and put her on her mettle of pride, by half revealing his love for her, then abruptly leaving her for weeks, without a spoken or written word. Eugene Adair was kind, noble, honorable, gentlemanly, and considerate, but he would not have belonged to his sex had he not been unreasonable and exacting as well.</p>
               <p>So Berrie glided gaily along over the pathway of the days, hiding bravely the pain which lay couchant in her tender heart, and unconscious of the pangs she inflicted on the man she loved, while he found it difficult to tell, as he watched her, whether she was the more charming when pouting till her crimson lips looked more kissable than ever, or smiling till her snowy teeth shone in bewitching contrast with the ripe red mouth.</p>
               <p>On this evening Charlie Anderson, as usual, was close to her side, turning the leaves of her music when she played, and in every manner possible monopolizing her attention, while Mr. Adair, determined to speak a few words to her that evening ere he should leave, bided his time.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are going to Clara Maybury's party to-morrow night, Berrie, are you not?" inquired Jennie Wardell late in the evening.</p>
               <p>"I suppose so, yes! but I do not care about it much; I would rather stay quietly at home by myself."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! so lately home from school and averse to parties?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, wonderful as it may seem! I have scarcely<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6505-00000083"/> had a quiet day since my return, and I am tired," and her looks for the moment did not belie her words.</p>
               <p>"However" she continued, "I suppose I shall go, as I believe the invitation has been accepted."</p>
               <p>"It seems to me," said Belle, "that Clara is rather early in the season."</p>
               <p>"She has a special reason for it, I believe. Many of the summer boarders in town, with whom she is intimately acquainted, leave next week, and this is more particularly in their honor."</p>
               <p>Berrie wondered if Eugene Adair was one of them, but kept silence. He had said nothing of going away since the first night of his return, but she knew, of course, that he must go, as he had no business or other connection there, and her heart sank at the dread certainty of the absence of one who was dearer than all other earthly objects. The evening's excitement had suddenly worn off, leaving her pale, listless, and silent, wearying of the society of every one, and longing, as she so often did of late, for the quiet of her own apartment. In vain she endeavored to arouse herself to her former gaiety; the mask had been removed, and she found she could not replace it. And Eugene Adair looked with surprise at the girl, who a short time before had been so brilliant and lively, now sitting silent unless addressed, with such a weary, weary look in the olive, colorless face, and large, dark eyes.</p>
               <p>She was arranging the music on her stand, somewhat apart from the rest of the company, when Mr. Adair arose to go. He bade Miss Burton good evening, then approached Berrie, and held out his hand. She looked up listlessly, and placed her own in the one extended.</p>
               <p>"My little friend," with the old gentle intonation, "I shall send you a bouquet for the party to-morrow evening, and, if you will permit, a spray for your hair also."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Mr. Adair!" she returned, "but—"</p>
               <p>"Do not refuse me, Berrie, so simple a request," he interposed. "Accept the trifles and wear them for my sake, for the sake of your—friend."</p>
               <p>She looked up with the weary look still in her eyes, but did not reply, until he said again: "You will accept them, will you not, little girl?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, since you wish it so much. Were you going now</p>
               <p>"At once! I have taken leave of your sister. Good night, Berrie! How tired you look."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>am</emph> tired! more tired than you can think!" and the eyes that looked so frankly in his, suddenly filled with tears.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my child! Good-night!" he murmured softly, and with a lingering pressure of the hand he held, he turned away, while she resumed her interrupted occupation, bending lower and lower over the scattered sheets to hide the tears that <emph>would</emph> fall in spite of her. But after a moment she regained her self-control, and crushing them back, resumed her place in the group of guests.</p>
               <p>How relieved she felt when they were all at last gone, only those who have entertained strangers, or indifferent persons, when with every moment the tears<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6505-00000084"/> pressed nearer and nearer to the heavy eyelids, and the heart throbbed harder and harder with a nameless pain, can realize or understand.</p>
               <p>To her surprise, she found her mother in her room, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour.</p>
               <p>"Why, mamma, how you startled me! Why are you up so late?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I came up to look over some garments of yours, and taking up this little book, became so interested that I did not notice how late it was. But how tired you look, child! What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>The book she held was "Lucile," and at sight of the little volume which was so dear to her, for its own sake and that of the giver, she felt she could endure no more, and throwing herself on the floor, she buried her face in her mother's lap, and sobbing, exclaimed: "I <emph>am</emph> tired, and, oh, mother, so miserable also!"</p>
               <p>u What is it, dear? tell ma all about it," soothingly stroking the bowed head of her grieving child.</p>
               <p>"Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me, mamma! but I am so unhappy, so very wretched."</p>
               <p>Her mother said no more, letting her silence and caresses manifest such sympathy in her child's sorrow as a mother's tender heart alone can know.</p>
               <p>At last her grief was spent for the time, the passionate sobs ceased, and she arose from her kneeling position, averting her face and saying: "I shall feel better now; I am fearfully tired, and a little nervous as well, I believe."</p>
               <p>Her mother assisted her to undress, and when she was at last in bed, she kissed her and said tenderly: "Good night, my darling! rest as long as you like in the morning, and God bless you, my precious child!" then turning out the gas, she left the girl alone with the silence and the night.</p>

               <p>BEERIE, come down here a moment, please!" called Belle from the hall below, about three o'clock on the following afternoon, sitting down on the lower stairs to await the response to her summons. She held in her hand a hot-house bouquet in its covering of paper, and a small package, also closely wrapped.</p>
               <p>After waiting a few minutes patiently, as her sister did not make her appearance, she called again: "Berrie, are you not coming?"</p>
               <p>"In a moment, Belle!" was the distant response, and a few seconds later the girl, still in her morning-dress, came slowly down the stairs.</p>
               <p>"What is it? Why, what have you there, Belle?" as she espied the articles her sister was holding.</p>
               <p>"A bouquet, and this!" presenting them to her. "A little boy just left them at the door."</p>
               <p>"From Mr. Adair, I presume," Berrie replied quietly. "That is, the bouquet, as he said last evening he would send me one; but I do not see what this can be."</p>
               <p>"Open it, and you <emph>will,</emph> doubtless!" returned Belle, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Very likely!" and sitting down on the stairs above her sister, she proceeded deliberately to remove the wrappings, betraying none of that eager haste which most young ladies would evince on receiving a mysterious packet from a gentleman of her acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"A jewel-case!" exclaimed Belle, in surprise, as the paper which had covered it dropped from her sister's hand. "That looks suspicious, Berrie!" laughingly. "Did lie say he would send that also?"</p>
               <p>"No!" quietly.</p>
               <p>"Well, do open it, and let us see! Oh, how beautiful! For your hair, I suppose," as the open casket revealed a cluster of holly-berries in cut coral, with prickly leaves crusted with green enamel, and glittering with tiny emeralds, set on every point of the leaves.</p>
               <p>"Why, you don't get a bit enthusiastic over it, Berrie; don't you like it? I think it is lovely, and will be exceedingly becoming to you," as her sister scarcely smiled, and looked rather vexed than pleased.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think it beautiful!" she returned, as quietly as before. "But I do not like to receive such presents, and had I any idea last night, that he meant anything of this kind, I should have said no."</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6505-00000086"/>
               <p>"It seems he <emph>did</emph> speak of it then; you said you knew nothing about it," returned Belle, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Well, I did not. He merely said when he went away that he should send me a bouquet for the party, and asked permission to send me a spray for my hair also. I supposed, of course, he meant a spray of flowers, and did not object, as he begged so earnestly that I would not."</p>
               <p>"Well, this is much handsomer than flowers, and you two are such good friends, I do not see why you should mind accepting and wearing it."</p>
               <p>"I shall have to, I suppose, as I promised to, but I would rather not, nevertheless."</p>
               <p>"What dress do you mean to wear to-night?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know; my white alpaca, I thought, with scarlet geranium in my hair."</p>
               <p>"Well, this will look much handsomer than the geraniums, and you know he desired to see you crowned with holly-berries!" laughing.</p>
               <p>"Belle!" called her mother from the dining-room.</p>
               <p>"Yes, mamma!" and she arose hastily to respond to her mother's summons, while Berrie slowly returned to her room.</p>
               <p>"Well, ma, will we do?" enquired Belle, laughingly, as the sisters met in the sitting-room previous to leaving for the party, each with her cloak on her arm, and fan, gloves and bouquet in her hand.</p>
               <p>"You look very nicely indeed, both of you!" returned the proud mother; "I hope you will have a pleasant evening, but do not stay very late; Berrie is about tired out with so much gayety."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, we'll return early. Isn't Berrie's holly beautiful, ma?"</p>
               <p>"Very lovely, and becoming also," and she kissed the girls and sent them down to the carriage which had been some time in waiting.</p>
               <p>Partial as were the mother-eyes, she did not err in saying that they both looked exceedingly well; and so thought many another, as they entered the already nearly filled rooms of Clara Maybury.</p>
               <p>But Berrie, at least, had thus early proved the truth of Maud Lester's careless statement on the day of exhibition, that "wealth and beauty do not always bring happiness." Her heart was very heavy, and she felt that it would be only with an effort that she could assume her usual gay manner, while there were so many by to note each look and word.</p>
               <p>Charlie Anderson and Mr. Wright met them at the door of the reception-room, and led them to the young hostess, Berrie feeling with a little pang, how much more attentive Mr. Wright was to her sister, than was his friend Eugene Adair to herself. A rapid, but apparently careless scrutiny of the guests assembled, showed her, however, that he had not yet arrived. Nor did she see him when he quietly entered some moments later; but started nervously as he approached her unobserved, and addressed her.</p>
               <p>"Good evening!" she returned gaily, to his low greeting. "I did not know you were here."</p>
               <p>"I have but just arrived; you were less dilatory, it seems."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but we have not been here long. Charlie,<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6505-00000087"/> what did you do with my fan?" and her crimson cheeks testified to a necessity for its use.</p>
               <p>"I have it here; what will you give to redeem it?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know; what do you demand?"</p>
               <p>Now Charlie half suspected that the bouquet she held was the gift of his presumed rival, Eugene Adair, and feeling accordingly jealous, he returned: "Something that you value, of course. Let me see! Well, I will exchange for the bouquet you have in your hand."</p>
               <p>Involuntarily she glanced at the donor, who had seated himself near by, and her quick glance encountered one as rapid and eloquent. Charlie had seen the significant look as well, and convinced of what he had suspected before, he bit his lip with vexation, and awaited her reply. It came after scarcely a moment's delay, in her usual gay tone and manner.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Mr. Impertinence, you <emph>are</emph> modest in your demands! Capture my fan, and then require my bouquet as a ransom! What would you do with either, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Keep them as a memento of one I—admire!" he returned in a low tone that meant much more than the words implied.</p>
               <p>"How romantic! A withered bouquet as a relic! Will you not have a lock of my hair, also?"</p>
               <p>"I should be delighted. Mrs. Maybury, will you oblige me with a pair of scissors?"</p>
               <p>"Do not trouble yourself, Clara! Be so kind as to pass me Belle's fan instead; I see she is not using it."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Maybury did as requested, and Charlie looked exceedingly non-plussed.</p>
               <p>"So you will not redeem your fan?" he inquired, in a somewhat vexed tone.</p>
               <p>"Not until you become more moderate in your demands; I never encourage extortioners."</p>
               <p>"Well, what will you give me, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I do not care particularly about having it just now; my wants are supplied, you perceive."</p>
               <p>"I think she has the best of you this time, Anderson," laughed Mr. Wright, who sat near.</p>
               <p>"I'll be even with her yet; see if I don't, Miss Berrie!" returned Charlie, in pretended desperation.</p>
               <p>"Who has orange-flowers? I am sure I smell them," said another young gentleman, taking a seat near Berrie which had just been vacated.</p>
               <p>"Orange-flowers? is it you, Berrie?" exclaimed Charlie, bending above her bouquet before she could prevent it, then catching the hand which held it. "Let me see! there is such a conglomeration of odors that I can't distinguish one from another."</p>
               <p>Berrie laughed, and blushed, and attempted to draw her hand away, but Charlie held it firmly, closely scrutinizing the artistic arrangement of tube-roses, geraniums, heliotropes, and the various blossoms which usually form a hot-house boquet. Nearly in the centre, and almost hidden by the waxen leaves of a beautiful yellow rose, his sharp eyes at length discovered a tiny cluster of the flowers in question, whose subtle perfume had betrayed to the sensitive nasal organ of her neighbor its presence in her bouquet.</p>
               <p>Charlie laughed significantly as he espied it, and murmured under his breath; "Orange-flowers, eh! in<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6505-00000088"/> Mr. Adair's bouquet! quite suggestive, Miss Berrie!" then louder: "Since you will not redeem your fan with the whole bouquet, you shall have it, Miss Burton, for that single cluster of orange-blossoms. Is it a bargain?"—and again lowering his voice—"my prospective Mrs. Adair?"</p>
               <p>His meaning tone and laugh, and the consciousness that the eyes of the giver of the nosegay were upon her, confused and irritated her extremely, and she heartily wished that she had left at home the bouquet which had been a cause of so much annoyance to her. Deliberating a moment if she should accede to his request, and fearful a refusal to do so would but confirm his suspicions, unwilling, also, that Mr. Adair should think that she prized it so much as to be reluctant to part with it, she returned, hastily drawing the cluster out: "It is a bargain, yes! since you covet my flowers so much. Please restore my fan."</p>
               <p>Charlie obeyed, murmuring again under his breath, "Are we even, Miss Berrie?" as Mr. Adair, without a glance at her, arose and walked off to another part of the room.</p>
               <p>She did not see him again until supper was announced, when he approached her, and asked permission to lead her out; during which the usual amount of light conversation was carried on, as is general in such gatherings, no one seeming to think of talking anything but nonsense, and the usual small-talk of society.</p>
               <p>When they returned to the parlors, he led her to a somewhat secluded seat, and took his place beside her, hoping for a few moments' quiet conversation, such as he had not enjoyed with her since his return.</p>
               <p>"I must thank you, Mr. Adair, for the handsome gift I received from you to-day; but I think you presumed a little on my promise to accept your flowers," smilingly.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry if you do; I had no intention of doing so, I assure you,"</p>
               <p>"I presume not! but I certainly should not have said yes to your request, had I known that what I supposed would be a spray of flowers, was anything so beautiful and costly."</p>
               <p>"And why should you not accept the one as readily as the other?"</p>
               <p>"On account of a natural aversion to receiving gifts from gentlemen, I suppose," laughingly. "To say nothing of its being a breach of etiquette to do so."</p>
               <p>"Circumstances alter cases, Berrie, and I am sure you need not be averse to receive such a trifle from one you have <emph>promised</emph> to regard as a friend."</p>
               <p>"Well,"—a little confused at the resumption of his old tender manner and intonation—"It is beautiful, and I thank you very much, at all events."</p>
               <p>He bowed in acknowledgement, and returned: "I am sufficiently rewarded by seeing it where I so much desired to. It becomes you regally, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>"Yes?" smiling and blushing. "Belle said it looked very nicely."</p>
               <p>"It does indeed!" and the eloquent eyes of her companion expressed more admiration than his words.</p>
               <p>"I saw it at a jeweller's in Washington," he continued<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6505-00000089"/> ued; "and thought at once of my holly-berry friend in Bristol, and I could not resist purchasing it, hoping she would not think me presuming on our friendship, if I presented it to her." And his old sweet smile touched her heart with a renewal of the old thrilling pleasure.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you thought of me! 'Tis sweet to be remembered, you know." With bent head and crimson cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> know it, I assure you; but you could not think I should not remember you, though ever so far away, could you, my little girl? I do not forget my <emph>friends</emph> so easily."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Maybury's approach prevented her replying, to his regret, and her exceeding relief.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, come and sing for us, won't you please?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I cannot sing to-night; please do not ask me."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would; several of my guests have requested that I would ask you."</p>
               <p>"I would like to oblige you, Clara, but I really could not sing to-night. I will accompany any one else that wishes to, if you like."</p>
               <p>"Very well! I must excuse you, I suppose. I will ask Miss Munroe, if you will play for her."</p>
               <p>"I will with pleasure."</p>
               <p>When she arose from the piano, Mr. Adair, being urged on every hand for a song, took her place, while she sat down in the nearest vacant seat, a large easy-chair by the window, at the end of the instrument, and of course in full view of the occupant of the piano stool.</p>
               <p>A short "prelude, and with eyes fixed dreamily on the face of the girl he loved,—eyes that seemed in harmony with the words on his lips,—he sang the beautiful Spanish air by an English composer, "Juanita." <q>

               <p>Had he spoken the same sentiments in the pure prose of common conversation, when there was no one else to listen, they would not have dropped more completely into her heart than they now did; and had they been written expressly for him, they could not have better<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6505-00000090"/> served his purpose. There was a look in his face which she had never seen there but once—the night preceding his departure for Washington—a look which gave a double significance to the pertinent words, and told her as plainly as possible that she was loved. Again, as on that evening so well remembered, her heart beat high with hope, and felt in every part the sweetness of a reciprocal affection; and though her eyes dropped beneath the ardor of his gaze, its fascination drew them again and again to encounter it, until the sweet tale was completely told, the happy lesson entirely and perfectly learned. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"And this is an old fairy tale of the heart!</l>
                        <l>It is told in all lands in a different tongue:</l>
                        <l>Told with tears by the old, heard with smiles by the young,</l>

               </p>
               <p>The song was ended, and no persuasions could prevail upon him to sing again. He had sung with a purpose, and for one ear alone; that ear had heard, that purpose was accomplished, and he would sing no more.</p>
               <p>As he arose, Belle approached her sister, and said in a low tone, "I have a severe headache, Berrie, and think I will go home. Are you ready to go now?, if not, Mr. Wright will accompany me, and I will send the carriage back. I dare say Mr. Adair or Charlie would be glad to see you safely home."</p>
               <p>"I am ready, and only too glad to go at once," and quietly bidding their hostess good-evening they left the room.</p>
               <p>When they came downstairs a few moments later, Mr. Wright and Mr. Adair were waiting in the hall, and as they handed them to the carriage the. latter asked: "Will you be at home to-morrow evening, young ladies?"</p>
               <p>"I presume so, yes! will you come up?" replied Belle, while Berrie kept silence.</p>
               <p>"Thank you. I propose to do so, if agreeable to you. I shall have some news to tell you," with a pressure of Berrie's hand, and slight emphasis on the last word.</p>
               <p>"We shall be very glad to see you; good-night!" and the gentlemen closing the door, the carriage rolled rapidly away.</p>
               <p>No tears in Berrie's eyes or heart that night! Only a touch of "<emph>hope's fruition</emph>"—the tremulous joy of happy anticipation, the sweet consciousness of renewed confidence in the loved one's truth and affection, the thrilling remembrance of the last hour's silent communion.</p>
               <p>With eyes and lips smiling dreamily, she carefully locked the drooping bouquet, about which there had been so much ado, in a drawer of her bureau; and disengaging from her tumbled ringlets the lovely cluster of holly-berries, as bright and beautiful as when they were placed there hours before, she gazed at them a few moments with many a loving thought of the giver, then laid them carefully away in their casket, and soon with weary head, but a buoyant heart, she had stepped across the borders of the mystic land of dreams.</p>

               <p>EVENING had come again, and a happy quartette was gathered in the familiar rooms of the Burtons.</p>
               <p>Although the first week in October was past, it was an exceedingly oppressive evening, a significant reminder of the sultry midsummer nights, long ago bound in the sheaves of the past. The artist hand of autumn had not touched with his skilful pencil and glowing colors, the canvas of nature, but the verdant hues with which fair summer had sketched the picture were still alone presented to the eyes. King Frost, still delaying his coming, had not yet bowed the heads of the late flowers that bloomed in the gardens of most of the cosy Bristol homes, or strewn the ground with the dead leaves of the departing year.</p>
               <p>Breathing the balmy air of the glorious night, listening to the sigh of the gentle breeze through the still heavily-foliaged trees, one found it difficult to believe that the golden summer time was past, and that <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The melancholy days had come,</l>
                        <l>The saddest of the year;"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> the time for the departure of the birds, the death of the flowers, the chilling storms that attend the decay of the hoary old year.</p>
               <p>To Berrie the night seemed perfect! all its natural beauty enhanced by the rosy lenses through which she was looking. In after years, the recurrence Of such an evening would cause her to open her casket, in which memory had enshrined the record of this peerless, intoxicating night, and with a sad delight to "read backward" the beautiful, glowing pages of the past.</p>
               <p>Berrie was bright, lively, coquettish, and decidedly looking her best; for happiness had touched her with his beautifying wand, and her fair face shone with an added grace and charm.</p>
               <p>"By the way, I believe you said you had some news to tell us, Mr. Adair; it is pleasant, I hope!" remarked Belle, in a pause of the conversation.</p>
               <p>"I have some news, but whether it is pleasant or not, I leave for you to decide; it is not entirely so to me."</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6505-00000092"/>
               <p>"Do tell us what it is; I am all curiosity to know," laughingly.' "Aren't you, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh certainly!" she returned smiling.</p>
               <p>"It is nothing of much importance, save to myself. I bid farewell to Bristol to-morrow, and sail for Europe the last of next week."</p>
               <p>He looked at Berrie as he spoke, who grew white to the very lips at this sadden communication of what at any time would have caused her unmitigated anguish.</p>
               <p>Pity for the girl's pain was mingled in the man's heart with an ecstatic assurance that she loved him, but neither was manifest in his manner as he turned from her to Belle, when the latter remarked: "Indeed! we are very sorry to have you go."</p>
               <p>"Not more so than I am to leave, I assure you. I have passed an exceedingly pleasant summer, thanks to the kindness of you and your family."</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not speak of it! I am sure the pleasure has been mutual; and I trust you will not entirely forget us in your sojourn in a foreign land."</p>
               <p>"That I can <emph>never</emph> do, believe me. I do not forget my friends so easily."</p>
               <p>Just what he had said to her alone, the previous evening. She was only a friend, then, after all. "God pity me!" she thought; "how can I live through all the years to come?" as she listened in silent agony to the conversation in which she <emph>could</emph> not have taken a part;—listened, while all the fairy castles which delusive Hope had reared crumbled and fell at her feet, a mass of shapeless ruins. This, then, was "hope's fruition tion!" Anguish and disappointment! she could never hope again.</p>
               <p>"How long do you intend being absent?" continued Belle.</p>
               <p>"I have a government appointment which will necessitate a stay of three years at least; possibly five."</p>
               <p>"So long? then we may bid you farewell for ever, I think; you surely could not remember us for such a time."</p>
               <p>"Do not think it! you are mistaken, I am sure."</p>
               <p>So long! down fell another hope, and she lived ages in the few moments of that brief conversation; looking with darkening eyes into the vista of the coming years, realizing that her love had been utterly thrown away, unsought and undesired, fondly as she had imagined to the contrary; shuddering at thought of the time to come in which she must carry such a heavy, heavy burden, hoping for no relief until death should mercifully still the heart which must henceforth beat in the silent anguish of despair.</p>
               <p>For a time she forgot everything but the ruin of her hopes; but at last pride whispered in her ear, "Be on your guard! do not let him know how you suffer from his indifference; do not let him and others see that you have loved unsought and unreturned. Can you not act a part for one brief evening?"</p>
               <p>"Brief!" her heart responded; "it will be endless in its torturing duration."</p>
               <p>But pride's suggestion, was not unheeded; for with one mighty effort of will, one agonizing but silent prayer for help to Him who alone can succor, the<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6505-00000093"/> blood rushed back to her previously colorless cheek, and she forced herself to speak gaily on the very subject which was causing her such torturing pain. Truly, "Where is the woman that cannot act a part?"</p>
               <p>"So you are really going abroad! To England or the Continent?"</p>
               <p>He turned quickly, surprised at the cheerful tone and words; for he had mercifully refrained from looking at her since the first announcement of his intended departure.</p>
               <p>"So she has fought it out in these few brief moments!" he thought, admiringly. "She is my own brave little girl; how can I leave her!"</p>
               <p>"To both!" he replied quietly, to her question. "First to England, then the Continent. I am sent to Venice permanently."</p>
               <p>"To 'Beautiful Venice, Isle of the Sea!' You must be so glad to go!"</p>
               <p>He smiled sadly, reproachfully, it seemed to her. "Glad so far as the future is concerned; exceedingly sorry for the present. It is very bitter, the parting from dear friends for so long."</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure! but new faces and new scenes will soon wear off the pain."</p>
               <p>"To some it might, perhaps; but I am not so fickle, and find it hard to forget those for whom I care."</p>
               <p>"I suppose we shall hear from you sometimes, directly or indirectly?" said Belle.</p>
               <p>"I presume so, although I am not a very good correspondent. But I shall doubtless write to Mr. Wright now and then, and thus I dare say you will hear."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair had been wondering how he should manage to see Berrie alone for a few moments, to decide his fate, and ease her heart of the pain he knew was piercing it, when Hattie entered, exclaiming: "Berrie, pa wants you to go to the post-office; his head aches so hard he says he cannot go up."</p>
               <p>"Yery well! Hattie, come speak to Mr. Adair; he is going away to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Not to come back any more?"</p>
               <p>"Not for a long time, Miss Hattie! I shall cross the blue water before I see you again. Are you not sorry?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am real sorry! Are you going to Europe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to Italy! Won't you go with me?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid ma wouldn't let me. Will you be here again next summer?"</p>
               <p>"I fear not, my child; not for three or four summers. But you won't forget your friend, will you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, of course not!"</p>
               <p>"You will be a fine young lady, I suppose, by the time I return, and I shall not be permitted to pull your curls any more; but see that you do not forget me."</p>
               <p>"Bring me my hat and shawl, won't you, Hattie dear?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Berrie!" and she left the room, returning soon with the desired articles.</p>
               <p>"I may accompany you, I suppose?" said Mr. Adair, rising as she placed her hat on her head.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you like!"</p>
               <p>"It is such a beautiful evening, and my last as well, do not be alarmed, Miss Burton, if I do not bring your sister back immediately."</p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6505-00000094"/>
               <p>Belle smiled, and returned mischievously; "Suit yourselves; only don't let Berrie sprain her ankle again, Mr. Adair."</p>
               <p>"I will take care she does not!"</p>
               <p>Berrie was ill at ease, but she rattled on in the most gay and lively manner, giving her companion no opportunity to talk aught but nonsense, had he desired. They called at the office and received the evening mail, then passed on down Hope Street, until the waters of the bay in a heaving sheen of beauty lay stretched before them.</p>
               <p>The brilliance of the full moon lighted up the whole scene with rare distinctness, and added beautifying touches to the ever lovely face of the girl, whose hand rested so lightly on the arm of her companion. The hand was small, soft, and ungloved, and looked like sculptured marble in contrast with the sleeve on which it reposed.</p>
               <p>He laid his disengaged hand upon it, with a gentle pressure which was not resisted, and said: "So you are not sorry I am going away, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>Berrie felt she did not care to discuss that question, but returned, "Why certainly I am! Why should I not be?—Have you noticed that sail in the distance? See how beautiful it looks, touched by the moonlight."</p>
               <p>"It has just come in view, has it not? I had not noticed it previously."</p>
               <p>"I think it has, yes!"</p>
               <p>"Do you realize that I shall be soon gliding over the 'bounding billow,' while the same moonlight whitens the sails of the barque that bears me far away?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" she returned, low and quietly.</p>
               <p>"And shall I carry with me the regrets of my little friend for the close of 'our brief and perished intercourse,' and her kind remembrance of one who feels the pain of parting more than he can say?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, of course!" she returned a little bitterly. "As you have said, 'I do not forget my <emph>friends</emph> so easily.' The tide is rising, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"I think it is!"</p>
               <p>"How musical is the sound of the lapping waves, as they advance, and then recede."</p>
               <p>"Do you remember what Alexander Smith says of the flowing of the sea?"</p>
               <p>"No I can you not tell me?"</p>

               <p>At least so thought Mr. Adair, as he watched her in silence, while with averted head she stood gazing far out to sea, apparently rapt with the beauty of the scene, in reality struggling to keep down the rising tide of grief, that, with such mournful monotone, rose and her heart bearing on its incoming waves the, sad farewell.</p>
               <p>After a silence of some moments, he remarked softly, and somewhat sadly: "How a few short months can change the whole tenor of a life!"</p>
               <p>Berrie shivered with pain at the thought of the ravage they had made in hers, but felt she had not the wish or courage to talk of it, and avoiding the dangerous ground, replied irrelevantly: "The air is rather chilly here; let us walk on, please!" and with a little sigh at his want of success in approaching the subject near his heart, he complied with 'her request, and they walked on,. turning up a cross street, and pursuing their stroll on the one above.</p>
               <p>Long periods of silence were followed by the most trifling and commonplace conversation, while each heart was beating heavily and painfully in realization that these swiftly speeding moments were the last they should spend together, ere they parted to meet no more for years, and possibly <emph>never.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! that bitter, bitter word! As it rang loudly it her ears, like an echo to the desolating word, floated to her memory a familiar passage from her favorite "Wanderer,"—that little volume so full of heart breathings, which find a response in many a stricken soul.— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Perchance on earth I shall not see thee ever,</l>
                        <l>Ever again; and my unwritten years</l>
                        <l>Are signed out by that desolating <emph>never,</emph>

               </p>
               <p>Thus they walked along, each acting a part, and endeavoring to hide the emotions which were swelling at both their hearts, until, as they emerged from the shadow of the massive trees which shade the streets of this fine old town, they were startled to note how dark it had grown, and looking upwards, found that the heavens were fast being overspread by the heavy black clouds, and a sudden storm was evidently threatening.</p>
               <p>Berrie's hold of her companion's arm was tightened, as she exclaimed: "Do let us make haste, Mr. Adair! I am terribly afraid in a thunder-storm," and her nervous trembling verified her words.</p>
               <p>"Do not be alarmed, Berrie; I think we shall reach your home before the storm overtakes us; if not there is a God above, and He can keep us safely, wherever we are."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I know that, but I am wretchedly frightened nevertheless."</p>
               <p>They hastened onward as rapidly as the girl's trembling limbs would permit, but they were some distance<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6505-00000096"/> from home, and the heavy clouds above were freighted with one of those sudden tempests which sometimes sweep with such fury over the town.</p>
               <p>They had just reached a church in the southern portion of the town, when the storm burst. Mr. Adair drew the frightened girl up the steps of the church, whose porch afforded them a comfortable shelter, while the wind howled and moaned through the swaying trees, the rain fell in torrents, and flash after flash of lurid lightning parted the tumbling clouds over head, followed by deafening peals of thunder, which echoed and reverberated through the empty aisles of the church.</p>
               <p>The poor girl was dumb with nervous terror, and clinging closely to the arm of her companion, involuntarily hid her face against his shoulder, starting affrightedly at every fresh peal of "heaven's booming artillery."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair used every effort arid argument to soothe her, without reply or apparent effect, and at last, unheeded, drew the trembling form within his arms, and pressed the bowed head to his bosom. Thus they stood until the might of the storm was spent, and as the tempest gradually lulled, Berrie's terror subsided, and she became aware of the tender clasp in which she was held.</p>
               <p>At first it seemed to her she was treading the witching mazes of a dream; and lest the blissful scene should dissolve, and leave but the cold despair of the previous hour, she forbore to stir, until at last he murmured: "Berrie, my love, the storm is nearly over, and you are safe in my arms, while underneath us both are the everlasting arms of our Heavenly Father, who has brought us safely through the perils of the tempest. Will you not look up and speak to me, little girl?"</p>
               <p>His tones were tremulous with passion, and his arms still held her close to his throbbing heart, whose every pulsation beat audibly against her cheek, which was almost pressed against it; but hope had already twice deceived her, and she dared not trust to her seductive wiles again; therefore she merely answered deprecatingly, and attempting to withdraw from his clasp: "I am afraid I have been very foolish, Mr. Adair; but I cannot help being terribly frightened in a thunderstorm, and have scarcely any control over my sensitive nerves."</p>
               <p>But he only drew her closer, saying with a sharp ring of pain in his voice; "Do not shrink from me. Berrie; let me hold you here in the few brief moments left to us, and while we thus stand heart to heart, tell me that all my passionate, undying love for you is reciprocated—that I have not presumed in telling you that all the world contains nothing so precious to me as this little girl I hold in my arms."</p>
               <p>It was true then, and he <emph>did</emph> love her, after all! All the cruel torture she had suffered for the past few weeks had been for naught, and at last she had the certain consciousness of knowing that even as she had loved, was she loved.</p>
               <p>He held her now unresisting; but her joy was too deep for words, for <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"It is with feelings as with waters—</l>

               <p>He waited a moment for a reply, but it came only in a closer nestling of the lovely face against his shoulder, and resting his cheek against hers, he said softly: "You <emph>do</emph> love me, Berrie! I read it in your white face to-night when I told you I was going away. Fate is cruel to part us just as it truly unites us, is it not, love?"</p>
               <p>The agonizing thought of parting restored her voice, and she murmured pleadingly: "Oh, <emph>must</emph> you go, Mr. Adair?"</p>
               <p>"Do not be so formal; can you not say Eugene in the little time left us? for although it breaks my heart to leave you, Berrie, I must go. Had I known a month ago that you loved me, I might have made different arrangements; but I did not dare believe it, for the very evening before I was called away I meant to try my fate, but you were so distant and cool, it shattered what little hope I possessed, and I left, meaning never to let you know how passionately I worshipped you. But you and love were too much for me, my darling, and I have my reward," And he bent his lips to hers in the first caress of an acknowledged and mutual affection.</p>
               <p>"Everybody teased me so about you," she murmured, "and watched every motion and look of mine."</p>
               <p>"I dare say, but they could not keep us apart, after all, could they, dear? It will be very hard to leave yon, but my word is pledged and I must go. I will not bind you by any promises or vows. You are very young, and though I believe, and you think that you love me, we may both be mistaken, and you may yet see some one you much prefer to me; so I wish you to be entirely free, for I could not take to my heart an unwilling wife. As for me, I have lived long enough, and been sufficiently tried to know something of my own heart, therefore I know what I am saying when I tell you that my love for you can never change; but I suffered too deeply once from another's mistaken affection, to take your happiness into my keeping, without being assured that I am capable of making it. Do not think me cold or suspicious, Berrie; believe me, you will never be more passionately loved than by me, and that I suspect you of nothing but what is pure and true; but no one can know his capabilities until they have been tried and proved, therefore it is well, perhaps, although so bitter for both of us that we should part for a time. Look forward to 'hope's fruition,' my love, and when we meet, let it be as we part, hand, to hand, and heart to heart."</p>
               <p>"We must go, Mr. Adair—"</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair?" he interposed.</p>
               <p>"Eugene!" she shyly corrected. "It is growing late, and ma will be worried. I think it does not rain much now."</p>
               <p>They passed down the steps of the church, and he continued: "I shall write you sometimes, if I can discover any way of getting my letters to you, without exciting comment or badinage. I would not have my little girl subjected to any annoyance which I could prevent, and though I have nothing to conceal, and leave it with you to do as you like in the matter, perhaps under the circumstances it would be best to say<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6505-00000098"/> nothing of our mutual affection until I return, and <emph>then</emph>—think what that means, Berrie, if God keeps us safely and true."</p>
               <p>"I would much prefer that nothing should be said of it. I cannot bear teasing, particularly about one I care for."</p>
               <p>"And Berrie, love, you will think of the wanderer very often, will you not?"</p>
               <p>The girl's eyes filled with tears in the darkness as she murmured, "Every day, and every hour, Eugene!"</p>
               <p>"Grod bless you!" he returned, earnestly, pressing the little hand that nestled close in his own.</p>
               <p>"I meant to tell you something of my past, and of my future prospects as well, but there is no time this evening. I will write you all necessary particulars on the passage over, and send it when I reach my destination, Venice. If we had only met a year ago, that I might take you with me, my peerless Berrie! But here we are at home; bid me good-by before we go in, my love," and he took her again in his arms, murmuring in a tone of bitter pain as he kissed her in a lingering farewell, "How can I leave you, dear, how <emph>can</emph> I go?" while Berrie threw her arms around his neck and sobbed bitterly on his bosom.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do</emph> not, Berrie!" he murmured, entreatingly. "This is more than I can bear. We must go in."</p>
               <p>They stood in silence for a moment, until Berrie was calmer, then rang the bell.</p>
               <p>Miss Burton promptly replied to the summons, exclaiming: "Well, truants! I have been fearfully worried about you; fortunately, ma did not know you were out. The storm came up so suddenly that I expected you would be drenched."</p>
               <p>"Well, you see it is better than you hoped," returned Mr. Adair. "We found a friendly shelter, and escaped the drenching you anticipated."</p>
               <p>"Better than I feared, you mean!" she laughed. "But come in, do! You have draggled your dress well, at all events, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"I should think I had! I will run up and change it, and be down in a moment. Go in, Mr. Adair, it is not late yet," and Berrie ran upstairs, thankful to escape the scrutiny of her sister's loving eyes.</p>
               <p>She was not long in making the required change, and the remainder of the evening passed pleasantly, while joy and regret each struggled for the mastery in two hearts whose every throb was in unison.</p>
               <p>The adieus were quietly made; Belle fluently expressing the regret that Berrie felt in every fibre of her being, and Messrs. Wright and Adair, for the last time, took their departure together.</p>

               <p>AFTER a night of broken slumbers, Berrie awoke to the consciousness of a new and perfect joy, a new and bitter grief. "It is all true then," she murmured to herself, "and not a dream of my imagination as I have half fancied through the hours of darkness. True that he loves me after all, true, too true that he is going away for long, long weary years," and hardly knowing whether she was most glad or sorry, she smiled and wept by turns. But though she felt that the long separation would be very bitter, yet she was so glad to know that a common love united them, so relieved at the perfect annihilation of all her doubts, so sweet was the first taste of "hope's fruition," that after all, she was really more happy than sad.</p>
               <p>In truth she did not yet realize that they were parted for years; she repeated the words to herself, but they did not possess the meaning that they would do, when the first flush of joy in his love had passed, and the long months and years of absence caused her to long with such intensity for a sight of the loved one's face, a touch of his tender hand, the echo of his low, caressing voice falling sweetly on her hungry ears.</p>
               <p>The predominant thought in her mind that day, was not, "He has left me \o cross the vast blue ocean," but, "If he <emph>must</emph> go away, I am so glad that he loves me, so glad that he told me! it makes the parting far more endurable. Blessings on the fearful storm which brought me such a boon."</p>
               <p>She thought it no more possible to see him again than if the ocean wastes already divided them from each other; and therefore was greatly surprised when Hattie, entering the room where she was sitting late in the forenoon, said: "Berrie, Mr. Adair is downstairs, and wants to see you a moment. Don't wait, he says, as he is in a hurry," and with one glance in the mirror at the crimson cheeks it revealed, a careful smoothing of the flowing curls, an adjusting of the dainty collar at her throat, she passed down the stairs, trembling with the excess of her surprise and pleasure at this unexpected meeting.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6505-00000100"/>
               <p>The man needed no better assurance of her joy at seeing him again, than the beaming face before him, as he sprang forward and took her hand, she exclaiming: "Why, Mr. Adair, this is an unexpected pleasure! I supposed you were far away, ere this."</p>
               <p>"No! I have delayed a little to see my new-found treasure once more;—to make sure that it is really mine—and to bring you a little reminder of your absent friend," and he placed in her hand a tiny casket and drew her to a seat beside him on the sofa.</p>
               <p>As she opened it, he glanced at his watch and said: "I have just fifteen minutes to give you, Berrie; we must compress as much as possible in that limited time, my love!" smiling as he drew his arm around her waist, and said, "Well, how do you like my gift?"</p>
               <p>"Almost as well as the giver!" she replied, archly, looking up in his face. "I <emph>could</emph> not say more, Eugene!"</p>
               <p>The open casket revealed a glitter of diamonds, and as the girl removed the jewels from their case, it prayed to be a handsome cluster ring, and he remarked: "You see, Berrie, it is not the conventional pledge of troth, a solitaire, nor do I give it to you as such, or wish you to consider it a type of bondage. You know I leave you free, my little girl, and I wish you to think of this as a parting gift merely, a reminder of one absent, but I trust ever dear."</p>
               <p>"It is very beautiful, and I shall prize it more than you can think!" she murmured. "But, Eugene ";mdash;timidly—"I am afraid you do not trust me as yon ought"</p>
               <p>He kissed her tenderly before replying, then said: "I trust your present affection, Berrie; but do not blame me if I have not sufficient confidence in your constancy through the months and years of absence. You will not, I think, when you know how I suffered once, as I said last night, from mistaken affection. I trust your truth and purity of purpose, my love, and if I have doubts of anything, it is your knowledge of your own heart!"</p>
               <p>"If you knew what tortures I have endured for the past few weeks, you would think differently, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"On my account?"</p>
               <p>"On your account, yes!"</p>
               <p>"Well! be true to me, Berrie, and I shall hope for a happy coming home by-and-by. The weary probation will make the glad re-union all the more perfect and sweet. So you like the ring, do you, dear?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I do! how could I help it, particularly as coming from you!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I am glad if you do! but here is something which perhaps will make it still dearer to you!" and he touched a tiny spring which threw backward the cluster of jewels, and revealed a small, but perfect likeness of the handsome giver.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Eugene!" she exclaimed. "I am so glad of that! It does render it indeed doubly dear; it is so like you!" and she looked from the miniature to the speaking face of the original which was bent so near her own.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the likeness is very good, I believe, and I thought it would please my little girl to have it."</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6505-00000101"/>
               <p>"You cannot guess how much!" she returned earnestly, receiving a tender caress for reply, as he slipped the ring on the fore-finger of the little hand he held.</p>
               <p>"But, Eugene," she continued hesitatingly, "I don't think I will wear it, at least just at present; it would be provocative of too many questions."</p>
               <p>"Act your own pleasure about that," he returned, smiling; "it is yours to do as you like with; only don't give it away to Charlie, or any other of your ardent admirers," mischievously.</p>
               <p>"There is no danger of that, I guess. Do you know he is fearfully jealous of you?"</p>
               <p>"Is he? Well, do not let him cut me out!"</p>
               <p>She looked at him reproachfully, but made no reply. After a few moments, he said: "Berrie, I wish you would give me something for a keepsake—not to remember you by, for I can <emph>never</emph> forget you, my love!"</p>
               <p>"I wish I could, Eugene, but I don't know that I have anything you would like."</p>
               <p>"Will you give me one of these?" and he lifted a curl from the beautiful head on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, with pleasure, if you wish."</p>
               <p>"Charlie did not get his the other night!" laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly, no!"</p>
               <p>She brought him a pair of scissors, saying playfully: "Don't cut it off where it will show, Mr. Adair, or I shall get unmercifully teased."</p>
               <p>"Who were you addressing, <emph>Miss</emph> Burton?" as he cut the curl, and held it in his hand, looking fondly at it, but not kissing it as a younger man might have done.</p>
               <p>She laughed. "It is difficult to say Eugene, when I have been so long accustomed to use a different name."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must forgive you, I suppose! you have done very well indeed."</p>
               <p>They sat in silence for some time, heart only speaking to I heart, until Berrie exclaimed: "By the way, Eugene, I believe I have one of my last photographs left, if you would like to have it."</p>
               <p>"Judge by your pleasure in receiving mine, whether I would or not!" he replied, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Then I think you would, very much!" archly. "You shall have this one in the album, and I will replace it with another."</p>
               <p>"It is beautiful, my darling!" he said, "but not half so lovely as my precious original. This would be but an aggravation, were they not both mine!" and as any lover would have done, he sealed his tender flattery with many tender caresses, and placed the picture with the curl carefully in the breast-pocket of his coat, saying playfully, "Next to my heart, you see, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>"I see, yes! I suppose you will carry it there for a time, until some of those fair Italians supplant the original in your favor."</p>
               <p>"It will be for long, then, you may be sure, dear! You trust me, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"As entirely as you do me!" mischievously.</p>
               <p>"You compel me to trust you, whether I will or no!" and resting his cheek on her head, he held her for a<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6505-00000102"/> few moments in silence, trying to summon the courage to leave this little girl who was so dear to him, to say the bitter words of farewell which were agony to both their hearts.</p>
               <p>At length he took out his watch, and holding it before her eyes, said softly: "Berrie, do you see the time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" she murmured.</p>
               <p>"Only five minutes more, and I must go!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Eugene!" she cried, passionately, the might of her love, and the anguish of parting, overcoming her shyness and reticence: "How can I let you go! What may not happen in five whole weary years?"</p>
               <p>"My love, I leave you in God's hands, safe! trusting He will keep us for each other and unite us at last, praying that the probation may not be so long and tedious as we anticipate, <emph>certain</emph> that in any event all will be well. Can you not trust as I do?"</p>
               <p>"No! I can only feel that you are going away!"</p>
               <p>"And do you not think that I feel it as bitterly as you can, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know—it seems to me you do not!"</p>
               <p>He pressed her close without replying, hurt at her doubt of him, suffering untold pain at thought of leaving her.</p>
               <p>His silence reproached her more than any words could have done, and she whispered penitently: "Forgive me, Eugene! I know that you <emph>do</emph> care, that you <emph>are</emph> sorry to part with me."</p>
               <p>"<emph>How</emph> sorry, my darling, you can only judge by your own tortured heart. Language has no word so sad as farewell! Why, Berrie, what is this! tears again?" as a warm drop fell on his hand. "<emph>Do</emph> not, love! be brave and hope for the best! I cannot bear that you should grieve so," and his own eyes were moist as he drew her still closer, and waited for the passionate sobs that shook her frame to cease; only murmuring now and then; "I must go, Berrie!" yet still lingering.</p>
               <p>"It is getting late," at last he said," and I <emph>must</emph> leave you, Berrie! Let me have one last smile to remember," and bravely choking down her sobs, she raised her head, and while her eyes were still wet with tears, smiled in the face so tenderly bending above her.</p>
               <p>"That is my brave little girl!" and with his arms still around her, he drew her with him to her feet.</p>
               <p>"And now, farewell!" he pressed his lips to hers in one lingering kiss, strained her for a moment close to his heart, murmured: "Think of me often, love, and may God bless and keep you!" released her, and without one backward look, left the room and the house.</p>
               <p>As the outside door closed behind him, she sprang to the window for one more glance, and as he turned the corner near by, he looked back, raised his hat, and kissing his hand to her, was—gone! carrying with him as a last remembrance, the picture of the girl he loved leaning eagerly from the open window of the room in which he had passed so many pleasant hours, her graceful figure clearly defined against the misty curtains of embroidered lace that fell behind her.</p>
               <p>She stood for a time gazing at the spot where she<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6505-00000103"/> last saw him, with tears in her eyes, and smiles on her lips, and then went to her own apartment, carrying in her hand the tiny casket he had given her, and with the gleaming ring still on her finger. But when she came downstairs an hour or two later, in response to her sister's summons to dinner, it was left behind, safe in its little casket, locked away from curious eyes, with his gifts of a day or two previous, the fading bouquet, and the costly spray of holly.</p>

               <p>SIX months had passed, and in the gloaming of a lovely day early in May, Berrie sat in the cheery west window of her own pleasant apartment, alternately watching the swiftly changing hues of one of America's own glorious sunsets, and glancing over the pages of a tiny volume which she was holding in her hand.</p>
               <p>In outward appearance, the six months had wrought very little change in the lovely girl,—perhaps the oval face had taken on the least shade of seriousness, and the lips, so pouting and sweet, were sometimes slightly<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6505-00000104"/> compressed, while in the large dark eyes lurked a latent tinge of sadness; but the casual observer would scarcely notice these marks of a restless heart, or dream that 'neath the fair exterior, weariness and sadness and pain too often lay, sapping the youthful freshness and vigor of her spirits, and setting on "her fair, smooth brow, an added seal to her ripened womanhood.</p>
               <p>Let us look over her shoulder, as she reads from the little volume in her hand—which is evidently a diary—and see if we cannot ascertain something of her life for the past six months or more.</p>
               <p>The first record is</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Oct. 16th.—More than a week has elapsed since <emph>my friend</emph> bade me farewell; and wearying of the silence that rests about his name, wearying of the ceaseless thoughts of him that come and go, come and go in my heart, taunting me with 'bliss remembered,' and hopes which must wait years for glad fulfilment, I have decided to keep a diary—writing a little now and then, when silence becomes a burden, ands unfolding to these silent pages the restless longings of a weary, unsatisfied heart.</p>
               <p>"As I have said, more than a week has passed by since Mr. Adair bade me adieu, and I am already longing for him, and wondering how the long months arid years of separation are to be endured.</p>
               <p>"I hoped he would write to me before he sailed for a foreign land, but to-day I read the clearance of the steamer in which he had taken passage, and to-night I can only think of him as gliding over that 'coquettish,' impulsive sea, which he so dearly loves. That thoughts of me are mingled with his farewell to America, I cannot doubt, particularly when I touch the magic spring of the cluster of jewels on my finger—for I indulge myself by wearing it now and then, when securely locked in my own room—and gaze on the handsome, smiling face of him who is so dear to me.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wright left for Boston two days ago to see his friend off, arid when he returns I shall have the latest tidings of '<emph>Eugene.</emph>' God keep him safe and true!"</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>October 18th.—Mr. Wright returned to-day, and as usual, has spent the evening with us. He expects to leave town next week, permanently; although he says he shall run down occasionally during the winter. There is a strong attraction for him here, evidently; and I would not be surprised were he one day to bear a nearer relation to us than at present.</p>
               <p>"He told <emph>Belle,</emph> in my presence, the particulars of his friend's departure; every word of which was as manna to my hungry heart. He said Mr. Adair was well, but he never saw any one feel so badly at going away, and thought, had not his word been pledged, he would, at the last moment, have given up going.</p>
               <p>"Late in the evening, Belle left the room for a moment, and Mr. W. crossed over to the window where I was sitting, and said in a low tone, 'Mr. Adair wished me to give his best love to his little friend, and a last, but regretful farewell.'</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6505-00000105"/>
               <p>"Belle's opportune entrance obviated the necessity for a reply, to my exceeding relief. I wonder did he tell Mr. Wright of the bond between us; I do not think he did, or would."</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Nov. 3d.—Mr. Wright did not leave as early as he expected, and is still here, although I believe he goes away in a day or two now. He said to-night that he had seen reported the arrival at Liverpool of the steamer which bore away my friend. Therefore I trust the perilous journey has been safely completed—or that portion of it—and to-night my dear one treads the far-off shores of fair Albion.</p>
               <p>"I hope he will write me from there, in which case I should receive it in two weeks at farthest. Haste, old Time, and bring me tidings of the wanderer."</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Nov. 17th.—Tidings, but meagre and unsatisfactory. Mr. Wright left for Boston about two weeks ago, and to-day Belle received a note from him, inclosing one which had just arrived from Mr. Adair; thinking, he said, we would all be glad to hear from him. <emph>Knowing,</emph> he <emph>might</emph> have added, that Berrie at least would. But however much he may know or suspect, he keeps his own counsel faithfully. He is <emph>very</emph> kind, and I fully appreciate his delicacy and generosity.</p>
               <p>"Belle sent the note—Eugene's—up to me, and it lies before me now; traced on thin blue foreign paper, in a firm, plain, manly hand, characteristic of the noble writer. It was very brief, and ran thus:</p>

               <p>"That was all; and though of course I am relieved to know he is safe and well, it is scarcely more than an aggravation to a heart hungry for full and perfect tokens of continued love and remembrance. Not that I doubt either; but my heart craves the sweet assurances of both.</p>
               <p>"No letter for me as yet, nor do I know in what direction to look for one. I judge, from what he said, that he will not send them direct to me through the post-office, but if he made other arrangements, he did not inform me of them. Possibly he may send them<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6505-00000106"/> through Mr. Wright. I am sure he might be trusted. But I know nothing of his plans, and can only wait and see. But the waiting time is weary, weary!"</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Jan. 16th.—It is just three months to-day since Mr. Adair stood on the deck of an outward bound, steamer, and watched the domes and spires of fair old Boston fade slowly from his sight. Three weary months! and still not one word from him to tell me I am remembered, or ease this aching longing in my heart, for tidings of my dear one. I thought the note to Mr. Wright, announcing his arrival at Liverpool, unsatisfactory, but I would gladly welcome now anything as meagre as that even.</p>
               <p>"He did not say he should write to me before arriving at Venice, but still I hoped he would; and even had he not, it seems to me I should have heard from him ere this.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wright was down and spent Christmas with us, and the holidays passed off quite pleasantly, although I seemed to miss and want <emph>my friend</emph> more then than at any other time. If ever we wish for the presence of our dear ones, it is surely in festival seasons, and to know that miles of land and ocean separate us, is very, very bitter. Could I have heard from him, even, ere then, it would have been less hard. Mr. Wright informed us casually, that he had received no further tidings, but though I longed to ask him if Mr. Adair had made arrangements to send my letters in his care, I could not summon the courage to do so.</p>
               <p>"I received a letter from Maud Lester a few days since, urging me to come and spend the remainder of the winter with her; but, although I would like very much to see her, I feel that my heart and nerves could not endure the constant strain which the gayety I should be forced to affect would impose. Therefore I shall write her that I cannot come.</p>
               <p>"I have not yet ventured to wear my precious ring, save in the privacy of my own room; but I mean to do so some time, when I can gain sufficient courage to face the astonishment and questions it would be certain to provoke."</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>April 15th.—I find it is three months since my last record; months that have 'seemed almost endless to me, and still I can only write in substance what I did three months ago, no letter yet! Time drags wearily and there are days when I can scarcely endure existence; when the longing in my heart for tidings of my loved one, for a sight of his face, the sound of his voice, seems almost more than I can bear; but time goes on, and my longings are still unsatisfied, and the burden grows still heavier to bear. I cannot account for his silence, and am tortured with all manner of suggestions from my anxious heart,—fears for his safety, almost doubts of his constancy, or anxiety lest he should have chosen an untrustworthy medium through which to communicate with me. In fact, I know not what to think! But the suspense is wearing upon me, and I often find it impossible to assume the gayety of manner which alone wards off the questions and comments that I find it so hard to endure.</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6505-00000107"/>
               <p>"I wish sometimes that we had been less private, and announced to the world our engagement—for although he protested that he left me free, he bound my heart with chains that nothing can break—that I might not be forced to constantly wear a mask. Yet, should he prove untrue, publicity would have rendered the mortification all the more deep and bitter. But I feel I wrong him by the slightest doubt of his constancy; and I <emph>do</emph> trust him, spite of all; I <emph>will</emph> trust him, let what may come. He is incapable of treachery, in relation of life.</p>
               <p>"But I find there are various rumors rife which annoy and provoke me more than I can say; and which an understanding of the bond between us would have prevented. Some protest that I refused him, and in desperation he left for a foreign land, there to hide his grief and disappointment. Others mat he was trifling with me, and went away without making the declaration of love that I expected and desired. It is so very provoking, and so difficult, when such rumors are reported to me by officious friends (?), to hide my vexation, and laugh the subject off. I <emph>did</emph> turn sharply on one old gossip the other day, and tell her that if people would attend to their own affairs a little more, and let mine alone, they would do better. I regretted it afterwards, but I was so annoyed I could not help it; and I think she, at least, will not trouble me with any more nonsense.</p>
               <p>"It has been a very gay winter for quiet old Bristol, and I have participated in the gayety when I could not do otherwise, although growing so weary of it, and wishing, in the midst of it all, for the quiet of my own room. Charlie Anderson is, as usual, very attentive—too much so; in fact—and Harry Alcott is equally devoted; but it is all of no avail, for my heart is over, the blue ocean, and <q>

               <p>"Mr. Wright was down a month ago, but brought no tidings of his friend."</p>
               <p>The twilight shades slowly deepened, and Berrie dropped the book in her lap, leaning her head on her hand, with a far-off look in the eyes fixed on the gathering gloom without.</p>
               <p>A half-hour elapsed; then there was the sound of an arrival, unheeded by the sad dreamer at the window, and in a short time Hattie rapped at her door, and called, "Berrie, can I come in?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear!" was the mechanical reply.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, Mr. Wright has come, and Belle wants you should come down and see him."</p>
               <p>"Very well I" absently; "tell him I will be down soon."</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6505-00000108"/>
               <p>"No, Berrie, I don't want to go down until you do. Come now, won't you?" and the little girl leaned her arm on her sister's shoulder, and played caressingly with her curls.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you have the gas lighted? Come, Berrie, come down stairs!" as her sister passed her arm around her without replying.</p>
               <p>"Well; Hattie, I suppose I must. How long has Mr. Wright been here?" as she arose, and putting away her book, prepared to go down stairs.</p>
               <p>"Not very long; he asked for you, and said he would like to see you."</p>
               <p>"Did he?" and a gleam of hope that he had at length heard from the wanderer crept in her heart as she passed down the stairs, with Hattie clinging to her hand, and chatting gaily all the way.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, wouldn't you like to see Mr. Adair?" just as they reached the hall below. "<emph>I</emph> would, ever so much!" and Berrie had only time to answer briefly "Yes," ere they entered the parlor.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Berrie?"—for he, too, had dropped the "Miss" at last—"didn't I take you by surprise, this time?"</p>
               <p>"You did, indeed, Mr. Wright! but we are very glad to see you, nevertheless; aren't we, Belle?" mischievously.</p>
               <p>Belle blushed, and Mr. Wright hastily went on: "Thank you, Berrie, I am very glad to come, I assure you. I have been thinking for a week or so I would run down, and yesterday I received a long letter from Mr. Adair, and I thought you would all be pleased to hear from <emph>him,</emph> if you weren't to see <emph>me;</emph> so I concluded to come and take you by surprise."</p>
               <p>It was Berrie's turn to color now, which she did rosily, as she answered playfully; "I suppose you thought a poor excuse better than none, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Exactly! though I am sure <emph>you</emph> cannot think <emph>that</emph> a poor one."</p>
               <p>"Well, what did Mr. Adair say?" inquired Belle.</p>
               <p>"I will give you the letter by and by, and you can see for yourself."</p>
               <p>"You think you deserve the first welcome, don't you?" asked Berrie.</p>
               <p>"Decidedly, yes!"</p>
               <p>Berrie was in a fever of impatience to see the longed-for letter—but would not for the world have asked for it—and felt at the same time hurt and sore to think in all this long time he had not written to <emph>her.</emph> And as the evening waned, and nothing more was said of the absent one, her heart grew faint with the sickness of hope deferred, while torturing doubts of his love for her dimmed the trust in him she had hitherto felt.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening when a ring at the doorbell was followed by the announcement that Jennie. Wardell wished to see Belle for a moment, but would not come in, and Miss Burton left the room in response to the summons.</p>
               <p>As the door closed behind her, Mr. Wright took a parcel from his pocket, and passing it to Berrie, said: "Here, Berrie, is a packet Mr. Adair sent me for you. "So you see I had a double errand in coming to Bristol to-day."</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6505-00000109"/>
               <p>The girl was painfully confused, but contrived to murmur; "Thanks, Mr. Wright, you are very kind, indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not speak of it, Berrie! I am glad to oblige Eugene, or yourself either. I was very much pleased at hearing from him again," and as Belle re-entered the room Berrie excused herself and withdrew, with the precious packet, so long and so ardently desired, clasped tightly in her hand.</p>

               <p>ALONE in her room, with closed doors, and little rocker drawn under the brilliant gas jet, Miss Berrie seated herself to the perusal of the precious letter in her hand.</p>
               <p>Her heart beat high with anticipatory pleasure, for what is more delightful than a long and tender letter from one we love, when miles of distance roll between, and long expectation enhances the value of the missive at last so joyfully received.

               <p>As she broke the seals of the foreign looking packet,<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6505-00000110"/> a thin square of card-board, wrapped in tissue paper, fell from the numerous folds of thin, blue letter, but so eager was she for the tender words she felt certain of finding, that it dropped unheeded in her lap.

                              <salute>"MY DEAR LITTLE GIRL!</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>"On the 'rolling deep, with the blue waves of mid-ocean before me, behind me, to my left, to my" right, and God's boundless blue heavens bending serenely above, I come to write my first letter to the little friend, whom, with so many regrets, I left behind me.</p>
                           <p>"We are six days out, and though we have a very pleasant party on board, the monotony has already become almost unendurable to me, and I am longing to place my foot once more on terra-firma, to see rise before my gaze the rugged, barren cliffs of Emerald Isle, and know that the first part of my long journey is at length nearly accomplished.</p>
                           <p>"I need not tell you, Berrie, how much more endurable would be these quiet days on the heaving sea, if I might have brought with me the little friend whom the past months of frequent intercourse have so greatly endeared to me. In lieu of that, however, I will fulfill the promise made to her ere my departure, and employ a few of these quiet hours in rehearsing to her some of the scenes of the past, and confiding to her some of the hopes and prospects of the future. Of <emph>one hope,</emph> whose fruition will be the brightest and sweetest of all, I do not need to speak, as I know it is shared by her, and her own vivid imagination, can paint its fulfillment more perfectly and sweetly than any words of mine could do.</p>
                           <p>"My father died when I was scarcely eighteen years of age, leaving on my hands a burden of a debt which it required years of arduous labor on my part to remove; but with a counsellor and sympathizer in my dear mother, which rendered any toil a pleasure, and every burden easy and light to be borne.</p>
                           <p>"As a boy, drawing was a passion with me, and I indulged many a dream of future pleasure and fame with the use of my pencil, which, when at length confided to my father, were blighted by unsympathizing ridicule, and a decided refusal to 'allow me to waste my time on any such nonsense;" and immediately on my completing the regular course at the Latin school in my native city, I was placed behind a counter, and all my fairy aspirations annihilated at one blow. Of the disappointment it was to me, I will not speak at length. It was my first, and one very hard to endure by a high-strung, impetuous boy, whose tastes were all artistic, and directly antagonistic to the petty details of trade, in which, against my will, I found myself launched.</p>
                           <p>"However, I swallowed the bitter potion with what grace I could, and my father's sudden death shortly after, leaving on my hands a mother and younger sister, to say nothing of carelessly accumulated debts, gave me a new incitement to labor, and devoting all my energies to the work I had undertaken, distasteful as it was to me, I succeeded beyond my utmost expectations<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6505-00000111"/> tations, and, being rapidly advanced, when I had reached my twenty—first birthday, I had the satisfaction of knowing that by my own exertions—and the blessing of God—I was free from debt, my mother and sister comfortable in the home I had saved for them, and that at any day I willed, I could become a partner in the firm which had so fully appreciated my services, and so generously rewarded them. Of course so advantageous an offer I did not hesitate long about accepting, and still fortune prospered me.</p>
                           <p>"About a year later I met a young lady, who to my dazzled eyes seemed the perfection of beauty and loveliness, and after a brief but impassioned courtship, I had the joy of leading her to the altar, and hearing the man of God pronounce us man and wife. She was very beautiful, as I have said; and, of course, as all young lovers do, I thought her as perfect in character as she was lovely in form and feature. She was, in reality, very sweet—tempered, lively, and spirited, and with a manner exceedingly attractive and winning. But firmness and will were wanting to perfect her nature; she was weak and easily influenced, shallow in affection, and exceedingly susceptible to flattery.</p>
                           <p>"She was ever very free in expressing her attachment to me, and God knows I never doubted her purity, or the depth and strength of her affection. Nor do I really believe now but she thought that she loved me; but, as I have said, she was shallow and very young, and in reality did not know her own heart.</p>
                           <p>"The firm of which I was a member desired a representative abroad, and it being decided that it was best I should be the one to go, we were married, and for our bridal trip we crossed the Atlantic, and took up our abode in the delightful but dissolute city of Paris.</p>
                           <p>"For a year, all went well. We went into society very little, and my home was as attractive and pleasant as any one could desire. At the end of that time I met an old school-fellow and friend, and the pleasure he expressed at the meeting was fully reciprocated by me. He also was resident at Paris, and I took him home with me and introduced him to my wife. He was a bachelor, and finding my home, in which he was ever a welcome visitor, so attractive, he did not scruple to frequent it as often as he desired.</p>
                           <p>"At the end of six months more, a decided change was observable in my wife. She was nervous, irritable, and exceedingly cool to me, becoming more and more fond of society, and seemingly indifferent as to whether or not I accompanied her, when attending the social gatherings to which we were invited.</p>
                           <p>"At last I resolved that such a state of things should exist no longer; and on remonstrating with her, she frankly declared that she had been mistaken in her affection for me, that she did not love me as she had done at the first; and that, in fact, so averse had she become to my society, she could scarcely endure my presence, much less my caresses, which, to her relief, had some time since been withdrawn.</p>
                           <p>"Imagine, Berrie, what I endured at hearing such words from the lips of the woman I had promised to love and cherish till death should part us! No! you cannot, even with your tender heart, fancy what it was<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6505-00000112"/> to me. All my happiness crushed at one blow, all my faith utterly shattered, all my hopes thoroughly annihiated, bound for life to a woman who hated me. Can you think of anything more horrible-and we both so young, with every prospect of a long, long, weary existence before us!</p>
                           <p>"For a time I could not speak to her, so utterly crushed was I, with misery and consternation. At last, in the midst of the anguish, crept the suggestion that if she had thus changed to me, another might have won the love I had deemed was only mine; and I turned to her suddenly with the question, 'Clara, do you hate me because you love another?'</p>
                           <p>"The guilty blood rushed to brow and cheek of the beautiful, but treacherous face; she covered it with her hands, and turned away without reply. Almost frenzied with agony and jealous rage, I tore her hands from her face and compelled her to look at me, repeating with white lips and a stern voice, the question I had previously asked.</p>
                           <p>"'Don't, Eugene!' she pleaded. 'I dare not tell you.'</p>
                           <p>"'You need not!' I exclaimed bitterly; 'I am already answered!' and throwing her hands from me, I left the room.</p>
                           <p>"What I endured that night, I scarcely remember myself, so crazed was I with grief and anger. In the morning she did not appear at breakfast, and when I reached home at night, and inquired for her, I was informed she had left home the previous evening, and had not as yet returned. A terrible suspicion crossed my mind, and I repaired immediately to her room, there to find what I dreaded confirmed‐that she had flown from ray home, and that the man I had trusted had been the one to lure her away.</p>
                           <p>"Do you wonder now, Berrie, that I have confidence neither in man's friendship nor woman's love? Rather, that I have not had for long, long weary years, until my little girl in far-off Bristol eased my heart of the old desolating pain, and taught me new faith in the purity and truth of woman. For Berrie, love, I do trust and believe in you, and am looking with eager, hungry eyes, to the dim vista of the future, when in your tested and triumphant love, I find at last my rest.</p>
                           <p>"But to continue! That very night there was a terrible railway accident, and among the list of the killed I read the name of my treacherous friend, '<emph>and lady.</emph>' Hastening at once to the scene of the disaster, I was just in time to look on the coldly beautiful face of my false wife, and that of her guilty paramour, ere they were lowered into their hastily prepared graves in the quiet country churchyard.'</p>
                           <p>"Thus early had God avenged my wrongs; and even in the midst of my misery, I remembered to thank Him that IIe had never granted my desire for a child, to inherit the misery and disgrace my weak and unprincipled wife would have transmitted to it.</p>
                           <p>"I settled up my business in Paris as soon as possible, and returned to America, only to find our firm fearfully involved; and its total failure shortly after, threw me again, almost penniless, upon the world. But<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6505-00000113"/> my sister had wedded before my own marriage, and was therefore provided for, and my mother was too dear to me to ever become a burden. How tenderly she welcomed back the wanderer, and eased by her affection and sympathy the sharpness of the cruel pain one of her sex had inflicted upon me!</p>
                           <p>"But 'misfortunes never come singly,' as I had already proved; and scarcely six months after my return to America, I laid the form of my best friend in the silent grave, and almost despairing, turned from the quiet shades of Mount Auburn, where we had laid her to rest. But my mother's God spoke to me through my deep affliction, and taught me that it was the chastening but loving hand of a Father that had desolated my life, taught me faith and patience, and hope in the life to come, if not in this present existence, so full of trial and turmoil.</p>
                           <p>"I entered into business again, and was moderately prospered. The offer, last spring, of a government appointment abroad, which would be lucrative, and leave me much leisure to ply my favorite vocation—painting—among the master-pieces of the old world, was too tempting to be resisted, and had I not met my little Holly-berry in dear old Bristol, I should have left the American shores without a regret. In the three or five years to come, I hope to accomplish much; and when I return to my native land, if I find awaiting my coming one who has been true to me through the long probation, I shall once more have a home, and feel that life has nothing more to offer me.</p>
                           <p>"Thus I have told you. briefly some of the events of the past, and the prospects of the future, and trusting that the trials I have endured will trusting that the trials I have endured will render me no less dear to the one I have dared to love—impossible as I had thought it I could ever do so again—I will leave the completion of this somewhat lengthy epistle until later in the voyage.</p>

                           <p>"As you will see, we have nearly reached our journey's end, and I will spend a little time while running up to Liverpool, to tell my little friend the principal events of the passage, which perhaps may interest her.</p>
                           <p>"When a few days out, it was reported in the cabin that there had been a death in the steerage the previous night, and the funeral took place the same afternoon about five o'clock; and I can assure you, Berrie, a funeral at sea is a solemn occasion,—surrounded by water, with no escape, a death at sea has more than double the solemnity of one on land, and though but a child, there were none, I think, but felt impressed. It appears that a steerage passenger with her husband and child shipped at Boston—her child at the time being very sick, and concealing the fact until the following day, lest they should be sent ashore, the physicians on board found it out too late to be of service to the little one, and it died on the Friday evening subsequent to our departure from Boston, and, at the mother's request, was kept until the following day. At five o'clock we were all on deck, when the second officer came forward, followed by four seamen, carrying the little coffin on boards, covered by a pretty new British ensign<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6505-00000114"/> for a pall, and accompanied by the whole of the steerage passengers. They were met by the Captain and some officers on the quarter-deck, and after raising it to the side of the vessel, the captain read the burial service, and at the words 'We commit our brother to the deep,' the little coffin was slid to its last resting-place, and was soon out of sight. The child was but fourteen months old, was well cared for, and very decently buried, and at the mother's request placed in a coffin, instead of canvas, as is usual. Thus the Death Angel spread his wings over our gallant barque, and stooping, gathered in his dusky arms this innocent, unconscious babe, bearing it far away from the evil and pain of this troublous world.</p>
                           <p>"The next day was the Sabbath, but seemed very little like it to me, and I much longed to be in America, and have the privilege of Christian worship. Thought much of you all, and how and where you were, until I was almost homesick for Bristol and Berrie. We did not have service on board, much to my, and others' disappointment. The captain entertaining somewhat peculiar religious views, from conscientious reasons I presume, did not care to read it. But in the afternoon, several of us who were drawn together, I suppose, by that sympathy which always exists between one Christian and another, were sitting in the saloon, and in the course of conversation, deprecating our not having service, and saying how much unlike Sunday it was, I suggested that if some one would play for us all to sing it would be pleasant, and the suggestion being acted upon, we succeeded in singing several beautiful and well known hymns. One by one many of the passengers joined us, until we had a goodly congregation; and till those who had walked by with as much of a scoffing sneer on their faces as was consistent with gentlemanly deportment, had brought their faces into natural shape, and some of them even faintly joined in the familiar tunes, we continued it; then separated, and spent the remainder of the day in various ways, feeling more content that we had made some effort to keep holy the Sabbath day.</p>
                           <p>"There was quite an interesting little incident occurred a day or two subsequent, which I will tell you of, briefly. One of our ladies went into the steerage and talked with an old woman nearly eighty, who was 'going home to die.' The poor soul had started for Ireland without a penny in her pocket—the company giving her a free passage—and she was trusting to her good fortune to get the remainder of the way, some miles in the interior. We have some monks, and a priest, on board, the latter of whom reminds me of Longfellow's 'Jolly Friar,' and I think if there <emph>is</emph> honesty among Catholics—and we must be charitable—he is honest. We sent him to her, and he gathered the facts as above; and one of our ladies commenced taking up a six-penny subscription for her, raising about fifteen dollars. We decided it were best we should keep the money until arriving at Queenstown, lest it should be swindled from her; so the lady—who is a Methodist—and the priest, paid the old woman a visit and told her what they had done for her; and so full of gratitude was the poor old soul, that her feelings<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6505-00000115"/> entirely overcame her, and she could do nothing but weep.</p>
                           <p>"I have had two sea-baths since coming on board, and though I have taken various kinds of baths previously, none of them can compare with a bath at sea; particularly when it is taken in one's state-room <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nolens volens,</foreign> and without warning, as mine were. The porthole had been carelessly left unclosed by my roommate, and when the seamen were washing the deck, the water poured into my berth—which was the lower one—in floods, completely drenching me. The last time I supposed myself dreaming; thinking I was on deck, and a severe rain-storm corning on, I would go below. In attempting to do so, I came up full against the side of my berth, and then, for the first time, became aware that I was out in the wet in earnest. I then undertook to get out of my berth; but was only half-awake, it was dark as Erebus, and having attempted one side with no success, I tried at the end, my head coming in not very pleasant contact with the top of my berth. Thinking I was hemmed in, I tried the right side, but not expecting to be successful, came near landing on my head on the floor. I had concluded by this time that sea-baths were not very pleasant things; and on complaining to the purser, he gave me a pleasanter room on the other side of the ship. I was rather late in engaging my passage, and was obliged to accept such accommodations as were available.</p>
                           <p>"We have had a dense fog for a constant companion nearly the whole of the passage, until we longed to see once more the bright blue of the sky, if it was in reality behind the heavy mist surrounding us, which we were sometimes almost tempted to doubt. And is not that the way with our own hearts? When the mist of trouble surrounds us, we forget that just beyond the Sun of Righteousness is ever shining, and though it lasts for many days, if we will only wait, the calm clear blue of the sky will surely come again. Forget that <q>

                           <p>"I have often thought, when leaning over the water, gazing into the heaving depths, how much you would admire it if you were by my side. We have been in the Gulf Stream for some days, and in the wake of the vessel by day, the 'troubling of the water' produces a light blue color, almost azure, while all around the deep indigo blue of the Gulf Stream throws it into pretty and striking contrast. During the night, too, it is still lovelier. The animalcules, which are always present during the season when the wind sits in the south, transmit phosphorescent particles, and these being excited by the motion of the ship, give a beautiful effect—the tips of the waves around us being luminous as though on tire, while in our rear there is one broad phosphoric band, such as you will see—in effect—when the moon is shining full on the water.</p>
                           <p>"Last evening we had a splendid sight. The high hills, bleak, barren and lone, were distinctly defined against the blue back-ground of the heavens, which<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6505-00000116"/> were dotted here and there, around and above, with patches of lazy, fleecy clouds, and soon after the sun began his setting—the first clear sunset since we left Boston—and of course I thought of my little friend who would have enjoyed the sight so much, and thinking of her, I drew out my sketching block, and transferring the outlines of the scene to paper, will finish in water-colors at my leisure, and send across the blue ocean to my dear little girl in Bristol.</p>
                           <p>"It was as pretty a sunset as one could wish to see; not brilliant and gorgeous as I have witnessed from your own dear home,—as one in particular which occurred in our early acquaintance, and that I am sure you still remember—but just as beautiful in its way as those. The clouds were turned to a purple grey, and tipped with a pure silver sheen, while the sinking sun had the appearance of molten silver of the brightest hue. Americans on board thought it the prettiest sunset they had ever seen; familiarity with their own gorgeous ones having deadened their approbation of them, while a more chaste and modest one, having the charm of novelty, called forth their loudest praises.</p>
                           <p>"Early to-morrow we shall reach Liverpool—for while I have been writing we have been gliding rapidly onward—and the first stage of my journey will have been successfully accomplished. I shall hot send this until I reach Venice, when I shall add a few words more.</p>
                           <p>"Think often, love, of your absent friend, and may God's richest blessings ever be poured on the head and heart of my dear little Berrie.</p>

               <p>BERRIE dropped the letter in her lap, and leaned back in her chair with a little sigh of content and perfect satisfaction, and a face beaming with that exquisite pleasure which kind words and tokens of remembrance from one we love are certain to impart.</p>
               <p>For a time she mused; then taking up the precious letter again, she glanced over the closely written sheets, her eyes darkening with sympathetic sadness, or lips smiling with pleasure and amusement, as the words she read were calculated to excite those alternate emotions. When she reached the sunset description, she remembered the little packet the letter had inclosed, which had dropped unheeded on the floor, and raising it, she hastily unfolded the wrapping of tissu epaper, and uttering an exclamation of delight at the picture which met her eye. It was small, but exquisitely finished by the artistic hand of her friend, the reaches of dark blue water in the fore-ground seeming to her delighted eyes to almost rise and fall with the impulsive throbbings of the ocean's mighty heart, while in the distance rose the barren cliffs of the Irish coast, described in the letter in her lap, and above the whole bent the arching heavens, flecked by the purple-grey cloudlets, silver-tipped by the chaste but beautiful sunset.</p>
               <p>It was an exquisite little thing, and, though merely a water-color sketch, its perfect finish rendered it valuable as a work of art, and to the receiver doubly so, coming from the hand of her loving artist friend. It was too beautiful, she thought, to hide away in the drawer with the rest of her treasures; but others' knowledge of her possession of it would excite such questions as she did not care to answer, and therefore as she heard Belle's step on the stairs, with one more lingering look at the little sketch, and at the dear name which closed the missive that had accompanied it, she laid them, away, and the key clicked in the lock just as her sister's hand was placed softly on the door.</p>
               <p>"In a moment, Belle!" she called, and throwing, down the little key in her hand, she hastened to unfasten the door and admit her sister.</p>
               <p>"Well, is Mr. Wright gone?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! and—" blushingly and hesitatingly,—"Berrie, I have something to tell you!"</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6505-00000118"/>
               <p>"Have you?" taking no note of her sister's embarrassment, her thoughts too full of her own affairs to think of aught beside, and blushing slightly as she wondered vaguely if it was anything concerning her own dear absent friend, that her sister had to communicate.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Belle?" she went on, "any thing nice?" "Oh, of course <emph>I</emph> think it is!"</p>
               <p>Berrie turned and looked at her, as the trembling, confused tones of her sister struck her ear.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Belle? do tell me!" she exclaimed eagerly.</p>
               <p>The girl held up her finger on which sparkled a solitaire ring, and said, laughing archly in the midst of her blushes: "Can't you guess what this means, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I can! that I am to congratulate you, does it not?" adding, as she put her arms around her sister and kissed her warmly, "I do, dear, with all my heart!"</p>
               <p>"I know you do," whispered Belle. "And oh! Berrie, I wish you were as happy as I am."</p>
               <p>A moment before the girl had thought her happiness full and complete. To find her doubts all annihilated, to hold in her hand the proof or token of her friend's continued love and remembrance, had seemed enough to fill her heart with joy; but in the presence of her sister's full tide of happiness her pleasure paled; all the lonely longing of the past few months for a sight of her dear one, all the weary waste of years which stretched between her hope and its glad fruition, all the possible chances or mischances of the future, rushed back to her heart, and her joy of the previous moment seemed but a mockery, compared to her sister's complete and triumphant happiness.</p>
               <p>With a little short laugh, she exclaimed bitterly: "Oh, <emph>I</emph> am happy, Belle, why should you doubt it?" and releasing her sister from her clasp, she sat down wearily in the nearest chair.</p>
               <p>"Do you think I am blind, Berrie? I know you are not happy."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>thought</emph> I was, at least a moment ago. But yon know <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'None here are happy, save in part,</l>

               <p>"Well, I am thoroughly glad that <emph>you are,</emph> if, as you persist, I am not."</p>
               <p>Belle said no more, but stood looking at her with a world of sympathetic regret expressed in her speaking face, until Berrie could endure it no longer, and with a little nervous shiver and laugh, turned away, covering her face with her hands, and exclaiming: "Don't, Belle! why do you look at me so?"</p>
               <p>Belle sprang to her side, and winding one arm around the girl's neck, said tenderly: "Can't you trust your sister, Berrie? <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'The grief that doth not speak</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> you know."</p>
               <p>Berrie burst into tears without reply, and her sister<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6505-00000119"/> let her silence express the sympathy she could not utter. At last she said softly: "You need not tell me, Berrie! I know that Eugene has gone away and taken your heart with him; but I know, also, that he loves you as well as you do him."</p>
               <p>"<emph>How</emph> do you know?" tremblingly.</p>
               <p>Belle laughed. "Why I have known it, child, for months. I am not so blind as you think me."</p>
               <p>"Did he tell Mr. Wright?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know, indeed! George has never mentioned the matter to me."</p>
               <p>"He had other things more interesting to talk of, I suppose!" smiling as she wiped away the traces of tears, relieved to turn the conversation from herself.</p>
               <p>"Well—I don't know about that!" blushingly.</p>
               <p>"When is he going back to Boston?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow; but he will be up in the morning to say good-by."</p>
               <p>"And when is it to be? Am I to be bridesmaid?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly! I don't know when—in the fall, I presume. I wish Eugene was here that we might have a double wedding."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that might not follow!"</p>
               <p>"Berrie, what became of your picture that was in the album?"</p>
               <p>"Isn't it there now? oh, I remember, I took it out and forgot to replace it"—with another, she added to herself, vexed that she should have neglected to do so.</p>
               <p>"Indeed?" and Belle laughed mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Come, Miss Isabel, it is time we were in bed. Remember member, I have not received a proposal of marriage to-night, and so may be supposed to desire a little sleep; and it is very late, do you know, Miss Burton?" and she held her watch before her sister's face.</p>
               <p>"Well, good-night, then, and pleasant dreams, Berrie!" as she kissed her and turned to the door.</p>
               <p>"The same to yourself, as I suppose they are sure to be, sleeping or waking."</p>
               <p>Belle looked back and laughed; then the door softly closed behind her.</p>
               <p>A hasty disrobing, a few moments' silent kneeling beside the low white bed, an unlocking of the private drawer, and last peep at the smiling face beneath the glittering cluster of jewels in the tiny casket, and darkness and silence reigned through the entire house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wright called in the morning, asked and received the consent of Belle's parents to their engagement, and departed on the afternoon train for Boston, of course a happy man.</p>
               <p>As Berrie gave him her hand in farewell, she said, Archly smiling up in his face: "I suppose I am to congratulate you, Mr. Wright! Please accept my best wishes for all manner of future happiness to you and Belle."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Berrie! and"—lowering his voice—"I suppose I may return the compliment in two or three years from now, when a certain friend of ours returns from his wanderings! eh, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know!" was the blushing reply, as she shook her head doubtfully. "Possibly you may have an opportunity before."</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6505-00000120"/>
               <p>"Possibly, but pardon me, if I say I <emph>hope</emph> not!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed! one would think your own happiness would cause you to wish others the same."</p>
               <p>"So it does, Berrie! but at the same time I should be sorry to have Eugene disappointed in his <emph>little friend's</emph> truth!"</p>
               <p>"You know too much, Mr. Wright, by far!" as with crimson cheeks she turned away.</p>
               <p>A significant but good-natured laugh was his reply, and Belle inquired: "What are you two talking about so confidentially there?"'</p>
               <p>"No cause for jealousy, Belle!" returned Berrie, hastily; "Mr. Wright was only advising me to 'go and do likewise.'"</p>

               <p>THE golden sunlight of a warm June afternoon stole into the little school-house of an inland New England town, where sat our old acquaintance, Miss Helen Harrington, with an open letter in her hand, and another upon the desk beside her.</p>
               <p>"It was an old-fashioned little affair, that country "temple of knowledge," situated in the edge of the village, on the borders of a grove of trees, composed of nearly every variety which beautiful, fertile New England can boast. A little low, one-story building,<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6505-00000121"/> with tiny entry in which to deposit the caps, shawls, and sun-bonnets of the village children who spent a portion of the day within its walls, and with old-fashioned seats and unpainted desks, which the ruthless hands—or knives—of mischievous boys of many generations had scored, and chipped, and carved, until they had lost all symmetry and native polish.</p>
               <p>The teacher's desk was on a low platform at one end of the unattractive room, and before it sat the weary teacher herself, with aching brow, and every nerve in a quiver, heartily glad that the duties of the day were over, and she was at last rid of the noisy, restless group of children, which, in the excited state of her nerves, had made the day one long torture to her.</p>
               <p>It was uncongenial employment to her, this "teaching the young ideas," antagonistic to all her tastes and aspirations, although she tried her best to do her duty in the sphere in which God had placed her; and, distasteful as was her occupation, the firmness of will and character she possessed rendering perfect discipline an easy matter to her, made her more than ordinarily successful as a teacher, while her native grace and kindness of heart attached her pupils to her, and won golden opinions from the parents of the children with whom she had to deal. In truth, the delicacy of her nervous organization was the greatest barrier to her content or happiness even.</p>
               <p>The days were exceedingly warm for the season, and the restless motion of the many little feet on the uncarpeted floor, the constant buzz of voices which it was impossible to quell entirely, the necessity for exertion tion which now and then a refractory pupil enforced, all acting upon her susceptible nerves, made teaching a torture to her, and the close of a session an unqualified relief. Besides all this, her health of late was none of the best, and the warmth of the season but added to the lassitude and weariness she found it impossible to shake off.</p>
               <p>She had spent the winter in one of the graded schools of Boston, where she had a pleasant and lucrative situation, but her health becoming impaired, and the necessity for work remaining, she resolved to apply for some small school in the country, hoping that the clear, pure, inland air might restore her drooping health and energies. But children are the same all the world over, and the little bare-footed, sometimes uncouth country urchins, were no less trying to their teacher than the mischievous city children had proved, and her health and spirits had rather retrograded than improved.</p>
               <p>But she had one other motive besides this for seeking a quiet summer in the country. The sub-master of the school in Boston in which she was employed as a teacher, had taken a lively interest in the proud but gifted girl, and a warm friendship had been the result. Indeed, it had come to be more than friendship on the man's part ere they separated, although, for a long time, quite unconsciously to Helen. He was a man of rare culture and refinement, a gentleman in the truest sense of the word, and she had enjoyed his society exceedingly, until startled by a betrayal of his passion for her, when she had immediately resigned her position in the school, and abruptly left the city. She did not stop to<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6505-00000122"/> ask herself if she cared for him in return,—she only felt that she could not continue to meet him on the previous free and cordial terms did she refuse him, and with her old resolve to marry only one who had "plenty of money," as she had expressed it in her school days, felt that she could not accept him.</p>
               <p>Therefore, without giving him the opportunity to make the declaration which she knew he was desirous to do, she had feigned indisposition—or yielded to it, rather, for she was far from well—resigned her position by letter, and returned to her home, where she remained until accepting her present engagement in the country. And though even yet she would not acknowledge that she cared for him, the consciousness that she was so dear to him rarely left her, and she was restless, dissatisfied, unhappy, and daily losing ground in health, strength, and spirits.</p>
               <p>The enthusiastic reception of her valedictory at the close of school, had first suggested the idea of turning her talents to account, but notwithstanding her dominant and haughty nature, she was somewhat distrustful of her powers, and a rather extensive reading had given her a better understanding of the difficulties attending the labors of an aspirant for literary honors than many amateur authors have possessed. Therefore she shrank from undertaking what might prove in the end but a mortifying failure.</p>
               <p>Entertaining a high opinion of her gifts and abilities, her friend had repeatedly urged her to enter the literary lists, and give scope and exercise to what he considered her rare talents. At first she had laughed at the suggestion, and at last, when he had one evening asked her abruptly why she did not attempt to write a book, she had replied frankly, "I cannot afford it, Mr. Carlisle."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me," he returned, "I scarcely understand you."</p>
               <p>She laughed. "I thought I spoke plainly enough; I cannot afford to do so."</p>
               <p>"Is it such an expensive undertaking?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it would require an outlay of time that I have not at command."</p>
               <p>"Well, take the time then!"</p>
               <p>"As I said before, I cannot afford it. I must work at something that pays."</p>
               <p>"But a successful novel brings often large pecuniary reward."</p>
               <p>"I know, but I might not be able to write a successful one."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubts on the subject."</p>
               <p>"Well, I have! to say nothing of the difficulties in publishing that an unknown author must necessarily experience."</p>
               <p>"Many young authors think that any publisher would be only too glad to print their effusions."</p>
               <p>"I am more modest, you see, or have a better understanding of the difficulties attending the beginning of a literary career. Besides, I have not the nerve or spirits to encounter the discouragements, criticisms, and perhaps failures that I should have to contend with."</p>
               <p>"Still, were you to undertake it, I should have no fears of your non-success."</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6505-00000123"/>
               <p>"You are very kind, and I feel greatly flattered at your high estimate of ray abilities; but I do not see how you can know anything about it, as you have never seen a word of mine, to my knowledge."</p>
               <p>Although the subject was soon dropped, it was not forgotten by her, and stimulated by his opinion of the possibilities of her nature, she resolved to attempt a work of fiction, and if she should succeed to her own satisfaction, to make an effort to publish, allowing herself to be discouraged by no obstacles which she might encounter. But engagements were so numerous during the remainder of her residence in the city that she had no opportunity to commence the great undertaking, and though she supposed she should have sufficient leisure during her country engagement to at least make a beginning, yet when the irksome duties of the day were over, she was invariably so weary and nervous that she had no inclination, or in fact power, to enter on a work which should only be pursued when mind and body are fresh, vigorous, untrammelled, and capable of being entirely concentrated on the subject in question. Thus her literary powers were still untested, and her aspirations in no immediate likelihood of being realized.</p>
               <p>The letter which she held in her hand on this sunny June afternoon, was closely but delicately written, and as we take the somewhat rude liberty of looking over her shoulder, we perceive that she is at the moment perusing the following passage:</p>

Maud Lester will be here in a week or two, Bristol is lovely at this season, and I have many a plan for enjoyment while my old school friends, Maud and Helen, are with me.

               <p>The regal brow of the girl became contracted as she laid the letter on the desk beside the other, and bent her head on her hand in deep, and evidently troubled reverie. The letters had both arrived in the morning mail, but a hasty glancing over the contents was all her time permitted, until, the duties of the day at last over, and the noisy troop of scholars dismissed, she was at liberty to ponder the contents of the two epistles before her.</p>
               <p>Although the reception of the latter had been a surprise to her, the sentiments and desires it embodied were none. She knew that he loved her, that he would gladly take her to his heart and do his best to shield her from the ills of life; knew also that he was a true, noble man, worthy her highest esteem and regard; but she was ambitious for wealth and fame,—she knew he could not give the one, and feared that the housewifely duties she would be obliged to assume as his wife would entirely interfere with the other. Therefore she deliberately shut her eyes to the blessing which the love and protection of such a man would be to her, carelessly threw away the greatest boon that life could offer her, and utterly refused to listen to the pleadings of her own heart, or confess that the affection so nobly offered to her, was really and truly reciprocated.</p>
               <p>She was still very young, knew nothing of love save in theory, and did not realize but what her preference for him was such as she might feel for any other man,—one who could give her the advantages which she craved. Nor could she appreciate or value an affection or protection that an older woman would have felt to be the highest and best of earth's poor offerings.</p>
               <p>Therefore, after a half-hour's painful and perplexing reverie, she drew from the desk before her paper and pens, and proceeded to reply to the letters in hand.</p>

               <p>The reply to the other epistle was written with more deliberation and care, and though it contained a refusal of the boon desired, it was couched in the most gentle and respectful terms. She thanked him gratefully for the honor he had done her, expressed much regret at the pain her decision might cost him, assured him of her high esteem and constant friendship for him, and hoped that their old pleasant intercourse might one day be renewed without a thought of regret on either side. On the whole, it was a very gentle and womanly letter, such as one would not have deemed it possible for the haughty, imperious Helen Harrington to have written. There was one noticeable thing about it, however; although her refusal of his suit was decided, she did not once say that she could not return his love, and in fact, gave not a single reason for her rejection.</p>
               <p>The letters written, sealed, and addressed, she donned her hat and proceeded to her boarding-place, only pausing at the post-office to deposit the important missives, and receiving in return a letter from her mother which had arrived in the afternoon mail.</p>

               <p>BERRIE, Berrie! where are you?" called Hattie from the entrance hall, one morning early in July, while Charlie Anderson stood on the piazza, absently tapping his boot with his cane.</p>
               <p>"Please come in, Mr. Anderson," she continued, as she received no response to her summons; "I don't know where she is, I am sure, but I dare say I can find her."</p>
               <p>She conducted the gentleman to the parlor, cool and<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6505-00000126"/> lovely with its close-drawn blinds, and adornments of handsome bouquets, then ran upstairs in search of her sister. Meeting Belle in the upper hall, she inquired: "Belle, <emph>do</emph> you know where Berrie is? Charlie Anderson is in the parlor, and I can't find her anywhere."</p>
               <p>"Have you been to her room?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! she isn't there."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps she is in the garden; if not, she has gone out probably."</p>
               <p>Down the stairs tripped the light little feet, and out on the side piazza, calling again: "Berrie, Berrie! where are you?"</p>
               <p>"Here I am, Hattie; what do you want?" and the graceful figure emerged from behind a grape-arbor, where she had been stooping over a bed of pansies. Her pretty pink morning dress was tucked up and pinned behind her, a wide hat concealed the sparkling, piquant face, and in her ungloved hand, the palm of which was covered with rich brown soil, she held a small garden trowel.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Charlie Anderson wants to see you, and I have been looking everywhere for you."</p>
               <p>"Is he alone, Hattie? Here, unpin my dress, won't you, please?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he is alone; but you aren't going in with those dirty hands, are you, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I am; I don't care for him." And the girl's dark eyes sparkled mischievously.</p>
               <p>Her face was very bright and gay that morning, and it was evident she was in one of her liveliest moods. For at times she missed and wanted her <emph>friend</emph> so much that it made her very sad, she did not always yield to such depressing feelings, and since she received his letter, now two or three months ago, she was often as gay and lively as in the days before love had come into her heart, stealing from it a little of its freshness and elasticity. She had become somewhat accustomed to his absence, and really congratulated herself on the patience with which she was bearing the long, and ofttimes weary probation. Spring, with its exhilarating days, and the brightness of summer, had restored the fulness of her usually perfect health, and her Spirits were almost as bright and gay as they had been the previous year.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Charlie! of course you wish to shake hands?" and she laughingly extended a little palm fresh from contact with the moist brown earth.</p>
               <p>"I don't know about it, Berrie!" glancing at his neat grey glove. "What have you been doing with yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Me? oh, only gardening a little—not making dirt pies. I thought I would take advantage of this cloudy morning to transplant some slips that required it. Accordingly, you see the result!" laughing as she held up her hands, and peeped mischievously up from the shade of her broad-brimmed hat.</p>
               <p>"But where are your gloves?" returned the fastidious gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Gloves? oh, in my pocket, I think. I couldn't bother with gloves around those delicate little plants. My hands will wash, I assure you," laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Indeed?" bending over the low chair in which she had seated herself.</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6505-00000127"/>
               <p>"Oh yes!" holding them out. "Don't they look pretty, Charlie! wouldn't you like to kiss them?" and the mischievous girl glanced archly up in her companion's face, which was bent, she thought, rather too near her own; therefore she pushed back her chair slightly as he returned, smiling: "Why no, Berrie, I do not think I would."</p>
               <p>"No? why now I thought you might!" still laughing archly.</p>
               <p>"Why should I, Berrie, when I can kiss your lips instead!" and he stooped to suit the action to the word; but ere he could reach her, she had sprung from her chair and was across the room, exclaiming: "But yon can't do that, <emph>this</emph> time!"</p>
               <p>The gentleman looked somewhat discomfited, and Berrie sat down on the other side of the room, laughing.</p>
               <p>"No, Charlie, I don't believe in such things! No girl should yield her lips save to her betrothed lover, and even then not too freely. That's a good theory, Charlie, if very little practised. I know that often, now-a-days, when gentlemen pay particular attentions to a lady, they are allowed such privileges from the first; while there may be nothing serious in the attentions, and she may keep company with a half-dozen before she marries. I don't believe in it, Charlie!" and she shook her head, smilingly.</p>
               <p>"I don't like prudes, Berrie!" he returned.</p>
               <p>"Neither do I! but it is better to err in that direction, even, than the other. I like for girls to keep their <emph>own</emph> respect, however, and then they are pretty certain to have that of the other sex."</p>
               <p>"You don't care for kisses, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>"Yes I do, who does not? but I care for my self-respect more; and there is only one man that can give me them, Charlie."</p>
               <p>"And who is that? Eugene Adair?" bitterly.</p>
               <p>The girl flushed rosily, but returned: "Don't talk nonsense, Charlie! I mean the man that I marry."</p>
               <p>"And that is?"</p>
               <p>"The Future and the Fates must determine!" laughing.</p>
               <p>The man drew nearer, and bending over her, said tenderly: "Let them decide on me, Berrie! Give me this little hand, and with it the right to take the kisses you have just denied me."</p>
               <p>It was out in spite of her, successfully as she had previously warded it off. She reproached herself for entering into such a conversation with him, but the crisis had come, and she must meet it as bravely as she could.</p>
               <p>With a little embarrassed laugh, she said, showing him her hands: "You forget the soil, Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"No! you said they would wash. Don't trifle with me, Berrie."</p>
               <p>The girl looked down without replying, and he continued: "You <emph>do</emph> love me a little, don't you, Berrie?" and bending nearer: "May I have my kiss?"</p>
               <p>"No, Charlie, I cannot give it you!" without looking up.</p>
               <p>"Berrie!" with a sharp ring of pain in his voice. "Do you mean to reject my love—to tell me that you do not care for me?"</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6505-00000128"/>
               <p>"Forgive me, Charlie! I tried my best to spare yon this."</p>
               <p>He caught her hands, soiled as they were, and exclaimed: "Berrie, look at me!" and then as she obeyed: "Don't you, <emph>can't</emph> you love me?"</p>
               <p>She shook her head sadly and slowly without other reply.</p>
               <p>For a moment he looked at her, his handsome violet eyes darkened with pain; then she exclaimed, attempting unsuccessfully to draw away her hands: "I am so sorry, Charlie! I tried to make you see that it never could be, but you would not understand."</p>
               <p>"'Love is blind," he returned, "and oh, Berrie, I <emph>do</emph> love you!"</p>
               <p>He saw her eyes fill with tears under his glance, and he said more gently: "Berrie, do you love another? May I not kiss you because I should take another man's caress from your lips?"</p>
               <p>She avoided the former question, blushing eloquently however, and replied to the other: "I told you why, Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"If I may not hope for a kiss of love from you, Berrie, won't you break through your rule for once, and give me one for friendship's sake?"</p>
               <p>She would have done it for very pity had she been free, had her lips not belonged to another, and to him alone, did not her betrothal kiss seem still lingering on her mouth. So she answered gently and sadly: "I can't, don't ask me, Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"Nor one of farewell?"</p>
               <p>"It isn't farewells it, Charlie? Now that you know it cannot be, you will not think so much about it after a little."</p>
               <p>"Berrie, do you know what love <emph>is?</emph>" smiling bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Does any one?" confusedly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, those who have felt it."</p>
               <p>"You cannot define it! 'I love, you love, they love!' that is the most you can say. And Charlie, I expect some young lady friends from Boston, in a week or two; I am sure you would like them, and you will come up, the same as before! Let us be friends, at least, Charlie."</p>
               <p>"I will come up if I can trust myself, but do not expect it just yet. Good-by, Berrie!" and notwithstanding the soiled palm, he pressed his lips to the little hand he held.</p>
               <p>"Good-by, Charlie, God bless and comfort you! I am so sorry; I like you so dearly as a friend."</p>
               <p>He smiled, very faintly and sadly, however, and a moment later the door closed behind him, and she was alone.</p>
               <p>The brightness had gone out of her day, and a few warm tears welled over her brimming eyes, as she realized what pain she had been obliged to inflict on one who loved her so well, and whom she esteemed so highly as a friend. She could not forgive herself for tempting the avowal by the mischievous conversation she had allowed herself to drift into, but was consoled at last, or endeavored to be, by the thought that it must have come some time, and that it Was better then than later.</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6505-00000129"/>
               <p>For a few minutes she tried to persuade herself that she might be happy with him; happier, perhaps, than in waiting so long for what might, after all, never come to her; that in his love she might forget, after a time, the tender face of her absent friend. But in her ears rang his "Be true to me, Berrie, and I shall hope for a happy coming home by-and-by!" She reflected on the disappointments he "had hitherto borne, his hardly-won trust in her, his hopes for the future, and up rose the mighty swellings of her love for him, rebuking her for her moment's faithlessness, though only in thought.</p>
               <p>"No I it must be he, or none! Charlie was a dear, dear friend, but Eugene was the one love of her life; and let the future bring what it might, she <emph>would</emph> be true to him and to herself.</p>

               <p>LETTER for you, Berrie, and one for Belle as a matter of course; two for me, a paper from Charlie, and that is all," said Mr. Burton, distributing the morning mail, which had just come in, while they were still at table.</p>
               <p>It was early in the last week of July, and as Berrie opened hers, she exclaimed: "Helen is in Boston, and she and Maud will be here on the evening train to-day;" adding, as she folded up her letter and turned to her sister: "What does Mr. Wright say, Belle? anything special?"</p>
               <p>"No!" was the quiet reply. "He thinks he shall be on in a week or two, for a short vacation, he says."</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6505-00000130"/>
               <p>Berrie thought, with a little pang of mingled envy and regret, of the one who had accompanied him on such a trip the previous year,—one little year, which had made such a change in her heart and life,—of one then entirely unknown to her, and now so very, very dear. Nearly three months had elapsed since the receipt of his one precious letter, and she had been for some time looking and longing for another. She had not replied to the last, as he had not requested, or seemed to expect, her to do so, and besides, either inadvertently or intentionally, had omitted to send her any address. She thought it probable that Mr. Wright had it, but she was too proud to ask him for it, or let him know that she was ignorant of it. He had kindly offered to take charge of any "mysterious packet which she desired to have conveyed across the ocean'" but she had thanked him confusedly, and assured him she could herself dispose of any such in Providence, as she was often there; however, she had none at present, and did not expect to have. He thought it rather singular she should not write to her friend, and concluded she spoke in that way, as she was too shy to own to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The thoughts of him which Belle's news had provoked sent her to her room with a little sad regret in her heart, to glance once more over the pages of her one dear letter, and gaze on the "pictured likeness of her love," in the jewelled ring he had given her. How it brought back their last happy moments together, when he had been so tender and loving, and, though the bitter parting was so near at hand, filled her heart with such sweet and perfect happiness. "Oh my love!" she murmured, as she gazed on the noble face, "if I could only see you once more!" and her eyes filled with tears of longing, and her heart throbbed with such a heavy ache, as she thought of the long, long years which still stretched between her desire and its fulfilment.</p>
               <p>Very bitter are these long separations from our loved ones! Very hard to bear, this heart-breaking longing for the sweets of reciprocal love—the presence, words, and caresses of one who is all the world to us. But like many another poor, lonely woman, she was obliged to <emph>endure</emph> it silently, and as patiently as might be.</p>
               <p>All day long her thoughts were full of him, while she dusted, arranged, and adorned with her favorite flowers parlors and guest-chamber; and when she was dressing for the evening, she paused again before the locked drawer, for one more peep at the pictured face of her dear one.</p>
               <p>Her toilet was nearly completed, and as the tiny spring clicked in closing, she slipped the ring on her finger, and holding it off to look on it lovingly, noting its beauty and brilliancy, she murmured to herself, "I have half a mind to wear it, and see what they will all say-about it. It will excite any quantity of questions, and I don't know whether I am brave enough to face them or not. Well, I will wear it until I finish dressing, at all events."</p>
               <p>She went to the mirror to put on the finishing touches to her pretty dress, and as she fastened her hair and collar with rose-colored ribbons, she noted with a<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6505-00000131"/> girlish satisfaction-little as she cared in reality for jewels-the beauty and glitter of the precious stones on "her finger. At length she decided to wear it; she meant to do so, some time, and as well now as ever, and then the quizzing would be over.</p>
               <p>She was going to the depot to meet her friends, and more for the use than ornament, she added the watch and chain which her father had given her on her return from school a year ago. She had sent for a carriage, and was momently expecting it, and, anxious to have the ring ordeal over before her friends should arrive, she hastened downstairs to wait for it.</p>
               <p>She had iwt been long in the room where her mother and sister were sitting, before Belle exclaimed, "Why, Berrie, what have you got on your hand!"</p>
               <p>"Why where, Belle? I don't see anything," returned the little actress, as she looked them over intently in seeming alarm, pretending to think there was something terrible there.</p>
               <p>Belle laughed. "Why, on your finger, goosey! How came you by such a pretty ring?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that!" in a tone of 'affected relief. "Did I never show it you, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"Of course you did not! Where did you get it, pray?" coming closer to examine it.</p>
               <p>"I didn't steal it," archly.</p>
               <p>"I presume not, nor buy it either."</p>
               <p>"Don't be too sure about the latter. I saved up a lot of money when I was at school."</p>
               <p>"Not to buy diamond rings, though, I warrant!" laughing.</p>
               <p>"Not I, indeed! Didn't you know that one of my numerous admirers gave it to me? Let's see! which one was it?" musingly.</p>
               <p>"Of course you do not know!"</p>
               <p>"Of course not, no! But, seriously, have you never seen it before? I have had it a long time."</p>
               <p>"How should I see it, since you never wear it, or leave it around? Did Ned Lester give it to you?"</p>
               <p>"I don't like to tell!" blushing, with drooping head and finger in her mouth, with affected bashfulness.</p>
               <p>"Well, it's elegant! Ma, do you know anything about this mysterious ring?"</p>
               <p>"No more than yourself, Belle," her mother returned, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Oh, there's the carriage; good-by!" and glad to escape further questioning, she ran off.</p>
               <p>"Well, I am thankful <emph>that</emph> is over!" she thought. "Fortunately, Belle never suspected the source from which it came. I expected she would at once. Ned Lester!" laughing. "Well, I only hope she won't ask Maud, and she may think that as long as she likes."</p>
               <p>A few minutes' drive brought her to the depot, and her gay greeting to her friends, who shortly arrived, was met with a quiet kiss and—"I am ever so glad to see you, Berrie!" from Maud, and a laughing "Well, well! Miss Burton, do I behold you? I am tired to death, and hope you are glad enough to see me to pay for the trouble of coming!" from Helen.</p>
               <p>"She's the same Helen, isn't she, Maud? I'll leave you to guess whether I am glad to see you; but if you<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6505-00000132"/> talk like yourself, you don't look like it; how thin and pale you are! what have you been doing with yourself?"</p>
               <p>"'Teaching the young idea how to shoot,' and expending all my own ammunition in the attempt."</p>
               <p>"I should judge so! well, we will try and furnish you with a fresh supply before you go back. But give me your checks, girls, and I will have you home in no time."</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Miss Berrie! Can I render you any assistance?"</p>
               <p>The blood rushed to brow and cheek, as she turned at the voice of her old friend Charlie, whom she had not seen since their momentous interview; more than two weeks ago. She had learned accidentally that he was away, and was not aware that he had returned.</p>
               <p>"Why, Charlie, how do you do? I haven't seen you in ever so long!" extending her hand. "Allow me to present my friends. Mr. Anderson, Miss Harrington, Miss Lester."</p>
               <p>"My fellow-travellers, I presume!" smiling, as he acknowledged the rather informal introduction.</p>
               <p>"Why! have you just returned, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. What can I do for you, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, if you will please take charge of these checks! I have a carriage outside.'</p>
               <p>He placed the young ladies in the carriage, then went off in search of the baggage.</p>
               <p>"There's a 'gallant knight' for you, Helen!" said Berrie, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Has he got plenty of money?"</p>
               <p>"That's the only qualification Helen desires," laughed Maud.</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you call a plenty! He has a good business, and never wants, I guess. He is a fine man, and would make you happy, Helen."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he might decline the honor; and possibly he is spoken for already."</p>
               <p>"I think not," returned Berrie, provoked to know she was blushing, and that the girls would fancy from her confusion, that he was more to her than he was. She always <emph>did</emph> blush when she most desired not to, and the consciousness of doing so only made the matter worse.</p>
               <p>"Ahem!" said Helen mischievously," perhaps not!"</p>
               <p>His immediate return ended the conversation, to Berrie's relief.</p>
               <p>"Won't you come up with us, Charlie?" she asked, as he shut the door.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Berrie, not to-night; but I mil try and come soon," and lifting his hat he turned away.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to see you looking so miserable, Helen; what is the matter with you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing special! I haven't been well since I began teaching. It tears my nerves all to pieces."</p>
               <p>"Why don't you give it up, then?"</p>
               <p>Helen laughed bitterly. "Because I don't care to take an apartment at Mount Auburn, just yet."</p>
               <p>"But you may do so, if you don't stop."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll die decently, then, and not starve to death and be buried in a potter's-field."</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6505-00000133"/>
               <p>"I guess it is not quite as bad as that."</p>
               <p>"That is because you do not know."</p>
               <p>"I guess it isn't either!" said Maud. u Helen is tired and cross to-night, aren't you, Queenie?"</p>
               <p>"I shouldn't wonder if I were!" with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>
               <p>"Well, we are nearly home now, and you shall just do as you like for the next few weeks."</p>
               <p>"What a luxury! I shall appreciate it, I assure you. I tell you, girls, I often think of the piece Maud read exhibition-day; and like the gleaner, 'I grow so weary, weary, carrying home the sheaves!' These verses particularly haunt me: <q>

               <p>"You should think sometimes of the last verse, Helen," said Berrie, as the carriage turned into her street, "and remember that <q>

               <p>As they reached home, Belle came running out to the carriage. "You need not introduce me, Berrie," she said, as she opened the door, "I have heard so much about Maud and Helen, that I know them already;" and she kissed both of the girls as she assisted them to alight.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6505-00000134"/>
               <p>"Come upstairs, girls, and wash!' said Berrie, as they entered the house, "and never mind about changing your dresses to-night."</p>
               <p>"No" said Belle, "tea is all ready."</p>
               <p>"Where do you wish the trunks, Miss?" inquired the driver.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Belle, you attend to them, will you, please?" and she conducted her friends upstairs to the tasteful guest-chamber, which she had taken so much pains in arranging.</p>
               <p>"What a pretty room!" exclaimed Maud, as they entered. "And what a glorious sunset!" as she glanced through the deep west window, opened nearly to the floor.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I can endure this for a while," said Helen, throwing herself into a low rocker that stood near the window.</p>
               <p>"Never mind the sunset," she added to Maud; "do wash while I rest, please."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how is Ned?" inquired Berrie.</p>
               <p>"He's well, and saucy as ever! He wished me to tell you he should run down for a few days, while we were here. Then look out for being teased!" laughing.</p>
               <p>"I expect so! Don't he improve any under your tuition?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid not much."</p>

               <p>WELL, well, girls! here are three of you with jewelled rings on your fore-fingers. And you too, Berrie, that never cared for such things! I should like to know what it all means. Come to confession, girls!" and the speaker, Helen Harrington, drew herself up gravely.</p>
               <p>It was a dull, cloudy morning, and they hardly knew what to do with themselves, and in lieu of anything else, talked any quantity of nonsense, as girls will do when they are together.</p>
               <p>"Be merciful, Queenie, and spare our blushes!" said Belle, laughing.</p>
               <p>"'The quality of mercy? is strained-out and gone, Mr. Shakspeare to the contrary notwithstanding. I <emph>have</emph> no mercy. Come, kneel before me and make<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6505-00000135"/> confession. Isabel!"—sternly, and pointing to the floor at her feet.</p>
               <p>"Isabel" obeyed the gesture, and dropping on her knees before her confessor, hid her face in her hands.</p>
               <p>"Will not your Royal Highness permit us to confess for another, instead of ourselves?"</p>
               <p>"Mark the way of the world! How much easier it is to acknowledge others' faults or errors than our own! Confess, fair penitent"</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to confess, may it please your Highness!"</p>
               <p>"What means this gewgaw that sparkles on the fore-finger of your left hand?"</p>
               <p>"It means—it means—that it won't fit any other!"</p>
               <p>"It means—it means—a wedding next fall," laughed Berrie. "Come, Helen, let me confess for the lot!" and she dropped on her knees by her sister's side, saying: "Arise, fair penitent, and leave your cause with me."</p>
               <p>"Well, what have <emph>you</emph> to say for yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing for myself, anything you like for my companions."</p>
               <p>"You have explained the meaning of Belle's jewel; Maud's comes next in order."</p>
               <p>"Maud? oh, her's means that she will be my sister one of these fine days."</p>
               <p>"And yours?"</p>
               <p>"Mine is without a meaning! mysterious in origin, and mysterious in significance! Not a solitaire, you perceive, fair queen."</p>
               <p>"I perceive more than is apparent! Your blushes are more eloquent than your ring."</p>
               <p>"One means as much as the other—nothing!" she arose from her knees and sat down. "Come, girls, it is a year since we left school, we have seen a year of woman-life, and ought to have some plans for the future. Suppose we mark out our prospective life for five years to come, and at the end of that time compare notes as to the fulfilment of our hopes."</p>
               <p>"Very well!" answered Helen. "Belle, you are the oldest, begin!"</p>
               <p>"'Man proposes, and God disposes!'" Belle returned. "I anticipate nothing more than falls to the average lot of woman; a happy home, and a busy life, working for those I love."</p>
               <p>"Maud!"</p>
               <p>"I do not know that I have any distinct plans. Charlie and I expect to be married in about a year—" with many blushes—" I hope to be happy, useful, and beloved."</p>
               <p>"As I do not doubt you will, sweet sister," whispered Berrie.</p>
               <p>"Now, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>"I believe you are the oldest, Helen!"</p>
               <p>"That does not matter! proceed, and I will follow."</p>
               <p>"My plans depend so much on others, that I can say nothing definite. I anticipate a few years of weary waiting, and then—hope's fruition, or disappointment. And you, Helen!",</p>
               <p>"Oh, I expect to 'waste my sweetness 'on bare-footed, tow-headed urchins, and wake up some morning to find myself famous."</p>
               <p>"Ma says, 'come to dinner, girls!'" interposed Hattie<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6505-00000136"/> tie, entering the room at that moment; and glad of anything for a change, her summons was promptly obeyed.</p>
               <p>About two weeks had elapsed since their arrival, and the time had passed very pleasantly to them all, in enjoying the walks and drives of which the suburbs of Bristol boast so many beautiful ones, in various picnics and excursions, to say nothing of informal evening gatherings, which had invariably been so very pleasant.</p>
               <p>Charlie Anderson had been very attentive, and rarely betrayed the pain and passion which had stolen so much of the sweetness from his life, and sobered a little the former gayety of his manner. Once when Berrie was at the piano, and the others were all standing around her, Helen had said, apropos to a previous remark: "Oh, a woman's 'no' always means 'yes!'"</p>
               <p>"Is that a fact?" he asked quickly, with such a changed and eloquent face, and eyes fixed on the girl at whose back he was standing.</p>
               <p>"Proverbially true, Mr. Anderson!" was the laughing answer.</p>
               <p>"Then I am all right," he returned, more earnestly than playfully.</p>
               <p>Helen had noticed his changing face, and was persuaded of what she had suspected all along; that Berrie had refused him, and that he loved her madly still. But he was generally on his guard, although the girl's gentle, sympathetic manner, since the fatal morning which had dashed his hopes to the ground, was much harder to endure than coldness or hauteur would have been.</p>
               <p>The following week Ned Lester, Charlie Burton, and Mr. Wright were to be there, and the girls—Maud and Helen—were to return with them, Berrie and Belle accompanying them, to make the purchases which the important event to occur in the Fall rendered necessary.</p>
               <p>The next week came, and with it the expected guests; and there was certainly no gayer house in that beautiful town for some days to come than that of the Burtons. Helen's health had wonderfully improved, thanks to the leisure, gay company, and life-giving breeze, freshly perfumed by the salt breath of the Bay, and with returning health had come her old bloom and gayety, and she was ever the life of the party. The gentlemen's arrival was but the signal for increased pleasure, and many were the pleasant drives, picnics, sails, and other excursions which they enjoyed during their stay.</p>
               <p>Climbing the steep hills to reach the new cemetery, lingering with awed hearts among the beautiful trees of the silent city, enjoying the view which its altitude commanded, filled pleasantly and profitably one beautiful afternoon. A drive to Mount Hope, and brief resting in "King Philip's Chair," passed away another. A walk through Constitution street, far out into the silent country, occupied one golden morning, and filled their hearts with recollections of a scene, than which no fairer had their eyes ever beheld. A drive through the southern portion of the town to "the ferry," and past the elegant residences in the suburbs, gaily whirled away the time of one breezy afternoon. A sail or row<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6505-00000137"/> on the blue waters of the beautiful bay filled more than one glorious moon-lit evening, and other amusements, too numerous to mention, rendered every hour of their stay a pleasure long to be remembered.</p>
               <p>The excursion to Newport which had proved so contrary the previous year, was again attempted, and this time successfully accomplished. The day had been perfect, the sail to and from delightful, the stay in Newport exceedingly pleasant, and the company nearly the same as on the preceding occasion.</p>
               <p>But to Berrie, there was a decided difference. One who had made her day a golden one before, was far away; and though she could not choose but be lively with Ned Lester for her escort, yet every moment was filled with recollections of, and longings for the absent one, and she was really glad when she stood once more upon the steps of her own home, and knew that the much talked of excursion was among the things of the past.</p>
               <p>Jennie Wardell, now Mrs. Malvern, had been in the company, and suspecting more of the relations between Mr. Adair and Berrie than she had been successful in her efforts to confirm, and remembering the events of the former excursion, she could not resist alluding to it, in order to tease and annoy Berrie, if it were possible to do so.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, do you remember who was with us a year ago, when we attempted to visit Newport, and had to take up with Rocky Point? I wonder where Mr. Adair is now; do you know, Berrie?" she had asked soon after they started on their homeward passage, and while there was still light enough to note every change of the lovely face.</p>
               <p>The company were all in a group, and Berrie, knowing well that more than one pair of curious eyes were upon her, felt more than ever provoked to feel the rush of color from heart to cheek, at mention of the name which had been in all her thoughts through every hour in the day.</p>
               <p>She wished Mrs. Malvern anywhere else but there, but answered calmly and haughtily: "I do not, indeed! how should I? He went to Europe, I believe, did he not, Mr. Wright?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, last October!" he returned. "Doesn't Newport look lovely at this distance?" kindly attempting to change the conversation, knowing well how embarrassing it was to Berrie.</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Malvern was not so easily silenced. She laughed provokingly, and said to Ned: "Mr. Lester, you took better care of Berrie to-day than her escort did last year. She and Mr. Adair wandered off together over the rocks, and she fell and sprained her ankle so badly it was as much as ever that she could get home."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" he returned coolly. "Perhaps that wasn't her escort's fault."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not!" with her provoking laugh. "But he felt very badly about it, and did his best to console her for it, didn't he, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> say that he did; I do not wish to dispute your word, and you seem to know more about it than any one else."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6505-00000138"/>
               <p>"Oh, I only judge from observation!" with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>
               <p>"People are mistaken in their judgment sometimes, Mrs. Malvern," Mr. Wright remarked.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mrs. Malvern has had so much experience in such matters, she is sure to be right. I would not destroy her self-esteem for anything," said Berrie, scorn-fully.</p>
               <p>The lady having had more than one encounter with Berrie, in which she had invariably been worsted, thought it best to let the subject drop, and accordingly changed the conversation.</p>
               <p>Berrie was more vexed than she cared to show, and she resolved to do her best to drop Mrs. Malvern from her list of acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Ned's curiosity was excited, and at the first opportunity he asked her abruptly who Mr. Adair was.</p>
               <p>"Oh, a gentleman that spent the summer here last year; a friend of Mr. Wright's," she answered as carelessly as she could.</p>
               <p>"And of yours?" mischievously.</p>
               <p>"An acquaintance, yes!"</p>
               <p>"Only an acquaintance, eh? What sort of a looking fellow was he? I am desperately jealous, Berrie."</p>
               <p>Berrie would fain have let the matter drop, but Ned was not inclined to do so, therefore she thought she would tease him a little, since he was so fond of teasing her, so she answered: "A very handsome man, Ned, and as fascinating as fine looking. One of your born aristocrats, you know, betraying it in bearing, manner and tone."</p>
               <p>Ned ground his teeth savagely. "And what is he to you, Berrie?" catching her hand.</p>
               <p>"To me? Let go my hand, Ned! Oh, I told you, an acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"Nothing more?"</p>
               <p>"Well, a friend, if you like!" blushing.</p>
               <p>"Nothing more?"</p>
               <p>"I don't answer impertinent questions, Ned!" laughing. "Let go my hand!"</p>
               <p>"Couldn't, Berrie! It's quite a nice little hand, and this is a nice little ring, by Jove! "Did' that fellow, Adair, give it you?"</p>
               <p>"You forget what I told you?"</p>
               <p>"What?"</p>
               <p>"That I never answer impertinent questions."</p>
               <p>"Well, you didn't tell me what sort of a looking fellow he was. Is that impertinent, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!" laughing. "Why, yes, I did tell you! handsome, distinguished-looking, and all that sort of thing."</p>
               <p>"Well, is he black or white, yellow, red, or what?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is light—by the way, you have seen him yourself! r. You remember the man we saw at Copeland's the night before I came home last Summer, and again at the depot the day I left?"</p>
               <p>"Confound it! not <emph>that</emph> impudent fellow?"</p>
               <p>"That <emph>gentleman,</emph> yes! He came down on the same train"—wickedly—"assisted me at the junction, called here the same evening, and I was introduced to him."</p>
               <p>"Romantic, by Jove! and what about the sprained ankle?"</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6505-00000139"/>
               <p>"Nothing, only I sprained it!"</p>
               <p>"Through your own fault?"</p>
               <p>"Of course! whose else do you suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Berrie, I'll not have any more such doings! ship the man at once!"</p>
               <p>"Couldn't! He shipped himself last October; first for England, then the Continent."</p>
               <p>"For how long?"</p>
               <p>"An absence? oh, four or five years, I presume."</p>
               <p>"And what then?"</p>
               <p>"What when?"</p>
               <p>"Why, when he returns."</p>
               <p>"How should I know? A wedding with some one, possibly," mischievously.</p>
               <p>"And that some one is Berrie Burton?"</p>
               <p>"I don't answer impertinent questions, yon remember. Come, Ned, I think you have quizzed me enough. <emph>Please</emph> let go my hand."</p>
               <p>For reply he clasped it tighter, and attempted to draw her nearer, saying: "Well, give me a kiss and tell me you love me, Berrie, and I'll forgive you."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I shall do no such thing!" she laughed, accustomed to that sort of thing from this most audacious young gentleman.</p>
               <p>He bent nearer, attempting to take what she refused, but she boxed his ears soundly, and in his consternation succeeded in releasing her other hand from his clasp.</p>
               <p>"Ned, you are worse than ever! I don't see as Maud has reformed you a bit."</p>
               <p>"I told you she couldn't while you were around, Berrie. You shouldn't have such tempting lips if you don't want to be kissed. They always look as if they were just ready for it."</p>
               <p>"You saucy fellow; it is no such thing!"</p>
               <p>"It is too! Come, kiss me once, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"Do you want to take another man's kiss from my lips?" laughing archly, and looking back over her shoulder, as she ran out of the room.</p>
               <p>The day but one before their visit was ended, they accompanied a picnic party on an excursion to Nayatt. Ned escorted Berrie, as a matter of course. Charlie Anderson had invited her, but she was very glad that Ned had previously engaged her company, as she felt it would be very unwise to accept of his escort during the hours of such informal intercourse as an excursion like that would entail. Therefore he had taken Helen instead. Charlie Burton took possession of his affianced bride, Maud, and Mr. Wright, of course, escorted Belle. As usual, they were a very gay party, and passed an exceedingly pleasant day.</p>
               <p>"Well, this ends our excursions from fair old Bristol, I suppose!" remarked Maud on the homeward ride. "I have had such a pleasant visit, Berrie; I shall always remember it."</p>
               <p>"So have I!" added Helen; "and I am much obliged for the new stock of ammunition you have given me, to teach shooting with again."</p>
               <p>"What <emph>do</emph> you mean, Queenie?" said Ned.</p>
               <p>Helen laughed. "To 'teach the young idea how to shoot,' you know."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said Ned, looking rather sold; whereupon followed a general laugh at his expense.</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6505-00000140"/>
               <p>"But seriously, Berrie," Helen continued, "I <emph>have</emph> enjoyed my visit more than I can tell you. Just wait until that millionaire comes along, and then I'll pay old scores."</p>
               <p>"I'll wait!" laughing. "I am very glad if you have had a pleasant visit, girls, I am sure. I have enjoyed it exceedingly for my part."</p>
               <p>The next evening a party of friends gathered at Mr. Burton's to bid Berrie's guests farewell, and on the following morning the three gentlemen and four ladies took the first train for Boston. An excursion which, to one of the number, proved a most important one.</p>

               <p>COME, girls, this is such a beautiful day, do let your shopping go, and let us visit Mount Auburn to-day. I haven't been there in ever so long, and I think it would be real pleasant,' said Maud, two or three mornings after their arrival in Boston, as they arose from the breakfast table.</p>
               <p>"I do, too!" said Ned.</p>
               <p>"Who said anything about you, sir?" retorted Berrie. "You don't suppose we would have you along, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Now, Berrie, you <emph>know</emph> you couldn't get along without me."</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6505-00000141"/>
               <p>"I know I should have infinitely more peace if I left you at home."</p>
               <p>"I should like to go, for one, very much," said Belle, "but I feel as if I ought to hurry my shopping along as fast as I can, and get home."</p>
               <p>"Oh, one day, more or less, won't make much difference."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll go, if the rest wish it."</p>
               <p>"The rest do, as a matter of course," returned Helen; "any thing for excitement."</p>
               <p>"May I go, please, Miss Lester?" said Ned pleadingly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I suppose we shall have to let you," returned his sister; "but you just hurry off, and go down town and see if Charlie and Mr. Wright can go, and meet us at Scollay's building at—let me see! can we get down there by half-past-ten, girls?"</p>
               <p>Berrie looked at her watch. "It only wants a quarter of nine now, and it will take us—how long? three-quarters to go down, Maud?"</p>
               <p>"About that, I suppose, yes!"</p>
               <p>"That leaves us an hour to get ready in. I should think we might be off in that time."</p>
               <p>"I should too! hurry off, Ned, and don't keep us waiting down town, for it is a long way out there."</p>
               <p>"All right! Adieu, Strawberry!"</p>
               <p>"Farewell, Nettles!" she retorted, and kissing his hand to her, he took his departure.</p>
               <p>The girls were prompt to time for once, and after a long and somewhat tiresome ride, they stood within the beautiful grounds. Having previously seen the principal places of interest, they preferred to walk, and strolled leisurely off in the direction of the tower. It was somewhere about two o'clock when they reached it. They sat down in the shade near its base for awhile, then attempted the ascent.</p>
               <p>Helen was considerably in advance of the others, and as she stepped up on the open platform at the top, a familiar figure met her view, which, turning at sound of her step, and taken off his guard, uttered involuntarily a passionate expression of endearment, then added deprecatingly, before she could speak, "Forgive me, Miss Harrington, you took me completely by surprise. How do you do?" extending his hand.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am well, thank you, Mr. Carlisle. I did not think of seeing you here. Allow me to present my friends," as the remainder of the party made their appearance on the scene.</p>
               <p>The introductions were made, and they all turned to look at the matchless view spread before. The silent city of the dead in the foreground, with its marble shafts gleaming through the dark green foliage of the trees, and its picturesque lakes, looking like jetty glass as they slept in the shade below; the smooth green fields which intervened between the cemetery and the distant city of Cambridge, conspicuous in which gleamed the golden dome of the observatory, and the gray cluster of collegiate buildings; the great tri-mountain city still farther in the background; at the right Brookline, Brighton, and other places of interest, and the golden August sun touching with beautifying gleams every point in the beautiful landscape. But<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6505-00000142"/> there were two of the party that gazed on the scene with eyes that took no note of its matchless beauty and variety.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Carlisle the meeting seemed like a fate. He was thinking of her at the moment, wishing she was there to see the lovely view, and longing for one more sight of the proud, haughty face so dear to him, when, hearing a step, he had turned mechanically, only to find his wishes gratified, and see before him the one who was all the world to him.</p>
               <p>As to Helen, his involuntary, unguarded exclaimation touched her exceedingly; and the quick thrill that ran over her pulse as she recognized the familiar form, had shown her how untrue she had been to him, and her own heart, in rejecting the love so nobly offered, how thoroughly his affection for her was reciprocated, and placed before her mind in its true light, the feeling or principle which could throw away the love of such a man as he was for the possible chance of one day winning wealth and fame, which never yet have satisfied a truly womanly heart.</p>
               <p>"Fool that I was!" she thought to herself. "Here were home, comfort, competence, and the tenderest affection offered me by a man whom I can esteem, honor, and even love with my whole heart, and for a vision I have thrust them all aside, leaving a certainty of nothing but a life of drudgery at an occupation that is one long torture to me. Yet he cares for me still, I am positive, and a single word from me would bring him to my feet again. Shall I speak it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Helen, were you ever silent so long in your life, before?" exclaimed Berrie at last.</p>
               <p>"Silent! was I? well, I was pondering a weighty matter, and besides, haven't I sufficient cause for silence in that lovely view? Mr. Carlisle, how are all my old friends at school? think I must come back in the Fall, if there is a vacancy. I do not think I can endure another season in that horribly dull country town," and she looked at him with, he thought, the sweetest smile he had ever seen on her lips.</p>
               <p>How his heart bounded with hope at her manner and words! He did not believe her to be a coquette, and certainly nothing could be more encouraging. But he answered quietly: "Your friends are all well but Miss Clare, and would be more than pleased to welcome you back. The lady procured to fill your place has resigned to be married"—smiling—"and the position is vacant. Of course it is yours if you desire."</p>
               <p>"Thanks! I think I must accept it! But what is the matter with Miss Clare? I had not heard she was ill."</p>
               <p>"She has had a light run of fever, caused by overwork; but is convalescent now, I think."</p>
               <p>"I must call and see her. She is at home, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, she was preparing to go away when taken sick."</p>
               <p>"Poor Ella! I am very sorry. I must surely call and see her to-morrow afternoon."</p>
               <p>"Do you remain in Boston long?"</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6505-00000143"/>
               <p>A few days only, then I shall go home to Dedham. When does the term begin?."</p>
               <p>"The first Monday in September."</p>
               <p>"Only a little more than a week, then!"</p>
               <p>That is all!" smiling.</p>
               <p>"Well, you may count on me!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Carlisle, determined to make the most of the opportunity, kept at Helen's side during the remainder their stay, although without monopolizing her conversation and attention to the exclusion of the rest of the party, and they all left the grounds together, taking the same car for Boston.</p>
               <p>As has been previously stated, he was a gentleman of rare culture and refinement, and made himself so agreeable, that the whole party were exceedingly pleased with him, and when, on reaching Boston, they exchanged for their own car, he was strongly urged to accompany them home, and spend the evening. He hesitated for a time, scarcely knowing what reply to make; but an evening once more in the society of the woman he loved was a stronger temptation than he felt able to resist, and he at length accepted with pleasure the very pressing and cordial invitation extended to him.</p>
               <p>The evening passed as such evenings generally do pass; in unimportant conversation and lively repartee, with now and then an interval of really sensible conversation, a little music, and the like. v</p>
               <p>Mr. Carlisle, without rendering his attentions marked, contrived to make Miss Helen understand that she was still as dear as ever to him, and she in turn was all that he could desire, and hope held high carnival in his heart when he took his leave.</p>
               <p>She was standing a little apart from the others—perhaps intentionally—bending over a stand of plants, when he came to bid her good-by.</p>
               <p>"Good-night, Helen!" he said softly, as he extended his hand. "I am more happy than I can tell you at meeting you again, and I would be glad to have a little conversation with you. May I call for you at Miss Clare's to-morrow afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you wish," she returned somewhat confusedly.</p>
               <p>"At what hour, please, Helen?"</p>
               <p>"About four o'clock, I think."</p>
               <p>"Then farewell until then!"</p>
               <p>He pressed her hand, looked into her eyes for a moment with a very eloquent glance, turned away, made his adieus to the others, and was gone.</p>
               <p>"What an agreeable man, and how noble he is in looks and appearance!" exclaimed Berrie, when he was out of hearing. "Is he rich, Helen?" mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Scarcely! He is sub-master of the school in which I taught last winter, or rather, was, for he tells me he is to be principal hereafter."</p>
               <p>"Then if he lacks the one attractive quality to you, I suppose it is of no use to tease you about him."</p>
               <p>"Not the slightest, I assure you!" calmly.</p>
               <p>"Well, I think he is splendid, at all events! Don't you, girls?"</p>
               <p>They all agreed with her, and the subject was dropped.</p>
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6505-00000144"/>
               <p>The following afternoon about three o'clock, in the chamber of a pleasant house at the South End, sat Miss Helen Harrington, while near her, propped up with pillows, reclined a delicate looking young lady, some two or three years Helen's senior.</p>
               <p>"How well you are looking, Helen!" she said, after a slight pause in the conversation, in which she had been intently regarding her friend. "So much better than when you left town last winter. Do you know, your sudden resignation created quite a sensation at school? I shall not soon forget how Mr. Carlisle looked when informed you had resigned and gone home. I think he liked you very much, Helen."</p>
               <p>"Yes, we were very good friends. My health was miserable when I went away, and in fact has been ever since until within a few weeks. I have been visiting some friends and got recruited, you see."</p>
               <p>Never had she looked better, indeed! The expectant excitement which she felt had tinged her olive cheeks with a very warm, fresh hue, her dark eyes glowed and sparkled, and she was exceedingly becomingly dressed.</p>
               <p>"Teaching makes fearful havoc with my nerves!" she added.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you give it up, and try something else then?"</p>
               <p>"What, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I don't know; I should think you might write."</p>
               <p>"I should think so too, only I can't afford the time to build up a reputation. One must eat, drink, dress, and be housed, you know, nelons-volens."</p>
               <p>"I know, but can't you teach and write too, to begin with?"</p>
               <p>"I thought I could; but when I am through with the day's teaching, my nerves are in such splinters that I can't patch them up sufficiently to write. One must be fresh to do that sort of work. Mental activity cannot be expected when the whole physical system is wearied and overtasked."</p>
               <p>A servant entering at that moment, informed her mistress that there was a gentleman below to see Miss Harrington, and she arose at once to go.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" she said. "A friend told me he would call for me. Good-by, Ella; I hope you will be better the next time I see you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am improving every day now. I am sorry you must hurry away."</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall be in town for the winter in a week or two, and then shall see you often. Good-by until then," and kissing her, she hastily left the room to meet the friend who impatiently awaited her coming below.</p>
               <p>She was so excited that her teeth fairly chattered, warm summer day though it was; and obliged to keep them tightly shut, he had the conversation almost wholly to himself for a time. The nearest place of public resort was Chester Square, and towards that beautiful little park he accordingly led her.</p>
               <p>The day was scarcely less lovely than the preceding one; the playful waters of the fountain glistened in the rays of the afternoon sun, the flower borders were brilliant with summer's richest blooms, and the miniature<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6505-00000145"/> ture groves cool and shady to the eye. They sat down in one of the least conspicuous seats, and after a little common-place conversation, Mr. Carlisle began the subject so near his heart.</p>
               <p>"Helen, I received a letter from you about two months ago."</p>
               <p>"Yes," low and quietly.</p>
               <p>"It gave me a great deal of pain, Helen!"</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, Mr. Carlisle," still more softly.</p>
               <p>"Sorry enough to retract what you said in that, and to say' yes' to the questions contained in mine to you?"</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>"Have you nothing to say to me? Have I deceived myself in thinking since I met you yesterday, that there was still hope for me? Speak to me, Helen!" as he still received no answer.</p>
               <p>"What shall I say, Mr. Carlisle?" with downcast eyes, and lips that, haughty as they were, trembled visibly.</p>
               <p>"That I may hope."</p>
               <p>"You may hope."</p>
               <p>He held out his hand without a word, and clasped it warmly for a moment aver the one placed hesitatingly within it, their eyes met for an instant, and—they were betrothed.</p>
               <p>They sat in silence for many minutes, a silence that was more eloquent than words, that spoke the deep content which filled both their hearts, then Helen arose.</p>
               <p>"I must go, Mr. Carlisle, my friends will be expecting me. As school begins so soon, I shall go home somewhat earlier than I intended."</p>
               <p>"Since teaching is so distasteful to you, Helen, why not give it up?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot afford it, Mr. Carlisle, as I have told you before," smiling up in the noble face bent to catch her words.</p>
               <p>"I shall not permit you to do it for long. One term at the most, and then you must leave teaching for house-keeping."</p>
               <p>There was not much to choose between them, she thought, but of course did not say it.</p>
               <p>"When do you intend going home?" he continued.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, or the following day, I think."</p>
               <p>"Then I shall not see you again." "Probably not."</p>
               <p>"May I come out to Dedham before you return to Boston?"</p>
               <p>"I should be so glad if you would! I would like for you and my mother to meet soon."</p>
               <p>"I shall come, you may be sure."</p>
               <p>"Is not that my car?"</p>
               <p>"I think it is, yes."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, then, Mr. Carlisle."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Helen!" he said, very low, as he released her hand after assisting her on the step of the car, and lifting his hat to her, he turned away as the car glided swiftly onward.</p>
               <p>"Maud, I must go home to-morrow!" said Helen that evening, as they were making preparations to go upstairs for the night.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Helen! you must do no such thing.<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6505-00000146"/> Belle and Berrie are going away on the following day, and I can't have you all go at one time."</p>
               <p>"But school begins a week from next Monday, and I must have some time at home. I shall soon be back, you know, and you will see all you want to of me for the next three months."</p>
               <p>"Not unless you do better than you did last winter."</p>
               <p>"Well, I shall, doubtless. I must go, at all events, although I would like to stay more than you have me."</p>
               <p>Therefore, on the following day she took an afternoon train for Dedham, and on the succeeding one Belle and Berrie Burton were whirled out of the same depot for home, with trunks laden with silks, laces, a marvellous "love of a bonnet," and other accessories to a stylish bridal trousseau.</p>

               <p>THE bridal preparations went swiftly forward, and the twenty-eighth of October was nearly at hand, when Berrie and Belle sat one morning in the room of the latter, holding a consultation over some article of wearing apparel for the important occasion.</p>
               <p>"By the way, Belle," exclaimed Berrie abruptly, "has Mr. Wright engaged his groomsman yet? I am anxious to know who is to be my escort on that happy day."</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, didn't I tell you? he asked Charley Anderson, the last time he was here."</p>
               <p>"Charlie Anderson! and did he consent?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, of course! After some objections, I believe, however."</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6505-00000147"/>
               <p>"Well, Belle, get some one else to take my place, won't you? Send for Maud."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Berrie! What an idea! I thought you liked Charlie."</p>
               <p>"Well—I do."</p>
               <p>"And I know he likes you."</p>
               <p>"That is the trouble; he likes me too well."</p>
               <p>Belle looked up in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Is that so? I thought he was a confirmed old bachelor. And you do not care for him?"</p>
               <p>"Not in that way, no! I didn't mean to say anything about it. Don't mention it to Mr. Wright for the world."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not; but I can't have any one but you for bridesmaid. I am sorry he asked Charlie, though, if that is the case. I wish Mr. Adair was here!"</p>
               <p>"So do I, with all my heart!"</p>
               <p>The earnest wish of her heart was spoken involuntarily, and she turned away to hide the blushes that followed the consciousness that she had spoken aloud.</p>
               <p>Belle laughed. "You need not look so confused, Berrie; of course I know you wish he was here, although you <emph>are</emph> so shy about acknowledging it. What is the use of being so secret with your own sister, dear?"</p>
               <p>"'My own sister' will soon be a married woman, and you know they cannot keep secrets."</p>
               <p>"I think I could keep yours; besides, I fancy that George <emph>knows</emph> more about the matter than I do. Now truly, Berrie, didn't Mr. Adair <emph>tell</emph> you that he loved you, and give you that handsome ring you wear?"</p>
               <p>"Are you a witch, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"No, only a woman, and a 'Yankee'!" laughing. "I could guess how the matter was going, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"Come here, Belle!"</p>
               <p>Her sister came towards her, and touching the spring of the ring on her finger, she showed to the surprised eyes of her sister, the handsome face of her friend.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how perfect! he <emph>is</emph> splendid, Berrie, and I wish he was here."</p>
               <p>How sweet was such praise to the ear of the girl that loved him; how thoroughly was the repeated wish echoed in her heart of hearts. But she said nothing; only the dark eyes dimned a little with gathering tears, the proud, sweet lips trembled with the longing for his presence.</p>
               <p>"I guessed, the moment that I saw the ring, Berrie," she continued, as the spring clicked in closing, "from what source it came; but I thought perhaps you would rather I should not say it. It is handsomer than a solitaire, but not so conventional."</p>
               <p>"It is not an engagement ring? Belle, only a parting token of remembrance."</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>are</emph> engaged, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"No! not really; but if all be well; when he returns there may be a wedding," smiling and blushing.</p>
               <p>"Well, it will be all right, I know. He is sure to be true, and if you love him, you will be also. I feel provoked at him, though, for keeping you waiting so long."</p>
               <p>"Ho does not trust me very well—believes that I shall not be constant."</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6505-00000148"/>
               <p>"He does not know my true little sister."</p>
               <p>"Well, he has some excuse for want of confidence," and amid many exclamations of surprise from Belle, she related briefly the events of his life, communicated in the letter sent on his arrival at Venice.</p>
               <p>"It was settled the night before he went away—when you were out walking?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, in the storm."</p>
               <p>"I was sure of it! But you have heard from him?"</p>
               <p>"Once—last May. Mr. Wright brought it to me the time he asked you to name the happy day."</p>
               <p>"I told you George knew more than I did. Well! you have only confirmed what I was satisfied of before. You need not regret telling me, dear."</p>
               <p>"Oh I do not! it is a relief, rather. I do so long sometimes to speak of him, get so tired of thinking, thinking, of what I must not speak."</p>
               <p>"More than ever, now, I wish he was here. <emph>Think</emph> if he only <emph>were,</emph> Berrie!"</p>
               <p>"Don't, Belle! it seems sometimes as if he <emph>must</emph> come!" and a few bright tears trickled through the fingers that covered her face.</p>
               <p>At the same hour, in his Venetian office, sat the object of the foregoing conversation. He held an open letter in his hand, and his brow was contracted with perplexity and pain. Musing a few" moments, he turned again to the letter, and read as follows: "I have just had a short vacation, and of course spent it in Bristol. You will not wonder that I say 'of course' when I tell you that Miss Burton is to become Mrs. Wright on the twenty-eighth day of next October."— There was only one Miss Burton to him, and when ho had first glanced over the letter, his heart had stood still for a moment at the sentence, until he recollected, with a smile at his folly, that Belle was Miss Burton, and the prospect, ere his departure, of her becoming Mrs. Wright; but now he read rapidly on:—"There was quite a party staying at the house, and your little Berrie was as lovely and bewitching as ever, and wore a ring on her finger, at whose source I think I could guess. Miss Burton's brother Charlie was at home—by the way, he is engaged to Maud Lester of Boston, whom I presume you do not know, and she and her brother Ned were also there, the latter of whom was evidently very much in love with our pretty Berrie. Miss Harrington, a handsome brunette, and school-friend of Berrie's, with your humble servant, completed the number of guests at the hospitable mansion. We had quite a gay time, and among other excursions perpetrated the one to Newport, in which we failed so signally last year. I often wished that my friend Adair had been present, and I do not doubt that <emph>one other</emph> at least did also. I think it is time you were writing to me, and have been looking for a letter some weeks."</p>
               <p>Ned Lester, the handsome, audacious, merry fellow, of whom he had felt jealous the first time he saw him;—<emph>he</emph> was there, installed as guest in her home, doubtless escorting her on the various formal excursions which the party had taken, perhaps taking <emph>his</emph> place in, his dear one's heart. He knew how much more influence has a present suitor than an absent one, felt assured<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6505-00000149"/> sured that the Ned in question was extremely fond of Berrie, and, alas! had not the confidence in her constancy which he should have had.</p>
               <p>Thus he tormented himself with all manner of doubts of her truth, told himself that he had been absent a year without receiving one line from her, while he had written to her twice, and resolved to write no more until he had received some token of remembrance 'from her own hand:—ignorant that in neither letter had he sent any address, and not considering it necessary to ask her especially to write, by such a course he was recklessly daring an estrangement that would cause both of them years of unmitigated pain and regret. Men are the same all the world over; and superior as he was in many respects to most of his sex, he was as jealous, distrustful, and unreasonable as the majority of mankind.</p>
               <p>Thus, while Berrie was longing with all the intensity of her loving heart for his presence, keeping herself true to him, in word, thought, and deed, he was doing her gross injustice, and laying a sure foundation for future misunderstanding and regret.</p>
               <p>The night before the wedding-day, Mr. Wright made his appearance, and on a favorable opportunity presenting itself, he handed her a sealed packet, remarking: "News at last from the wanderer! I received a letter also, which I have been expecting for some time. I think he might do better than to write only twice in a year."</p>
               <p>The letter was not so long, perhaps not quite as tender as the previous one; at least, on perusing it, the loving girl was forced to acknowledge herself disappointed. She had waited for it so long, longed every day and hour for its arrival, suffered such tortures of disappointment each time that Mr. Wright made his appearance without bringing her what she so much desired, judged him by herself, and thought that each month of absence would render her all the dearer, and opened the letter at last with such thrills of anticipatory pleasure, that for it to fall so far below her expectation, was more than she could bear; and some very bitter tears fell on the thin blue sheets in her hand. Then, too, he not only sent her no address in this also, but expressed no disappointment or regret at not receiving a reply to his last; and the sensitive girl asked herself if it was really possible that he did not <emph>wish</emph> her to write to him, that he already really did not love her as well as when he went away, and listening to the promptings of pride, resolved that she would not write, at least until he <emph>did</emph> ask her.</p>
               <p>Pride is a very poor thing to stand between those who truly love! Ere the consciousness of reciprocal affection is reached or expressed, it will do; but when its promptings are listened to after the pledging of vows, it but too often wrecks true and loving hearts for life.</p>
               <p>The wedding morning dawned as fair and lovely as one could possibly desire. The noble old trees that lined the handsome streets had put on their bright-hued, autumnal robes, which took an added beauty and brilliance under the rays of the unclouded morning sun, the air was cool, and clear as the ether above,<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6505-00000150"/> and all Nature seemed doing her best to render the morning perfect.</p>
               <p>We will not enter into a detailed description of the bridal scene. Belle looked exceedingly well in her tasteful travelling dress,—in which the ceremony was performed—and Berrie equally so in her similar attire, although rather sad at losing her sister, to say nothing of the lingering effects of her disappointment on the preceding evening. The ceremony was performed at home, but few. guests being present, and cards were issued for a grand reception on the return of the bridal pair from Niagara and other places of interest which it was their intention to visit. Maud Lester and Charlie Burton were down, and intended to remain for several days.</p>
               <p>Berrie and her escort, Charlie Anderson, accompanied the. newly-wedded couple to the depot, and on their return were of course alone in the carriage together. Berrie felt embarrassed, and wished herself at home, and Charlie looked very grave indeed. In fact he had done so all day; it was an exceedingly trying time to him. At last he spoke:</p>
               <p>"Berrie, I am going abroad next month, if the weather is not too severe."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Charlie? We shall miss you very much."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is pleasant to be missed by one's friends, you know," with a grave smile.</p>
               <p>"You have chosen a rather unpleasant season, it seems to me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, somewhat, but my business is so arranged that I can leave now without detriment, and it might not be in the spring."</p>
               <p>"How long do you intend being absent?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know! Until I learn a little self-control, at least."</p>
               <p>This was what she had dreaded, and she remained silent.</p>
               <p>"Will you not bid me God-speed, Berrie?" and he held out his hand.</p>
               <p>Berrie looked up at him with eyes that were full of tears, as she said, placing her hand in the one extended: "I do, with all my heart, Charlie! May you have a most pleasant and prosperous journey, and return soon with new health and spirits. I am <emph>so</emph> sorry that you must go."</p>
               <p>"But you think it wise?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so, yes! you are the best judge of that. May God keep you, my friend."</p>
               <p>He wrung her hand without reply as he assisted her from the carriage, but with lips that trembled under his long mustache.</p>
               <p>She went directly to her room, and sat down by the cheery west window, while her eyes filled again and again with pain, longing, and regret. Life looked very sad to her that day. Her sister gone, to enter that place no more as her home, to return but for a brief interval ere she should leave them for a home of her own in a distant city; her dearest friend absent, gone for years, perhaps <emph>never</emph> to return to <emph>her</emph> and Charlie, whom she had esteemed so highly, who had been such a frequent companion and deaf friend, driven away<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6505-00000151"/> from her with a heart filled with pain of which she was the cause. Life was but a failure and disappointment, she felt, and the future which looked so bright to some, seemed to her very dreary and bitter indeed.</p>
               <p>She did not think of her blessings, as one is so little inclined to do when winder the spell of sadness such as hers; but dark as seemed her life just then, this was but the beginning of shadows, which should wrap her heart in the gloom of desolating sorrow and affliction.</p>

               <p>IT was a gloomy evening late in November! The clouds hung low about the horizon, and were gray and heavy with their weight of threatening storms; the wind moaned and shrieked around the corners of the city streets, and the air was chill and cutting as it struck the unprotected faces of the passers-by.</p>
               <p>In the elegant parlors of a handsome house at the south end of Boston, sat two ladies; the elder, a dark-eyed, dark-haired, matronly woman of some forty years, attired in heavy mourning robes, and the younger, who was evidently her daughter, a stylish young lady of twenty-two, or thereabouts, in a fashionable evening home dress which became her well.</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6505-00000152"/>
               <p>She was rather pretty, but not in any light beautiful, with the dark eyes of her mother, but with hair many shades lighter, and a mouth that betrayed in every curve the haughty, overbearing character of its possessor. Just now she looks particularly unpleasing, as she discourses on a subject which is evidently disagreeable to her.</p>
               <p>"I don't care, ma! I think it is outrageous to invite her here now, when Mr. Hanson is still so undecided. Every one says she is very pretty and fascinating, and I know as a child, she was lovely. You might have waited at least until I was off your hands, before you sent for her to come here pouted the young lady.</p>
               <p>"My dear child," remonstrated the mother, "how could I do any less? Her mother wrote me on her dying bed to ask that I would give her a home for a time, and I could not refuse."</p>
               <p>"Why don't she go to some other of her friends? I should not think she would want to come here, when we are all nearly strangers to her."</p>
               <p>"But I am her aunt, nevertheless, and you her cousin, and I hope you will treat her as one. Remember she has been greatly afflicted of late, and needs all the kindness we can possibly show to her."</p>
               <p>"Well, why don't she go somewhere else, where she would be certain of kind treatment?" persisted the young lady.</p>
               <p>"Why you know, Carrie, she hasn't many relatives, and her brother and sister are both in Europe."</p>
               <p>"Yes! a pretty time to go to Europe after being two years married! Why didn't Belle go then and be back before this time?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know why she didn't go then, but she went now on account of her health, and as her brother was going for a wedding tours they thought it would be a good opportunity."</p>
               <p>"I should have thought Miss Berrie would have gone too! Pity she hadn't!" sneered the girl.</p>
               <p>"I think it would have been a pity if she had. She remained at home because she was a dutiful daughter, and wouldn't leave her mother. It is well she did not; what would her parents have done without her."</p>
               <p>"Well, I think it is mean she is coming here, at any rate!"</p>
               <p>"Why Carrie! why are you so averse to her coming here? I should think you would be pleased to have her here for a companion, she is so near your own age."</p>
               <p>"I have got companions enough, and I don't care to be superseded by my country cousin."</p>
               <p>"I do not see why you should anticipate anything of the kind."</p>
               <p>"Because she is beautiful, and you know very well I am not!" returned the jealous, but candid young lady. "And <emph>I</emph> know, if you don't, that beauty and style are decidedly attractive."</p>
               <p>"That may be! but a sweet temper, Carrie, is more so."</p>
               <p>"Pity you hadn't transmitted some of <emph>your</emph> sweetness to me!" answered the undutiful daughter.</p>
               <p>"Carrie, be more respectful, if you please," said the<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6505-00000153"/> mother, a little sternly. "I cannot see why you should be so jealous of poor Berrie; you know she is in mourning, and cannot go into society for some time to come, and before she leaves it off her sister will be home, doubtless."</p>
               <p>"Well, if she <emph>don't</emph> go into society, she will of course be down stairs when there is any one here. Mr. Hanson isn't any too devoted now, and I wouldn't lose him after this for all his fortune; the girls would triumph so; they all wanted him themselves."</p>
               <p>Ding-a-ling-ling, rang the door-bell, and the young lady finished her ill-natured speeches with an impatient, "Oh bother! I suppose she has come, and I shall have to be on my good behavior. What a wretched night this is, any how!" and she threw herself back in her chair to await the entrance of the expected guest.</p>
               <p>A few moments later, a servant opened the large double doors of the parlor, and announced "Miss Burton," and Mrs. Mitchell went cordially forward to meet the slender figure in heavy dress and wrappings of dead black.</p>
               <p>"My dear child, welcome home!" and the lady took her in her arms and kissed her warmly. ""You are very cold and tired, are you not? we have been expecting you for some time"—looking at her watch—"it is now after six."</p>
               <p>"Yes, the train was late to-night!" answered the sad, soft voice, "and the air is very cold. You are so like my dear mother, auntie!" and the large eyes filled with tears.</p>
               <p>"Yes? we were called very like each other when we were young. This is your cousin Carrie, Berrie, I hope you will be very good friends," with a slightly beseeching look at her daughter.</p>
               <p>The young lady arose and came indolently forward, taking in a cold, limp grasp the hand extended, and saying coolly: "Oh I dare say we shall be as good friends as two young ladies living in the same house are apt to be. Are you well, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Well, thank you; but very tired. May I go upstairs at once, auntie?" chilled at the cold reception from her cousin, from whom she had hoped so much in the way of companionship and sympathy.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my child! I will send for Annie to show you to your room," and she stepped into the back parlor and pulled the bell.</p>
               <p>"Will you come down to dinner in half an hour?" she continued, while awaiting a reply to her summons, "or shall I send it up to you?"</p>
               <p>"I will not trouble you to do that, auntie; I do not require anything to-night but rest, I think."</p>
               <p>"Send Miss Annie here," said Mrs. Mitchell to the servant who answered the bell.</p>
               <p>A few moments later the door opened again to admit a pretty young girl about fourteen years of age. There were elements of rare beauty in the unperfected face, and had she been a little older, her sister would doubtless have been as jealous of her as of her cousin.</p>
               <p>The young girl came smilingly forward, and, as her mother said, "This is your cousin Berrie, Annie; take her up stairs, will you, dear?" she held out a little<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6505-00000154"/> dimpled hand, and pouted two red lips archly for a kiss. Berrie kissed her very warmly, feeling the contrast between her reception of the stranger and her sister's, and hoping that she at least would be a friend to the lonely girl, who to one member of the family was so unwelcome a guest.</p>
               <p>"I am real glad to see you, 'Berrie!" she said, laughing. "I have heard so much about my pretty cousin. Come upstairs, ma says," and she preceded her from the room. On the stairs she paused until Berrie reached her, then slipping her hand in her cousin's arm, she walked beside her, chatting gaily all the way.</p>
               <p>"What a merry little girl you are, Annie!" said Berrie, smiling, as she was ushered gaily into the room prepared for her. "You remind me of my little Hattie; I suppose she is very lonely to-night without her sister, and her dear mother and father lying under the cold, cold ground. Don't you feel sorry for her, dear?" and with her arm around the slender waist of the young girl, she sat down wearily in an easy chair drawn up cosily before the grate.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I do, and for you, too, cousin," and the dark eyes filled sympathetically. "I have no papa, but he died before I can remember, and I couldn't live without my dear mamma, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"So Hattie thought at first, but she has learned thus early 'tis not so easy to die."</p>
               <p>"Poor little girl! where is she, cousin?"</p>
               <p>"At boarding-school, A year has made a great change in our lives."</p>
               <p>"I am so sorry, Berrie, but we will make you just as happy as we can," and the sweet girl smoothed caressingly the soft cheek of her companion.</p>
               <p>After a few moments she asked gently: "How do you like your room, cousin?"</p>
               <p>Berrie looked around the large, airy apartment, at the handsome chamber-suite, the hot-house bouquet on the little stand between the windows, at the cheerful fire in the open grate, and answered, trying to smile: "It is very nice, Annie, dear! Who was so kind as to give me such a handsome bouquet?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I was out walking to-day, and I thought perhaps you were as fond of flowers as I am, so I just stepped in at a. florist's and bought that. Isn't that camelia beautiful, Berrie?" and she brought the little vase containing the bouquet to her cousin.</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, very, and I love flowers dearly! Here are some of my favorites too; heliotrope, tube-roses, violets and mignonette; you are very kind, little cousin, and I thank you more than I can say."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you need not!" laughed the girl. "I expect I got my pay in the pleasure I had in buying it. Oh, there is the dinner-bell; are you going down. Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Not to-night, Annie, I think; I do not care for anything:"</p>
               <p>"Well, I presume ma will send you up something. <emph>I</emph> am real glad you came, anyway, if Cad—" she paused, frightened at how near she had come to betraying her sister's uncordiality, and wounding her cousin's feelings.</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6505-00000155"/>
               <p>"If Carrie isn't, you meant to say?" Berrie asked, smiling a little, although somewhat sadly.</p>
               <p>"Well, Cad is cross; you needn't mind her. She thinks that you are so much prettier than she is, that you are going to cut her out."</p>
               <p>"She need not be alarmed! But I am glad if you are going to be my little friend, Annie."</p>
               <p>"Of course I am! I love you dearly already!" and the arm that was around Berrie's neck tightened rather uncomfortably. "But there! I must go down to dinner, or ma will scold. By-by, cousin," and laughingly kissing her hand to her, she ran off, just as a servant entered with a tray heaped with a very inviting dinner for the weary girl.</p>
               <p>As will be inferred from portions of the foregoing conversation, Berrie's life had sadly darkened since her sister's wedding day, a little more than two years previous. Everything but loss of fortune seemed to conspire together to sadden her heart, and render her hitherto bright, happy life, a weariness and a blank.</p>
               <p>The letter received on the evening preceding her sister's bridal, from the man who had professed to love her so dearly, was the last that had come to her hand. For a year not a month passed but she hoped and expected to hear from him, and her heart had sunk again and again under the sickening pressure of hope deferred. For a time she would not allow herself to doubt his truth and affection, assuring her heart that a thousand things might have conspired to prevent her hearing from him. He might be ill; letters might miscarry or be lost entirely; anything or everything might happen except that he should be fickle or untrue. But as time wore on, and still no letter came to assure her of his constancy, hope gradually died out in her heart, and she gave him up for lost, to her at least, forever.</p>
               <p>Of all the weary days of longing that had come and gone since then, we will not speak. Those who have hoped and waited, and despaired and waited, will understand and realize it all. With her to love once was to love forever; and though they might be parted to meet no more on earth, she could but be true to herself, and in being that she was true as steel to him, false, fickle, inconstant though he might be.</p>
               <p>She had tried to hope for the best, and bore his seeming desertion very bravely; but there were days when her heart was so sore and heavy, when bitter tears pressed so closely to her aching eyes, that she could but yield for a time to despondency, and let her grief spend itself in tears and sighs, and moans of anguish, which alone could bring a calm to the tempest raging so violently within her soul.</p>
               <p>Her sister Belle had spent the Summer following her marriage at home, endeavoring to recover health and strength after a long course of fever, by which she had been attacked in the Spring, but her brother's wedding day in the Fall finding her still weak and frail, her husband arranged his business for an indefinite absence, and took his wife abroad, with the bridal pair for companions. Either couple would have been more than pleased to have taken Berrie with them also, but her mother, with her old dread of the sea, could<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6505-00000156"/> not consent to part with so many of her children on what she considered so perilous a journey, and Berrie, loving her mother too well to cause her a moment's anxiety which she could prevent, dutifully remained at home. A sacrifice, if such it was, which she ever felt happy to have made.</p>
               <p>Early in the following Summer her father's health began to decline, and though at first they considered him only slightly indisposed, they found after a time that he was suffering from a slow fever that was sapping the vital forces of his system, and which, as the warm weather came on, grew more violent in symptoms, until it took a typhoid form, and after a long run—for he was a man of iron constitution—he sank into a stupor from which he never rallied, and when the gardens were brilliant with the blooms of mid-summer, they laid him to rest amid the trees and shrubs of the new cemetery, and turned away to their desolate home, almost heart-broken with grief.</p>
               <p>But the end was not yet. Mrs. Burton, pining for her dear companion of so many happy years, and exhausted with grief and the long hours of watching over the sinking form of her loved one, also yielded to the slow approaches of the insidious disease which had sapped the life-energies of her husband, and at last took her bed, never to rise again, until the soul had wandered into the realms of a better world.</p>
               <p>Poor Berrie's cup of grief seemed full to the very brim. Unused to sickness in any form, almost prostrated herself with sorrow and watching, all alone, no relative or near friend there to comfort or assist, and her mother, so dear to her, whose life and health seemed necessary to her very existence, stretched on a couch of suffering, perhaps never to rise again, seemed more than the stricken girl could bear. Life looked very dark to her, and wildly did she pray at times that God would take her also, and not leave her here to mourn above her shattered idols, torn one by one from her loving grasp. But her very loneliness rendered the necessity for exertion all the greater, and prevented her from sinking under her grief, as she would have done, had there been any one else present on whom the care might devolve.</p>
               <p>It was a trying time to the poor girl, and looking back now, it seemed to her like a long and bitter dream, from which she might soon awake, to find herself surrounded by her dear ones, in the dear old Bristol home.</p>
               <p>Her mother had sunk so gradually under the cruel disease, that she had been enabled to write to her sister, then residing in Boston, and who had, until within a few months, been resident in the Southern States, asking her protection for her lonely girl until her sister's return from Europe, should a fatal termination to her illness render it necessary. Mrs. Mitchell had replied very kindly, and Berrie, after remaining a month in her dreary, desolate home, to arrange such matters as had required her attention, gladly availed herself of the proffered home; hoping that new scenes would ease a little the sharpness of her agonizing grief.</p>
               <p>Hattie, poor, stricken little girl, had been sent the previous year to the school from which Berrie had<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6505-00000157"/> graduated, and to which she returned after the death of her mother, and the breaking up of the old home which had been so dear to them all. Berrie would gladly have kept her with her, but knew it was best she should continue the studies so sadly broken off, and sent her back with many loving words and regrets.</p>
               <p>She had, of course, transmitted the sad tidings to her brother and sister over the water, but they were wandering about so, it was doubtful when they would receive them, and she had no hope of their immediate return.</p>
               <p>Thus she settled down in her new home as contentedly as possible, but with many a dreary heart-ache for the lost loved ones;mdash;her dear father and mother lying still and cold under the chill November snows, her absent sister and brother, and her far away lover, whose image was still bright in her heart, but who seemed as lost to her as if the sods of an Italian churchyard lay green above his grave.</p>

               <p>BERRIE, there is a lady downstairs that wishes to see you," said Annie Mitchell, bounding unceremoniously into her cousin's room one afternoon about six weeks later. "She is real pretty and queenly looking, cousin, and very handsomely dressed. Will you go right down?"</p>
               <p>"Why yes, I suppose so; but didn't she send up her card? How came you to see her, dear?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I was practising in the parlor, and I thought when the bell rang it was Jennie Adams to see me, so I just ran to the door myself. Ma would scold, I suppose, if she knew it," and she laughed and shrugged her shoulders mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Berrie, how pretty you look in that white crape<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6505-00000158"/> collar and bow," and she threw her arm around the neck of the girl who had not yet arisen from her chair.</p>
               <p>"Well, don't spoil the effect then, Annie dear, by mussing it all up," she returned laughing.</p>
               <p>"No, I won't!" smoothing it out. "There! it is good as new. It is ever so much more becoming than that horrid black."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe it is. There isn't contrast enough in that," smiling. "You did not tell me, Annie, if you asked the lady for her card."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I asked her, but she said she had forgotten her card-case, and I was to tell you that it was—let me see! now what <emph>was</emph> that name! Mrs.;—Mrs.—Carleton? do you know any such person, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Carleton?" said Berrie, musingly. "I don't know that I do, Annie. Wasn't it Carlisle?" as a sudden thought struck her.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, that was it. I knew it was something of that kind. What a forgetful little ninny I am, to be sure!" laughing. "Say, Berrie, how do you like Mr. Hanson? you saw him last night, didn't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I saw him, but scarcely long enough to say how I like him; he seems very pleasant."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he is; what a contrast he would be to Cad in that! But I know he thought you just charming!" she continued archly: "for Cad was telling Ma this morning, that it was just as she knew it would be, he was completely carried away with you."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Annie! he had no reason to be, I am sure; I scarcely spoke to him," returned Berrie, looking unmistakably vexed.</p>
               <p>"Now, cousin, you are cross! I didn't mean to vex you; won't you kiss and make up?" and with her arms around her cousin's waist—for they were nearly of a height—she pouted her rosy lips for the desired token of forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Berrie laughed as she kissed the merry girl, and returned, "I couldn't be vexed with you for very long, if I should try, little cousin. I only felt annoyed to know that Carrie had one more cause for disliking me. I, hope I sha'n't see Mr. Hanson very soon again. But I must go down, dear; what will Helen think of me?"</p>
               <p>"Who, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Carlisle, my old school-friend, Helen. Won't you come down and see her, Annie?" as the young girl, after walking part way downstairs with her hand in her cousin's arm, turned to go back.</p>
               <p>"Oh no! Ma wouldn't like me to. Good-by, Berrie!" and she sat down on the stairs, and watched her companion's receding form, until the trailing black dress disappeared through the parlor doors.</p>
               <p>The young girl was a very ardent admirer of her "pretty cousin," as she called her, and Berrie loved her very dearly, turning with pleasure to her lively chat, from the sneers and disagreeable manner of her | sister, who could not forgive her for coming into the family, and did her best to make her unhappy.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Helen, this is an unexpected pleasure! I am so glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"Glad? I should think so, when you have been here for;—I don't know how long, and never came to see me."</p>
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6505-00000159"/>
               <p>"I had forgotten your address, and didn't where to go."</p>
               <p>"Well, couldn't you look in the directory and find it?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I could! what a simpleton I am! I never once thought of that. But how did you know I was here?"</p>
               <p>"I saw Ned Lester the other day, and he told me.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have been out there once, but it seems so odd not to have Maud there, that I could not enjoy it."</p>
               <p>"When are they coming back?"</p>
               <p>"Maud and Charlie? I don't know. I haven't beard from them since;—since;—I sent them the news."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Berrie, how my heart ached for you! I am so sorry for you; far, far more than I can say," said Helen, tenderly, as Berrie covered her face with her hands for a moment; but <emph>only</emph> for a moment. She was becoming accustomed to bear her grief alone, and not intrude its expression on others.</p>
               <p>Her face was very pale, and her lips quivered piteously as she removed her hands, and answered: "Yes, Helen, I know you are; but after all you cannot realize half how hard it is. We had such a pleasant, pleasant home."</p>
               <p>"I know it, Berrie, I know it! Where is Hattie?" after a pause.</p>
               <p>"At the old seminary, Helen; she has been there for a year. Poor little girl, she is very lonely, I expect."</p>
               <p>"What a pity Belle isn't home! How is her health now? any better?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it was; somewhat, when she wrote last, and she thought the winter in the south of France would quite restore her."</p>
               <p>"She will be likely to come home earlier, now, will she not?"</p>
               <p>"I think not, no! I wrote her that I was very comfortable, and not to hasten home until she could do so with impunity. I would not be surprised if Charlie and Maud returned at once, however."</p>
               <p>"I hope they will, I am sure; you would not feel quite so desolate. But it is nearly five o'clock,"—glancing at the jewelled watch in her belt, as she arose;—"and I must go, Berrie. We dine early."</p>
               <p>"Oh don't be in a hurry, Helen; I have a world of things to say to you yet."</p>
               <p>"And I to you, Berrie; but I must go now. Come and spend the day with me to-morrow, can't you?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, I know of nothing to prevent, and I shall be very glad to do so. I suppose you are very pleasantly situated now, Queenie!"</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, rather! for a quondam school-ma'am," she laughed.</p>
               <p>"And how about the books?"</p>
               <p>"Oh we'll talk about all those things to-morrow. Good-by, dear!" and kissing her warmly, the happy, queenly woman swept away.</p>
               <p>The same evening, towards nine o'clock, Berrie was sitting in her own pleasant room, endeavoring to write some letters, which was a rather slow and arduous task, as her little cousin Annie sat on a hassock at her feet, talking constantly to her. There were visitors below, and Berrie had been pressed by her aunt, and<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6505-00000160"/> coldly invited by Miss Carrie to come down, but had decidedly declined both invitations.</p>
               <p>"Well, chatter-box!" smiling, and tenderly stroking the dark head laid in her lap, while the laughing eyes were fixed on her face, "when do yoii suppose I shall finish my letters?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Berrie, do you want to send me off? Never mind your letters, they are not of half so much consequence as I am," laughing.</p>
               <p>"You have very exalted ideas of your value, haven't you, little cousin?" smiled Berrie. "I don't want to send you off, but I must finish my letters to-night, as the European mail closes to-morrow, and I have an engagement for the day."</p>
               <p>"For all day, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, I shall be fearfully lonely without you. Come home early, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"I can't promise. But what will you do when I go away entirely, if you can't spare me for a day?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am not going to let you go. What a pretty ring, Berrie! did your papa give it to you?" slipping it round and round on the finger of the hand she held; for though Berrie had given up her lover as lost to her, she could not put away what was so dear to her as his parting gift had long become. Three years had elapsed since he went away, and she often wondered if his absence was to be extended to five, as lie had thought possible. She still, half unconsciously, cherished a faint hope that when he should return, the charm of the past might be renewed, and she might even yet taste the sweets of "hope's fruition." At present her life seemed to have come to an end. Nothing in the present to brighten it, nothing in the future to look forward to. Life is sad indeed when, to a heart so young, it holds nothing to hope for or anticipate.</p>
               <p>She colored rosily at her cousin's question, and returned: "No, dear; Pa gave me my watch and chain, but not this. A friend far over the water gave me this as a parting gift," and the proud lips quivered a little as she thought of that day, so happy in spite of the pain of parting with one she loved with her whole warm, true heart.</p>
               <p>The sharp eyes of the young girl noticed the rising color and trembling lips, and drew her own conclusions; but with a delicacy that many an older member of her sex would not have shown, laid her cheek on the little hand she held, and said no more. Berrie resumed her writing with the other hand, and there was silence for a few moments, which was broken at length by a low tap at the door.</p>
               <p>"Come in!" called Berrie, and a servant entered and presented her a card, on which was engraved "Ned Lester."</p>
               <p>"Is the gentleman waiting?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"He is, mum!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I will be down directly."</p>
               <p>With the card in her hand, Annie sprang up, exclaiming laughingly: "Bother Ned Lester! I wish he had staid away."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't use such a word, Annie; it isn't ladylike<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6505-00000161"/> like," as she put away her writing, and went to her mirror to make some alterations in her toilet.</p>
               <p>"I know it isn't elegant," she laughed, "but it's very expressive Sometimes, and Mr. Ned Lester has lost me my pretty cousin for the remainder of the evening."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is nearly time <emph>my</emph> pretty cousin was in bed. Good-night, Annie dear!" and kissing her she left the room.</p>
               <p>Ned Lester was his old gay self, although a little less saucy in the presence of strangers. Mr. Hanson, a fine looking man of some thirty-five years, was also present, and two or three other guests, to whom Berrie had been previously introduced. Ned made room for her on the sofa where he was sitting, and as she took the proffered seat, she noticed with annoyance that Mr. Hanson was next her on the other side. Miss Carrie noted it also, and frowned and bit her haughty lips with vexation.</p>
               <p>"I received a letter from Maud to-day!" Ned remarked after a little.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I was just writing to her. Had they received my late letters?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they had just arrived, and Charlie was writing to you by the same mail. Haven't you received it?"</p>
               <p>"No!"</p>
               <p>"You should have had it to-day, but it will be delivered to-morrow, doubtless."</p>
               <p>"Did they say anything about coming home?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Maud thought they should come by the next steamer, if the weather was not too severe, and Mrs. Wright was well enough to leave."</p>
               <p>"Was she worse?" asked Berrie quickly, in alarm.</p>
               <p>"No, not materially, I think. Naturally she and Charlie were both greatly shocked and grieved at the sad news, and your sister was not as well in consequence."</p>
               <p>"How glad I shall be when they are all at home once more!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, so shall I! for your sake, particularly, Berrie. I imagine by the looks of your fair cousin over there, that it is not especially pleasant for you here," he added in a low tone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hanson heard the remark, low as it was uttered, and listened breathlessly for the reply.</p>
               <p>"Indeed it is not!"</p>
               <p>"By the way," Ned continued, "Maud mentioned meeting your old friend, Charlie Anderson. He has remained abroad a long time, has he not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he went the fall Belle was married. People must find it very charming over there, I think," she added a little bitterly, playing with the glittering ring on her finger, "as they all seem loth to return."</p>
               <p>"Anderson was a good fellow," Ned went on, "and we had a pleasant time that summer in Bristol."</p>
               <p>Berried eyes filled with tears, as they always did at mention of the old happy days, and Mr. Hanson's heart throbbed sympathetically, although he made no attempt to take part in the conversation.</p>
               <p>"It seems sometimes, Ned," she answered slowly, "that those were the last of my pleasant times. I have had nothing but anxiety and grief since."</p>
               <p>"I know you have been fearfully tried, Berrie, but<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6505-00000162"/> you must look forward to a good time coming. When Charlie and Wright get back, things will be changed, and we'll have some pleasant times yet. Won't you sing for me, Berrie?" he added, hoping to divert her mind.</p>
               <p>"Oh, not to-night, Ned; I would rather not. I scarcely ever sing now."</p>
               <p>"The more reason why you should. Come, please, Berrie."</p>
               <p>Berrie was undecided, and Mr. Hanson turned to her and said: "Miss Burton, let me add my entreaties to Mr. Lester's that you would favor us."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mitchell, sitting near, overheard a part of the conversation, and turned to Berrie, with, "Do you sing, my dear? Oblige us, won't you?" and Berrie reluctantly consented to be led to the piano.</p>
               <p>She had never sung since becoming a member of her aunt's family, fearing that her accomplishments in music would be another source of annoyance to her jealous cousin.</p>
               <p>"I am somewhat out of practice," she remarked, as she turned over the loose sheets of music; "I have not played any since I came to Boston. Can you turn the music, Ned?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you let me know when. I couldn't read the first note," he returned, laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Allow me!" said Mr. Hanson, stepping to her side.</p>
               <p>The piece she had placed on the rack was, "I cannot Sing the Old Songs," then comparatively new, and she sang the appropriate words very feelingly, and exquisitely, as she did every thing.</p>
               <p>Her cousin could have bitten her tongue off, with envy and vexation; but, hoping to annoy the performer, rudely talked and laughed constantly, apparently taking no notice of the music.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hanson was more disgusted than he cared to show, although his thanks were a trifle more warmly expressed than they might otherwise have been. He was deeply interested in the pale, quiet girl, dressed in such heavy mourning, and carrying in her face traces that the grief lay deeper than the sable robes which draped her rounded girlish form. He had been amused at Carrie Mitchell's manœuvres to win his attention, and thinking her a good-natured, entertaining girl, had visited her rather more than was consistent with the indifference of his feelings toward her. But the sneering manner with which she had received his expressions of admiration for her lovely cousin, had first opened his eyes to her true character, and her conduct this evening completed his disgust and contempt for her. Henceforward Miss Carrie was <emph>not</emph> the attraction which drew him to the house</p>
               <p>As they resumed their seats after the music, Mr. Hanson inquired: "Have you seen the new painting on exhibition at Williams and Everetts, Miss Burton? Boston is going wild over it."</p>
               <p>"I have not; no, what is it?" she returned. "I have been so secluded I know nothing of what is going on."</p>
               <p>"It is called c Holly Berries.' I have not seen it myself as yet."</p>
               <p>"Who is the artist?" she asked.</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6505-00000163"/>
               <p>"I have forgotten the name. An American gentleman resident at Rome, I think. I should be most happy to take you to-morrow, if you will honor me by accepting of my escort," he continued.</p>
               <p>Berrie was annoyed, knowing how her cousin would feel, did she know of it, and was very thankful she could decline with thanks, on the plea of a previous engagement.</p>
               <p>"At any other time, then, which will suit your convenience," he persisted.</p>
               <p>"Very well," she returned, seeing no way of escape without positive rudeness. "I will accept your invitation for Thursday, if that will be convenient for you."</p>
               <p>"Perfectly!" he returned. "At what hour, please?"</p>
               <p>"Oh about eleven, I think," and turning to Ned, she said, in a low tone, "Ask my cousin, Ned, and go with us, do!"</p>
               <p>Ned knew by her look and tone that his compliance with her wish was of moment to her, and therefore did not hesitate to do as she required. He remarked aloud, smiling: "Mr. Hanson has forestalled me, Berrie, and I will ask your cousin and accompany you if agreeable."</p>
               <p>Mr. Hanson could do nothing less than bow his pleasure in the arrangement, although he would much have preferred that the unamiable young lady referred to had been left behind.</p>
               <p>Miss Carrie, although vexed that Mr. Hanson should have invited her cousin instead of herself, was yet somewhat mollified when "that gay Ned Lester" so gallantly requested her to honor him with her company on the same occasion.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was settled much more agreeably than Berrie could have hoped, and the gentlemen took their departure.</p>

               <p>WHAT a pretty room!" and Berrie paused on the threshold of Helen's study, to which Mrs. Carlisle had invited her. It opened by sliding glass doors from the side of the handsome back-parlor, and was, as Berrie had said, a very pretty room; not so much for what it contained, as for the cozy, home-like look of its arrangement. The carpet which covered the floor matched those on the parlors, although somewhat smaller in figure; lace curtains fell inside the low, balconied windows, in whose recesses stood stands of trailing plants; a bright fire burned in the grate at one side; a marble-top table in the centre of the room was piled with books, while carved racks stood in every available place, loaded with handsomely bound volumes, and pictures covered the walls, many of them small and of little value, save for their associations, or as souvenirs of friendship or travel. Near one of the windows was a handsome writing-desk, whereon lay a pile of closely written manuscript, and an easy study-chair was drawn closely before it.</p>
               <p>Helen laughed contentedly at Berrie's exclamation. "Yes, as I told you yesterday, it will do for a quondam school-ma'am that hadn't a cent to her name. But come in and sit down!" she continued, as Berrie still stood on the threshold. "Here, take this rocker by the fire;" and Berrie sat down in the chair designated.</p>
               <p>"I should think you might write here."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I should think so too. I have a couple of pretty good servants. Ma is with me, and manages the house; and I have nothing to do but to be as lazy as I please."</p>
               <p>"Which you are not pleased to be always, to judge from that," and she pointed to the heap of manuscript on the desk.</p>
               <p>"No, I have written a good deal for the past year. That is no task, however, but a pleasure, rather."</p>
               <p>"Have you published anything yet?"</p>
               <p>"Not as yet; but I have a book nearly completed, which a publisher-a friend of Mr. Carlisle's—has seen and made me an offer for."</p>
               <p>"That is pleasant! I hope it may be successful."</p>
               <p>"I hope so too!" with a shrug of her shoulders. "Failure would finish me entirely. I could not write in the face of that."</p>
               <p>"I suppose you have a good critic in your husband?"</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6505-00000165"/>
               <p>"Yes, but a partial one, I tell him. I should never have commenced in the first place but for him."</p>
               <p>"You owe him a great deal."</p>
               <p>"I do, indeed!" very earnestly. "More than you can think. Home, comfort, love, happiness, everything! and I came so near throwing it all away! I often think what a foolish girl I was."</p>
               <p>"Why? what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I refused him at first, just because he was not rich; and if I hadn't met him that day at Mount Auburn, I might be still drudging at school-teaching."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Well, I should judge he wasn't very badly off, to look at your house."</p>
               <p>"No, not so bad as it might be. An eccentric old uncle, who had seen how rents eat up an income, left Mr. Carlisle a small legacy, on condition that he should use it in purchasing and furnishing a house when he should marry, and not to be touched for any other purpose: virtually, a wedding present. He has a small property besides, and his salary is very good now. 'The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places,' Berrie, more pleasant than I deserve, or had any reason to expect."</p>
               <p>"I am very glad, I am sure, Queenie. The three years since we left school have brought many changes," and she glanced sadly at the sable robes which swept the handsome carpet</p>
               <p>"Yes. Little Lillie, who was so fond of me—you remember her—has been a year in heaven; Annie is married and gone south; Rose is travelling in Europe. I am as happy as the day is long. You have watched the spoiling of your household idols, and sit here sadder than your gloomy robes, and Maud is your sister now. Who would have thought it in the old schooldays?"</p>
               <p>"Who, indeed!" and a few bright tears fell from the brimming eyes.</p>
               <p>"I remember I used to envy you then, your future looked so very bright," continued Helen; "and that I expressed it on the very morning of exhibition, when some of us girls sat out in the grove, assorting flowers for our hair; and that Maud said, reprovingly, that wealth and beauty did not always bring happiness, and that my lot might be even more enviable than yours. I could not believe it then."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Ned Lester called to see me last evening, and said he had just received a letter from Maud. They thought they should return on the next steamer."</p>
               <p>"They had heard the news, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; just received it. I suppose I shall find a letter from Charlie at home to-night, as Maud said he was writing."</p>
               <p>"What a shock it must have been to them!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Belle was not as well, in consequence, when Maud wrote."</p>
               <p>"She is not coming back at present, then?"</p>
               <p>"No, not until Spring. I shall be so glad when she gets home; it is not pleasant at aunt's."</p>
               <p>"No? That was a nice little girl that came to the door yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Annie? Yes, she is a darling, and if it was not for her I couldn't stay. Auntie is very kind, but<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6505-00000166"/> Carrie is so jealous of me, that she makes both herself and me miserable. It is not much like my old dear home."</p>
               <p>"I suppose you still keep the place in Bristol?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes! I couldn't part with that. I presume we will spend our summers there."</p>
               <p>"Berrie," said Helen suddenly, after a slight pause, "I should think you and Ned Lester 'might make a match.'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Ned is like a brother to me—nothing more."</p>
               <p>"But I think he likes you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, as I do him; in no other way."</p>
               <p>"Ned is a good fellow."</p>
               <p>"He is, indeed! He seems more like a brother than ever since Maud married Charlie. By the way, Ned said that Maud wrote they had met Charlie Anderson. You remember him, don't you, Queenie?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do! Do you know, I always thought he was another of your victims?" laughingly.</p>
               <p>Berrie did not laugh in return, but looked down without reply.</p>
               <p>"Berrie," Helen continued after a moment, "what is the secret of your coolness to all these eligible young gentlemen?"</p>
               <p>"An exceedingly cold heart, I expect!" laughing with a little embarrassment.</p>
               <p>"A heart already given away, I <emph>suspect,</emph>" returned Helen mischievously.</p>
               <p>"I told Ned last night I was coming here to-day, and he said he would come around this evening and take me home," said Berrie irrelevantly, to turn the conversation, adding immediately: "Have you seen the new picture Williams &amp; Everett have on exhibition?"</p>
               <p>"No. 'Holly-berries,' isn't it? My husband was speaking yesterday about taking me to see it."</p>
               <p>"I am going to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"With Ned?"</p>
               <p>"No. Mr. Hanson, a friend of my cousin. Ned invited her."</p>
               <p>The day passed away very pleasantly, and another visit was promised speedily. Ned Lester came around in the evening, per engagement, and took her home. She found Annie waiting for her in her room.</p>
               <p>"You see I took possession in your absence," she said laughing, as Berrie entered the room. "Welcome home, Miss Burton!" and she took her cousin's arm and led her to the easy-chair by the fire, removing the girl's hat and cloak as she talked gaily to her.</p>
               <p>Crossing the room, she returned in a moment with both hands behind her, laughing archly, as she exclaimed: "Which will you have, my pretty cousin, the right or left? and what will you give me for either?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll have the right, and give you a penny to buy sugar-plums."</p>
               <p>"How very generous you are, Berrie, for an heiress," she laughed, presenting the right hand, and with it an exquisite bouquet of tea-roses and heliotrope.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Annie dear. How lovely they are!"</p>
               <p>"From your ardent admirer, Mr. Hanson," laughed the mischievous girl. "You have made an impression, sure, Miss Burton."</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6505-00000167"/>
               <p>"I think Mr. Hanson presumes. I should prize them much more highly had they been given me by my dear little cousin, as I thought."</p>
               <p>"Would you, truly? How kind you are!" and she kissed the lips whose warm expression had pleased and gratified her so much.</p>
               <p>"Kind, because I love my little cousin who is so kind to me?" said Berrie in return, adding: "But I hope your sister did not know of this?"</p>
               <p>"No! she was out, and I took it myself and brought it right up here. But I have something else for you, Berrie; what will you give for that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, anything you demand, dear; I am sure you will not be extravagant. What would you like?"</p>
               <p>"To sleep with you to-night. May I, cousin?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly you may! I would like you to, much."</p>
               <p>"Oh, thank yon, Berrie! and here is your letter."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I expected that!" and while the young girl sat down on the arm of her chair, with her arm around her neck, she broke the seals, and with streaming eyes read her brother's letter, written under the first shock of bereavement, the first pressure of bitter, heart-rending grief.</p>

               <p>WHY, Berrie! it is your very self!"</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, Miss Burton; pray look up!" fell respectively from the lips of Ned Lester and the girl's companion, Mr. Hanson, as the four paused before the important picture which was the object of their visit.</p>
               <p>With crimson cheeks, Berrie turned her eyes from the name in the corner—"E. Adair, Venice"—on which they had been riveted, to see, as Ned had expressed it, her very self standing before her.</p>
               <p>The design of the picture was exquisite, the execution almost perfect; and as Berrie stepped back a few paces, and sat down to contemplate the master-piece of<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6505-00000168"/> her old-time love, notwithstanding he had seemed to desert her, her heart throbbed with pride, and a little of the olden pleasure, to say nothing of the happy consciousness of which the picture before her was a proof, that if he had forsaken her, he had at least not forgotten her.</p>
               <p>The picture represented a New England scene, in the heart of a spicy wood, whose trees were centuries old. Dim aisles of the pillared trunks stretched off in every direction; rocks covered with delicate mosses were piled on every side; a tiny brooklet rippled and danced over the huge boulders which strewed its bed; the topmost branches of the trees were loaded with snow, patches of which lay white in every direction; and in the foreground, under the spreading branches of an ancient hemlock, the almost life-size figure of the lovely girl, in a scarlet shawl and dark trailing dress, with hat in hand, a face bright, sparkling, bewitching, with smiling lips, and eyes upturned to those of the man who, standing a little back of her, was in the act of placing on the peerless, drooping curls, a crown of dewy holly-berries, nestling among their prickly and shining leaves of dark green, while a ray of sunlight struggling through the thick branches, crowned the lovely head with golden glory. The face of the man was that of her artist friend; and as Berrie looked at it, all the past rushed in an instant over her heart, and she bent her head, and shaded her crimson cheeks with her hand, longing to fly from her companions and hide her conscious face in the silence of her own room.</p>
               <p>A little in the rear of the two principal figures was a group of gentlemen and ladies, gathering the scarlet berries, but most of them with faces turned away.</p>
               <p>The pose of the two figures in the foreground, the witching expression on the upturned face of the girl, and the tender look in the soft blue eyes of the man, as he bent above her, crowning her with the gleaming scarlet berries, was simply perfect; and as Berrie looked at it, the past months of sorrow seemed but a troubled dream, from which she had awakened with renewed love and trust for the man who had won her heart in, the first flush of her happy, innocent girlhood.</p>
               <p>Her companions of course could but note, without wondering, her evident agitation, and considerately left her to herself for a little time. A few moments given to the conscious embarrassment she could not but feel, to the retrospect of the past, which crowded on her throbbing heart, and though her cheeks still burned with as vivid a crimson as those of her counterpart in the beautiful painting before her, she forced herself to be calm, and speak gaily of the picture which had so surprised and embarrassed her.</p>
               <p>Stepping a little forward to the trio that was still gazing at the painting, she said, laughingly, "Ned, please ascertain if the picture is for sale. I don't think I like to be exhibited in this manner."</p>
               <p>Her remark was the signal for a volley of questions, which she would fain have refused to answer.</p>
               <p>"Who is the gentleman, Berrie? his face looks familiar to me," said Ned.</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6505-00000169"/>
               <p>"Oh, the gentleman is the artist. He has painted himself admirably.</p>
               <p>"And you too!" remarked Mr. Hanson, smiling.</p>
               <p>"And a friend of yours?" persisted Ned.</p>
               <p>"Yes! he used to be."</p>
               <p>Ned looked in the corner of the painting and read the name. "Adair—Adair," he said, musingly—"oh, I remember, the gentleman Mrs. Malvern was talking of in Bristol; the one we saw at Copeland's on a certain evening—eh, Berrie?" and Ned looked into her eyes mischievously.</p>
               <p>"Well, will you inquire if the picture is for sale, Ned?" she asked hastily.</p>
               <p>Ned walked off, and Carrie said: "Adair? that isn't a common name. I wonder if it is the one Ma used to know before we went south. I forget what his first name was, but he married a cousin of Pa's, I believe, and she was killed in a railway accident near Paris."</p>
               <p>"Did you never see him yourself?" asked Berrie, in the indifferent tone she always used to the girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I was so young I do not remember how he looked. I think that might be him, however," and she turned to the painting as Mr. Hanson remarked: "It is very like you, Miss Burton."</p>
               <p>"Yes, although it flatters her some," added Carrie, a little spitefully.</p>
               <p>"I beg to differ with you!" returned the gentleman. "I think it scarcely does her justice, if either, although it looks a little more girlish than she does now. I think you should be proud," he continued to Berrie, "both of the picture, and of having so gifted a friend. It is exquisitely executed."</p>
               <p>Berrie was painfully embarrassed, and hardly knew how to look or what to say, feeling at the same time flattered and vexed at forming the subject of such a painting.</p>
               <p>Ned returned, after a few moments absence, and reported that the picture was not for sale, but was to be retained by Messrs. Williams and Everett until the artist's return. Ere that, the other visitors in the room had begun to notice and remark the striking resemblance between the girl and the picture, and Berrie begged Mr. Hanson to take her away.</p>
               <p>"Why, we have scarcely glanced at any other picture!" remonstrated Carrie.</p>
               <p>"Well, you can stay as long as you like, but I must certainly decline remaining longer," and she and her companion hastened away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hanson was truly kind and considerate, and talked pleasantly to her on subjects foreign to that which caused her so much embarrassment, and that required from her but brief and infrequent replies.</p>
               <p>With thoughts all in a tumult, she reached her room at last, and sat down before her pleasant fire, to muse upon the singular event that had occurred to her. She scarcely knew for a time what were the predominant feelings in her mind; joy in the knowledge that he still thought of her, pride in the wondrous talent of her artist friend, annoyance at being thus publicly exhibited, hope that the future might bring her the happiness she had anticipated in the first<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6505-00000170"/> months of their engagement, or the old surging love for him, pure, and strong, and sweet as ever.</p>
               <p>How it brought back all the past to her heart! Those first happy days of their acquaintance, the few long weeks of torturing doubt she had endured, the final annihilation of all uncertainty and perfect reciprocity of her strong, tender love for him, and most of all, their last parting, when his affection for her had been so full and manifest.</p>
               <p>She had nothing to reproach herself with. She had been true as steel to him in word, thought, and deed, and under the magic of that tender face, though only pictured, the old trust in him came back, sweetening the memory of the months and years of waiting which she had already endured, and that might yet be in store for her. Thinking of all his nobleness, gentleness, honor, she could not doubt his truth. He had loved her as he thought never to be able to do again, to use his own words; and with such a man as he, love was no light thing. Something had caused his silence—perhaps he meant to test her constancy, of which he had confessed lie was distrustful, and in that case, he should find she had been worthy of all the trust he could have reposed in her; that through absence, silence, seeming coldness, desertion and forgetfulness, she could still be true to her own heart, and the love which had been for years a part of her very soul.</p>
               <p>"Thinking of the picture, it seemed as if she had seen his living self, so true to life was it, so perfect in prose and expression, with the same look in the dreamy blue eyes that she had seen there so often, the same gentle deference in his bearing, that rendered his manner so exceedingly fascinating. And then the holly-berries with which he was crowning her-with which he had said once so flatteringly that he desired to see her decked-and the pet name which he had given her in the early days of their acquaintance. Could she doubt his remembrance and continued affection in the face of all that? No! she would trust him still, until a blighting certainty of faithlessness crushed out all hope from her heart.</p>
               <p>It was late in the afternoon when Carrie returned, having passed some time with a friend, and, therefore, took the opportunity at dinner to ask her mother if she remembered the name of that Adair they knew before going south.</p>
               <p>"Adair? The name sounds familiar, but I do not recall the person to mind just now. Why?" Mrs. Mitchell replied.</p>
               <p>"Wliy, the picture we went to see was painted by an artist of that name, and Miss Burton here forms one of the principal figures."</p>
               <p>Berrie said nothing, but heartily wished herself upstairs, and Carrie, knowing she was annoying her cousin, continued the subject.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" Mrs. Mitchell exclaimed. "Is the artist a friend of yours, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"He was, yes. He is an intimate friend of my brother-in-law's, and spent the summer previous to going abroad, in Bristol."</p>
               <p>"What made you think we ever knew him, Caddie?" her mother inquired.</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6505-00000171"/>
               <p>"Why, Ma, didn't a gentleman of that name marry Pa's cousin, Clara Mitchell? I am sure I have heard you speak of it a hundred times."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I recollect now. They went to Paris to live, and she eloped with a friend of his, and they were both killed in a railway accident the next night. Few knew of the elopement, however. He came home," she continued musingly, "to find the firm fearfully involved, and he was soon as poor as when his father died. Then he lost his mother soon after. We went south about that time, and I lost sight of him."</p>
               <p>"Didn't he have any brothers or sisters?" asked Carrie.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes; he had one sister, who is Mrs. Merrill, of Worcester Street. You know her, Carrie."</p>
               <p>"Of course I do! You remember seeing her, don't you, Berrie, a few nights ago, at the concert at Music Hall? I pointed her out to you. She attends our church, too."</p>
               <p>Berrie did remember, as she had been puzzled at the time by her striking resemblance to some one she knew, but could not tell who it was.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember his name, mamma? It was 'E. Adair' on the picture; and what sort of a looking man was he?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he was very finelooking—tall, light complexioned, and a. perfect gentleman. His name was Edward—no, Eugene, I believe."</p>
               <p>""Was that the name of the one you knew, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," was the quiet reply.</p>
               <p>"Then it is the same one, without a doubt, and he is a sort of cousin to us, isn't he, Ma? We must cultivate him when he returns to America. That picture alone would make him famous! How odd that lie should have painted <emph>you,</emph> Berrie!" she added provokingly, and turning her sharp eyes on her cousin.</p>
               <p>Berrie made no reply, and Mrs. Mitchell said, smiling: "I do not think it is at all, if he knew Berrie. She is certainly handsome enough to be painted. I shall have to go and see the picture myself, I think;" and, to Berrie's relief, she arose at once from the table.</p>
               <p>Berrie was both amused and vexed for some days to hear Carrie constantly refer, in the presence of visitors, to the popular painting, claiming the artist as a cousin, and when Berrie was spoken of as the original, explaining it by the fact that he was an intimate friend of Miss Burton's brother.</p>
               <p>Berrie allowed her to say what she liked, without contradiction or comment; and for two or three weeks the beautiful painting and the fair original was the topic on every one's lips.</p>

               <p>A MONTH or six weeks passed on without anything of much interest occurring to Berrie or her friends; and yet there had been quiet changes working as an undercurrent, which rendered Berrie's life at her aunt's a little less disagreeable than formerly.</p>
               <p>It was now toward the last of February, and her brother and Maud had been home about two weeks from their European sojourn. Maud was at home, busily making preparations to go to housekeeping in the Spring, when she declared she should claim Berrie, if Belle did not previously return. Mrs. Wright's health was then steadily improving, since she had rallied lied from the shock of her double bereavement, and she was becoming impatient to return, and be established in her own home once more, with her dear sister for a constant and honored companion. It was their intention to be in Boston by the first of May, although Maud thought it probable they might not really arrive before June, at the earliest. Weekly visits to Maud and Helen took up two days pleasantly, and time dragged less wearily than it had done during the first month or two of her stay in Boston.</p>
               <p>But, after all, the greatest change was in Carrie. Soon after the picture episode, she had met a wealthy young Englishman—not particularly good-looking or brilliant, but rather pleasing in manner—to whom she was immediately attracted, and which had ere long proved to be a mutual thing. It was really wonderful how a true attachment had softened and improved the girl. Her restlessness, ill-nature, and jealousy seemed nearly to have vanished, and she had become as amiable as she had before been disagreeable and captious. There was as yet no formal engagement, but either knew that the words only were wanting to make them one in life, as they already were in heart. Berrie was more than pleased at the new state of affairs, began to feel at home and content in her aunt's house.</p>
               <p>The affair of the picture had but increased Mr. Hanson's interest in the girl, and. though at first she had repelled all advances from him, on her cousin's account, when the new state of things had released her from the sneers and unkind treatment of her cousin, she allowed herself to take all the pleasure in his society<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6505-00000173"/> which it could afford her. Nor was that small. He was well-informed and intelligent, kind-hearted, and, so far as she knew, good-principled, and she carne to look upon him as a dear and true friend. Still, her experience with Charlie Anderson had taught her to be a little cautious, and the trials through which she had passed had imparted, such an air of unconscious dignity to her manner, that it was not easy to approach her, save as a friend.</p>
               <p>Of course, her mourning still excluded her from society, and she was fain to accept all the legitimate amusement that came in her way. Thus, many a morning was spent in picture-galleries and libraries, and evenings in the society of the few choice friends that gathered around her in the parlors of her aunt's hospitable house.</p>
               <p>The fair face of Mr. Adair's sister often came before her in the distance, and she was conscious of a strong desire to become acquainted with the woman who not only bore so near a relation to her absent love, but also so strongly resembled him in feature and expression; and though that might have been an easy thing had she made her wishes known to aunt or cousin, naturally she shrank from doing so, and the introduction was still unperformed.</p>
               <p>She was in the parlor, one afternoon near the last of February, entertaining a-friend who had called, when Mrs. Merrill was announced. She had called to see Mrs. Mitchell on some business of the church of which they were both members, and started in surprise when Berrie was presented to her.</p>
               <p>While conversing with Mrs. Mitchell, somewhat apart from Berrie and her friend, her eyes constantly wandered off in that direction; and when the other visitor had taken leave, and Berrie approached them, in reply to some request of her aunt's, Mrs. Merrill exclaimed: "Pardon me, Miss Burton, but are you not the original of the picture which my brother, Mr. Adair, has had on exhibition at Williams &amp; Everett's for some weeks?"</p>
               <p>Berrie colored rosily as she replied: "People seem to think I am, Mrs. Merrill"</p>
               <p>"I was sure of it the moment I saw you," returned the lady. "The resemblance is very striking. Of coarse you know my brother, then?"</p>
               <p>"I did know him, yes, before he went abroad."</p>
               <p>"Then you must know me also," continued the lady, laughing, "for if there is any one I worship it is Eugene, and his friends are sure to be mine."</p>
               <p>Berrie was greatly pleased, and replied softly: "I am sure the acquaintance would give me great pleasure, Mrs. Merrill."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am glad, if it would be a mutual gratification. But I am in haste to-day, so just run over tomorrow afternoon, informally, and see me, won't you, Miss Burton? I would be so glad if you would."</p>
               <p>"Thanks! I should be pleased to," said Berrie, u and know of nothing now to prevent."</p>
               <p>"I have an engagement in the morning, but shall be at home before three o'clock;" and giving her address, she hastened away.</p>
               <p>Berrie was more gratified than she cared to own,<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6505-00000174"/> and the next afternoon found her in the cozy private sitting-room of Mrs. Merrill.</p>
               <p>"You see I am not going to make a stranger of you, Miss Burton," she had remarked as she invited her there, adding: "Just remove your hat and take this easy-chair, and we will settle ourselves for a nice cozy chat."</p>
               <p>Berrie did as requested, and after talking on commonplace things for a time, Mrs. Merrill came back to the picture.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, Miss Burton," she said, "I was almost startled when I saw you, the resemblance is so striking to the painting I have spoken of, which I have studied day after day, admiring and wondering who the original was, half inclined to believe it was one of those fair Italians, although the scene, and even the face, was so pre-eminently American. But in my last letter from Eugene, he remarked, casually, that if I should chance to see his 'Holly-berry,' I was to be very kind to her, as I should be certain to like her. Of course I was a little puzzled at first, and, in fact, until yesterday, when your face burst upon me like a revelation; it is such a fac-simile of the one in the painting."</p>
               <p>"Yes," Berrie returned, a little confusedly. "I believe Mr. Adair has painted me to perfection."</p>
               <p>"He has, indeed, and I am exceedingly glad to have met you. I cannot tell you what my brother is to me; 'my hero,'" she added, laughing, "in the nicest sense of the word. He spared no pains to make my girlhood pleasant and happy, and has been to me the kindest, truest friend a woman ever had. He is worthy the gods' best gifts, but has been very unfortunate. He married a worthless woman when quite young, who nearly broke his heart, and has had more sorrow than falls to the lot of many. It is the dream of my life to see him happily and worthily married, and permanently established in a home of his own. He is at least deserving of any woman's highest and best love. You must excuse my rhapsodies," she went on, laughing; "I never know where to stop when talking of my brother."</p>
               <p>Of course, notwithstanding it confused her, no theme was so pleasant to the girl, and she hastened to assure her hostess that she need not apologize, as she did not doubt he was all his sister thought him.</p>
               <p>"I am glad if you think so," returned the lady, "as I am sure you must do if you know him at all. Please tell me about your acquaintance with him, Miss Burton."</p>
               <p>"There is very little to tell, Mrs. Merrill," the girl returned, her downcast eyes and crimson cheeks belieing her words, however. "He spent the summer previous to his departure for Europe in Bristol, and I saw him frequently."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes I remember. And were you staying there too?"</p>
               <p>"I was residing there. Bristol has always been my home until the death of both my parents a few months ago."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my child, for recalling your grief to your mind," said the lady, sympathetically, as the girl's<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6505-00000175"/> eyes filled, and in tones so like the low, tender ones of her brother, that it thrilled the girl's heart with pleasure. "I was not aware of so recent a bereavement."</p>
               <p>"No apology is necessary," Berrie returned after a moment. "I am very foolish, doubtless, but I loved my parents so dearly, and had such a pleasant home, I can never think of it without tears."</p>
               <p>"My poor child! I do not wonder. But we were speaking of Eugene," she added, thinking to divert her mind.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he was quite intimate with my brother-in-law, Mr. "Wright. Perhaps you know him?"</p>
               <p>"George Wright? Of course I do! And he married your sister?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; they are in France now. I expect them home in the Spring."</p>
               <p>"And Mrs. Mitchell is your aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; my mother's sister."</p>
               <p>"I believe her husband was a distant relative of Eugene's wife."</p>
               <p>"I think I have heard so, yes. Are you not called very like him, Mrs. Merrill?"</p>
               <p>"Eugene? Yes, by many, to my great gratification," she answered, laughing. "I am very proud of my brother, particularly since he has developed into such a talented artist. He was always desirous to paint, but father would not hear of it. Don't you feel greatly flattered, Miss Burton, to be painted by such a model man?" she laughed.</p>
               <p>"I hardly know whether I am most flattered or annoyed noyed. I don't think I like being exhibited so publicly."</p>
               <p>"Don't you?" laughing. "Well, I don't think you need to mind. I shall write Eugene, the next time, that I have found his 'Holly-berry.'"</p>
               <p>The conversation drifted off to other things, and at last Berrie arose to go.</p>
               <p>"I must tell you again," said Mrs. Merrill, "how very happy I am to have met you. Pray don't let this be your last visit, but run in unceremoniously at any time."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," Berrie returned, "I shall be very glad to do so."</p>
               <p>"I assure you that you will always be welcome," said the lady, as she playfully tied the girl's hat under her chin, and then, to Berrie's surprise, impulsively took her in her arms and kissed her.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my little girl! come in often."</p>
               <p>Oh! how like to his was her voice and intonation when she let it drop in those low and tender tones; and as the short winter twilight closed around her, Berrie walked slowly homeward, with heart and thoughts full of her absent, but ever dear friend.</p>
               <p>Annie met her at the door, exclaiming: "So you have arrived, my pretty cousin! welcome home again," And then, as they went upstairs—"I saw Mr. Hanson to-day; he was coming here, but I told him you were out, so he commissioned me to ask you to go to the opera with him to-morrow evening; it will be "Il-Trovatore," he said, and they have a fine cast—I believe that was the word," laughing. "I was to<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6505-00000176"/> tell you that he would have a private box, so you need not mind your mourning; and would you be so kind as to send him a note if you would go. There! I believe I have delivered the message <foreign xml:lang="LAT">verbatim et literatim.</foreign> Is that right?" laughing.</p>
               <p>Berrie laughed also. "How classical you are getting, Annie dear! Mr. Hanson is very kind, and I think, in consideration of Il-Trovatore, I must accept"</p>
               <p>"Say, Berrie," said the girl suddenly, "do you mean to marry Mr. Hanson, and so lose me my pretty cousin?"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Annie! What should put such an idea in your head? I have no such intention, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"Well, I heard Cad tell Ma to-day that she should not wonder if you did, and how she should have felt once at the prospect. Do you know Mr. Saville has proposed, and is going to England in a few weeks?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I am very glad. Not that he is going away, but that Carrie is so happy."</p>
               <p>"So am I; she is ever so much pleasanter than she used to be."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merrill was exceedingly pleased with her new acquaintance, and knowing that her brother must be deeply interested in one he could paint with such perfectness; her next letter to him contained the following passage: "Well, my dear Eugene, I believe I have been so fortunate as to meet your 'Holly-berry,' the original of your painting by that name, and must say, you have barely done the young lady justice. I made love to her at once, and find her more charming than I can tell you, as I do not doubt you did also; eh, Eugene? She confessed, with downcast eyes and many blushes, that she knew you ere your departure for Europe, and I could but guess that the interest you feel for her is fully reciprocated. And oh, my precious brother, you cannot think how many fairy castles I am building for you, and hope you will be sensible, and come home very soon to your sister and <emph>love!</emph> Perhaps you do not know that the dear little girl has lost both parents recently; and as her sister is in France, she is staying with her aunt, Mrs. Mitchell, whose husband was a relative of Clara's, I believe."</p>

               <p>WHEN Berrie drew up her blind on the following morning, she found that it was snowing rapidly, and the ground was already white. The storm continued with but short intervals during the day, and as night fell, it rather increased than diminished. Therefore Miss Burton's visit to the opera was indefinitely postponed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hanson called during the evening, expressing much regret for the pleasure of which the storm had deprived them; but to make amends, he said laughingly, they would have a sleigh-ride the next afternoon, to, or towards Brighton, if Miss Burton would honor him with her company. Miss Burton would be happy to do so, and thus it was arranged that he should call for her about two o'clock or half-past on the following afternoon.</p>
               <p>The day proved to be beautiful beyond comparison. Berrie was in unusually good spirits, and could but yield to the exhilaration of the scene and motion, the charm of the musically tinkling bells, the bracing freshness of the clear, cold air, and the novelty of the exciting races which were constantly in progress before her eyes.</p>
               <p>She was wrapped to the chin in an ermine mantle, which, on account of her mourning, she had not previously worn that season, and now donned only for her comfort, but which was exceedingly becoming to her; her dark curls floated on the clear, sharp breeze, and her rounded cheeks had taken on a deeper tint of crimson than they were wont to wear, while her beautiful, rosy mouth, which was constantly dimpled by smiles, looked more than ever tempting and kissable. So thought the man at her side, at least; and his eyes wore a new light as she now and then glanced up at him—a light that caused her to dread a moment's cessation of the lively conversation that kept her chatting gaily on every subject which presented itself, and in endeavoring to ward off what she dreaded, rendered herself more than usually charming.</p>
               <p>They extended their drive farther than they had thought to do, and at last alighted at the hotel in Brighton, to give the horses a little rest, and warm<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6505-00000178"/> their numb fingers and toes. A brief delay, and they were in the sleigh again, and driving rapidly homeward; but the shades of twilight were fast falling around them before they reached the city.</p>
               <p>For the greater part of the distance the horses had completely occupied the gentleman's attention, but as they neared the Roxbury line, and the dashing of racing teams abated, they slackened their pace, and Mr. Hanson had an opportunity to speak.</p>
               <p>"Miss Burton," he said abruptly, "why do you suppose I invited you to drive with me this afternoon?"</p>
               <p>"Why, indeed?" she laughed. "To give me pleasure, I suppose, and enjoy my charming society."</p>
               <p>"And do you think that was all?" and his tones said more than his words.</p>
               <p>"Of course; what other object could you have? It is growing fearfully cold, won't you please drive faster?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, after I have told you that I love you, and asked for a reciprocity of my affection."</p>
               <p>It was said, manly and straightforwardly, like himself.</p>
               <p>Berrie covered her face with her hands, exclaiming: "Don't tell me, Mr. Hanson. I cannot listen to you."</p>
               <p>The man seemed struck dumb for a moment, then he said: "Is there no hope for me, Miss Burton? Have I been mistaken in thinking I was not disagree able to you?"</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>not</emph> disagreeable to me, I assure you, Mr. Hanson, but I do not, cannot love you!" she returned with effort.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I have been too precipitate; will you not let me endeavor to <emph>win</emph> your love?"</p>
               <p>It was a moment before she replied, and as she had done when Charlie Anderson had told her a similar tale, she debated if she could not be won by him, and at last forget the man who seemed to consider her love so little worthy an effort to retain; but, as then, although in a shorter space of time, her heart recoiled at the thought, and she knew that the love she had given to him was "the sole love that life gave to her."</p>
               <p>Therefore she answered gently: "I should be cruel, my friend, to say yes to your plea; for it could but end in a sharper disappointment than a decided refusal now would be: Oh, Mr. Hanson!" she added with emotion, "you cannot fancy what pain this gives me. I seem destined to lose every friend I prize, in one way or another. I heartily wish I had never come to Boston."</p>
               <p>"Do not say that;" he returned gently, and the darkness hid the white face and lips that quivered like a woman's. "I certainly cannot regret having met you, although it was only to lose you. It is something to have known so true a woman; one that must give her sex an added sacredness in my eyes henceforth. It is needless to say that I am pained exceedingly at the annihilation of my hopes, and regret being the cause of sorrow to you; but I acquit you of all blame in the matter, and must ever look upon you as the noblest and sweetest woman I have ever known."</p>
               <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6505-00000179"/>
               <p>"And we may be friends yet?" beseechingly.</p>
               <p>"If you will, yes. I shall be only too glad."</p>
               <p>He touched the horses with the whip, and they sprang rapidly forward, and Mr. Hanson soon lifted her from the sleigh at her aunt's door.</p>
               <p>"Good night, my friend!" she said softly, as she gave him her hand in farewell.</p>
               <p>"Good night, and may God keep you!" he pressed her hand lingeringly, lifted his hat to her, and running down the steps, sprang into the sleigh and drove rapidly away, while Berrie entered the house with such pain in her heart as any true woman could but feel under like circumstances.</p>
               <p>Two months glided rapldiy onward, and brought the first of May. Mrs. Wright had not yet returned from abroad, but was expected in the course of another month. Berrie's acquaintance with Mrs. Merrill had progressed rapidly, and she already loved the beautiful woman, as she had loved few friends of her own sex previously; while all her affection was fully reciprocated by Mrs. Merrill, who, as she had written her brother, was dreaming many a dream of future happiness for her dear brother and almost equally dear friend.</p>
               <p>Carrie's betrothed, Mr. Saville, had left for England more than a month previous, and she had already received one or two letters from him, when, as they were all sitting together in the pleasant back-parlor one afternoon in May, the bell rang with the carrier's peculiar ring, and the servant entered with a foreign letter for Miss Mitchell. Berrie was feeling rather depressed and sad that day, and the contrast between her lover and that of her cousin's, struck her so forcibly, as the letter was brought in, that she arose hastily and went upstairs.</p>
               <p>How her heart swelled with longing for tidings of <emph>her</emph> dear one; for a few fond lines written in his own dear hand, for a single proof of remembrance, and continued affection. But no! other lives were filled full of love; other's friends, when absent, were constant in their remembrance and tokens thereof; while she was doomed to live her lonely life, unsatisfied, unthought of, uncared for, wasting all the wealth of tenderness which dwelt in her loving heart, all the constancy of a rarely true nature, on one who could let years of absence elapse, without a single word of even friendly remembrance and regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Could</emph> he do so if he really cared for her? Much as he disliked writing, would it not be a pleasure to write to one he loved? He was unkind—almost cruel. He did not deserve that she should be true to him; he did not prize her love, or he would make some effort to retain it. Why could she not have taught herself to care for Mr. Hanson, who would have cherished her as she wished and deserved.</p>
               <p>She stood beside the window in her room as she mused thus, her forehead pressed against the pane, her heart swelling with grief and longing, her throat throbbing, her eyes full of such bitter, bitter tears, a few of which had trickled over the flushed cheeks, while her lips were compressed despairingly, when an arm stole around her waist, and a sweet, arch face looked into her own.</p>
               <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6505-00000180"/>
               <p>"Why, cousin dear!" said the young girl, in surprised but tender tones, "what is the matter? It breaks my heart to see you feeling so badly."</p>
               <p>"It is nothing, Annie dear, don't distress yourself," said Berrie, wiping away the traces of tears. "Only I feel rather sad to day," and she sat down and drew the girl in her lap.</p>
               <p>"I am ever so sorry, Berrie. But I forget; Mrs. Merrill is downstairs, and wishes to see you. I told Ann I would tell yon, and came near forgetting it. I rapped, but receiving no answer, thought you were out, so just peeped in to see."</p>
               <p>"That's all right, dear; you need not stand on ceremony with me." She arose, bathed her face, changed her collar, and went down.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merrill's object in calling, as soon transpired, was to deliver a message from her brother, which was contained in a letter that she had but just received.</p>
               <p>"Here, you shall read it for yourself!" said the lady, handing one sheet of the letter to the blushing girl.</p>
               <p>That dear familiar hand-writing! how good it was to see it once more! and the tears that had hardly been repressed, dimmed her eyes again as she attempted to read.</p>
               <p>"So you have really found my 'Holly-berry,' my dear sister! I am very glad, both for her sake and yours, as I am sure that the pleasure in the acquaintance will be mutual. But I am greatly grieved to learn that she has been so sadly bereaved, and cannot bring myself to realize it as yet. Please remember me very kindly to her, and assure her of my heartfelt sympathy for her in her great sorrow. Say to her also, that I can never forget the pleasant hours we have passed together in her old pleasant home, and that I trust to see her once more ere the present year shall give place to another."</p>
               <p>There was more in the message than was apparent to a casual observer, and all her doubts of the moment before seemed answered by this brief passage in his letter to another. So he was coming home before the year waned, and he had not forgotten either her or the past with which she was connected. That was enough for the present, and her tears fell fast as she handed back the letter to her friend, and covered her face with her hands, saying: "Do not mind me, Mrs. Merrill; I have been sad, nervous and homesick all day to-day, and the time of which he speaks, was the happiest year of my life."</p>
               <p>"My dear little girl!" and the impulsive lady's arm was around her waist, and Berrie's head drawn tenderly to her shoulder. "I know all about it, dear, and tears are a great relief sometimes." And suspecting more than the girl confessed, she soothed and petted her by turns.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Wright returned early in June, the latter with restored health and spirits, and at once took up their abode in their old home at the South End, and Berrie left her aunt's for her sister's.</p>
               <p>Annie was quite unconsoled for a time, but as their homes were not many blecks distant from each other, contrived to see Berrie nearly every day, although<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6505-00000181"/> never ceasing to regret "losing her pretty cousin," as she persisted she had. Hattie came in for a short vacation, and Berrie felt as if she once more had a home.</p>
               <p>"By the way," remarked Belle, the day following her return. "Did George tell you that he ran down to Venice to see Mr. Adair, shortly before we left?"</p>
               <p>"No; he did not say anything about it."</p>
               <p>"Well, he did! He said Eugene was looking splendidly, though painting hard. He thought he should return to America in the fall. I suppose you hear from him often."</p>
               <p>"No; I have not heard directly, of late."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! He is a miserable correspondent. Well, he will be home one of these days, and then all will be right."</p>
               <p>Berrie said nothing. She did not care to have even her own sister know how she had been neglected, to say the least, by one she had loved with her whole heart, or to betray how dear he was to her still, notwithstanding his seeming desertion. So they went on talking about his famous picture," Holly-berry," about Berrie's acquaintance with his sister, Mrs. Merrill, and kindred subjects.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, he is certain to be famous!" said Belle carelessly. "George said he was much thought of in Venice."</p>
               <p>"By the way," said Berrie, in a pause of the conversation, "did you know that Helen had published a book?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; has She?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, about two months ago, and the prospects are that it will be quite a success."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am very glad. She didn't teach 'shooting,' as she used to call it, very long, did she?"</p>
               <p>"No; and she has a beautiful home. You must go down there one of these days."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I shall like to. How long have Maud and Charlie been housekeeping?"</p>
               <p>"About a month, only.</p>
               <p>"Why didn't you go with them?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, aunt wished me to remain with her until you came, and as there was a prospect of that being soon, I did not think it worth while to change."</p>
               <p>"When is Cousin Carrie going to be married?"</p>
               <p>"About next Christmas or New Year's, I expect."</p>
               <p>"How do you like her betrothed?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, very much. Carrie will do very well indeed."</p>

               <p>IT was an evening far into December, and in the privacy of her own room at her sister's, Berrie was dressing for a party. Her Cousin Annie was also there, chatting constantly in her usual lively manner, and Berrie was smiling and answering her merry nonsense by turns.</p>
               <p>Her beautiful hair was already most becomingly arranged, and she was just fastening the sweeping robe of black velvet, which fitted the fine, full form to perfection, its short sleeves and low bodice revealing and enhancing the beauty of the rounded arms and shoulders ders, as Annie exclaimed, drawing towards her the girl's jewel-casket:</p>
               <p>"Let me select your jewels, cousin! Where is the key?"</p>
               <p>Berrie took it from the bureau in front of her, and tossed it to her cousin, saying, "I do not wear jewels, dear, and I think there is nothing there that I wish. You can look at them, however, if you like."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>are</emph> the queerest girl, Berrie! I never saw one before but that liked such things."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I like to see them, well enough, but do not care about wearing them. Besides, my dress is too matronly, Belle says, and I do not care to make it conspicuous by a blaze of jewels."</p>
               <p>"What a beautiful set of pearls, Berrie! oh, <emph>do</emph> wear these! I think pearls are just lovely."</p>
               <p>"So do I, but they do not suit me; there is too much contrast."</p>
               <p>"Well, try these garnets; those are sure to become you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you know I am scarcely out of mourning as yet, and those would hardly do. Give me my ring, Annie-that diamond there."</p>
               <p>Annie took it up and held it off, admiring the brilliance of the precious stones, then nearer, nearer still, and at last exclaimed: "Why, Berrie, isn't this a locket ring? I am sure I see the least mite of a hinge," and she looked up inquiringly.</p>
               <p>Berrie laughed and blushed, and holding out her hand for it, said: "What sharp eyes you have, Annie. No one ever detected it before. I shall have to be<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6505-00000183"/> careful how I let you into my jewel-caskets, and such things."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Berrie! you know I never would speak of anything that <emph>you</emph> wouldn't like me to, and I am sure you need not mind your little cousin."</p>
               <p>"No, I don't, Annie; you are a dear little friend to me."</p>
               <p>"Then you <emph>might</emph> let me see what was in it, Berrie!" archly.</p>
               <p>Berrie hesitated, saying at last, slowly: "Well, I do not know that I care. You can look at it if you like."</p>
               <p>"Not unless you are willing that I should," said the honorable little girl.</p>
               <p>For answer, Berrie touched the spring and handed it to her cousin.</p>
               <p>"Oh, isn't he splendid!" exclaimed the girl. "Have I ever seen him? it seems to me I have!" as she looked at it intently, with a puzzled expression in her face.</p>
               <p>"I do not think you have, Annie. He has been in Europe for several years."</p>
               <p>"Then I have seen some one that he looks like; his face looks as familiar as can be."</p>
               <p>Berrie did not reply; and after a moment the girl exclaimed: "Oh, I know! it is Mrs. Merrill. Is it her brother, the artist, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"I shouldn't wonder if it were?" said Berrie, smiling.</p>
               <p>"Then I shall lose my pretty cousin entirely, one of these days!" and she looked so woe-begone Berrie could not help laughing.</p>
               <p>"Why, Annie dear, don't look so disconsolate. You haven't lost me yet, and there is no prospect of your doing so. The ring was a parting gift from a <emph>friend,</emph> that is all."</p>
               <p>"But you like him, I know! for though you don't care for jewels, you always wear this."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I like him!" said Berrie absently</p>
               <p>"And of course he does you, or he wouldn't have painted you."</p>
               <p>"Well, if you are done admiring him, please pass him over," said Berrie, laughing. "And remember, this is between you and me, little girl."</p>
               <p>"I will remember, never fear!" and she went on turning over the contents of the jewel-casket. At last she exclaimed: "Oh, what is in here? May I see, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>Berrie was busy tying the broad lavender sash, and without looking at her cousin, answered mechanically in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how perfect! that is the loveliest of all! <emph>Do</emph> wear this, Berrie, it would look so handsome in your hair."</p>
               <p>Berrie turned quickly. "What an inveterate little explorer you are, Annie!" as her cousin held up the spray of holly, given her more than four years previous, by one who was now, as then, all the world to her. Adding: "No, dear, I could not wear that if I were inclined, for the same reason that I rejected the garnets; but I am not inclined; I never wore it but once, and that was over four years ago. Four long years! how many changes there have been!" she continued<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6505-00000184"/> tinued musingly; and in a few minutes caught herself humming the air of "Juanita," which the cluster of scarlet berries in her cousin's hand had instantly recalled.</p>
               <p>"Shut the casket now, dear, and give me the key," she continued after a few moments. "I am all ready now but the flowers in my hair, and I want you to arrange those."</p>
               <p>Annie, highly flattered, obeyed with alacrity, but exclaimed in dismay, as Bessie handed her some sprays of heliotrope, and a few geranium leaves: "Nothing but this, Berrie? it isn't half pretty enough."</p>
               <p>"No?" laughed Berrie. "I think it just suited. I cannot wear bright colors yet, and white is too conspicuous. The heliotrope will do. There! that looks very nicely, and Belle is calling. Come, Annie! turn down the gas, please!" and the girls left the room, to find Mrs. Wright waiting for them in the hall below.</p>
               <p>"Take off your cloak, and let me see how you look," said Belle.</p>
               <p>Berrie obeyed, and after looking her over, her sister said: "Well, you will do! that lace is exquisite, but no jewels, as usual."</p>
               <p>"'Beauty unadorned, etc.,' you know, Belle," laughed Berrie, and they entered the carriage, and drove rapidly away.</p>
               <p>The party was given by Mrs. Mitchell, and Annie had gone over to see her cousin dress, returning with them in the carriage.</p>
               <p>How seldom, in reality, do "coming events cast their shadows before!" How little Berrie dreamed, as she stood in the dressing-room at her aunt's, deliberately drawing on her gloves, of what the evening had in store.</p>
               <p>The first hour or two passed as such hours generally do, with nothing special to mark them, and midnight was fast approaching, when, in compliance with continued urging, Berrie took her place at the piano, which stood in such a position that the long mirror in the back parlor was in full view, and consequently a large part of the company present, who were reflected on its shining surface.</p>
               <p>She had undertaken, by pressing request, to sing a piece of which she had not the music there, but that was perfectly familiar to her, and was nearly half through it, when her eyes, which were fixed on the mirror, dilated with surprise, she turned deadly pale, and forgetting to sing, her hands dropped on the keys with a crash.</p>
               <p>The sound brought her back to herself, and laughing, although somewhat constrainedly, she exclaimed: "Please excuse me, good friends, I have entirely forgotten the rest. Is there anything else I can favor you with?"</p>
               <p>Several other pieces were instantly named, and she sang one of them with even more than her usual expression and grace, but without a return to her cheek of its banished color, and rising immediately on its completion, she turned to Ned Lester who was standing near, and said in a low tone: "Take me to the library, please, Ned, the heat makes me faint," and her face certainly did not belie her words. "Once out of<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6505-00000185"/> the crowd I shall feel better," she added, as Ned led her from the room, eagerly watched by one pair of eyes, whose reflection in the mirror had so startled the girl, and abruptly ended her song.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merrill, with a tall, light-complexioned gentleman at her side, whom she proudly introduced as "My brother, Mr. Adair, who has just returned from Europe," made her way into the crowded back parlor, inquiring, "Where is Miss Burton? I am sure I heard her singing but a moment since."</p>
               <p>"Yes," some one replied, "she went out a minute ago with Mr. Lester." Adding: "She and Mrs. Burton's brother are very good friends."</p>
               <p>"Why should they not be?" returned the lady. "They have known each other a long time; I am vexed that she has gone out, I want to see her. I wonder where she is."</p>
               <p>"Gone promenading on the balcony with her <emph>friend;</emph> doubtless," sneered the woman who had previously spoken.</p>
               <p>"Probably she has <emph>not!</emph>" returned Mrs. Merrill with spirit. "Miss Burton is not so imprudent as to go from this warm room directly into the cold, night air. She has gone to see her Cousin Annie, doubtless, of whom she is very fond."</p>
               <p>"And is Mr. Lester 'fond of her Cousin Annie' also?" asked the woman.</p>
               <p>"I would not be surprised if he were; Annie is a very pretty girl," returned Mrs. Merrill serenely, and taking her brothers arm, she drew him away from the vicinity of the spiteful gossip.</p>
               <p>Berrie was not long absent, and when she returned, leaning on Ned Lester's arm, the color had returned to cheek and lip, and one would not have guessed it had even been banished therefrom.</p>
               <p>During her brief absence, she had reasoned herself into believing that her eyes had deceived her, and that the face whose reflection in the mirror had so startled her, was <emph>not</emph> that of her long absent friend, as she had at first supposed. She felt certain that had he returned, she should have been made aware of it, by her aunt had she known of it, and assuredly by Mrs. Merrill, who she knew was exceedingly anxious they should meet. Mrs. Merrill was very late to-night, and she had not as yet seen her.</p>
               <p>As to him, he had listened to the familiar tones of the sweet, rich voice, with a thrill of the olden pleasure, and somewhat in advance of his sister, had pressed forward just in time to see her leave the room with his old fancied rival, Ned Lester. The remarks of his sister's gossiping neighbor, though having not the slightest effect upon her, did not allay the feeling of jealous distrust which was already awakened in his heart. He told himself that doubtless her bereavement had delayed their marriage, which might possibly be on the eve of consummation, and reasoning thus, made himself as miserable as need be. At least he resolved he would not be very demonstrative to his old-time love, the girl with whom he had parted lip to lip, whose picture still lay "near his heart," as he had told her playfully, just before bidding her farewell,—to whom his allegiance had never for a moment wavered<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6505-00000186"/> He would not be very demonstrative to her until lie had satisfied himself "how the land lay," or had received from her some token of continued regard. Foolish man that he was! Did he know her so little as not to believe that she would rather die than betray such a feeling? not to know that love him as she might, she was proud enough yet to crush it down out of sight and knowledge, until won timidly forth by a similar confession from his own reticent lips?</p>
               <p>Conversing calmly with those by whom he was surrounded, ho still kept constant watch for the return of the girl he loved; nor did he fail to see her entrance, although she had been in the room some time before his sister was aware of it, and he had a brief opportunity of studying her from a distance.</p>
               <p>Berrie had changed much in the past four years, and the eyes that had not looked at her in all that time, could not fail to note it. The fair face seemed less mobile, more grave, reserved, and cold. The rounded form had gained a little in height, or appeared to have done so in the heavy, trailing dress that she wore, but in her bearing and manner was the most noticable difference. He had left her little more than a child, with the gay, arch, playful airs of a young and artless girl; he returned to find a matured, self possessed woman; carrying in her face the marks of suffering and bereavement, polished and graceful in manner, but cold, quiet, and at times a little haughty, receiving the homage of those around her as a matter: of course, and remaining so impassive under the most flattering attentions, as to provoke a surmise that either her heart was exceedingly cold, or she had long ago wept all passion out of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair watched her with eyes that sought in vain to read that heart; to judge if the man who was constantly at her side was in any degree preferred to others who surrounded her. She evidently, he thought, had no idea of <emph>his</emph> presence there,—never once did her eyes wander in that direction, but she carried on the conversation in which she was engaged with the most cool and easy air imaginable, her thoughts seemingly not wandering beyond the circle where she sat.</p>
               <p>At last his sister turned, and glancing into the back parlor, discovered her friend.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miss Burton has returned. Come and speak to her Eugene," and taking his arm she drew him away, saying laughingly: "Please excuse him, ladies and gentlemen, I wish him to see an old friend."</p>
               <p>"Berrie will be surprised at seeing me!" he remarked.</p>
               <p>"Who?"asked his sister.</p>
               <p>"Why, Berrie—Miss Burton."</p>
               <p>"What a pretty pet name!" she laughed. "Who but you would have thought of it."</p>
               <p>"Why, that <emph>is</emph> her name—Berrie Burton. Didn't you know it?"</p>
               <p>"No indeed, I did not. Come to think of it, I believe I never heard her first name mentioned."</p>
               <p>"That is singular, as long as you have known her."</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Miss Burton," said Mrs. Merrill." I was looking for you a while ago, and you had run away."</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6505-00000187"/>
               <p>Berrie arose and returned her friend's greeting, and Mrs. Merrill at once introduced her brother.</p>
               <p>"Allow me, Miss Burton, to present an old friend, Mr. Adair," she said.</p>
               <p>How thankful Berrie was that she had been previously made aware of his presence there, that she might not betray the emotion that she would have done on so sudden a presentation.</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>very</emph> happy to meet you once more, Miss Burton," in the low, cultivated tones she remembered so well, and with the same kindly look in his face as she glanced up at him, and placed her hand in the one extended.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> am very much surprised at meeting <emph>you!</emph>" she returned smiling, and perfectly self-possessed outwardly, although her heart was beating suffocatingly. "His return was somewhat unexpected, wasn't it, Mrs. Merrill?" turning to her friend.</p>
               <p>"It was indeed! he never wrote me a word to let me have the pleasure of anticipating it, but drove up late this afternoon, as unceremoniously as if he had only been gone a day."</p>
               <p>"Much to your surprise and gratification, I presume," she smiled.</p>
               <p>"I assure you, yes! and the first thing I did was to, send him off to the steamer to hasten his baggage, that I might bring him around here to-night."</p>
               <p>"That is why you were so late. I had concluded you were not coming."</p>
               <p>"Yes. You were singing when we came in, but before I could reach you, had disappeared."</p>
               <p>"I went upstairs for a moment." Very quietly.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Adair, allow me to present my friend, Mr. Lester," she added, and as the introduction was acknowledged, Mrs. Merrill exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Pray excuse me, Mr. Lester, for overlooking you. You see I am so enraptured at my brother's return, that I know nothing else, scarcely.</p>
               <p>"Which is not to be wondered at. I forgive you, Mrs. Merrill!" laughed Ned.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you are so magnanimous. Perhaps you know all about it, as your sister returned from Europe not long since."</p>
               <p>"I do, I assure you. Miss Burton and I have been trying to discover what relation we are; can you assist us in our dilemma, Mrs. Merrill? Her sister married my brother, you know—or rather her brother married my sister," he corrected, as they all laughed at his blunder.</p>
               <p>"I don't think I can unravel such a complicated relationship," laughed the lady, and Berrie said to Mr. Adair: "You did not see my sister Belle when she was in France, did you?"</p>
               <p>"I did not, no. I was very sorry not to be able to do so, but I did not know they were abroad, or rather where they were, until Mr. Wright ran down to see me at Venice, and my engagements then were such that I could not leave. Is she well?"</p>
               <p>"Very well now, thank you, and is present to-night."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? I have not see her, nor her husband."</p>
               <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6505-00000188"/>
               <p>"Mr. Wright is out of town, and Belle has gone up stairs with my aunt, I think."</p>
               <p>"There have been many changes since I went away," in a low tone, and looking intently at the passionless face before him. Most of the immediate circle had moved away, Ned with the rest, and they were comparatively alone, with the exception of Mrs. Merrill, who had taken a seat by Berrie, while her brother leaned against the mantel-piece near by.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" she returned quietly, with downcast eyes, and lips that slightly trembled for an instant. Adding, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Friends have been scattered, like roses in bloom,</l>
                        <l>Some at the altar, and some at the tomb.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Belle and Charlie are married, Hattie is at school, and our pleasant home is among the things of the past."</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you, Berrie,—the old name, with the old tender intonation—"how deeply I sympathized with you in your great grief."</p>
               <p>"I do not doubt it, I assure you, Mr. Adair. You saw enough of what my home was, to know something of what I have lost."</p>
               <p>"I did, indeed! I can never forget my pleasant summer in Bristol. Are you staying with Mrs. Wright?"</p>
               <p>"At present, yes!"</p>
               <p>"I was about to inquire for my little friend, Miss Hattie. I suppose she is almost a young lady now."</p>
               <p>"She is at boarding-school, as I said before. Yes, she is quite a tall, pretty girl. She is nearly fourteen now.</p>
               <p>At this moment Ned returned, and said to Berrie: "Your sister does not feel well, and is going home. She wished me to ask if you were ready, or if she should send the carriage back. I of course volunteered to see that you arrive safely."</p>
               <p>"Don't go yet, Miss Burton, I have scarcely seen you. Tell Mrs. Wright I will take her home myself," interposed Mrs. Merrill.</p>
               <p>"You are very kind, Mrs. Merrill, but I think I will go with Belle. I am very tired myself. Good-night, my friend. Good-evening, Mr. Adair."</p>
               <p>"Run over to-morrow if you are not too much fatigued," said Mrs. Merrill.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, I will!" she returned, thinking that she certainly should be.</p>
               <p>"Present my regards to Mrs. Wright, Miss Burton, and say that I shall call soon," said Mr. Adair.</p>
               <p>"She will be very glad to see you. Good-evening," and bowing, she took Ned's arm and left the room.</p>
               <p>An hour later, Berrie, with her heavy dress thrown aside, her hair pushed back from her face, and her cheek resting in her palm, sat before the grate, musing on the event of the evening. The large eyes were darkened with pain, the sweet lips sharply compressed, and her heart very heavy; but no tears fell, as they would have done so freely, four years ago, when her heart ached as it did this evening. He had come back at last, and they had met and parted, scarcely less warmly<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6505-00000189"/> than mere strangers. He had taken her hand, looked into her eyes, talked to her in a very kind and friendly manner, it is true; but oh, how different was the coming home, from what she had anticipated in the early days of his absence! And in her heart still rolled the heavy tide of her love for him, which had never ebbed, whose flow was full and strong as ever, while his had evidently flown out long ago, leaving only the bare sands of lost affection, strewn here and there with wrecked hopes, and the broken shells of constancy and truth.</p>
               <p>She might have felt less bitterly, as she sat there alone in the small hours of the morning, could she have looked at that moment in the heart of the man that she deemed was lost forever to her, as he sat with his sister in her pleasant sitting-room, talking of past, present, and future.</p>
               <p>"Eugene, what am I to think of you and Miss Burton?" she asked abruptly.</p>
               <p>"Just what you like, I suppose. I could not attempt to control a woman's thoughts, Grace, I am sure," smiling.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but what do you wish me to think?"</p>
               <p>"Anything that pleases you, Grace."</p>
               <p>Well, I have been thinking <emph>that</emph> for a long time, and now I want to know if my castles have all been built in Spain, or if there is hope they may have a solid foundation, and rear their graceful towers in dear old America."</p>
               <p>"You are poetical, Grace. 'As long as there is life there's hope,' you know."</p>
               <p>"You torment!" and she pulled his mustache playfully. "Can't you give a plain answer to a plain question?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose I could; "he smiled, "but, pardon me, Grace, your questions have not as yet <emph>been</emph> exceedingly plain."</p>
               <p>"I'll <emph>make</emph> them plain enough!" she laughed. "Eugene, do you love Miss Burton?"</p>
               <p>"Grace, I do."</p>
               <p>"Bless your dear heart, my brother! And does Miss Burton love you?"</p>
               <p>"You ask me too much now, Gracie dear," and a shadow swept over the handsome saxon face. "Would to God I could say yes," he continued earnestly. Then after a pause—"You have seen much of her, of late, and you women understand each other; can yon not answer the question yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Sometimes I think I can, and then again I am puzzled. Miss Burton is very proud, and has a good deal of self-control."</p>
               <p>"She has changed greatly since I went away."</p>
               <p>"She has had a great deal to change her; and four years at her time of life generally changes character and manner, somewhat. She is a very charming girl; at least the gentlemen think so."</p>
               <p>"They always did!" he returned a little bitterly. "Have I any rival in particular?"</p>
               <p>"No—"slowly—"she seems to favor Ned Lester the most, but they are such old friends, and almost related, it is not to be wondered at."</p>
               <p>"You do not think they are engaged, then?"</p>
               <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6505-00000190"/>
               <p>"No, I scarcely think they are! She wears a diamond ring on her fore-finger, but it is a cluster;mdash;"</p>
               <p>"Has it a close, heavy setting?" he interposed eagerly, and his heart beat almost audibly as he waited for her reply.</p>
               <p>"I never examined it closely, but I think it has. At least it is not nearly as open as mine. Why? did you give it to her?"</p>
               <p>"I gave her one, yes!"</p>
               <p>"Didn't she have it on to-night? she always wears it."</p>
               <p>"I did not notice it; I think both gloves were on."</p>
               <p>"Yes! they were, I remember. She never wears any jewels. Didn't she look beautifully to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! She has scarcely left off mourning yet, has she? I noticed she wore no flowers but heliotrope."</p>
               <p>"Scarcely, no!"</p>
               <p>"Do you really think there is hope for me, Grace?" after a pause.</p>
               <p>"I could tell better if I knew how far matters had progressed when you went away."</p>
               <p>"We were engaged, conditionally. I left her free, not daring, from past experience, to trust her powers of constancy."</p>
               <p>"You foolish man! she is no Clara, I assure you. And you have been gone all this time without writing to her?"</p>
               <p>"I wrote her twice, but received no reply."</p>
               <p>"Twice in four years! A devoted lover you are, forsooth! You do not deserve her. There is not one woman in ten that would have been constant."</p>
               <p>"Any woman would that truly loved."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! <emph>Love</emph> must have something to feed it. Many a woman would have married from pique, or from a feeling that if once she was bound to another, she should forget her former lover."</p>
               <p>"Well, she did not answer those I did write."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she did not receive them; or likely as not you did not send her any address?"</p>
               <p>"I think I did; but Mr. Wright knew it, she might have asked him."</p>
               <p>"Do you know so little of women, Eugene, as to think she would do that? As I told you before, Miss Burton is very proud."</p>
               <p>"You told her you did not trust her, I warrant!" she added.</p>
               <p>"Why yes! I said something to that effect, I believe."</p>
               <p>"What fools men are! I thought you more sensible than the rest of your sex, Eugene."</p>
               <p>"Well, after what I have passed through, I am sure I had some excuse for want of confidence."</p>
               <p>"But you need not have let her know that you distrusted her, and should have made every effort to retain her love. If you lose her, you will have only yourself to blame."</p>
               <p>"That don't make it any pleasanter!" bitterly. "Of course she saw the picture?"</p>
               <p>"What, 'Holly Berries?' yes! but I couldn't get her to say much about it, only that she did not know as she fancied being exhibited in that manner. I didn't become<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6505-00000191"/> come acquainted with her until some months after she first saw it."</p>
               <p>There was a silence of a few minutes, and then Mrs. Merrill asked;—"Well! what do you propose to do?</p>
               <p>He started. "Do? about what?"</p>
               <p>"About Miss Burton, to be sure. Do you mean to go to her in a manly, straightforward way, and tell her that you love her still, and ask her to be your wife, or do you mean to keep quiet, until, even if she does love you, she is stung into accepting some one else? For she will never betray the state of her feelings to you, I warrant you."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to be premature."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! It should be sufficient encouragement for you that she hasn't married in all this time; and if she has been waiting for you, it would be cruel and insulting to delay now. If she loves you, she has endured enough already in your seeming desertion."</p>
               <p>"Well?" after a long pause.</p>
               <p>"Well, I will take advantage of the first opportunity."</p>
               <p>"Make your own opportunity, my dear brother." And she bent over him, and pressed her lips to his forehead.</p>
               <p>"It is the dream of my life to see you 'married and happy,' and I could not wish for a dearer sister than your 'Holly-berry.'"</p>

               <p>BELLE, I am going to spend the day with Maud!" said Berrie, the following morning at breakfast.</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't dear, to-day; aren't you too tired?" returned her sister.</p>
               <p>"No! 1 don't feel like staying in all day. This fresh air will do me good."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it will. Well, give my love to her, and tell her to come down in the course of the week."</p>
               <p>"When do you expect George home, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"This evening, unless I receive word to the contrary."</p>
               <p>"He'll be surprised to see Mr. Adair, won't he?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! he hasn't heard from him since he saw him at Venice."</p>
               <p>"Berrie, are you going away to avoid Eugene?" Mrs. Wright asked abruptly a few minutes later.</p>
               <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6505-00000192"/>
               <p>"What an idea! It is not likely he will call to-day?" she returned evasively, yet looking slightly conscious.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, she <emph>did</emph> think it very likely he would call that day, and in accordance with that thought, was her determination to go away. He had said ho should call to see <emph>Mrs. Wright,</emph> not her; a remark which annihilated her last hope, and to her sensitive heart, seemed intended to show her that all was over between them. Besides, she shrank from meeting him, and yet she knew if she remained at home she should be constantly expecting him, and would be accordingly restless, nervous, and uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>"Do not be alarmed if I should not come back tonight," she said, as she left the house an hour or two later.</p>
               <p>She passed quite a pleasant day, although she did not leave her restlessness at home, and was so absent at times all day, that Maud at last asked her what she was in such deep thought about, receiving a laughing and evasive reply.</p>
               <p>Ned came in to tea, unexpectedly, and was surprised at seeing Berrie there.</p>
               <p>"Well Berrie," he said, "you recovered from last night's dissipation pretty soon, didn't you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes!" she returned. "I left early, you know, and have not been out much as yet, therefore I was comparatively fresh."</p>
               <p>"So your old admirer has come back!" he said archly.</p>
               <p>"Who?" inquired Maud, "Charlie Anderson?"</p>
               <p>"Charlie Anderson, no!" returned Ned contemptuously ously. "A more dangerous rival of mine than he ever was, I assure you. No other than the artist, Adair. Do you know him, Burton?"</p>
               <p>"Only by hearsay," returned Charlie. "<emph>Is</emph> he an old admirer of yours, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"So Ned says!" she answered, laughing, but blushing also. "But I fancy he don't know much more about it than you do."</p>
               <p>"Well, he is highly spoken of," said Charlie, "and I should be glad to see Berrie happily married."</p>
               <p>"Are you so anxious to give me away, Charlie?" she said in pretended reproach.</p>
               <p>"Not unless it were for your own happiness, as you know, of course. I used to think that you and Ned would make a match;. but he seems to be an incorrigible old bachelor, loving all the girls, but desiring to possess none."</p>
               <p>"That's just as much as you know!" retorted Ned. "And here is proof to the contrary. Berrie, will you take such a scamp as I am, and try and make something of me? Come, name the happy day!" and seizing her hand, he dropped on one knee, saying in an aside to Charlie;—"You see I mean to make the most of my time, before that fellow, Adair, has a chance to cut me out."</p>
               <p>Berrie laughed, and attempted to draw her hand away, saying: "Oh, spare my blushes, Ned, and don't make me confess my attachment before so many."</p>
               <p>He arose from his kneeling position, and with his arm around her waist, drew her through the folding doors, near which she was standing, and closing them<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6505-00000193"/> behind him, said: "You shan't have <emph>that</emph> excuse, Berrie! Tell me that you love me, and will be my wife."</p>
               <p>Something in his tone struck her as unwonted—although he had said the same thing, in effect, playfully, a dozen times;—and she looked into his face questioningly before replying. There was an expression there she had never seen before, and drawing away from him, and attempting to open the doors, she said; "Don't talk nonsense, Ned! It is time I was going home."</p>
               <p>"Don't trifle with me, Berrie! it is time we came to terms." And Ned laughed, and stood with his back against the doors, although the same unusual look lingered in his face, and shone from his merry brown eyes, which looked wonderfully soft and tender.</p>
               <p>"About what, pray?" was the evasive reply.</p>
               <p>"About being married, to be sure! When is it to be?"</p>
               <p>"Never, I guess, Ned!"</p>
               <p>"Berrie, look at me!"</p>
               <p>She obeyed, and looked long and earnestly in his face, which took on a very tender and loving look under her gaze.</p>
               <p>At last he said: "I am not making believe, Berrie. I love you better than any one else, and ask you, in so many words, to be my wife."</p>
               <p>"You don't know what you are talking about, Ned! We are like brother and sister to each other, and never can be anything more."</p>
               <p>"Is that final, Berrie?" and the merry face looked very grave indeed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ned! I thought you knew it was so, and were content."</p>
               <p>"Then it is only brother and sister?"</p>
               <p>"Only brother and sister, Ned, but <emph>always</emph> that." And in her earnestness she laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>He turned impulsively, and drew her within his arms, saying sadly: "Farewell to love then! Give me a sister's kiss, Berrie, to seal our relationship, and <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">'—soften for my heart</l>
                        <l>The pain of this mistake.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And Berrie, with infinite pity unhesitatingly obeyed, and would have drawn away, but detaining her, ho said: "Wait, Berrie;. do you love Eugene Adair?"</p>
               <p>"You have no right to ask me that, Ned."</p>
               <p>"I have, Berrie, a <emph>brother's</emph> right. Answer me! I will be true, I promise."</p>
               <p>"What good would it do you, Ned, if I should tell you?"</p>
               <p>"Much! It will show, at least, that my sister has confidence in me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Ned, I do! Let me go, please!"</p>
               <p>Without a word in reply, he released her, opened the folding-doors for, and closed them behind her, then stepped into the hall, and taking his hat, left the house.</p>
               <p>Charlie and Maud, with a single exclamation expressing a desire that it might be as Ned wished, awaited their return, and guessed when Berrie came in alone, how the matter had terminated.</p>
               <p>"It is getting late, and I must go. Charlie, you will<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6505-00000194"/> have to go home with me, as Ned had an engagement, I think, and has gone."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair had called, as Berrie had anticipated, and expressed much regret, she was informed, at not finding her at home. But she was <emph>not</emph> informed that he had inquired, when told where Berrie had gone, if Mr. Burton had not married a sister of the Mr. Lester to whom he had been presented the previous evening, and on being answered in the affirmative, had gone away with his heart filled with the old jealous pangs.</p>
               <p>"She might have known," he thought, "that I would call to-day, and doubtless went away especially to avoid me. In that case, she cannot care for me still, of course." Had he understood the sex better, he might have taken that very thing as proof that she <emph>did</emph> care for him still.</p>
               <p>He having already called, she remained at home the following day, instead of spending it with Helen, as she meant to have done, in case the gentleman had not yet presented himself at her sister's; thinking he certainly would not call two days in succession. But late in the P. M. Mrs. Wright came up, and said that Mr. Adair was downstairs and wished to see her.</p>
               <p>"Will you go down with me, Belle, and remain as long as he does?" she asked.</p>
               <p>Why no! of course not! He don't want to see me. He has a message for you, Bridget said."</p>
               <p>"Then I will send down word that I am engaged, and he can deliver the message to her."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! go down and see him."</p>
               <p>"Not unless you do!" decidedly.</p>
               <p>"Well, come along then!" and they left the room. "I have half a mind to tell him that you made me come."</p>
               <p>"Hush! Perhaps the parlor door is open. Don't you dare to do any such thing. Wait a moment," she added, "I have forgotten something." And running back she drew his ring from her finger and threw it on the bureau, saying to herself: "He shall not know I wear the ring of a man who has deserted me."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair's first glance was for the identical ring, and its non-appearance on her hand, he did <emph>not</emph> consider particularly encouraging.</p>
               <p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Adair! I missed your call yesterday," in as self-possessed a manner, as if her heart had not been swelling with love for the man before her, who had once held her in his arms, as his betrothed bride. She wondered vaguely if he thought of it now.</p>
               <p>"Yes! I regretted exceedingly not being able to see you."</p>
               <p>"Have you seen Mr. Wright?" asked Belle.</p>
               <p>"Yes! I called at his office this morning."</p>
               <p>"He was quite surprised at your abrupt return."</p>
               <p>"As all my friends were!" he returned, smiling. "I am a poor correspondent, and neglected writing until too late."</p>
               <p>He looked at Berrie as he spoke, and she thought she could bear witness to the fact he had stated.</p>
               <p>"I shall have a new picture on exhibition next week," he said after a while. "I have given up business entirely, and devote my time to painting now."</p>
               <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6505-00000195"/>
               <p>"Indeed?" said Mrs. Wright. "Your other picture created quite a sensation in Boston."</p>
               <p>"'Holly-berries?? yes! That was owing, I fancy, to the beauty of my principal figure," he laughed.</p>
               <p>Berrie colored as she inquired: "Which? the gentleman or lady?"</p>
               <p>"Oh the lady, of course! I flatter myself I achieved a perfect likeness in painting that. Do you not agree with me that the girl was lovely, Mrs. Wright?"</p>
               <p>Belle laughed: "I do, indeed, Mr. Adair! And the artist's figure was very good also."</p>
               <p>"Yes! a friend of mine in Venice painted that. I hope you will like my other. It is an Italian landscape. I shall be glad to take you to see it, Miss Burton, and Mrs. Wright also, if her husband won't object," laughingly.</p>
               <p>"Oh no! George isn't jealous, I believe," Mrs. Wright returned. "But I dare say he will like to take me himself."</p>
               <p>The conversation continued on commonplace matters, until Mr. Adair, seeing no prospect of Mrs. Wright leaving the room, arose to go.</p>
               <p>"By the way, I came near forgetting my errand. My sister wished me to call and ask you to come around to-morrow evening. She expects some company, I believe; a little informal gathering of intimate friends. Shall I say that you will come, Miss Burton?"</p>
               <p>Berrie hesitated. She would have been glad to refuse, but did not see how she could, and therefore answered: "Thank your sister for me, Mr. Adair, and tell her I shall come, unless something unforeseen prevents."</p>
               <p>The next evening came and Mr. Wright took Berrie around to Mrs. Merrill's, she impressing upon him the fact that he must call for her at twelve or half-past, hoping thus to prevent a téte-â-téte with her quondam lover.</p>
               <p>It was a very pleasant little social gathering, and Berrie enjoyed it as well as she could do anything just now, when she was so restless, troubled, and dissatisfied. She had been singing rather late in the evening, and when she arose from the piano Mrs. Merrill said: "Sing something, Eugene, won't you? We have had so much to talk about, you haven't sung for me since you came home."</p>
               <p>"I haven't sung much of late, anyway," he returned. "Have you any old-fashioned pieces here, Grace?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, plenty of them at the bottom of that pile."</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair began turning over the music, and at last placed a song on the rack, and after an elaborate prelude, began the old, exquisite air, "Ever of thee I'm fondly dreaming."</p>
               <p>How pertinent seemed the words to the girl who listened with quickly beating heart to the familiar, musical voice! Equally as pertinent as one he had sung in the long ago, when, as now, she was in doubt about his affection for her. <q>

               <p>Scarcely was the song ended, when a message was conveyed to Miss Burton that a gentleman was waiting for her, and taking quiet leave of her hostess, she hastily took her departure; while Mr. Adair, when becoming aware of her absence, felt more vexed and disappointed than he cared to betray. He had counted much on escorting her home on that evening, and thus finding opportunity for saying what he wished, but had thus far been unable to do.</p>

               <p>BERRIE saw no more of Ned for Several days, when, to her relief, he presented himself at her sister's, with no perceptible difference in look and manner, with no <emph>seeming</emph> remembrance of the subject of their last conversation. He had fought out his pain and disappointment in those few brief days, and was his old gay self again.</p>
               <p>Probably he would never meet a woman who would be quite so dear to him as Miss Berrie Burton, but love and marriage were not a necessity to his happiness, and doubtless he would never have come to the point of proposing for the girl's hand, had it not been suggested to him by his brother-in-law's careless remark on the occasion of their last interview.</p>
               <p>Berrie was greatly relieved that the affair had terminated<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6505-00000197"/> minated as amicably as it evidently had done, for she prized Fed very highly as a dear and true friend, and apart from her dislike to cause him pain, was a strong desire that the pleasant relations existing between them for so long might still continue, to say nothing of the intimate connection the families must necessarily sustain to each other, through the marriage of Charlie and Maud.</p>
               <p>Berrie was passing through the hall on her way upstairs, the Saturday following the evening she had spent at Mrs. Merrill's, when the servant admitted a lad bearing a note for Miss Burton. Berrie, recognizing the familiar handwriting of her old-time love, tore it open where she stood, and read as follows:</p>

               <p>Berrie pondered a moment, then stepping to the basement stairs, called to her sister who was in the dining-room below.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Berrie?" her sister replied from the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>"I have a note from Mr. Adair, desiring to know what day I will go to see his picture. I would like you to go at the same time; when do you think George could take you?"</p>
               <p>Belle thought a moment, then replied; "I don't know, I am sure! On Tuesday as well as any day, I suppose. Thursday is Christmas, you know, and Hattie will be coming on Wednesday."</p>
               <p>"Very well, I will say Tuesday then."</p>
               <p>She stepped to the hat-rack in the hall, and taking a card from the basket there, wrote hastily on the back of it, "Tuesday. 11 A. M.—B. B."—and without glancing at the face of it, passed it to the boy in waiting, desiring him to give it to Mr. Adair.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Adair's chagrin, when, after reading the pencilled reply on the back of the card, he turned it over, to find Ned Lester's name engraved on the face. It seemed to him at the moment, scarcely less than an insult, and he fancied she had sent it to give him an intimation of how matters stood, and how vain it would be for him to seek a renewal of the old relations between them.</p>
               <p>"I will not trouble her!" he thought, bitterly. "I have tried my best, two on three times since my return, to find an opportunity of speaking to her, but she invariably manages to prevent it in one way or another, and I will wait now until there seems to be some chance of success."</p>
               <p>He tossed the card in the fire, and left the room and the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair was prompt to time on the following Tuesday, and Berrie did not keep him waiting long,<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6505-00000198"/> but came down looking beautifully in a black velvet walking dress, and hat, and the handsome ermine cape, in which Mr. Hanson had found her so irresistible.</p>
               <p>Her sister, to her annoyance, was somewhat indisposed, and she was obliged, much against her inclination, to accompany him alone.</p>
               <p>I think she could not have explained, had she been desired to do so, her reluctance to remain a moment alone, with one who was still so dear to her. Did she dread a renewal of their old relations to each other? Did she shrink from an explanation which might restore the love and confidence between them that had existed when he bade her a tender farewell four years previous? Did she distrust her own self-control when no restraint was imposed upon them by the presence of others? She would not have confessed that either motive was the cause, and therefore we must set it down to the indescribable instinct or emotion, which prompts a woman so frequently to act in direct contradiction to her impulses or desires.</p>
               <p>Berrie was, or pretended to be, in her gayest mood, and contrived to prevent anything tending toward serious conversation during their brief drive down-town, and of course while they remained in the exhibition-room there was no opportunity for approaching the dreaded subject.</p>
               <p>. The picture which was the object of their visit, was duly studied and admired, and Berrie could not avoid feeling just the least trifle proud of her companion, as the whisper that he was the "artist Adair," began to be circulated through the rooms.</p>
               <p>At last he said, laughing: "It is becoming rather uncomfortable here, Berrie; I think we will go, if you are willing."</p>
               <p>Berrie signified her readiness, saying archly: "That is one of the delights of being famous, Mr. Adair."</p>
               <p>"I suppose so!" he returned. "Have you visited the Athenæeum this season, Berrie? if not, we will go in for a while, if you like."</p>
               <p>Berrie had not been, and did like, therefore they drove down to Beacon Street, and spent an hour or so in those delightful rooms, crowded with works of art, which could but gratify the most fastidious eyes.</p>
               <p>As they were driving homeward about three o'clock, Berrie said: "I expect Hattie in to-morrow for the holidays, Mr. Adair. You must call and see her; she will be glad to welcome you home, for she is a great friend to you, I assure you," laughing.</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly do myself the honor to call; for constant friends, I find, are very rare," a little bitterly.</p>
               <p>Berrie could have echoed his remark, but returned serenely: "You were always rather sceptical as to the endurance of friendship, Mr. Adair, I remember, but you will find that Hattie is proof of its being a possibility; she is very true in her allegiance to you."</p>
               <p>"That is more than can be said of all my friends!" with a little bitter laugh. "But I am very glad, assuredly, that Hattie is still true, and shall certainly do my best to retain so constant a friend. Please give her my kindest regards when she arrives, and say that I shall make an early attempt to renew our acquaintance."</p>
               <pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6505-00000199"/>
               <p>Berrie had winced under his scornful exclamation and bitter laugh, and a sharp retort trembled on her lips, but controlling herself, she replied calmly: "She will feel highly flattered, I can assure you; she often speaks of how you used to tease her and pull her curls, and says she thought you provoking and delightful in a breath."</p>
               <p>"Yes! we used to have some battles, I believe. Is she as fond of her sister Berrie as she used to be?"</p>
               <p>"Very nearly, I think. Hattie is a nice little girl"</p>
               <p>"She promised to be when a child. I was greatly interested in her."</p>
               <p>There was a silence of some moments, then Mr. Adair remarked: "You do not visit my sister very frequently, Berrie!"</p>
               <p>"I have not of late, no! Have been very busy assisting Belle and Maud prepare for Christmas. An unmarried sister is quite an acquisition to a family, you must know," she added, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Doubtless!" he returned absently; and but little more was said until the carriage drew up at her own door. After assisting her to alight, he held her hand in a tight grasp for a moment, and looked into her eyes with a searching, almost stern expression in his own, and with lips sharply compressed.</p>
               <p>She returned the glance for an instant, almost defiantly, then laughed provokingly, and drawing her hand away, ran up the steps, saying gayly: a "It is very cold to-day! Good afternoon, Mr. Adair," and without a backward look, entered the vestibule.</p>
               <p>"Well?" said Mrs. Merrill inquiringly, as her brother entered the room where she was sitting, somewhat later in the day.</p>
               <p>"Well?" he echoed, looking rather moody, as he drew a chair close to the register, and sat down.</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me, Eugene, that she has refused you!" said the lady anxiously, as she arose and came toward her brother.</p>
               <p>"I have not asked her!" he returned quietly.</p>
               <p>"O Eugene! I supposed it would be all settled today. You surely had sufficient opportunity."</p>
               <p>"Why no! I do not know that I did. She contrived to make the conversation very commonplace during the drive both ways; and besides, I have no reason to think I should be successful, did I have an opportunity to speak to her. She is like the rest of her faithless sex, I suppose, as fickle and' inconstant as the wind."</p>
               <p>"Eugene Adair! what <emph>are</emph> you talking about! You know it is no such thing; and even if it were, she has plenty of excuses in your seeming desertion while you were abroad, and failure to seek an explanation immediately on your return."</p>
               <p>"Well, what could I do, more than I have? I called there the day following my return, and she was away, purposely, I have no doubt. I called again on the day succeeding, and Mrs. Wright remained in the room during my entire visit. The next evening she was here, but successfully avoided my escort home, and when I wrote on Saturday to ask when I should take her to see my picture, she sent the reply written on the back of Ned Lester's card, which by the way, I considered quite suggestive to say the least. And to-day the<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6505-00000200"/> result of our companionship was what I have previously stated."</p>
               <p>"Air of which amounts to nothing! You should have contrived on the evening of Mrs. Mitchell's party, to tell her that you should call the following morning, and wished to see her alone, instead of distinctly stating, as you did, that you should call soon to see <emph>Mrs. Wright;</emph> and which, by the way, I presume <emph>she</emph> considered quite suggestive, and excused her absence on the occasion of your first call. Failing in this, you might have written her a note the next day, to the same effect. In fact, there are a dozen ways in which you might have brought matters to a crisis. The truth is, Eugene, you are too much afraid you shall let her know that you love her still; and never as long as you both live, will you win a similar confession from her, until you have shown to her conclusively that you <emph>do</emph> care for her, and that the possession of her love is what you most desire."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what I will do!" she continued, after a pause. "I will invite her here Christmas Day, and contrive that you shall have an opportunity. You shall not have that for an excuse, after that."</p>
               <p>"She would not come. She expects her sister Hattie home to-morrow, and that will be sufficient excuse for her to refuse."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will invite Hattie too."</p>
               <p>"You can do so, if you like, but I am positive it will be of no avail."</p>
               <p>"We shall see, my dear brother, we shall see! Trust a woman in such matters as that," she laughed. "<emph>I</emph> can bring Miss Berrie to terms, if you cannot, I warrant."</p>

               <p>ARE the ladies in?" asked Mrs. Merrill, the following afternoon, as she stood with her brother on the steps of Mrs. Wright's residence, adding, as she received an affirmative reply and stepped in the hall: "Please say that I should like to see them all, Miss Hattie included, if she has arrived," and she handed her own and her brother's card to the servant in waiting.</p>
               <p>Berrie and Hattie came down immediately, and Mrs. Wright followed soon.</p>
               <p>"My sister Hattie, Mrs. Merrill!" said Berrie, introducing the tall, pretty young girl that accompanied her.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, my dear? I am very glad to meet a sister of Miss Burton's, and am sure we shall be very<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6505-00000201"/> good friends, shall we not, Miss Hattie?" smiled the lady.</p>
               <p>"I trust so, Mrs. Merrill," returned the girl, a little shyly. "I always love Berrie's friends."</p>
               <p>"Your old friend, Mr. Adair, Hattie," continued Berrie. "I was telling him yesterday you had never wavered in your allegiance to him," she laughed.</p>
               <p>"And is this really the little girl I left four years ago?" said the gentleman, as he bent over the little hand of the girl. "I am afraid we shall have to begin back in our acquaintance, you have grown so out of my recollection."</p>
               <p>"Yes?" she returned archly, but a little shyly, as she tossed back her ringlets. "But I am the same Hattie you used to delight to tease, Mr. Adair."</p>
               <p>He laughed. "So you have not forgotten our old battles, Miss Hattie!"</p>
               <p>"No indeed! nor how my curls used to get pulled when I was saucy."</p>
               <p>"Allow me, Miss Hattie!" and he placed a chair for her near the one in which he had been sitting.</p>
               <p>"So you really did come back!" she said, laughing, while the ladies were conversing together on matters in which neither were interested.</p>
               <p>"I really did, yes!" he returned smiling. "Didn't you expect I would?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know; four or five years looked a long time to me when you went away; and we missed you very much, Mr. Adair."</p>
               <p>"Did you? It is pleasant to be missed, you know!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose so! Do you find my sister changed, Mr. Adair?"</p>
               <p>"Berrie, do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Berrie, yes sir!"</p>
               <p>"Somewhat, yes! but more in manner than in face."</p>
               <p>"She is not nearly as gay as she used to be. She felt ma's and pa's death so much!" and the arch, piquant little face looked very grave for the moment.</p>
               <p>"As you must all do necessarily! I felt so sorry for you all when I heard of it in Venice. I could not realize that it were possible," said the gentleman, sympathetically.</p>
               <p>"I scarcely can, even yet. Berrie is all the mother I have got now," and the sweet lips trembled perceptibly.</p>
               <p>"Miss Burton," said Mrs. Merrill at this juncture, "I want you and your little sister to dine with me tomorrow, and spend the evening."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Mrs. Merrill! you are very kind—"</p>
               <p>"No refusal, now, Miss Berrie!" interposed the lady playfully, "I will not accept it. I want you and I must have you."</p>
               <p>"In that case," smiled Berrie, "I suppose I have nothing to say about it."</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all, only to say that you will come," she, returned laughingly.</p>
               <p>"I don't know about letting you have both of them;" said Mrs. Wright; "you had better take Berrie, and let Hattie remain with me."</p>
               <p>"No indeed! I want them both. You can have them afterwards, but I have set my heart on their eating<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6505-00000202"/> ing their Christmas dinner with me, and I always have my own way, don't I, Eugene?" she laughed.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you do, Gracie," returned the gentleman, smiling. "I believe we always spoiled you a little."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is nice to be spoiled by those one loves; isn't it, little girl?" she finished, turning to Hattie.</p>
               <p>"I think it is, Mrs. Merrill."</p>
               <p>"And you will come and dine with me Christmas Day?"</p>
               <p>"I shall be very glad to, thank you, if Berrie will go," said the little girl.</p>
               <p>"And Berrie will, I am sure! won't you dear?"</p>
               <p>"What will you do to me if I say no?"</p>
               <p>"Come and drag you off, nolens-volens."</p>
               <p>"Then I think the best thing I can do is to acquiesce gracefully, and keep my dignity intact," she laughed.</p>
               <p>"It is, decidedly!" returned the lady. "I am glad to find you so sensible."</p>
               <p>"We shall dine early, and I will send a carriage and my big brother, here, around for you about four o'clock," she said, as she was taking leave.</p>
               <p>"Do you allow your sister to dispose of you thus summarily, Mr. Adair, without consulting you in the least?" asked Mrs. Wright playfully.</p>
               <p>"Gracie does with me about as she pleases," he returned smiling, "and she is aware that nothing could afford me more pleasure than to escort my young friends to her house."</p>
               <p>"Good-by until to-morrow, Berrie!" he said in a low tone, as he pressed her hand warmly in farewell. "And allow me to express my exceeding gratification in your acceptance of my sister's invitation, though it may have been somewhat forced." And he looked into her eyes with a glance eloquent of the strong love for her which had made her heart so glad, and softened the pangs of parting more than four years ago.</p>
               <p>"Well, you see I accomplished my object, Eugene!" said his sister laughingly, as they were walking homewards.</p>
               <p>"I see you did, yes! much to my surprise and gratification."</p>
               <p>"And which I probably should not have done, if I had sent you instead of going myself. She would have refused the invitation at the outset, and you would have been too proud to urge its acceptance."</p>
               <p>"While <emph>you</emph> took her by storm," he retorted, "and compelled her to surrender whether she liked or not."</p>
               <p>"Exactly!" she returned serenely. "And all on your account, my faint-hearted brother. And now," she added threateningly, "if you don't make the most of the opportunity, and bring the young lady to terms, you deserve to lose her, and I wash my hands of your affairs."</p>
               <p>"I think Mr. Adair is just splendid!" said Hattie, when they were gone. "So handsome, and noble, and distinguished looking, and just as agreeable as he can be. I am glad we are going there to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Don't be too enamored of him, Hattie, or Berrie will be jealous," laughed Belle.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have a right to go into ecstacies over my future brother, haven't I?" and she glanced mischievously<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6505-00000203"/> ously at her sister, who colored rosily, and answered: "Don't talk nonsense, Hattie! Come upstairs, and let me try your black silk dress, and see if it requires any alteration. I suppose that is all you have suitable to wear to-morrow. You must have some new dresses, and I think might begin to wear colors now; don't you, Belle?"</p>
               <p>"Why yes, I think so! it is nearly a year and a half since we put on mourning."</p>
               <p>"Have you left it off, Berrie?" asked Hattie.</p>
               <p>"I have not put on colors yet, but have worn black velvet and lavender ribbons, once or twice."</p>
               <p>Berrie's heart beat in little thrills the remainder of that day, and the fore part of the next, and she could not avoid thinking of the last expressive glance of her friend, and recalling constantly the golden past, when all barriers were thrown aside, and she was so happy in her acknowledged and reciprocated affection.</p>
               <p>She could not have told what she anticipated from the promised visit, but she was in that delightful state of pleasant expectation, when one feels that there is a great good in store, or something exceedingly joyful about to occur,—which makes the hours pass tardily, and fills the heart with a nameless delight, often more thrilling and sweet than the actual and realized bliss.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair called for them soon after the appointed time, and when Berrie came into the room, somewhat in advance of her sister, and playfully extended both hands in greeting, on one of which sparkled his ring—and which he had not seen before since his return—he could not repress the passionate exclamation, "<emph>My</emph>
                  <emph>Holly-Berry!</emph>" which brought a most becoming flush to the fair girl's cheek, and caused her uplifted eyes to droop beneath the old, tender gaze of his.</p>
               <p>Hattie's immediate entrance prevented anything more demonstrative at that time, but Berrie's heart beat a trifle faster than it had done before, and the rose his words had called to her cheek, never left it till sleep kissed away the flushes, and hushed the rapidly-beating heart to its ordinary quiet pulsations.</p>
               <p>The hour before dinner passed away very pleasantly. Mr. Adair exerted all his powers of fascination, Mrs. Merrill was her own gay self, Berrie was in her most sparkling and witching mood, and Hattie the same piquant, saucy little girl of old, and the gay conversation never flagged. When dinner was over, and they returned to the parlors, Mr. Adair brought out his Italian sketches, and in looking at, admiring, and listening to explanations of them by the gifted artist, another hour was pleasantly filled, and then Mrs. Merrill exclaimed: "That picture of Rome reminds me of some exquisite cameos, mosaics, and pearls that my brother brought me from there. Wouldn't you like to see them, Hattie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes indeed, very much, if it is not too much trouble:"</p>
               <p>"Well, come upstairs with me then, and we will look them over."</p>
               <p>"May I not go too, please, Mrs. Merrill?" asked Berrie, with the old shrinking from being left alone with her old-time lover.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed!" returned the lady laughing. "You<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6505-00000204"/> must stay here and keep my big brother out of mischief."</p>
               <p>"Berrie don't care for jewels," said Hattie, and the girl was left behind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair closed the door after his sister and her little guest, crossed the room and drew a long spray of holly from a large antique vase which he had brought from Italy, then approaching his companion, he playfully wound it round her head, saying: "Do you remember, Berrie, how I used to wish in the old days, to see you crowned with holly-berries?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" was the low reply.</p>
               <p>"Come and see the effect."</p>
               <p>He drew her gently from her chair, and with his arm unresisted around her waist, led her to the long mirror.</p>
               <p>"Look! my little girl! is not that the very impersonation of my 'Holly-Berries?'"</p>
               <p>The girl glanced up at the glowing reflection of herself in the large pier-glass, and returned with something of the old confusion of manner: "I suppose it is, Mr. Adair, or would be if my jacket was scarlet instead of white."</p>
               <p>She was looking exceedingly well in the sweeping dress of black velvet which she had worn at Mrs. Mitchell's on the evening of his return, and which fell around her graceful form in such rich, heavy folds as velvet alone can assume; but she had drawn a dainty white cashmere jacket, richly embroidered with black, and which was exquisitely becoming—over the bare neck and arms which the low but dress had left exposed; lavender ribbons completed her rich but simple attire, and the gleaming wreath of holly, whose berries matched in hue the scarlet of her cheeks, all together made a picture as beautiful and attractive as any man could desire to look upon.</p>
               <p>They stood in silence for a moment, the girl with downcast eyes and drooping head, the man half intoxicated with the joy of holding her once more in his arms, after the long, weary years of separation and partial estrangement; then he said softly:—</p>
               <p>"Berrie!"</p>
               <p>She half looked up without reply, and lifting with his disengaged hand the rounded chin, he said tenderly: "Do you remember the day we parted, little girl, over four years ago?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Eugene!" was the low reply, calling him by his Christian name for the first time since his return.</p>
               <p>"And do you love me now as then, even as I do you, with all my heart and soul?"</p>
               <p>For reply she hid her face against his shoulder, saying softly: "You did not trust me, Eugene! You cannot blame me if I do not."</p>
               <p>"But you do, I know, else you would not permit me to hold you here. Thank God!" he added reverently, "for having kept us for each other, and united us at last."</p>
               <p>He held her for a moment in silence, then said playfully, as he kissed her tenderly: "This is our betrothal, my love! I leave you free no longer."</p>
               <p>"You should not have done before. You have put my love to some severe tests, Eugene."</p>
               <p>"I fear I have; and my sister says I do not deserve<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6505-00000205"/> you. But it has come out clear and true, as gold that has passed through the purifying fire."</p>
               <p>He drew her to a seat, and the cause of their mutual silence was speedily and satisfactorily explained.</p>
               <p>"And so I came home," he concluded, "trembling between hope and fear, to find my artless little girl transformed into a polished, self-possessed woman, wearing an armor of pride which I almost feared was invulnerable. But it is all right at last, and now after the waiting time, comes the perfect sweetness of 'hope's fruition.' God is very good, is He not, dear? to have kept us in health and safety through the testing years of separation, and to allow us to meet once more under such happy and promising auspices. I, at least, cannot thank Him enough, for His best and rarest gift—a true woman."</p>
               <p>"So you do believe, at last, Eugene, that a constant woman is at least a possibility!" she returned playfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Berrie, you have taught me a new faith in your sex, and shown me that there <emph>is</emph> truth in woman's love."</p>
               <p>"And you won't distrust or be jealous of me any more?" archly.</p>
               <p>"I shall try not, darling, but you must remember my weakness, and humor the old man a little; and I don't think I shall admit any gentlemen friends into my house too freely."</p>
               <p>Berrie was hurt, and drew away, saying bitterly: "You do not trust me, even yet, or love me either, I might say, if you think me capable of being false to my marriage vows. Have you not tested me sufficiently yet?"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Berrie, I do <emph>not</emph> think you capable of being untrue. I know you are no Clara, and I trust you, dear, as I have done no other living woman;" and unresisted he drew her close again.</p>
               <p>"Do you know I <emph>am</emph> getting an old man, Berrie?" he continued after a pause. "Forty next birthday, little girl; think of that?"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Eugene!" she laughed. "You are plenty young, and besides, will renew your age when you have a young wife to pet you."</p>
               <p>"I would not wonder, love, I would not wonder!" he murmured, tenderly stroking the holly-crowned head of the girl at his side.</p>
               <p>"And when is that to be, Berrie?" he added after a moment.</p>
               <p>"When is what to be, Eugene?"</p>
               <p>"When am I to <emph>have</emph> a young wife to pet me?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, in two or three years, I suppose!" she answered, saucily.</p>
               <p>"Two or three years, Berrie! Make it two or three months and I will try and be content."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is too soon! I have not a single dress but black, and think how long it will take to have all the pretty ones made, that I shall require for so important an occasion;" she laughed.</p>
               <p>"You are a true woman, I see, Berrie! But it is you I want, not the dresses."</p>
               <p>"I dare say! but I want the dresses, you see I would not like you to feel ashamed of your bride."</p>
               <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6505-00000206"/>
               <p>"No danger of that, little girl, no danger of that! I want you to spend the summer in Europe, and be back in your own home in September, or October at latest."</p>
               <p>"In Europe? with you? 'My cup runneth over,' Eugene."</p>
               <p>"My darling!" passionately, "I am glad if you are pleased! So let it be as early as possible. I will give you until the last of May for your dresses. Will that do, dear?"</p>
               <p>"It must, I suppose, if your lordship wills!" she returned laughingly.</p>
               <p>"So to-morrow I will bring you a solitaire, Berrie, to replace this parting gift of your friend."</p>
               <p>"Not to replace it, Eugene. This is one of my dearest treasures. By the way," she added after a moment, "what has become of your sister and Hattie, I wonder?"</p>
               <p>The gentleman laughed. "My sister promised I should have an opportunity to 'make up,' Berrie, and she has kept her word. She loves you dearly, my darling, and will welcome you as a sister with wide-open arms."</p>
               <p>"She has been a dear friend to me, both for her own sake, and the sake of one she so strongly resembles."</p>
               <p>"Well, is it all settled?" inquired Mrs. Merrill gayly, as she entered the room a little later.</p>
               <p>"But I do not need to ask!" she continued delightedly, and taking the girl's blushing face between her two hands, she kissed her warmly, saying. "God bless you, my dear little sister, and make you as happy as you deserve to be."</p>
               <p>Then to her brother: "I congratulate you with all my heart, Eugene, and hope you will own that I am a good manœuvrer at least; for you must know, Berrie, that you were invited here to-day with this special end in view. My faint-hearted brother, here," she continued, teasingly, "stood in such awe of his old-time love, that I really felt afraid he would lose her after all; so in sheer pity, you see, I just did my best to help him along. Well, well, good people! I wonder if you are really a bit happier at this termination than I am!" and she sat down in the nearest chair.</p>
               <p>Hattie had stood as if spell-bound, hardly comprehending what there was such an ado about, until Mrs. Merrill, catching sight of her as she sat down, exclaimed laughing: "Are you astounded, Hattie? Go and kiss your new brother, that is to be, dear, and wish him all the joy that his marriage with your sister is capable of bestowing."</p>
               <p>"I didn't get far wrong yesterday, did I, Berrie?" said the sharp little girl archly, as she stepped to her sister's side. Adding: "I am just as glad as I can be, Mr. Adair, and when you are married, I will adopt you for my father."</p>
               <p>There was a general laugh, and Eugene said: "You think I am old enough to be, eh, Hattie?"</p>
               <p>"Why no! I don't think you are very old, but Berrie is my second mother, you know, and so of course I shall have to adopt you for my father."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is it, eh? Well suit yourself! brother or father, it is all one to me."</p>
               <p>The remainder of the evening passed very pleasantly<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6505-00000207"/> and happily to all parties, and the carriage which Mr. Adair had ordered for twelve o'clock came all too soon.</p>
               <p>"This is keeping rather late hours for such a little girl as you, isn't it, Hattie?" said Mrs. Merrill, as she tied on the child's hat.</p>
               <p>"Rather later than boarding-school hours," she returned laughingly, "but you know it is Christmas night, and I am wide awake yet."</p>
               <p>"So I perceive!" answered the lady, laughing. "Be sure to come around again before you go back to school."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, I shall like to. Good-night!"</p>
               <p>"Good-night, dear! Now don't keep Berrie up until daylight, Eugene," she said archly, as he led Berrie away; "there are plenty more days coming, in which to say all those pretty things to her."</p>
               <p>"I shall be back immediately!" he returned, as he placed her in the carriage.</p>
               <p>Five minutes lingering in the deserted parlors of Berrie's home, with his solately restored love,—Hattie had considerately gone right upstairs—another in which to whisper his tender good-night, and Berrie was alone with her great happiness, so long delayed, but so perfect and sweet in the first moments of its glad fulfilment.</p>

               <p>THE days that followed were halcyon ones to the young girl. The short winter months were one dream of delight, and passed away only too fleetly. Looking back, years after, to that time, it seemed to her no mortal ever experienced a greater degree of, or more entire, happiness than did she. When the man she loved had wooed her previous to his departure for Europe, the ever-conscious pang of parting was mixed with all her ecstacy, while now not a single regret mingled with the delight that filled every day of their brief betrothal. Loving each other with a full and perfect affection, they had no lovers' quarrels to<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC6505-00000208"/> make up—she found her betrothed as devoted as she could ask, and he his love everything that he could desire.</p>
               <p>Thus happily and swiftly flew the days and months, and brought a soft May evening—the one preceding the bridal. The last garment was finished and packed, the handsome travelling dress was all ready to robe the dainty form of the bride, and on the morrow there would be a quiet morning wedding, when Charlie Burton would give away his sister to the man she loved and had chosen from all others, and an ocean steamer would bear away the happy couple, to spend their summer honeymoon among the storied haunts of the world beyond the sea.</p>
               <p>It was a perfect evening, but a few days before the birth of summer's initial month. The sun had gone down in a blaze of glory, leaving behind a cloudless sky, tinged at the western horizon with the reflected brilliance of his triumphal departure, while in the far east, a band of violet melted into a belt of rose, which in turn dissolved into the faint blue of the ether above.</p>
               <p>In the parlor, arranged for the important ceremony to take place on the morrow, behind the lace curtains which draped the windows and fell around her to the floor, stood the fair young bride, watching the dying day, and musing on the change which a few spoken words would make in her life, when, with a start, she recognized a familiar figure, and with a little cry of pleasure, hastened herself to admit her almost husband.</p>
               <p>"You did not expect to see me again to-night, did you, Berrie?" he said, smiling, as they entered the parlor. "I went to purchase that important little article, your wedding ring, and among so many sizes, I found it impossible to tell which would fit my little girl's finger, so I just ran round with a couple to see." And he drew a tiny box from his pocket, and fitted the heavy gold band to the "wedding-finger" of the little hand he held.</p>
               <p>"The smallest one fits best, Eugene," she said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, so I perceive. And now I must hasten back, in order to have it engraved to-night. I ought to have attended to this matter before. I was around at the house to-night with the carpenter, and gave the last directions about its fitting up, and Grace has full instructions as to the furnishing. So when we return from Europe next fall, her home will be all ready for my little bride. Good night, love! God keep you safe until the morning;" and kissing her tenderly, he took his departure, while Berrie glided back to her place in the lace-draped window, to watch the receding form of the man she loved.</p>
               <p>What a soft light was in the large, dark eyes, what a happy smile on the sweet lips, as she gazed at the tall, manly form of her lover, as he walked briskly away, turning at the corner to lift his hat and kiss his hand to the girl who on the morrow would be all his own until death should part them.</p>
               <p>The twilight deepened, and a ring at the bell was followed by the entrance of lively Annie Mitchell, who had come, she said, for one last chat with her "pretty cousin."</p>
               <pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6505-00000209"/>
               <p>Berrie lighted the gas, and sat down on the sofa with the young girl, saying in surprise as the light struck the face of her cousin: "Why, what is the matter, Annie dear? How red your eyes are!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I have just been crying them out to-day, because you are going away, and I can't see you for such a long time. Yet I am as glad as I can be you are so happy, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"I know you are, dear, and the time won't be so long, after all. Four months at the longest; it will soon pass."</p>
               <p>"Will you write to me, Berrie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, every week if I can. Will that console you a little?" smiling.</p>
               <p>"A little, yes; but I shall miss you so much! I love you, Berrie, better than I ever could my own sister."</p>
               <p>"And I am very grateful for your love, little cousin, and even Hattie is no dearer to me than are you. When I am back, you shall stay with me all you will."</p>
               <p>"You are just as good as you can be! I don't blame you for liking Mr. Adair, for I think he is splendid, and I am glad you are going to be so happy; but it breaks my heart to bid you good-by!" and the ready tears sprang to the soft, dark eyes of the girl.</p>
               <p>"Oh, cheer up, Annie!" said Berrie, gayly. "Don't think of that, but of my coming home in the fall. It will only seem a little while after all. How about the going to school. Has mamma given her consent?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes! I am to go back with Hattie the next term."</p>
               <p>"And you will have so many companions there, you won't miss me so much. There's the bell! who is that, I wonder; hark, Annie!"</p>
               <p>A moment, and a servant came in with a package directed to Miss Berrie Burton.</p>
               <p>"Another bridal present, I suppose. I have a table full now. This is from Ned Lester, I think, it looks like his writing," as she stood under the chandelier examining it.</p>
               <p>"He is sure to give you something nice; do open it, Berrie!" said Annie, with girlish impatience.</p>
               <p>The wrappings were undone, and a handsome silver tête-a-tête set brought to view. There was no card attached, but Berrie had recognized the handwriting of the direction, and knew well that it was from her old friend Ned.</p>
               <p>"Isn't it nice!" exclaimed Annie, admiringly.</p>
               <p>"It is indeed, very! and when I am back you shall come and drink tea with me from it, Annie dear."</p>
               <p>"That will be splendid! Oh dear! I wish you were coming back to-morrow, instead of going away."</p>
               <p>"Hark! there's the bell again. It is 'hung on wires' truly, to-day."</p>
               <p>They listened for a moment, then Berrie exclaimed in surprise: "Why, that is Mrs. Merrill's servant. What can he be here for, I wonder?" and an undefined foreboding of evil struck like ice on her loving heart.</p>
               <p>She sprang to the door, and opened it in time to see<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6505-00000210"/> the messenger deliver a note to her sister, for whom he had inquired. Belle tore open the note where she stood, and as she glanced over the contents, she uttered an exclamation of surprise, and turned deadly pale.</p>
               <p>Berrie sprang forward in alarm, exclaiming: "What is it, Belle? let me see!"</p>
               <p>But her sister thrust the note in her pocket, and rallying, exclaimed: "It is nothing, Berrie. Has Annie gone?"</p>
               <p>"Something has happened to Eugene. Give me the note, Belle!" and Berrie with colorless cheeks and compressed lips held out her hand for the letter.</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Berrie!" and Belle tried to laugh naturally. "What could be the matter with Eugene? You don't suppose I am going to let you see all my letters, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Give me the note!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright hesitated, but finally drew the note slowly from her pocket, saying: "You need not be alarmed, Berrie, Eugene got hurt a little going home to-night, and his sister sent to tell me."</p>
               <p>Whiter and whiter grew the anxious face of the girl, but she merely said as before, "Give me the note!" and as her sister reluctantly obeyed, she tore it from the envelope, and with straining eyes read as follows:</p>

               <p>Berrie handed the note back to her sister, and with a little shiver, sank into a chair and covered her face with her hands.</p>
               <p>Belle bent anxiously over her, saying tenderly: "Don't worry, Berrie, it will be all right in a little while!" But she only murmured without uncovering her face:</p>
               <p>"I might have known it! I was too happy! it could not last. He will die, and I shall be more desolate than before."</p>
               <p>"Oh, hope for the best, Berrie dear! It may not be serious after all. You know Mrs. Merrill is easily frightened; "and then as she received no reply—"I think I will go around, shan't I, Berrie? Mrs. Merrill wished me to."</p>
               <p>"I shall go too! Annie, get my hat!" and Berrie uncovered her face and arose.</p>
               <p>Her sister was on the point of remonstrating, but finally decided it might be better than to leave her at home to imagine the worst, and sending a servant for a carriage, they were soon at Mrs. Merrill's door.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Merrill came to them at once in the parlor, as she had said, almost distracted. She took Berrie in her arms, with tears running over her face, though the<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6505-00000211"/> girl's eyes were wide and dry with a tearless despair.</p>
               <p>"My poor child!" said the lady, between her sobs. "Did you come too? What can I say to comfort her, Mrs. Wright?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me how he is!" was the low reply from the girl.</p>
               <p>"He has not wholly revived yet, and the doctors are unable to say how seriously he may be hurt. They are afraid of some internal injury. But I must go back. Come up into my sitting-room, and I will let you know as soon as there is a change."</p>
               <p>They followed her upstairs, and Berrie sat down before the fire, with her eyes fixed on the glowing coals, and such an expression of agony in their dusky depths, as was pitiful to behold. A half hour of tortured waiting, in which Berrie neither moved or spoke, and Belle moved restlessly from one place to another in the small apartment, and then Mrs. Merrill came in with a smiling face, and going up to Berrie, she took her face between her two hands in a manner habitual to her, and kissing her, said joyfully; "Give thanks, little girl! He is better, and the surgeons think there is nothing serious." Then the tears that had seemed congealed around her bursting heart, flowed forth in torrents, and laying her head on her friend's shoulder, she sobbed with joy and relief.</p>
               <p>"How did it happen?" inquired Belle.</p>
               <p>"I scarcely know myself!" returned the lady. "Only that he was crossing a street, and, as I wrote you, was knocked down by a runaway horse. The doctors say he must have been struck by the thills of the carriage, directly over the heart, which was the cause of such a prolonged swoon."</p>
               <p>"And they think there is no serious injury?"</p>
               <p>"They think so, yes! but it was a narrow escape. I should have died, I believe, if he had been killed."</p>
               <p>"Thank God for His mercy!" said Belle, reverently.</p>
               <p>"I do, with my whole heart!" was the earnest reply.</p>
               <p>"And how about to-morrow?" asked Belle.</p>
               <p>"It is impossible to tell, I suppose; but I am sure if Eugene ia able to move there will be no postponement."</p>
               <p>"Has he spoken?" murmured Berrie, whose sobs had gradually ceased.</p>
               <p>"Only to say that Berrie was not to be told."</p>
               <p>"Well, if he is better we may as well go home, Berrie," said her sister. "You will let me know how he is the first thing in the morning."</p>
               <p>"Certainly! But wait a moment until I see how he is now." And she ran out of the room, returning in a moment to say that he had fully recovered consciousness, and the surgeon said he would be all right in the morning; adding, "So just rest easy to-night, little sister, and be your own fresh, sweet self to-morrow. I did not think it best to tell him you were here, lest it should excite him and make him worse."</p>
               <p>The night was anything but a restful and easy one to the anxious girl. She obeyed her sister, and went directly to bed, but only to toss from side to side with wide open eyes, and thoughts in such a tumult it was impossible to sleep.</p>
               <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6505-00000212"/>
               <p>Thanks for his narrow escape, fears that his injuries might have been more serious than they dreamed, after all, tremblings for the happiness which had been so nearly wrecked, anticipations for the future, was God so merciful as to restore her loved one speedily to health, all surged confusedly through her mind, until, as the gray dawn was breaking, she sank into a troubled slumber, from which she was awakened about seven o'clock, by the entrance of her sister, with a note in her hand, saying: "Here is a note from Eugene, Berrie; the messenger says he is better. You had best get up at once, it is seven o'clock." And giving her sister the billet she left the room.</p>
               <p>Berrie tore open the note and read:—</p>

               <p>Eugene came in due season, talking somewhat slowly and looking a little pale, but otherwise Ms handsome, prepossessing self, and a few words from the man of God made them one forever, and sealed their happiness as secure, until death should sever the bonds.</p>
               <p>Then came the congratulations, the wedding breakfast, the drive to the steamer which rode the gleaming waters of the bay "like a thing of life," the parting from dear friends, and the bridal pair were fairly en route on the voyage of wedded life, treading the first steps of the magic pathway with faith in each other, bright hopes for the future, and a mutual love that had endured all tests which the circumstances of the past had imposed, and come out pure, true, and triumphant, a perfect and enduring affection.</p>

               <p>IT was a bright, glowing morning, early in October, that a carriage drew up before one of the handsomest residences in Worcester Square, and Mr. Adair, hastily alighting, handed out his four months' bride, and led her up the steps of her own home. The heavy rosewood doors were thrown wide before he could ring, and Mrs. Merrill, with a beaming face, stood on the threshold.</p>
               <p>"Welcome home, my dear brother and sister!" and she took Berrie in her arms and kissed her rapturously, greeting her brother no less warmly and affectionately.</p>
               <p>"This is the happiest day of my life, good people! I always wanted a sister, and have now got one after my own heart. I hope you are in as ecstatic a state as I am! But come in, do! And Eugene, you can take Berrie over her house, while I see that breakfast is speedily on the table. I hope you will find everything to your mind, Berrie."</p>
               <p>"I am sure I shall, Mrs. Merrill, if you have had the ordering."</p>
               <p>"Don't 'Mrs. Merrill' me, Berrie," laughed the lady; "remember I am your sister Grace now."</p>
               <p>"Whom I love very dearly, as you know."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am glad if you do! but this isn't attending to breakfast;" and she ran away.</p>
               <p>Eugene led his bride through the handsome apartments, whose appointments and arrangement were all that the most fastidious could desire, and paused at last before a door on the second floor, which led into an extension, saying: "But Berrie, this is the best, after all!" and throwing wide the door, he drew her across the threshold.</p>
               <p>Berrie uttered an exclamation of delight as she glanced around the long and lofty room.</p>
               <p>"You see it is sitting-room, library, and studio combined!" he said. "While those two sets of folding doors may divide it into three. Yonder is my studio!" and he led her to the farther end, where stood two or three carved easels, where pictures finished and unfinished covered the walls, and windows were arranged most advantageously for the artistic use to which that portion of the room was devoted.</p>
               <p>"This is our library!" as he closed the first set of folding doors behind him, and led her into the middle of the triple apartment, where in the recess of the<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6505-00000214"/> deeply embayed window, stood a writing desk for each, while books lined the walls, statues gleamed purely white from niches, and a large table stood in the middle of the floor, covered with papers, magazines, and a few of the latest books of the day.</p>
               <p>"And this is your sitting-room; exclusively yours, as the studio is mine, although the latter is always free to you, as the former will be to me, will it not, love? Sit down in your own little sewing-chair, and tell me how you like it."</p>
               <p>"Like it? I cannot tell you how much, Eugene! My cup of joy is full to the brim, and my home, like my husband, is all I can ask."</p>
               <p>"Flatterer!" he exclaimed smilingly, although her praise was far from disagreeable to him.</p>
               <p>The deep, arching window of this portion of the room, birds and flowers rendered beautiful; a work-table and sewing-chair provided for industrious moments; a small but finely-toned piano was ready to minister to her musical tastes, above which hung her artist-husband's first exhibited painting, "Holly-berries," which had done so much, not only to secure the fame which he now enjoyed, but to keep true and bright her love for and confidence in him through the last months of his seeming indifference and desertion.</p>
               <p>"It is perfect, Eugene," she said at last, as her woman's eye took in all the pleasant little details of the cosy room. "I am the happiest girl in Boston."</p>
               <p>"As you ought to be, I am sure; though I am not certain that you are any happier than I am," said Mrs. Merrill gayly, as she entered the room at this moment. "But leave rhapsodizing for the present, and come to breakfast. I am sure you must be starved."</p>
               <p>"I haven't a particle of appetite," laughed Berrie; "coming home has banished every bit of it."</p>
               <p>There was a constant stream of callers through the day—Belle, Maud, Helen, and Annie in the morning: Mr. Wright, Charlie, Ned, Mrs. Mitchell, and other friends, whose names have not appeared in this quiet little story, in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>The days, and weeks, and months that followed, though quiet in the extreme, were very happy ones. Days when Berrie read to her husband while he painted, trifled over some pretty needle-work in the cheery south window of her portion of the room, or brought from the ivory keys of her piano sounds so sweet and ravishing, that her artist-listener often dropped his brush and stood spell-bound with wonder and delight. Evenings when she entertained her friends in her sumptuous parlors, and twilights when she watched through the deepening shadows for the form of one who made her days all sunshine; marvelling, as she watched, over the perfect happiness, serene and deep, which had come into her life, thanking the Author of all good for leading her feet into such pleasant paths, and beside the still waters of an abiding and reciprocated affection.</p>
               <p>"Girls, do you remember that day in Bristol, when for want of something better to do, we all tried to tell what we anticipated in the coming years?" inquired Helen Carlisle one afternoon, about a month subsequent to Berrie's coming home, as with Belle, Maud,<pb n="430" xml:id="VAC6505-00000215"/> and her fair hostess, she sat in the latter's little sitting-room, whose glass doors were partially closed, shutting out the artist, who was painting busily at the farther end of the triple apartment.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> do!" returned Belle. "Our plans have been well fulfilled. I have my happy home and plenty of work for those I love—witness the table at home, piled up with little garments for my two restless cherububs," laughing. "Maud is as 'happy, useful, and beloved' as she could desire; Helen long ago gave up 'wasting her sweetness' on tow-headed urchins, and has won all the fame she can desire; while Berrie—"</p>
               <p>"While Berrie,"—and the dark eyes rested on the handsome Saxon face that looked down at her from above the open piano,—"Berrie has had her years of weary waiting, and is now tasting all the sweets of HOPE'S FRUITION."</p>
