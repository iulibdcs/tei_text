CHAPTER I. Canst thou not minister to a mind deceased;  Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow'; Raze out the written troubles of the brain; And, with some sweet oblivious antidote, Cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff, Which weighs upon the heart?" - MACEBBTE. IN the north-western part of the state of North Carolina, and not far from the Saluda river, is a small village known by the name of Melville. The village contains but forty houses, and there is but one store in the whole place. Besides the store, there is a tavern kept by Deacon Smith, and a small post-office, the postmaster, or, rather, the postmistress, of which, is a little lame woman, called Aunty Johnson. At one end of the village stands the church-a neat little edifice, painted white, both inside and out. Close by the church is the village graveyard--the numerous white stones of which proclaim the virtues of the dead. Opposite the church is the residence of the village pastor, William Walker, formerly of New York city, but now of Melville.  America is a beautiful country. No land can excel her in magnificence of scenery. Her sons arrbrave, generous, and always ready to extend a helping hand to the unfortunate. Her daughters are beautiful, and, like the sons, generous; yet, for all that, in America, the ministers of the gospel are the worst paid of any nation on the earth. It is a fact, and I, who love my country, and Who would willingly lay down my life for it, regret to say it. Some receive high salaries; but the greater part, alas! a:e obliged to work in the day time, prepare their sermons at night, and preach two or three times on the Sabbath. Ought not those who love God be generous to those who teach his word?  Let abler pens than mine lay told of this work, and we shall soon see a reform effected  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7084-00000003"/> 22         THE JEW AND JEWESS. To our story. br. William Walker, (for he was a physician as well as a clergyman,) was h tall, grove-looking man, about forty-eight years of age. In early life, he had been seized with a desire for fame; but ere he had mounted the first step of the ladder, age began to creep upon him. He then longed for quietness and repose: he wished to be out of the crowded city, to spend his remaining days in retirement. A friend procured for him the appointment of the Melville circuit, and there we now find him. It was a beautiful day in spring, when a carriage drove up to Dr. Walker's door. The doctor was seated at the window, studying; but on seeing the carriage, he immediately rose from his chair, and ran out of the house. He was scarcely by the side of the carriage, when the door was. opened, and he caught sight of a face, so pale, so wan, so sickly- looking, that he involuntarily started. "Is this the residence of Dr. Walker?" asked a voice which trembled at every word, and sounding so low that the doctor could hardly hear it. "It is," replied the doctor. "And you are the gentleman?" "I am," was the reply. The gentleman extended a letter to the doctor. The latter opened it. It was from an old friend, requesting him to permit the bearer, Mr. Ecclangfeldt, and his three sons, to remain at his house a few months. As the doctor finished, he slowly folded up the letter, and placed it in his pocket. "What is your answer?" asked the gentleman. The doctor slowly raised his head, and a tear dropped from his eye as he spoke. "God knows," said he, "that I would gladly dothis for you; but I am oor, very poor, and what little I have will hardly keep one, much less five!"  "But I am able to pay for my board, and that of my children," he exclaimed. "See!" and he opened his purse and displayed several gold pieces before the eyes of the doctor. Then, suddenly shutting his hand, as if repenting having shown the gold, he asked, "What is your answer now?" "Different from the first, I can assure you," replied the doctor. "You can stay in my house as long as you wish." The gentleman got out. The doctor discovered that he was far gone ith consumption. To support his trembling frame, he was obliged to an upon the arm of his eldest son' a boy of ten years of age, named Abner. Benjamin and Charles, his two remaining sons, seven and five years of age, followed. The doctor led them into the house, and seated them in his study. "Ah," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt, "methinks the pleasant air of the villag already makes me feel better." The eldest uttered a cry of delight. "Just like their mother, just like their mother!" said he, as he gazed upon his sons; and, with a sigh, he closed his eyes, and appeared to sleep. The children left the room. Suddenly awakening, he asked:                     THE JEV' AND JEWESS.          23 "Doctor, you are a man of God, and speak the truth. Tell me, have t long to live?"   .  The doctor felt his pulse, examined his face attentively, and hesitated. "Speak!" said Mr. Ecelangfeldt. "You can not live a month, unless "  The doctor again hesitated. "\ Unless what?" asked the other, quickly. "Unless a change takes place within a week." "It is a fearful thing to die!" said Mr. Ecclangfeldt. "To the sinner it is; to the Christian it is not."  "And yet, I am not afraid of death." "Perhaps life has lost its charm " said the doctor, inquiringly. "Yes," was the reply. "But your children, have you no thought of them?" "My children! '" exclaimed the sick man, gazing earnestly around him. "Yes; are they not yours?" "They call nm father," was the) evasive reply.  "But are they not your children " asked the doctor. "Not by lawful marriage." "How?" "Their mother and I were never wedded." The dobtor rose from his chair, and paced rapidly to and fro. "Ay," said the other, "we were never wedded. The mother, my wife, before God, if not before man, was as fair a girl as was ever made by God. Oh! she was a fairy creature, that young mother; and I loved her as man can love but once. But her parents were rich, and H-I was poor. I told Alice of my love. I remember the hour; it was a beauti- ful evening in May. Let poets speak of the beauties of the sky--let them speak of the Angel of Night, how beautiful she is when surrounded by her myriads of bright stars-but they can not describe the evening when I declared my love. We were in the garden, seated in the summer- house. When I declared my love, Alice wept: she told me her father would never consent to our union. I resolved to ask the old man. Whena I entered the'drawlg-room, I saw him seated at the table." "Good-evening, my dear friend,' said he, extending his hand. De- lighted at my reception, I made sure of his consent. In a few words, I informed him that I loved his daughter, and that she loved me in return; and that I had come to ask his consent to our union. The old man heard me in silence; and, as I concluded, he smiled grimly." "'You love my daughter ' he asked. "' I do,' I said. "'And she loves you in return ' "I replied in the affirmative. "'What are you worth? tasked the father, with a grim smile hovering over his features.  "I was startled at the question; but he again demanded, and I told him I was worth nothing. "'When you are worth five hundred thousand dollars,' said the old man, 'return; then, only then, shall you have my daughter.' "I rose from my chair, and walked toward the door.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7084-00000004"/> 24        4 THE JEW AND JEWESS. ' Where are you going?' asked the old man. 'To marry your daughter,' was my reply. "'Without my consent ' "Yes.' "'Perhaps, young man,' said the father, you expect to get my money by marrying my daughter. If so, you are mistaken. You are penni- less; marry her, and she shall never have one cent of my money.' "I left the room. What cared I for money . We fled from the house to the city. I remembered the father's words: 'Marry her, and she shall never have one cent of my money!' When Alice prayed me to marry her, I replied, ' Let us wait!' "A year passed'; and Abner, my eldest son, was born. How I loved to gaze upon his infant form, as he lay in the cradle; how I delighted to hold him in my arms, for hours together; how I delighted to carry him through the crowded streets of the city, and how I delighted to hear the women, when I passed, say, 'What a beautiful child!' "Another year passed. Again was I a father, and of a son, who was, if possible, more lovely than the first.- During all this time, we had heard nothing from Alice's father. One day, I was thrown out of work. For a. week I was unable to find employment, and during that time we were nearly starving. Soon after, I found work; and the third year passed. This year, my wife presented me with another son. At the beginning of the fourth year, I resolved to visit Alice's father, and see whether he w6uld do any thing for me. I did so. The old man received me coldly, spoke of days gone by; but not a word about Alice. When I informed him that he was a grandfather, an almost imperceptible smile passed over his face. He requested me to bring Alice and my three children tohis' house, and said, if I chose to absent myself, they might remain with him as long as Alice wished. Ov'Ejoyed at my success, I returned home. To my entreaties for her to return home immediately, Alice returned no answer. When I asked her if she did not wish to see her father again, I received a reply in the negative: the poor girl did not Wish to leave me. I then grew angry, and H1 struck her." Mr. Ecclangfeldt paused, and covered his face with his hands. "Defer relating the rest until to-morrow," said the doctor. "Let me finish it now," said the sick man. "Yes, I struck her! The poor girl looked at me with such a sorrowful expression that it at once stamped itself upon my heart. I fell upon my knees, and craved pardon for the blow I had given her. She forgave me. The next day, she and my three children went to the old man's house, and I remained in the city. "A month passed; no letter from Alice. Fearing something had hap- pened her, I sent her a line, requesting an answer immediately. One day, as I was walking through a crowded street, I met a friend whom I had not seen for years. We were deighted at meeting each other. He persuaded me to enter a drinking-house, called for a bottle of wine, and while drinking it, we conversed about our boyhood days. My friend was a libertine He made sport of female virtue, and was an atheist. He argued with me about the Bible, and in a few hours gained such an infuence over me that I thought hinrone of the best fellows in the world.   THE JEW AND JEWESS.           25 I told him of my connection with Alice, and asked him if he thought it would be the best for my own interests to marry her. 'No,' was the reply. A short argument followed. My friend was poor, yet he was engaged to be married to the daughter of a millionaire. I might imitate his example. When I returned home I went to bed; but not to sleep. A night long, I lay awake. When morning broke, I sent a letter to Alice, requesting her to return one. I had scarcely dropped it into the post-box when my friend met me. We went to our house. A letter, directed to me, lay upon the table. It was from Alice. She informed me her father had just died, and, by his will, left all his property to some benevolent institution. How I cursed, when I read that letter. My friend grasped my arm: 'Do as I told you, last night,' he said. 'Alice is penniless,; throw her off, and I will introduce you to one of the beauties of the city.' I resolved to do so. In an hour, I had written another letter, informing Alice that I no longer regarded her as my wife. "That day, my friend introduced me to the beauty. What passed between us I need not relate here. I disliked her from the first. In one hour, I left the house, and never entered again. "That night I dreamed of Alice--I dreamed that she was dying! When I awoke, a cold sweat covered my brow, and my lips trembled so that I could not speak. I was afraid to look about the room, and I covered my face with the bed-clothes. Conscience was beginning its work. In vain did I close my eyes, and attempt to sleep: it was impossible. "In the morning, I picked up my things, and resolved to visit Alice, and to ask her forgiveness. I reached the house that same evening. The blinds were closed, and every thing was so quiet that I felt alarmed. I knocked at the door, and it was opened by a servant. "'Where is Alice ' I asked. "' She is dead!' was the reply. "An answer so different from what I expected! My God! it almost maddened me. I ran up stairs to the drawing-room. The undertaker and his assistants were there. At the moment I entered, they were placing the body of my wife in the coffin. I caught a glimpse at those pale features--features that were stamped upon my heart--and then fall, senseless, to the floor." "Horrible, horrible!" said the doctor, shuddering. "Fearful, was it not? But let me conclude. When I recovered, I took my children, and left the house. Everywhere I went, the spirit of Alice seemed to follow. For five years, I have not enjoyed an hour's rest. At length, poor and almost starving, I reached the city of New York. A friend-- a relative, I should say--presented me with two hundred dol- lars. Another friend gave me a letter to you. Doctor, I am here. My tale is finished." For a few minutes, a profound silence reigned throughout the room. "Doctor," said Ecclangfeldt, drawing his hand acroas his brow, 'me- thinks if I could forget the past, I should get better. Have you no medieine which has that virtue " "No, replied the doctor. u Heaven's will be done, then," said Mr. Eoclangfeldt, bowing his head upon his breast  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7084-00000005"/> 26          THE JEW AND JEWESS. CHAPTER    II. "It is concluded:-Banquo, thy soul's flight If it find heaven, must find it out to-night." -SHAKSPEARIE DAYS passed by. Ecclangfeldt rapidly grew worse, and was unable to leave the house. The doctor attended him, both day and night. The three children slept in the garret, and, as they would have been in their fathqr's way, they were sent to the village school. It was only on Sun- day that the father saw them. Poor man! many a sigh broke from him, when he thought how soon they would be parentless. It was a pleasant afternoon in August. Mr. Ecelangfeldt and the doc- tor were seated on the back stoop. The former was in a large chair, with pillows on each side of him. His head hung back; for; during the past few days, he had not been able to hold it up. Near him, was seated Mr. Walker. "And you do not feel any better " asked the latter. "Not in the least," was the reply. For full fifteen minutes, there was a deep silence. "How beautiful does life appear when we are about to die," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt; " and how strange it is that some men so foolishy put an end to their own existence. Methinks I could live forever in this bright world, now that death is so near me. And yet my life has not beer a pleasant one. At one time, I was almost an atheist; but, thanks be to heaven! I saw the wiles of satan, and fled from them." "And how strange it is," said the doctor, " that some men persist in disbelieving in God, and in a future existence. Does not every thing proclaim the existence of God? Do not even the birds sing praises to Him, and does not all nature seem to worship Him " "How pleasant it must be to leave the world with a calm conscience," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt. "Ah! the only great sin I have committed, in not marrying Alice, sinks deep into my soul; and, at this moment, I feel the enormity of it." "If you are truly repentant," said the doctor," God will forgive you." "I know He will," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt. Again there was a long silence. Suddenly, Mr. Ecclangfeldt spoke.       /x "Why did you never maTry " he asked. The doctor sighed. "I have never yet met with one whom I could love enough to make her my wife," was the reply. "When I was young, I was ambitious' and, like most youths, built many castles in the air. I have lived to see them all destroyed." "But what was your ambition?" asked Ecclangfeldt. "To win fame -glorious, undying fame," was the reply. "I might have won it; but I was fickle-minded. Had I stammered, like Demos- thenes; or been a hunchback, like Pope; or lame, like Byron; I might have won it."   THE JEW AND JEWESS.           27 1i   "When I first came here, I was almost a miser," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt. I brought with me two hundred dollars. I shall not have enough left to pay for my coffin." "Do not think of it," said the doctor. "And, my friend, how can I ever reward you for all your kindness to me and my children?" said Ecclangfeldt. "God will reward me," was the reply. Again there was a long silence. "My poor children! what will become of them " asked the sick man "Have you no relatives?" "Only one - a cousin." "What kind of a man is he?" "I do not know." "What kind of a character does he bear " I do not know," was the reply of Mr. Ecclangfeldt. "You do not know!" exclaimed the doctor, in surprise. No; for I never saw him." "Do you think he will take charge of your children " asked the doctor. "I hope so," was the answer. I would that I were able to bring them up myself," said the doctor, "but I am too poor." "And I would not tax your generosity so far as that," said Ecclangfedt. At this moment the door-bell rang. "Excuse me a moment,' said the doctor; and he entered the house. In a moment he returned, bearing in his hand a letter. "A letter for you, Mr. Ecclangfeldt," he said. The contents were simple and brief. They informed him that a relative in Germany had just died, and left him a sum equal to twenty thousand dollars. "It has come too late for me to enjoy it," said Ecclangfeldt; "but, thank God, my children will have it." "Allow me to congratulate you," said the doctor, taking his hand.* "Had you not better go into the house now?" "Yes," replied the sick man. The chair in which Mr. Ecclangfeldt was seated, was so contrived that it could be rolled along the floor. The doctor rolled the chair into the house, and then closed the door. "Were I in your place," he said, as he seated himself, "I should write to- what is your-cousin's name " "Talzingler," replied the sick man. "I should write to, Mr. Talzingler immediately," said the doctor. "But I can not write," said Mr. Eeclangfeldt. "Then I will write for you," said the doctor. "That will do." The doctor moved his patient's chair close to his writing-desk. "What shall I write " be said. "Tell my cousin that I am very ill- dying." "1 have done so." "Tell him about my three children,"  &#xD;<pb n="28-29 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7084-00000006"/> * 28        THE JEW  AND JEWESS. I have done so." "You need not say any thing about the money yet. Tell my consi that I have been unfortunate in life. You need not tell him about mi not being inarried to Alice." "What else?" asked the doctor. "Tell him that I have abjured his religion, and become a Gentile." "Is your cousin a Jew?" asked the doctor. "He is." "What is his profession?" "He is a pawnbroker." "A pawnbroker?" "Yes." "If I were in your place, I would not choose him as the guardian of my chillren," said the doctor. Surely his being a pawnbroker is nothing against, him," said Mr Ecclangfeldt.  'he doctor sighed, but made no reply.  "Tell him that, after much consideration, I appoint him guardian of my three children," said Mr. Ecclangfer. "And of the twenty thousand dollars " "Yes." "Do you intend to divide it equally among the boys:X- "What would you do?"  "Divide it equally among them." Yes, that will be the best." "And when is his control over them to cease " "When Abner is fourteen." "I have finished." "Sign it Claus Ecclangfeldt." The doctor did so. "Now direct it to 'Gustavus Linderhoff Talzingler, Asliville, state o. North Carolina.'" The doctor sealed the letter. "Send for a notary." "You mean a lawyer," said the doctor. "There is but one in the village, and he is almost starving for want of clients. I will send th servant for him;" and rising from his chair he left the room. In half an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall, slim man, very quick in his motions, and with eyes that looked as if unable to gaze e person full in the face. When he spoke, every four or five words were accompanied with an " ah!" and a sudden jerk of the head. "Take a chair," said the doctor. "This is Mr. Swiner, the lawyer of whom I was speaking. Mr. Swiner, Mr. Ecclangfeldt; Mr. Ecclangfeklt Mr. Swiner." "Delighted to make your acquaintance," said Mr. Swiner, with a jern of the head. "Fine weather, this; in fact, I -ah-may say, without the possibility of being contradicted, that it is-ah-delightful weather Don't you think so, Mr. -ah--Walker. But why need I ask. By-the by, I must confess,-ah-Mr. Walker, that the sermon you-ah preached last Sunday was delightful,-ah- I should say sublime."   &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7084-00000007"/> 30         THE JEW AND JEWESS. "I am glad you liked it," said Mr. Walker, impatiently. "Delighted! why, my- ah-dear fellow, I was astonished at hearin such a- ah- sermon-" "Mr. Ecclangfeldt is ready to make his will," said the doctor, thus cut ting short the lawyer's speech.          \ ' And I am-ah -ready," said the lawyer, seating himself. In an hour, the will was finished and signed. Mr. Swiner received hi fee, and bowed himself out of the room. "What a strange man," said Mr, Ecclangfeldt. "He is certainly an original," said the doctor. "Where is the letter?" ' "On its way to Ashville," replied the doctor. In three days the stage-coach stopped at the door. A young mat -whose features betrayed the race from which he had sprung, jumped ou He had scarcely laid his hand onothe door-bell, when the door opened, an the doctor appeared. "What is your name?" "Talzingler," replied the young man. "If I mistake not, this is th residence of Mr. Walker " "It is," replied the doctor, rapidly surveying the other from head t foot. "Walk in; Mr. Ecclangfeldt is up stairs." Is he any better?" asked the young man hurriedly. "We do not expect him to live through the night," was the reply. A look of joy, so rapid that the doctor observed it not, flashed over th young man's features. "Let the apostate die," he muttered. The doctor led the way up the stairs to the sick man's room. Softl opening the door, he requested the young man to enter. The sick ma was lying upon the bed; his face was turned toward the door. As th two men entered, he raised himself on his elbow; but weakness compelle him to fall back. Your cousin, Mr. Ecclangfeldt," he said.  On hearing these words, Mr. E;clangfeldt again raised himself on h elbow, and scrutinized his cousin's features closely. Then, as if satisfieo he again sank back. "Leave us for a short time," he said to the doctor. Mr. Walker immediately left the room. The young man walked up to the bed and took Mr. Ecclangfeldt's ban "Thank heaven you have come in time," said the sick man. "I sha not live through the night. Mark my voice, it grows lower every moment Not so, cousin, you have many happy years before you." "Happy years!" ejaculated the sick man; "happy to you, but not me. You are young; you have not seen life's charms shattered almost their birth." The young man drew up a chair close to the bed and seated himself. "How has life gone with you so far " asked the sick man. "Heaven has been merciful so far," was the reply. "Are you married?" No." "I wish you were."   THE JEW AND J:W S.  "I hope to be, some time." "You will take good care of my children " "I will." "See that they want not. Love them as a father loves his children." "I will." "Do so, and the God of the Gentiles -- The young man started up. "I know no such God!" he exclaimed.  "My God is the God of  Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. To Him only I bow the knee; for in Him only do I believe." "Ah, cousin, I would you were a Gentile, like myself." "Thank heaven I am not," was the reply. "In the Jewish religion was I born; in the Jewish religion will I die." The sick man sighed. "Your religion teaches you that Jesus is yet to come," he said, with a violent cough. "And He has not come yet," said Talzingler. "He has come," said Ecclangfeldt. "Well, well, we 'll have no words about religion, because I see it is impossible to change your view on the subject," said the young man, bit- terly. '"Let me hear what you have to say about the children." For an hour they conversed together. "And you swear to do every thing I bid you?" said the sick man. "Yes," said the other hesitatingly. "Swear it." "I swear by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." "It is enough," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt. "Why have you put the candles out?" "The candles are still burning." "What makes it so dark then " The young man made no reply. "Ah, I see," said Mr. Ecclangfeldt. "Death is near me. I told the doctor I would not live through the night." "Is there any thing else you wish me to do?" "Nothing.  Remember your oath to treat the children kindly-a your own sons. If you break your word, heaven will close its door against you;" and he sank back on the bed. For a few moments a solemn stillness reigned throughout the room. "Shall I summon Mr. Walker " asked Talzingler. There was no reply. The young man drew back the curtains, and as his eyes fell on the sick man's face, he uttered an exclamation of astonishment. Mr. Ecclangfeldt was dead. And thus he died. Born poor, he died worth twenty thousand dollars. Such is life. We taste of the cup of misery early; we die just as the cup of joy is being neared to our lips. When we are rich we have plenty of friends; when we are poor they desert us. The example of Timon of Athens is worthy of being followed. Let us go on with our story.

The death of Mr. Ecclangfeldt had no effect on his cousin. What cared he for the apostate? Nothing. CHAPTER III. Why, thou art lovely: fairer than night's queen, Whose silvery beauty, imaged from the sun, Can not be uttered by the tongue of man.

Bohemian: Soanle. TllE next morning, Mr. Talzingler and the three boys left the doctor's llisei niver to return. In a few days they reached Ashville, in which Mr. T;dzingler residede As has been said before, Mr. Talzingler was a pawnbroer, and unriar- rieod. Let is give a short history of his early life. Ma every one who re:cls this little book take warning by it.  Gustaivus Linderhoff Ta lzingler was born in the city oVienna, Austria, on tHe fourth day of March, in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-four, of Jewish parents. In early life his father had amassed a large fortune, but being suspected of treason against the then reigning sovereign, he was forced to flee with his wife and child to England. The passage was a very stormy one, and several times the ship came near being wrecked. At length they reached England. Mr. Talzingler remained in Liverpool a few years, and then removed to London. \He had hardly made himself comfortable, when his wife was taken sick, and after a few days' illness died. The old man grieved after her so much,that he neglected his business. In three monlths he was forced to go to the poor-house. In three years from the day his wife died, he was laid in the grave, beside her. At the age of twelve, Gustavus was bound 'prentice to a pawn- broker, with the agreement that -ie should remain with him seven years. His master treated him so cruelly, that Gustavus resolved to leave him. Accordingly he visited one of the piers, and engaged a place in the ship Caroline as cabin-boy. In four weeks he stood alone and penniless on one of the piers of the city of New York. One of the passengers pitying his forlorn appearance aind destitution, engaged a place for him on a farm not over ten miles fromi tire city of New York. Although young, Gusta- vus was both smart and expert at any kind of work, and he soon gained               * O               THE JEW AND JEWESS.           38 the good graces of his master and mistress. He remained on the farm two years, and then becoming tired of country life, resolved to visit the city. Both his master and mistress were averse to this project. Finding they would not pay him the money due him, Linderhoff resolved to wait a few months, hbping yet to come to an understanding with them. Three months passed, and the master and mistress, thinking the boy had given up the idea of going to the city, were overjoyed. The boy was useful on the farm, and they found it almost impossible to do without him. One evening when the members of the family were at supper, the boy requested them to pay him what they owed him, as he intended to start for the city the following Monday. On hearing this, the old farmer was greatly en- raged, and swore if the boy left him he would not pay him a single cent of the money due him. The boy heard all in silence. He remained at the farm several weeks, and did not once allude to the subject. One day the farmer sent him to pay a sum of money to a gentleman in the village. At night the boy returned, went to bed, and in the morning when they went to wake him up, they discovered that he was not in his room. That he had fled to New York was evident. That same day, the gentleman to whom Gustavus had been sent to pay the money, appeared, and requested the farmer to pay him the money he had lent him a few weeks before. The farmer was astonished, but he was still more so when the gentleman informed him that the boy had not been to his house at all. The following day an advertisement appeared. in the New York papers. For the edifica- tion of our readers w give it here:  t FIFTY DOLL   RS REWARD I   The above reward will be paid for information that will lead to the arrest of a lad calling himself Gustavua Linderhoff Talzingler. He is of Jewish descent, nearly or about seventeen years of age, good looking, olive conqplexion, dark eyes, bends slightly when he walks, curly hair, and with one of the upper front teeth missing. Apply to JAMES LUNSI, Waddingtown, New York." Two days after the above advertisement appeared in the papers, a youth rang the bell of the door of a dentist's house in Broadway. On being asked what he wanted, he stated that having lost one of his teeth a few days before, he wished 'to have it replaced by another. It was soon furnished him. After paying the dentist his price, the boyaleft the house. As our readers may have already suspected, the boy was Talzingler. On the after- noon of the same day, he purchased a wig, and a new suit of clothes. Thus attired he defied any one to recognize him. Years passed on. The little village of Ashville grew into a town, but it was still without that necessary person, yclept a pawnbroker. One day it was rumored through the town, that a pawnbroker was about to open a shop near the church. People shook their heads and said that he would soon be obliged to leave the place, for he could not make a living there. The next day, three large brass balls, and a sign in the window, informed the passers-by that Mr. Talzingler loaned money on jewelry of different kinds, &amp;c., &amp;c. In a few days, he had what he called a "good run of custom," and he was happy. As Mr. Talzingler had no rival in the place, he was in a fair way of making a fortune Unfortunately, however, he spent his money as fast as he got it. One day his house-keeper died, and Mr. Talzingler looked about  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7084-00000009"/> f             A 34         THE JEW AND JEWES.  him for another. Several females presented themselves for the situation, but the pawnbroker was not satisfied with them. One day as the pawnbroker was standing behind the counter numbering tickets, and placing them on the numerous bundles that lay upon the counter, the door opened, and a young lady of most surpassing beauty entered. Walking up to the counter, she drew out a small bundle, and waited impatiently for the pawnbroker to attend to her. - At the moment she entered, the pawnbroker was leaning over thecounter engaged in pin- ning a paper on a small bundle. On raising his head and seeing the young lady, he uttered an exclamation of astonishment. Well," said the Jew slowly, and speaking in a tone which he strove to make soft and tender, what will you have?" The young lady laid the bundle on the. counter, and opening it, drew out a watch and chain, together with a diamond ring. The Jew was aston ished to see so valuable a diamond in the possession of such a young person; for the young lady was not yet sixteen. "I'want five hundred dollars on these," said the young lady, holding up the watch, chain and ring. The Jew opened the watch, turned it over, and then applied a few drops of nitric acid on the handle and inner side; he done the same to the ring and chain. When he had finished, he gazed the girl full in the face for ,several moments, without speaking. Well!" said the young lady. The Jew sighed, and slowly withdrew his eyes from her face. "Will you give me the money?" said the young lady. Five hundred dollars is a large st81," said the Jew. "To those who are poor, yes; to those who are rich, no," said the young lady, with a smile.  And how do you know I am rich?" asked the Jew. "People or rather report, says so," was the reply. "I can't give five hundred dollars on these," said the Jew. "By father Abraham, I swear I am almost as poor as Job." "So you will not give me the money?" said the young lady with a strange smile. Not five hundred dollars," said the Jew. "The things are worth a thousand." The Jew snatched up the diamond ring, and rushed to the window. The young lady occupied herself in reading the paper in which the things had been wrapped up. Suddenly she started, raised her head, and looked at the sign which hung on the wall, directly in front of the counter. "See!" exclaimed the Jew, coming forward, "there is a flaw in the diamond." "Does that make it any the less valuable " asked the young lady, as she examined the Jew's features attentiv'y. "Father A raham, yes," replied the Jew. u The diamond is worth five hundred dollars," said the young lady; "the settilg is also valuable... The watch is worth three hundred, and the chain two hundred." 'Te Jew seized the watch and chain and rushed to the window. A One of the jewels has fallen out," he said I   THE JEW AND JEWESS.           Q5 uThen you picked it out," said the girl. "I am sure of it, for I saw you." I 'll lend you three hundred dollars on them," said the Jew.  "Five hundred dollars I must hbfve," said the girl. "Take them away; I can't give, so help me father Abraham, more than three hundred dollars." "Then you refuse to lend' me five hundred dollars " "I do." "Bend down your head a moment. I have a few words to whisper in your ears." Much surprised, the Jew bent his head. U One word from me," whispered the girl, " and you will be arrested." "Father Abraham!" exclaimed the Jew. "Arrested for what?" The girl handed him the paper which she had been reachng. The Jew's face turned pale as death, for he saw the advertisement offering fifty dollars reward for his arrest. "I am not the one," said the Jew, suffering the paper to fall to the floor. The young lady pointed to the sign. "There is your name," she said,-"Gustavus Linderhoff Talzingler. You are the person." Will you betray me?" asked the Jew, his breathing growing thick and short, and nervously grasping the barrel of a pistol which he carried in his. pocket. "Not if you pay me the money." The Jew gazed at her attentively. As we have before said, she was beautiful, and to the eves of the young man, she appeared more like an angel from heaven, than a dweller of this earth. A strange feeling came over his heart, a feeling that he had never felt before. Every thing about her showed that she was a member of his race--a Jewes. She was dressed like one moving in the first circle of society. "Enough," he continued, drawing his hand from his pocket,--"Enough, I will pay you the money. Come with me into my office, or rather my private room. You are not afraid, are you?" "Of what should I be afraid?" "Oh, nothing. I merely thought you would not like to have any one see you with me." "I care not whether I am seen here or not," said the young lady. "But come, I am in a hurry." After locking the door of the store, the Jew led the way up the stairs into the room above; this was his " private room." It was magnificently furnished. Large and heavily gilded chandeliers hung from the ceiling; magnificent silk hangings hung from the four walls; marble statues, splen- did paintings, vases of artificial flowers, richly bound books, &amp;c., &amp;c., were strewn around with lavish profusion. On entering the room the young lady uttered a cry of delight. "Take a chair," said the Jew, pointing to a richly carved oak chair that stood near the window; it was one of those old fashioned arm-chairs much used two hundred years ago. The back was carved with two angels, and on each arm was a figure of Venus. The young lady seated herself. "Place your arms on the arms of the chair," said the Jew.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7084-00000010"/> 36         THE JEW AND JEWESS. Scarcely had her arms touched the arms of, the chair, when click, click, went two springs, and two half circles of steel darted round her wrists. She made violent struggles to release herself, but all in vain.; "Ha! ha!" said the Jew, throwing himself into a chair. How do you feel now, my dear? Betray me, will you! we shall see, we shall see;" and he laughed violently. "Come, come, cease this joke, and release me," said the young lady. "Release you, my dear!" exclaimed the Jew, with another laugh. "Cer- tainly, you shall be released in an hour, but it shall be by death." "You dare not kill me." "Don't be too sure of that," said the Jew. "To tell the truth, I hardly know what to do with you." "Decide the question at once, and release me." "Not so fast, not so fast," said the Jew. "If I were to release you, what security would I have that you would not betray me?" a Wo uld it be of any advantage to me to betray you " "Yes." "What?" "The fifty dollars offered for my arrest." "Pshaw! the man who put the advertisement in the paper is no doubt dead by this time." "Perhaps he is, perhaps he is not." "Perhaps," said the young lady, " perhaps you think my father is rich; if so, you are mistaken; but you need not be offended, because you are not the first one that has been taken in with my appearance." "But these jewels." "Were presented to me by the man who employs me." "I do not believe it." "You are too suspecting." "My profession teaches me to suspect every one. Confess, did you not steal these jewels " "Yes." "I thought so," said Talzingler, in a voice of triumph. "Now I hold you in my power. But it has saved your life;" and touching a spring, the irons flew back, and the young girl rose. "Why did optake the jewels?" asked the pawnbroker. "Because am fond of dress, and my wages were not enough to buy me what I wanted." "What is your name " "Fanny Victoria." "Would you not like to add on another name " "If it were Talzingler, yes." The Jew threw himself at her feet. "Ah, Fanny!" he exclaimed, "I knew -" "His speech was interrupted by a loud knock at the store door. "What is that?" he exclaimed, rising to his feet. ' Perhaps one of your customers," said the young lady, a deadly pale- ness overspreading her features. "It must be," said Talzingler. "Fanny, will you bear my name without ,he aid of the priest "   THE JEW AND JEWESS           37 "Yes," said the young lady. Again there came another knock at the door. This time it was greatly prolonged, and the blows were given with such force that they shook the whole building. Both persons gazed at each other with astonishment. "Who can it be?" asked Talzingler. "I- 1 hardly know."   '     "I will throw open the window and see;" and advancing to the window he threw it open. On looking out he saw a number of men with staves in their hands, battering in the door. On seeing him they desisted. Several of the windows of the neighboring houses were thrown open, and curious faces were peeping out. "Who are you?" demanded Talzingler; "and why do you attempt to force open the door of my house?" "Open the door! open the door!" replied several of the men. "Why should I open to you?" exclaimed Talzingler. Because we are officers," was the reply. "In the. name of the law, we command you to open the door." "What if I should refuse " "Then. we must break it open." "But what is your reason for wishing to enter " "To arrest Fanny Victoria." Talzingler turned to Fanny, who sank shrieking into a corner. "My God!" he exclaimed, "they will arrest you - and here In The last two words, " and here," showed the selfishness of his nature. "What slall I do? what shall I do?" cried Fanny. "Will you open the door " cried the officers. Talzingler again leaned out of the window. "The young lady you speak of is not here," he said. "You lie," was the reply. "I swear by father Abraham--"  "We are not speaking of father Abraham now," "Have you ever seen Fanny Victoria?" asked one. "No," was the reply. "How do you know she is young, then " "Did I say she was young?" asked Talzingler. CJust now you called her the young lady." The Jew bit his lips with vexation. "I have heard of her," he said.  "Once more; will you open the door?" "What shall I do " asked the Jew.  "Conceal me somewhere  where, I care not!" "Ah! I have it," said Talzingler. "The secret panel. Good men, wait one moment. How many of you wish to. enter." "You will find out when you open the door." "I must have your answer now," said Talsingler. "There is a good i deal of valuable property lying about the roonm and- "Do you take us for thieves "      "I did not say so. I merely thought that sme of the packages might  accidentally find their way into your pockets."  The officers consulted with each other.           i  &#xD;<pb n="38 (Illustration) -39" xml:id="VAC7084-00000011"/>  THE JEW AND JEWESS.           89 "What is your answer, gentlemen?" asked Talzingler. "Two of us will enter, and the others will remain here." "I will be with you in a moment,' said Talzingler and he closed the window.  Then, turning to Fanny, he reque;ed her to follow him. Opening the door, he descended the stairs, tluing the jewels with him. On reaching the foot of the stairs, he stopped, and touching a spring in the wall, a door flew open.          s "Enter," said the pawnbroker. "Take thes jewels with you. Make not the least noise, for should you be discovered, I am undone;" and as  Fanny entered he closed the door. "Coming, gentlemen," he exclaimed, as a loud knock at the door announced that the officers were impatiently awaiting his appearance; "coming, gentlemen," and walking to the door he unlocked, and then opened it. "So you are here, are you!" said one of the officers. "Well, you were a long tim3 in coming, but 'better late than never.' Pennell, you will come with me. The rest of you remain outside, and if you hear me give the signal, come immediately; mind, don't delay a moment. Now, Mr. What's your name, we are ready to search your place. We will begin  with the store." "With pleasure, gentlemen, but you will only have your trouble for your pains," said Talzingler, rubbing his hands nervously, but smiling all the time. To find the secret door, was next to an impossibility, and some- how the Jew almost gloried in the search. The store was searched. Barrels were overturned, bags emptied, drawers pulled out, the floor examined, the wall sounded, but it was all in vain. They next proceeded to the second floor, and then to the third. "In an hour they descended the stairs. "She is not here, after all," said one of the officers, in a tone of disap- pointment. ' Gentlemen," said the Jew, "perhaps you are fond of wine; if so, you will oblige me by taking a glass;" and placing his hand beneath the counter, he drew out a bottle covered with cobwebs and dust, and three glasses. "Here," said he, filling one of the glasses, and handing it to one of the men; " try this, it will do you good." "Drink it yourself," said the man, with a laugh. Oh, you need not be afraid," said the Jew; "the wine is not poisoned;" and raising the glass, he emptied the contents down his throat. "Try it," he said, filling up the two glasses. What do you think of it?" "Very good," said the two men, holding out their glasses. The Jew again filled their glasses. "By-the-by," he said, " what made you think the girl was here?" "Why, one of the neighbors saw, or thought he saw, her enter," replied the man. "This is very good wine; I never tasted any thing like it before." Bring me ten bottles of the same quality," said the Jew, " and I'U give you a thousand dollars. Of what is the girl accused?" Of stealing a watch chain, and a diamond ring," was the reply.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7084-00000012"/> 40         THE JEW AND JEWESS. "What kind of a looking girl is she?" "It is impossible to describe her." "Is there any one resembling her, with whom I am acquainted " asked the Jew. "There is not another one like her, I don't believe, in the world," was the reply. "She is a beautiful girl, a very beautiful girl." "And yet she is a thief?" "Well, good looks and religion seldom go together," said the officer. 'But we must go now. Many thanks for your wine, Mr. Talzingler." "You are welcome to it," said the Jew; and as the men passed out of the door, he added to himself, " the cursed Gentiles, to think to find any one in my house. Ha, ha, ha!" An hour passed. During that time, the Jew remained behind the counter arranging his things. He was afraid that some of the officers were watching near, and therefore he dared not go near the panel. At length, feeliag assured that no one was watching, he walked to the door in the wall, and opened it. Fanny was sitting in a corner reading. As thee door opened, she raised her head. "Why, what a girl you are!" exclaimed the Jew. "Any other girl would have been scared to death, but you seem to take it quite easy." "May I come out now," asked Fanny. "Not now  4ot now. For all I know, the offcers may return at any moment. Are you hungry?" "Very much so," was the reply. "In about an hour I will bring you in your supper," said Talzingler. "You will have to remain where you are all night, but not alone." Very well," said Fanny. "To-lnorrow," said the Jew, "you shall come out, and I will teach yoi how to fold up the things, and so on." "But the officers will see me." "I intend they shall, if they come near the store." "But they will arrest me." "They will not know you." "How?" "Because you will be so completely disguised, that even your ow - parents would not recognize you," replied the Jew. "But what disguise shall I assume?" "That of an old woman, bent almost double by the weight of years, replied the Jew. "I have a disguise up stairs, left here by an actress that will fitou. Instead of speaking English, you will speak Hebrew. "Thanks, tanks," said the young lady. "In return for all you an doing for me, have but one thing to give you." e And whams -that?" "My love,' she replied, throwing her arms around his neck. And that is all I require," said the Jew. "Is the room furnished t your liking " "Yes." "Adieu!

When they were brought, he carlied them into the secret room, and then proceeded to close up the store. He fastened the door more securely than usual, for, glancing toward the corner, he saw the well-known form of one of the police-men. When the door was fastened, he ascended to the rooms above, and closed all the shutters. Even those of the back part of the house did not escape his natnjion. When every thing was fastened to his liking, he'walked out into the back yard, and unchained a large and savage bull-dog. After le'diig the animal into the house, he again examined all the fastenings, and then touching the spring, he entered the secret room. Morning dawned before he again issued from thence.  w  / CHAPTER IV. "If it were done, when 't is done, then 't wore well It were done quickly.

Several persons with whom. she was intimately acquainted, came in during the day, but not one recog- nized her. Mr. Talzingler called her Judith. In a few weeks, Fanny knew the prices of the different kinds of jewelry and other things left at the store; and very often the pawnbroker left her alone, while he wandered all over the toyn, or paid visits to his many friends. About this time Mr. Talzingler received the letter from his cousin, Mr. Ecclaut     fter consulting with T  he set off for the village of Melville, ana in a few days returned wltn the three boys.

The pawnbroker soon noticed that the teacher was of a very prying disposition, and Abner informed the pawnbroker that he was continually asking him questions. The children were withdrawn from the school, and sent to a boarding-school several miles distant. It was a cold morning in January, eighteen hundred and fifty-four, when the pawnbroker was awakened by a loud cry of fire. He sprang up and darted to the winfow. The red glare on the opposite side of the street :told him that his own house was on fire. Hurriedly awaking Fanny, he opened the door that led to the hall. A large volume of smoke rolled into the room, almost stifling the pawnbroker. He closed the door, and ordered Fanny to disguise herself as usual. Soon the bells began to ring, an  e engines roll up the street. The store door was forced open, but when it was discovered that the store was on fire, no one dared to enter. A. ladder was placed against the window, and Mr. Talzingler and Fanny descended to the ground in safety. They crossed over to the opposite side of the street, and stood watching the burning house. In an hour, it fell in, and thus was the pawnbroker rendered penniless. "Thank heaven you are insured," said Fanny. "Unfortunately, I am not," said the pawnbroker, with an oath. "I intended to have got a policy of insurance made out three days ago, but unfortunately- ah, that word,-I forgot it." "But have you no money?" asked Fanny anxiously. "Not one cent," was the reply. "Ah, my rich dresses," exclaimed Fanny. "Think not of them! but rather think of my misfortunes," exclaimed the pawnbroker. "What shall we do?" "First, let us find a place to sleep to-night," said Fanny. "But what am I to do " exclaimed Talzingler. "The proceeds of ten years lost in a single night; it is too bad!" "We will talk about your affairs to-morrow," said Fanny. "No doubt every thing will turn bright again. Come!" In a few minutes they entered the town hotel, and in an hour they were sleeping soundly. Very early the next morning, the pawnbroker rose and went to his house in hopes of saving a few articles. His hopes were vain, for the fire had destroyed every thing. A number of persons stood about the yet smoking ruins of the house, and as Mr. Talzingler approached, the first question they put to him was - ' For how much were you insured " "Not a farthing," was the reply. "It's a pity," exclaimed several, "I prefer your assistance to your pity," said the pawnbroker. "Will any of you lend me a thousand dollars " The reply was a loud laugh. Mr. Talzingler walked slowly toward the hotel, and as he walked, he considered. "Satan!" he exclaimed, striking his forehead with his fist, "put me in a way to make a thousand dollars, and my soul is yours."   THE JEW AND JEWESS.           43 Hardly had he spoken the words, when the thought entered his mind that Abner and his two brothers were worth twenty thousand dollars. "No! no!" exclaimed the Jew, " that I can not do. The oath to my cousin, every thing prevents it. Besides, even if I wished to take it, I could not, for I can not take the money while the boys are living. If they were to die, the money would belong to me." By this time, the pawnbroker was within a few yards of the hotel. Suddenly he stopped. "I would they were dead! I would they were dead!" he muttered; and again he walked forward.  "Perhaps Fanny has some plan by which I can raise the money," he thought. t' All I want is one thousand dollars; that will set me up again. A thousand dollars I I have often wasted a sum like that in a single week." And as he spoke the last words he entered the hotel. Fanny Victoria was seated in one of the drawing-rooms on the second floor. As Talzingler entered, she rose to her feet, and requested him to take a seat beside her. Hardly had he done so, when the door opened, and a woman entered with a band-box. "Ah, my milliner," exclaimed Fanny, rising. The milliner took off the cover, and held up a splendid bonnet. "What a beautiful bonnet!" exclaimed Fanny, in a voice of admiration. "Do you not admire it, my dear " This was addressed to Talzingler, who made no reply. "Ah, Madame Judith," exclaimed the milliner, "such taste as you possess I never saw before.', "And what do you charge for it?" said Fanny. "Only thirty dollars, and very low at that, too," replied the milliner, turning the bonnet round and round. "Thirty dollars!" exclaimed the pawnbroker, starting to his feet. "Pray, madame, when was that bonnet ordered?" "An hour ago," replied Fanny.  "And I am not worth a cent-" "Hush!" exclaimed Fanny. "Are you not worth twenty thousand dollars?" she added, drawing nearer to Talzingler, and speaking in a low voice, so low that no one but Talzingler heard her. "Twenty thousand dollars! how?" exclaimed Talzingler. "Ah, you plead ignorance," said Fanny. "Come, come, Gustavus, you know you have twenty thousand dollars in the -- Bank." "But that money is not mine," said Talzingler, starting. "It belongs o the three boys." "It is as much yours as theirs." "How mine I " "Have you not had a great deal of trouble with them, and that too without expecting to receive any thing for it " "That may be," said Talzingler; "but I tell you, I can not use that money till after the children are dead." "Then," said Fanny, speaking in a low voice, "then, Talzingler, we will kill them." Talzingler started.  &#xD;<pb n="44 (Illustration) -45" xml:id="VAC7084-00000014"/>   THE JEW AND JEWESS.           45 Murder!" he exclaimed hoarsely; ", and has it come to that?" "Yes," was the reply. "I dare not do it." "Coward! if at the moment your hand should tremble, I will do the deed," said Fanny. "Now what is your answer?" "Send her away, send her away," said Talzingler, pointing to the mil. liner, who was looking out of the window. "But it will look so strange if we do not pay her the money," said Fanny. "But I have not a cent." "Give her a check on the bank then." "I have no money in the bank." "Fool! the boys' money." "I can not touch that." "You forgot the interest; it is due to-day. You can draw out the interest. What per centage do they give " "Six per cent." "Which will make twelve hundred dollars." "Ah, true, true; give me paper." "You will find pen, ink, and paper on the table." Talzingler seated himself and wrote a check for thirty dollars, which hi handed to Fanny, who, in turn, handed it to the milliner. "Make me another exactly like this, only let the color be-what de you think is the best shade?" "Green." "Well, make it green." "I will," said the milliner; and she left the room. Talzingler was occupied in writing out checks. A moment after, the door opened, and a man entered. In his hand, hb carried several small pieces of paper. With a low bow, he advanced to the table, and unrolled the papers. "Well, what is your business with me?" asked Talzingler, looking up. "To settle these little bills," was the reply. "In whose name do you present them?" asked the Jew, in astonishment "In the name of Madame Judith,--that lady there," said the man raisinghis finger and pointing to Fanny. "And what is the amount?" asked Fanny. "Two hundred dollars," replied the man. "Good heavens! Fan-" "Madame Judith, if you please," said Fanny. "This is my jeweles Pay him; two hundred dollars are not much," she whispered. With a sigh the Jew wrote out the checks, and handed them to tl jeweler, who received them with a low bow, and then left the room. "Fanny," said Talzingler, sternly, "inform me at once whether an1 more bills will be presented. Come, be quick." "I do n't know," replied Fanny. "How many bills have you got out?" "Eight hundred dollars." "Eight hundred e        --ious sum." "Not to a man wortm .en n tnouana dollars.":  I  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7084-00000015"/> "         THE JEW AND JEWESS. The Jew covered his face with his hands. "I wish to heaven!" he exclaimed, that there were some mean's of of getting the money out of the bank without going so far as murder." "Can you not make the children sign their names to a check for twenty thousand dollars, and thus get the money?" "When Abner is fourteen, yes." "And not without?" No." "Then we shall have to murder them," said the Jew, in a hoarse"voice, and looking about the room as though afraid that some one might heaz him. "That is the only way," The Jew covered his face with his hands.  "So young," he said. "I dare not do it." "Then I will, if you but consent to the deed." "But how?" "There are many ways; to-morrow the boys may be crossing a bridge; if it should break, and the boys be drowned, the world could not blame you." "Yes, but there is no bridge near here." "' Poison them," said the Jewess. "The poison might be discovered." "Rent a house, lock the children up in a room, and then set fire to the building."   / "Ah, that is t o horrible," exclaimed the Jew. "Methinks their dying shrieks vould ring forever in my qars. No more on the subject now. We might fail, and then the gallows would be our fate." "We cannot fail!" said Fanny. "There are a thousand ways by which we can escape detection. Come, Gustavus, be a man." "Adevil would not perform such a deed as that," said the Jew. "The rery thought makes my blood run cold, and makes me tremble all over." "When shall we speak of it again; to-morrow " "No, no, not to-morrow." "The deed must be done soon, for we are almost out of money." "And had it not been for your fondness of dress, we might be worth welve hundred dollars," said the Jew.  "Pshaw! we are worth twenty thousand now." "Hush!" said the Jew, "here comes somebody  Bend your body ower, and do not forget that you are an old woman. "I have played my part well!" said Fanny. The door opened, and the landlord entered. u Dinner is ready," he said.   THE JEW AND JEWESS.           47 CHAPTER V. "Infirm of purpose I Give me the daggers. The sleeping, and the dead Are but as pictures: 't is the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil." -MAOBETH. THE next morning the three boys arrived from school. They were much surprised to learn of the destruction of the Jew's house by fire. Whenever they came into his presence the Jew felt a heavy load, as it were, come over his heart, but when they were gone it disappeared. Three days afterward, the Jew received a note from a friend who lived on a farm a few miles from Ashyille, requesting him to visit him. After consulting with Fanny, the Jew, Fanny, and the three boys set out for the f-iend's house. In three hours they reached it. The friend was delighted to see them, and requested them to remain several days. This they gladly agreed to; for, as the Jew had nothing to do in the city, he was delighted to remain with the farmer. One day, as Fanny and the Jew were walking out together, the former began talking of the subject which most engrossed her attention. "Well," said she, "have you considered about the twenty thousand dollars " "Ah, that curbed money!" exclaimed the Jew, a cold perspiration covering his brow. "I almost wish my cousin had died poor. If he had, this temptation would not have been placed in my way." "Again I say, be a man," said the Jewess. "Come, what is your final answer?" "I dare not do the deed." "Are you a coward " l y, s., "I thought so." "Yet few men would dare do tne deed." "Because most men are cowards," said Fanny. '"Yet few men would hesitate to take the lives of three brats, when the prize amounts to so much. Only think, Gustavus, twenty thousand dollars! What can we not do with it? The interest would support us comfortably. If you wish, we will retire to the land of your birth, Austria. Then we will live happily together; then we -" "But conscience?" "Conscience! pshaw! What have we to do with conscience? what has conscience to do with us? Gustavus, let us do the deed, It will be over in a moment, and the prize will be ours. What say you?" The Jew made no reply. "Oh, heaven!" he exclaimed; "why did thou permit us to meet " "Come," said Fanny, " dost thou consent to the deed? Think, Gusta- vus - the stake! Do you consent? -speak!" "When shall the deed be done?" "Now - this moment. The children are in yonder woods, gathering nuts. A moment, and it is over"        (  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7084-00000016"/> 48         THE JEW AND JEWESS. "But we nave no weapons." "Here are two daggers;-- I brought them with me, thinking we might have use for them. Here, take one," and she forced one of the daggers into his trembling hand." "Is there no other way?" "None. Come! this way." "Oh, I dare not, I dare not!" cried the Jew. "My soul would be lost forever!" "Give me the dagger!" said Fanny, snatching them from him. "I am not afraid. I will do the deed alone. Coward! remain where you are," and grasping the daggers, she walked toward the woods. Like a bird/fascinated by the rattlesnake, the Jew followed her. In a few moments they reached the wood. The three boys were seated toghther upon the ground, counting the nuts they had found. Ah, little did they suspect the angel of death was so Nnear them. Had they but suspected it, they would have rose to their feet and fled. Here comes Mr. Tatzingler," said Abner, looking up. Hardly had he spoken the words, when Fanny sprang out from behind the tree, and plunged the dagger into his breast. The boy uttered a low groan, and fell back dead. A second more, and Benjamin was lying dead beside him. On seeing the fate of the two brothers, the youngest child sprang to his feet, and rushing toward Talzingler, exclaimed, "Save me! save me!" "Hold him fast!" exclaimed Fanny, rushing toward the place where the two were standing. Greatly alarmed, the boy shrieked, and crouched beneath the Jew's knees. "Stand back, Gustavus," said Fanny, raising the knife. "No, no, Fanny, spare this one, for he is all that is left!" cried the Jew, clasping his hands. "The twenty thousand dollars are ours!" exclaimed Fanny, pulling the boy toward her, and then plunged the dagger to his heart. "Gustavus, it is over now." "DevilI " said the Jew, shaking hi fist. "It was not I that did the deed. I had no hand in it."  "Say what you please," said Fanny; '" but help me to bury the bodies. Quick! quick! before any one approaches." The Jew sunk back on the grass. "Hark, ye coward! if I swing, you shall swing to!" exclaimed Fanny. "Do you hear me"                 \ The Jew rose to his feet. "Yes, yes; the law will look upon me as an acomplice, because I did not attempt to prevent you," he said. "It is over, and -" "The twenty thousand dollars are ours." "What shall we do with the bodies?" "Bury them." "Where " "Here." "But we have no shovel." "I will go to the house after one." "But you are covered with blood."   THE JEW AND JEWESS.   "No one will see me. I shall go behind the wood-house, and get the shovel.. I saw it there an hour ago." / She went for it. In fifteen minutes se returned; her face was very pale. "Where is the shovel?" asked the Jew. "I havenot got it. The farmer and his wife are in the garden, near the wood-house, and I dare not go there." "But these bodies will betray us, unless they are concealed," said the Itow r   jtew.   "Let us cover them with leaves. It is near night: there are plenty of wolves in the forest, and by morning the bodies will be devoured." "But you are covered with blood." "I can wash it off in the brook." "But the family will ask you where the children are." "We are not going there again." "Where then " "To Ashville." "Difficulties are growing upon us," said the Jew. "The family will wonder at our strange disappearance; persons will be sent out to search the forest, and the bodies will be found. My God, my God! why did I not try to prevent the deed. Oh, this is horrible!" "Cease your whining," said Fanny. "It can not be helped now. Come, let us cover up the bodies." They did so. "Now let us leave the place," said Fanny. "In a few hours we will reach our hotel, and then we will change our clothes." In five hours they reached the city. Five minutes after they had left the place, a party of five horsemen came riding up the road; with them were several dogs. They were all dressed in the highest fashion. / "Look at Hector," said one of them, pointing to one of the dogs. "See, he is going toward the woods. Here, Hector, come back." The dog turned his head, uttered a low bark, and kept on. The young men, thinking he might be on the track of a deer, followed the dog. In five minutes they came up to the dog. The animal stood near a tree, scratching among a pile of leaves. Suddenly a bloody hand was exposed to the hunters' view. "My God!" exclaimed one of them, " murder has been done here." The men sprang from their horses, and scraping away the leaves, dis- covered the bodies of the three boys. On searching around they found a pocket-book. Inside was written "Gustavus Linderhoff Talzingler." "Ah, I know that fellow," said one of the men. "His house was burned down a few days ago, and I think I saw these three bovs at his house. Let us go to Ashville and arrest him. If he is not there, we will give a description of his person to the officers." It was midnight when they reached the place. On going to the nearest hbtel, they learned that Talzingler was in iis room. Accordingly they ascended the stairs, and knocked at the door. "Who is there?" exclaimed Talzingler, who, at the moment, was pre- paring for bed.       &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7084-00000017"/> 50         THE JEW AND JEWESS. Fanny turned deadly pale. "Speak," said the Jew: "who's there!" "Open the door," was the reply. "Not till I know what you want," replied Talzingler. "If you do not comply with our request, we will bulst open the door.; "What means that loud knocking?" asked Fanny. "Heaven only knows," was the reply. "Surely they will-" Before the sentence was concluded, the door was forced open, and several men rushed into the room. Several of them surrounded Fanny; the others laid hold of the Jew. "What means this?" asked Talzingler. "You are accused of murdering three boys, whether your sons or not, we can not say," replied one of the men. "I did not do it! I did not Jo- it!" cried the Jew. "Who murdered them then?' asked one of the men. "That woman," replied thjJew, pointing to Fanny. "What!" exclaimed Fan i "Yes, it was her," cried the Jew. "-I tried to preent it, but could not." "Were you in the woods at the time she committed the deed?" asked one of the men. "No!" cried the Jew, eagerly. "Just now, you said you tried to prevent her from killing them," said the man who had first spoken.  "To my mind," said one of the me" both of them committed the deed." "That's my opinion," said another. "And mine! and mine!" cried all. "What shall we do with them?" "Lynch them I Lynch them ". was the loud reply. Where?" "Here." One of the legs of the bedstead was taken off and fastened to the ceiling. Then two ropes with nooses were thrown over, and the nooses thrown about their necks. "Will you not give us time to repent!" asked the Jew. "Did you give them time?" was the reply. U Hoist them up! hoist them up!" cried the men. About a dozen men laid hold of each rope, and in an instant the two persons were swinging in the air. One struggle, a gasp for breath, and all was over.   i-  r   &#xD;</p>
