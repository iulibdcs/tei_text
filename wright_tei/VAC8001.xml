The afternoon. suited my temper, and both were gloomy. Low heavens of clouded steel that yet seemed, 'now and then,. to shiver with the 'still, biting air, and with each shudder, to let down a few wandering flakes of snow; a. bleak landscape of com- mons, blasted by invisible. frost; of sterile hills, that must have been stony and bare in the sunniest spring- time,--,id for a horizon, a girdle of' leafless woods, 'stretching up motionless boughs against the pitiless sky; in the hollow formed by the amphitheatre of hills, an artificial pond-too intensely tame in formn  &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC8001-00000004"/> ni     ,   SALLUTATORY. and surroundings to deserve the name of lake, or be mistaken for aught but what it was, viz., a pool dug and filled with a' single eye to the production of ice for the next summer's use,-this was the picture that greeted my outlooking sight. Within was the dull, icy calm ofL stoical misanthropy; distrust of my fellows, which stubbornly refused to ask of heavenly wisdom the solution of the human enigma that had baffled, in dis- gusting me. Into -the midst of this sunless mood came a surprise. Right before -me, in my steady but aimless track across the waste, was a clump of dwarf trees, poor, puny things that must have had a hard coming-up. I marvelled, in surveying them, that the germs from which they had stirggled had had the courage to sprout in such a bar- ren spot. In the centre of the coppice, head and shoul- ders above his fellows, arose a holly sapling, brave with leaves of glossy green and scarlet berries. The only smile in the drear expanse, it was in itself a whole foun- i tain of cheer. The soil about the trunk might be frozen to stone-lihe hardness, but below, the great heart of Mother Erh pulsed warmly still; throwing up, at each beat, Sap into the hardy frame of her winter-child; v strength to the lusty limbs; verdure to the spiky leaves; blushes to the coral beads. And while I looked, a bevy of brown-coated  plump-breasted snow-birds whirled noisily across the plain, and alighted' with much twit- tering and a ,deal of happy, useless fluttering, among the inviting branches. .., .

As one measure towards the fulflrTqent of the latter, I send this Christmas greeting into the waste we know as the common life of this working-day world. We make it too common, dear reader. We choose for ourselves a path across a dead level, and Ithen perversely adapt our feel- ings to what we are pleased to call our circumstances. I pray you, for this one holiday season, learn with me of my holly-tree. Seek out present brightness, and in it read the promise of happy days to come. Sigh not that -"All hope of Spring-time Has perished with the year," while the same Love that nourishes the tiny greenling of the forest into brightness and beauty, despite wintry blast and wintry sleet, will keep alive in your heart, if not the tender shoots of youthful joys, the stronger, braver, worthier growth of love for your brother man; helpful charity for all things weak and lowly and sor- rowing; hope and faith in the wise and tender Father of us all.

She would have been at a loss to specify what especial grounds she had for the' dis- content that possessed her on this partic- ular night.: If interrogated, she would probably have returned an evasive reply to the effect that it was none of the questioner's business how she felt or looked, so long as she did not obtrude her unhappiness upon   { other people, Everybody had his and her own troubles- with which others had no right to intermeddle. She was responsible to no one for her behavior; nobody should hinder her from  being low-spirited, if she pleased to be so. She was out of humor with' the whole world, herself included.  The children were troublesome; the servants heedless; her husband indif- ferent to her grievances-and it was Christmas eve. "Really," she said, peevishy, at tea-time, ', one would suppose that Christmas came but once in a century,  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8001-00000007"/> 12       NETTIE'S PRAYER. instead of once a year! Everybody is as crazy to- night as if there were never to be anbther 25th of December." "By the way," said her husband, looking up from his paper, "I suppose you have baked some mince- pies and fried some dough-nuts- haven't you?" "I have mince-pies and turkey for to-morrow!" was the curt reply. "I knew you would not be satisfied unless you had as good a dinner as your neighbors. But al for dough-nuts-they are oily, rankr, indiges- tible abominations, fit only for an ostrich's stomach, and one doesn't get the smell of the hot fat out of the house in two weeks after they have been cooked. I never mean to make another while I live." Two pairs of sorrowful eyes stole a glance of mutual pity at one another, when this announcement was made; two pairs of cherry lips took a piteous curl, for a sec- ond; two curly heads bent lower over the plates set before their owners. Not that there was any dearth of sweet things in the Dryden larder, or that Ally and Nettie, the proprietors of the eyes,jlips, and heads aforesaid, were gormandiz- era. But this matter of frying doughnuts was great fun to them, as it is to most other small -people who have ever- been permitted to stand by and see the  ,    NETTIE'S PRAYER.          13 I rings, leaves, birds, circles, triangles, and the endless rvariety; of nondescript figures leave the kneading-board pale, flat surfaces df soft dough, and, upon being thrown B into the bubbling fat, sinking, like leaden shapes, with a tremendous splutter and "fizz," arise slowly and ma- jestically to the top of the caldron, as Mr. Weller has it, "swelling wisibly" before the enraptured eye into pufy, crisp, toothsome morsels, fit, in the estimation of the juvenile artakers thereof, for a queen's luncheon. Last year, the brother and sister had spent Christmas week with an aunt in another town. This lady being the indulgent mamma of half a dozen boys and girls, enjoyed nothing so much as making them merry and happy.   The six days passed in her abode lived in the memory of nephew   and niece as a dream  of Paradis- aical delight. But, this season, the holidays were to be kept at home, and   the, prospect was, to say the least, not eminently flattering. Mr and Mrs. Dryden were estimable people in their way, but they had   studied to render themselves in- tensely and purely matter-of-fact. They prided them- selves secretly upon growing  wiser and more-practical -less poetical-each revolving cycle.  Each year, life assumed   a more positive and less romantic aspect; their own duties seemed more momentous and    imper-  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8001-00000008"/> ^ ; "      NETTIE'S PRBAYBER. ative; the things which others call recreation and inno- cent amusements were puerile and unworthy. Mr. Dry- den was miling money; Mrs. Dryden was a notable housekeeper, and, so far as the physical needs of the children were concerned, a careful mother. Four little ones, three - boys and a girl, claimed her love and maternal offices. Allison, the eldest, was eight years old; Nettie, six; and a pair of twin babies were in' their third winter. .The mother's hands were certainly full, however admirable might be her faculty of accom- plishing with speed the work set for her to do. It was not surprising that she should sometimes wear a haggard, anxious - look, or that, now and then, she should .be, as she now expressed it, "worried out of her senses." "I don't see, for my part," she broke forth, impa- tiently, presently, "how people find time or have the heart to frolic and observe holidays and the like friv- olous carryings-on! With me, it is work, work, work! from morning until night, and from one year's end to another. It frets me to see grown-up men and women, who ought to know something about the cares and solemn responsibilities of life, acting like silly children. What is Christmas. more than any other time-when one takes a sober, common-sense view of the matter?"    NETTIE'S PRAYER. '        16 "That is what nobody does in this age. of nonsense and dissipation," returned her husband. ." I don't know what the world is coming to!" "Wasn't our Saviour born on Christmas-day, Mam- ma?" asked Nettie's timid voice. "That is not certain, by any means, child. And if it were true, there is all the more scandal in making a frolic of it. If there were to be prayer-meetings held all over the world to celebrate the event, it would be far more appropriate." The polysyllable staggered  Nettie ait little, but she retained sufficient courage to reply: "Our teacher told us, last Sabbath, that everybody ought to be very happy upon the Saviour's birthday.' Before Mrs. Dryden could answer, Ally put in his oar. "Mamma!-why doesn't Santa Claus ever come down our chimney?" "There is no such creature, Allison! You are too old to believe in that ridiculous fable." "But, Mamma, he came to Aunt Mary's last year " cried both children, in a breath. "And we all hung up our stockings in the parlor!" added Nettie. "And Aunt Mary let the fire go down on purpose,  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8001-00000009"/> 16 .

"For you know-- /1 .  *i 'His clothes were all. tarnished with ashes and soot!"' quoted Nettie, '" and yet he was in a good humor t and filled all the stockings'- \ "' Then turned with a jerk,      i And lying his finger alongside his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose 1"' chanted Ally. "Oh! what times we had repeating that, after we went to bed that night. 'His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. He .had a broad face and a little round-"' "-You children will be the death of me!" cried Mrs. Dryden, distractedly, putting her hands to her ears. "I shall certainly never let you spend another Christ- mas at your Aint Mary's! Your heads-were so crammed with nonsense last year, that I aW  daraid you will newr get rid of it. Finish your suppers and be off Ae"T   NETTIE'S  PRAYEB.        17 to bed!  You are as Christmas-mad as if you had never been trained to more sensible things!" "I can not imagine," said Mr. Dryden, severely, "how they have contrived to remember the senseless doggerel your sister was so injudicious as to teach them." "That is the depravity of human nature!" sighed the wife. Very sober little faces were uplifted to father and mother for a "good-night"' kiss, and very slow foot- steps went up the stairs to the chamber which the brother and sister shared in common.  There was a pathos in the sound, so unlike was it to the brisk patter of other small feet upon other floors and stair- cases on that jubilee eve. The father, albeit he was not an imaginative man, noticed this, and went off to the parlor with a pained and yearning heartsaddenea, he knew not by what -longing for something he could not name. - The chil- dren had interrupted his evening reading, at supper, by their chatter, and he bestowed himself in his arm- chair by the centre-table, to finish the perusal of his newspaper. His seat was comfortable; the light clear and soft; the evening news interesting; the room still; yet he could not fix his mind upon his occupation. ,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8001-00000010"/> 18       NE T T I  p'BS PAYEBR. Through the quiet apartment came and went the echoes of the four little feet, in slow dejection, going on up to the repose that was to, be visited by no happy dreams of the glories of Christmas morning. He saw, between him and the printed column, the sadly-serious countenances, that were,by this time, laid upon their pillows. He wondered if the pair would cry them- selves to sleep. He purposely waxed angry with his sister-in-law for putting these silly notions into the children's heads. They were contented enough until that unfortunate visit. Now, there was no telling where this Mischief would stop. It was too provoking to have! two such fine natures, soured by repinings and foolish longings; two minds so intelligent filled with superstitious fancies. Yeet they werelfine childrenI if he did say it-and dutiful as handsome and intel- ligent. His wife had an excellent method of discipline, and deserved much credit for her success in training her offspring. She was a good woman--industrious and conscientious-but he could have wished that her spirits were more equable. He did not relish the idea, that his blooming Nettie might, one day, become a toil-womrn, pains-taking wife and mother; her smooth forehead be ploughed in two deep furrows, like those that crossed her mother's, from temple to temple; her   NBTTIE'S   PRAYER.       19 pouting lips grow colorless and drawn down  at the corners; her bird-like voie sharpen into the shrill peevishness of the tones that had ordered the bairns off to bed. He would like to keep life fresh and bright for his darling so long as he could. She would find out, soon enough, what a dry,' dusty, detestable cheat the world was. If he might have his wish, she should be a child always; a merry, laughing, singing fairy, to gladden his old age; a simple-hearted, trust- ing child, in whose love and purity he   could find refreshment, when disheartened by the faithlessness of his fellow-men. She was very fond of him-grave and undemonstrative as he was. With the unerring per- ception of childhood, she had discovered that she was his favorite, and repaid his partiality- in the coin he liked best. The sound of his latch-key in the door was the signal, noon and night, for her to bound down stairs to meet him; to kiss him, and offer, in her pretty, womanly way, to relieve him of his overcoat; to hang up his hat and bring him his slappers. Such nimble feet as hers were!  Blithe, willing little feet, how they twinkled to and fro, to perform  whatever errands he would suffer her to undertake for his com- fort!

Up And down-sad and slow-they wandered; never drowned for a mo- ment, while their monotonous beat was rendered more, mournful by the hurried, ceaseless tramp of pleasure- seekers upon the pavement without. He wished that he had spoken a kindly word to the downcast inno- cents, instead of the silent salute he had vouchsafed to their mutely-offered lips. Perhaps they were not asleep yet! His wife was still with the twins, in the bedroom overhead, for he heard her walking about the floor, preparing, as he knew, to leave them for the night. He could slip up noiselessly to the small cham- ber adjoining, and solace his uneasy spirit by a loving "good-night," that should dry Nettie's eyes, if they were wet, and comfort Ally's disappointed soul, while the partner of his bosom would be none the wiser for it.  Mrs. Dryden did not allow the attendance of a nur- sery-maid to her elder. children in the evening. 'For more than a year they hadundressed themselves and retired to their respective cots, without noise or com- plaint, leaving nothing for mother or servant to d, but to look in, a few minutes later, and eitinguisa the gas. This had been done by Elen, the chamber- maid, before she went down to her own tea; but   NETTIE'S  PRAYER.       21 the moonlight, streaming through the window-curtain, showed to the father, as he stood without the partly- open door, the two white beds in opposite corners of the room, and the forms that ought to have been snugly laid under the blankets. Instead of this, they were raised upon their elbows to a half-sitting pos- ture, and the low hum of their earnest voices arrested the spectator upon the threshold. "I wonder if Papa and Mamma ever were a little boy and girl!" said Master -Ally, in a doleful key. "If they were, I guess they have foigotten how they used to feel. I could have cried right out, to-day, at school, when the boys were all talking about Christ- mas gifts and what they expected to get. You ought to have seen them stare at me when they asked me what I thought I should have, and I said. that we didn't keep Christmas at ourthouse, and that I had never hung up my stockings but once, and that was when I was at my aunt's!   And one boy asked me if my father and mother were dead. Ad - when I said 'No,' another fellow called out, as rude as could be-' I guess they don't care much about you!' I tell you, Nettie, it makes a fellow feel real bad!" "I know it!" said the miniature woman, tenderly. "But, Ally, dear, Papa and Mamma do love us!

Papa works ever so hard to get clothes and food for us, so Mamma says; and Mamnma sews for us, and takes care of us when we are sick, and-and-a great many other kind things." "Maybe so; but. she was awful cross to-night, and scolded like every thing, just for nothing at all, and I am very miserable! Just. hear the .boys shouting out-doors, and the peoplejlaughing and talking, as they go along! It's downright mean in them, when they might know that there isn't to be any Christmas in our house. I wish they would be stilll I wish I was dead!" "Ally, Ally, that is wicked!" expostulated the gentle tones of the sister. PI don't care! where is the sense of living, if a 1 fellow is never to have any fun? Where is the use of being good? If I was the wickedest boy in town, I could not be treated worse than I am now. How I hate this stupid old house When I am a man, and have boys and girls of my own, I mean that. Santa Clams shall come every week and bring them   NETTIE'S PRAYER.         23 -oh, such lots of nice things! and you shall live with me, Nettie, and we will fry doughnuts and have New Year's cake every day!" "Ally!" said Nettie, thoughtfully, "do you suppose there is such a man as Santa Claus? M2amma says there isn't!" "I know there is!" returned the boy, confidently. "But he doesn't come to a house unless the father and mother of the children that live there send him an invitation. One of the big boys told me so, to-day. And good fathers and mothers always tell him what to bring." "I was just thinking," resumed Nettie's liquid treble, "if Our Heavenly Father knew how very badly we wanted to have a Christmas, whether He wouldn't send him to us. Suppose I pray to Him  and tell Him all about it!" "You may try it!" was the conclusion of the embryo skeptic. "But. I don't believe it will do any Igood." In a trice, Nettie had slipped to the flopr, and was fumbling among a heap of clothes laid upon a chair. Mr. Dryden watched her curiously. "Now, Ally!" he heard her say, presently, "Here are the clean stockings that Ellen got out for us to put on to-morrow. Manmma wouldn't like -it if we  &#xD;<pb n="24 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8001-00000013"/> 24       NETTIE'S PRAYER. hung them up ourselves, so I will just lay them on the foot of the bed. If Santa Claus should come, maybe he can pin them up for us." Then, sinking to her knees, she put her hands to- gether and raised her pure face-angelic in the -father's sight- as the moonbeams revealed its expression of meek devotion. "Our Father who art in Heaven! please make us good and happy, and let us have a merry Christmas. If there is any Santa Claus, please let him come to our house to-night, for he has never been here in all our lives, and this makes us very sorry. Bless dear Papa and Mamm'a, and don't let us thinlc hard of them, or say naughty things about them, only because they don't know how little children feel. Amen!" Ally gave a grunt that might mean acquiescence; or doubt, when his sister arose and leaned over to kiss him; but Mr. Dryden could play the eavesdropper no longer. Feeling that he must inevitably discover himself if he remained another minute in his present position, he hurried down-stairs and into the parlor, where he behaved more like a crazy man than the sober, self- possessed head of a staid and decent household.

Going into the hall, he snatched his greatcoat from the rack and put it on--still in desperate haste, pulled his hat over his brows, and rushed into the street. He found himself plunged directly into a rapid, buzz- ing crowd. Every step was .quick and light; every face wore a smile, and the air was full of the pleasant confusion of happy voices. Bless the childrenl how they ran under his feet, and trod upon his toes, and kicked against his heels, and jostled him on the right and on the left!   And not one of them was emapty- handed. Parcels of al sizes, shapes, and descriptions, filled small fingers; were hugged by small arms; laid upon sTnall shoulders and slung upon small backs Brown paper bundles; bundles tied in frailer white paper, which, bursting, showed the wheel of a toy- wagon, or the head of a toy-horse, or the arm of a doll; funnel-shaped bundles, fresh from the hands of the confectioner; bundles, wrapped hastily in news- paper by an economical shopkeeper, or one .whose stock of wrapping material had proved inadequate to  A  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8001-00000015"/> 26       NETTIBE'S PRAYER, the rush of custom; boxes, square, oblong, and many- sided, mimic guns and drums, wih gayly-painted sides, upon whose heads the delighted owners could not re- frain from beating stirring Christmas marches, as they carried them home; here and there a huge hobby- horse, with dilated eye and streaming inane, borne aloft by the stalwart porter of some toy warehouse; these were but a few features in the pageant that streamed past Mr. Dryden-a varied and joyous tor- rent of life. He caught the infection of this atmos- phere of gladness before he had gone a dozen yards. He had come forth with the intention of purchasing something with which to make his children happy; to answer Nettie's prayer so far as lay in his power. Awakened conscience and remorseful affection for those he felt he had wronged, had driven him on to the duty of malring restitution. He soon began to under- stand that there might be enjoyment, active and new, in the task. "4 ow I wish I had brought them with me!" he said to himself, as he felt his features relax into a smile at sight of the general hilarity. "It was hard to send them to bed so early on Christmas eve. But, ,what:-would their mother have said if I had asked her permission to take them out after dark?"   NETTIB'S PRAYER.         27 He stayed his rapid progress, as another query pre- sented itself. What would this very prudent and sedate help-meet say and think of another bold innovation upon established rules, to wit, this expedition and its probable results? How should he meet the stare of mingled astonishment and rebuke that would rest upon his freight of "useless" playthings, upon his return home?  She disapproved of toys, except when great moderation- was displayed in their bestowal. Nettie had but one doll in the world, and, careful as she was of this treasure, her loving arts could not conceal tie ravages of time; said maniMrin having been Aunt Mary's gift to her niece, upon her third birthday. Ally had never owned a hobby-horse.   is mother had a dread of "rough plays."  Our hero was quite aware that on this occasion he was not inclined to modera- tion. He would cheerfully have bought the entire con- tents of any one of the illuminated windows whose splendors drew around them  a swarm   of admiring juveniles, as a hive of honey would tempt hungry bees. The difficulty was to know what would best please the unsuspecting twain at home. "This sort of-thing is not in my line!" he soliloquized. "I suppose there is a difference between girls' and boys'- playthings. I have it!, These people ought to know  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8001-00000016"/> TIE'S PRAYER. their business I  I will state my dilemma, and take whatever they advise." Thus resolving, he entered the largest and most bril- liant toy emporium he-had yet seen, and makin:g his way, with considerable labor, through the throng of eager buyers, presented himself at the counter. Luck- ily, the saleswoman nearest him had just dismissed a customer, and turned to him with an engaging -smile. She looked tired-as well she might, poor thing! hav- ing been on her feet for twelve hours, and hard at work all the time-but it was not in a kind-hearted tradeswoman's nature to be cross on Christmas eve. "What can I show you, sir?" she asked, politely. "That is what you must tell me, madam! I want some toys for my little girl, aged six, and my boy, who is two years older. If you can inform me what will suit them, you will oblige me, and please them." His fluent, pleasant speech amazed himself. Cer- tainly, the witchery of the festal eve was working upon him fast. "Has your daughter a tea or dinner set?" inquired the shop-woman, taking down two wooden boxes; pull- ing back the sliding tops, and rummaging among the shred -paper used for packing the fragile contents. "Here is som thing very handsome."   " Just the thing !" ejaculated the father, upon behold- ing the wee tureen; covered and shallow dishes, gravy- boat, saltcellars, casters, and a dozen plates, white, with a rim of gold; all so graceful in design, so dainty in material, as to elicit his unqualified admiration.   Al- ready he saw, in imagination, Nettie's eyes glisten at sight of them; her deft fingers arranging them--cun- ning little housewife that she was. "Then you don't care for the tea-set ?" making a movement to close the box. " I-don't--know!" hesitatingly. "I suppose she will want to spread a supper and breakfast table, as well as play dinner, won't she ?" " If she has not cups and saucers already, I would certainly recommend you to take these," and the artful tempter made a tea-tray of the lid of the case, setting out the service so attractively, that her inexperienced customer speedily regarded the second array of china as a " must have." "Now, perhaps, you will look at a table !" pursued the woman, leading the way to the back of the store. "We have a novelty in that line-an extension-table," "Of course! how stupid in me not to remember that the ehina would be useless unless she had some- thing upon which to arrange it "  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8001-00000017"/> TIE'S PRAYER. Mr.' Dryden had entered thoroughly -into the spirit of the enterprise, and was highly diverted at .his over- sight,; very grateful to -her who had corrected his blunder. The table was a neat affair, with turned legs and polished top, and constructed, as had been said, upon the extension principle. Mr. Dryden took it-on the spot. "Chairs?" he said, interrogatively. It was now the lady's turn to be ashamed of her forgetfulness. Half a dozen cane-seat chairs were added to the pile, which betokened Mr. Dryden to be a valu- able customer. Then followed a case of knives, a knife- box, and an assortment of silver (?) ware, and both parties came to a momentary halt.      The gentleman recovered himsel-f frst. "Now, a doll-for which she can keep house !" "Wa / finish, porcelain, biscuit, or rubber ?" said the other, glibly. " Dressed, or undressed ?" "Dressed--I suppose, since to-morrow- is so near. As to the rest, I am no judge. But I want the pretti- est doll- in the establishment." His experience in this species of merchandise was so limited that he might well be excused for starting at the wonder lly life-like lady paraded for his inspec tion. Her hair waved in natural ringlets; she rolled    IE'S -PRAYER.        31 her eyes, as the shopwoman moved her to and fro.

"What will toy makers do next?" h-e articulated. "The art of manufacturing dolls is carried to great perfection," quietly replied the woman.  "Did you'say that you would take this, sir?" Take it! what could have bribed him to forego the treat of witnessing Nettie's rapture in the survey of this resplendent and accomplished demoiselle? "We have some very pretty doll-carriages, in which the lady can take the air," was the next attack, and Mr. Dryden fell a willing sacrifice to this new snare. In very compassion for her victim, the woman di- rected his thoughts to the boy's gifts. A .velocipede; a wheelbarrow, with spade, 'rake, and   hoe; a set of jackstraws, for winter evenings; a football and a sled made up the     complement that was to transport the semi-infidel to the seventh heaven of ecstacy, Truth obliges me' to mention that the lavish parent &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8001-00000018"/> 32       E N ETTIRE'S PRAYERe. sustained a slight shock when the obliging saleswoman figured up and presented the amount of his indebt- edness; but he rallied bravely. "Christmas comes but once a year!" he said, man- fully, and paid his bill with a good grace. "You could not purchase the same quantity of hap- piness so cheaply in any other matnner," remarked the bland merchant, oracularly. The tit-bit of wisdom was assuredly not original with her, but it impressed the hearer as a profound and truthful observation one well worth remember- ing, He was getting on very swiftly, indeed, in the acquisition of Christmas lore. "You have but two children, then, sir?" remarked the lady, casually, in handing him his change. 'Bless my life  I forgot the twins i" exclaimed the father, aghast. "But I suppose they are too young to appreciate Christmas presents." " What age?" queried the other, sweetly. "Two and a half." ",My dear sirl they would be disconsolate if they were overlooked   Children understand these matters astonishingly soon." And haying ascertained the sex of the twins, she "                    . '14J   NETTIE'S P-RAYER.         33 selected two rubber balls, and two sets of building blocks for their delectation. "Pur porter will take them  for you," she said, amused at Mr. Dryden's amazed contemplation of the dimensions of the pyramid she constructed of his pur- chases. "Please favor us with your address!" "Really, a little more practice will render me an adept in toy shopping!" thought Mr. Dryden, com- placently, when he was beyond the enchanted ground, the seductions of which had lightened both heart and pocket. "It is not a disagreeable or difficult opera- tion, after all." As he neared his own door on his return, his pockets crammed with conical packages of sugar-plums, nuts} and crystallized fruits, he overtook the porter with his barrow. "Quietly, my man!" he said, inserting his latch-key in the lock with secret trepidation  -of spirit. "It would never do to awaken the children. Or to attract my wife's attention," he added, inly. The porter's load was transferred to the hall so silently that even Mrs. Dryden's cat-like ears did not  hear any bustle. Mr. Dryden sent the man off with a gratuity, and proceeded to dispose of the presents in the following style: the table bestraddled the right  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8001-00000019"/> 34       NETTIES PRAYER, arm, .and upon it were the boxes of crockery, sur- mounted by the chairs; the case of jackstraws and several other light articles. The velocipede was borne in like manner upon the left coat sleeve; then came the wheelbarrow; the boxes of building-blocks, the balls, and on the top, held firmly in its place by Mr. Dry- den's chin, was the doll. In the right hand he carried the sled; in the other Dolly's carriage. This staid, prosaic pater-familias would have made no bad repre- sentation of the patron saint of the anniversary, the suggestion of whose existence. he had scouted, a few hours previously, as he slowly ascended the stairs on tiptoe, his face radiant with arch delight, despite the cowardly feat tugging at his heart-strings, as to the reception in store for him at the hands of his better half. Treading yet more delicately, in passing his sleeping-room, wherein, he had tio doubt, Mrs. Dry- den was soundly reposing, it being ten o'clock, her invariable bedtime, he pushed open' the door of the smaller chamber beyond, and entered.  The gas was burning-not brightly-but it inabled him to see with terrible distinctness the figure that started up in the aisle between the beds and confronted him  with an excited air. It was his wife! Dropping the curtain upon a tableau which the   NETTIE'S PRATYEBR.        35 reader can picture to himself better than I can de, scribe, we will take a step or two backward in our story. "And it's sorry for the children I am, this blessed night!" said Ellen, to the cook, over their dish of tea.

If the maid had been mistaken in her surmise as to the- tears she had seen in-- eyes which were generally dry and bright, there was no doubt as to the   meltig, mood that overtook the mother when she removed the four stockings from the place where Nettie had laid them.   She even pressed them to her lips before fastening the tops of each pair together with a stout pin, and hanging them over the foothoards of the beds. To unpack the bas- ket and undo papers, with as little rustling as was practicable, was her next act.  She paused, when everything was uncovered, to survey her acquisitions. Her expenditures had been on a scale, far less grand than her husband's, but nmaternal tact had guided her in the selection of acceptable gifts.  There were a cooking-stove, Eth its -Apsortment of pans, griddles, and kettles; a wrk-box of satinwood, lined with red velvet, and well stocked; a cradle with a baby-doll asleep under the muslin curtain, for Nbttio.

She had not forgotten the twins, as was evi- denced by a couple of whips; two picture-books, and two tin horses mounted upon wheels; one attached to -an express wagon, the other to a baker's cart. Nor had she disdained to call upon the confectioner. Her conical bundles contained "Christmas mixture;" plain sugar candy; peppermint lozenges and oranges; more wholesome, or, rather, less hurtful sweets than the richer and costly delicacies that had captivated her lord's fancy. Altogether, the sight was a pleasant one, and a satisfactory, if one might judge by the gleam of comfort that overspread the tear-stained Visage. She had just dropped a handful of the " mix- ture" into the foot of Ally's sock, when a soft tap at the door startled her. It was Ellen, and she bore a ,plate, covered with a napkin, in her hand. "If you plaze, mem-Biddy hopes yo   won't be offended, mem-but the children were so disappointed to-day, mem; and when I told her you were going to give them a Christmas, she made so bold as to fry them a few doughnuts.

"I have been a hard, unsympathining- mother!" she thought, sobbingly. "God forgive me this, my sin!" She wiped away the tears, and resumed her tasik. "William  will think I have lost my senses!" she ruminated, cramming an orange into the leg of the tightly-stuffed sock. "But I can't help its if he does!"

"Come, little birds, it is time you were out of your nests!" The cheery, loving voice aroused the sleepers more thoroughly than sterner   accents woild-  have done. The mother was spared the pain of knowing that the novelty of the address made it so efficacious. "Yes, Mamma!t answered Nettie, starting  up in bed. "All right!" responded Ally, and he turned over. Thus it happened that the eyes of both rested sim- ultaneously upon an object in the centre of the apart- ment, and a ringing cry of joy escaped them. s{ Nettie, Santa Claus did come 1" "Ally, don't you know what I prayed for?" They were upon the floor before the words had -left their lips.  The next few minutes were passed in speechless admiration of the miracuilous edifice that had arisen during their hours of unconsciousness.

And flying to the door, her curls streaming back, and her face fairly luminous with delight, she ran directly into her parents' arms. "Christmas shall be an '-institution' in our family, hereafter!" said Mr. Dryden, that night, when the happy childiren had kissed them  "good-night" over and over again.

No! we do not, as a, class, appreciate the dignity- I use the word advisedly-the dignity and privilege of maternity! In this respect, our English sisters are far ahead of us. The Hebrew women, under the The- ocracy, understood it better still, when Rachel pined in her quiet tent for the murmur of baby-voices and the touch of baby-fingers, and Hannah knelt in the court of the temple, to supplicate, with strong crying and tears, that the holy fountains of motherly love within her heart might flow   out upon offspring of her own.  In those days it was the childless wife, and not she who had borne many sons and daughters, who besought that her reproach might be taken away; that she might be accounted worthy to be intrusted with the high duty of rearing children to swell the ranks of theLord's chosen people.

I appeal to mothers-to brave, pious women who fear God and love their husbands -but who have yet never arisen to the perfect realization of the grandeur of the worlk assigned them; never thought of themselves as the architects of the nation's fortunes, the sculptors, whose fair or foul handiwork is to outlast their age; to outlive Time, to remain through all Eternity.

I declare, nevertheless, that if she spoke the truth in this instance, her babies were motherless.

It is only among the ignorant or the reckless that we find total disbelief and utter neglect of the laws which treat of -the intimate and subtle re- lation existing between mother and  child.

Society does not regard a "human boy"-as Mr. Chadband has it--as having arrived at the "interesting Age" until he attains the age of discretion. Young lady cousins, enthusiastic school-girls, or matrons, incited to the examination by thoughts- of their own little ones, occasionally lift the lace curtain and turn down the coverlet; call him an "angel," and remark in rapturous whispers upon his increasing size and. comeliness, and forget all about him by the time they reach the foot of the stairs. Or, an old friend of the family who "dotes upon babies," begs:that the "cherub" may be brought down to the parlor, saying, in pathetic reproach, "To think,: my love, how  seldom I see the darling!f' Really deceived into a belief of the sincerity of her visitor's desire, mamnma sends off an order to nurse; baby is caught up from his crib of ease, thrust into a clean slip, his tender scalp brushed to the right' and left of the line--more or less imaginary--where the down--alias hair--ought to part, until the soft, throbbing spot on the top of his head pulsates faster   A CH1RISTMAS TALK WITH, OTHERS,       59 and harder with pain and fright.

"There! take him, nurse!" says the visitor, hastily. "He does not fancy new acquaintances.    In a year or two, he will be just at the interesting age, and we shall be capital friends. Not a word, my dear!"--to Damma, who stammers an apology. "All young chil- dren behave worst when we want them    to show off their prettiest ways." This may be true, but for my part I don't blame the babies. Most Papas are shy or negligent of their heirs or heiresses at this epoch.

It will never need your gentle handling, your quick eye, more than at present.  A pin misplaced, a sudden wrench of a joint; the twist of the upholding hand, bringing the head-or a limb into contact with table or chair, may lay the foundation of years of pain and disease, if not of incurable deformity. We hear much talk about good and bad babies; how Mrs. Such-an-one always has model children, that give her no trouble at all; but sleep and eat at reg- ular seasons, and never cry when awake, unless they are in pain, while Mrs. So-and-so's existence is a woeful burden with her restless, fretful progeny, who turn day into night, and night into day, and some- times decline having any night at all in the course of the twenty-four hours; who are continually crying to be fed at all manner of inconvenient times; who are, in short, as wrong-headed and peevish brats as one can find in a day's ride.   Yet, Mrs. So-and-so sayfs that they are healthy and hearty, and suffer no pain. "It is just her luck to have cross children. All hers 'are born grabbed." In behalf of the infant tribe I enter a protest against this calumny. Well-bred, healthy, comfortable babies are never cross until they are rendered so, in   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        63 spite of themselves, by misrmanagement.  1 Mrs. So- and-so 'puts her Bobby to sleep where) he is liable to be awakened by the ordinary noises of the household machinery, and, furthermore, when these, or some un- toward accident  as started him   from  the slumber that should have lasted two hours, before one-half of this time has elapsed, if she makes matters worse by taking  him up, instead of quieting all external dis- turbance  and lulling him  again to rest before he knows where he is, or what has happened; if he is fed  just when it suits Mrs. S.'s or  Bridget's con- venience  or Bobby's whim,  at intervals of varying lengths; the probability, I  may say, the certainty is, that Bobby will become   an unreasonable, discontented tyrant, a nuisance to himself and to all around him.

Let there not only be "ad place, for every thing and every thing in its place,?' but a -time for every thing, and let every thing be done in its season. When I see the mis- tress of a family toiling and worried from morning until night, pulled a dozen different ways at once, by as many duties, all of apparently equal importance, driving herself and servants, wearying her husband by incessant complaints, and dragging, rather than bringing up her children,- I wonder not that Amer- ican women break down so early, but at the tenacity of life that enables them to endure their load for a ingle year.

To each of the fast-coming troop she gave a motherly greeting, and, as by magic, brought it, with its wishes and needs, under the influence of the judicious law of order that extended over the rest of her band. She nourished them from her bosom; bathed, dressed, and undressed them, and herself laid them down for the nightly and midday slumber; made most of their clothing with her own hands; as they grew older, directed their studies-she "could not bear to send them from her to school!"Yet she was the ever-patient, ever-cheerful referee in their sports and quarrels; looked well tp the other ways of her household; was a faithful mistress, a good house- keeper, and a kind neighbor, and, withal, managed to keep up with the best literature of the day; and ! when her husband's business hours were over, became hris companion, at home and abroad, with more ease and frequency than any other wife I ever saw. This is no fancy sketch, nor. have I done the original justice. It is not surprising that the offspring of such a woman should rise up and call her blessed; the marvel and disgrace are, that there are not) hundreds and thousands like her, throughout the country.

"As well bury me alive after the first year of mar- ried life!" cries Mrs. A-la-mode. "I, with my edu- cation and accomplishments, may surely aspire to a higher position than that of nursery-maid! I consider that I serve my children more effectually by reserv- ing my strength and cultivating my talents against such time as their maturer minds shall require my companionship." In other words, Mrs. A-la-mode leaves it to hired menials to worl, irrigate, and plant the virgin soil, and expects, in the ripening of the harvest, to put in her patent sickle-latest style-and gather such grain as she shall then decree.

Eternity can only tell-who has not learned, frol ex- perience, the fullness and sweetness of that simple line," As one whom his mother comforteth." Never let your child have his cry out alone. If he is old enough to observe that yours is studied neglect, he has also sense sufficient to enable him to put his own construction upon what is, to him, your cruel indifference to his suffering; and just in proportion as he recognizes and resents this, your influence over him is weakened; his faith in your love shaken. If he- is too young to guess why you disregard his outcry, terror and pain lay hold of his spirit, as is evinced by the changed tone of his lamentation.

A mother--a good woman, but a trifle too strong of will, and wedded to a pet theory of, family govern-  ment, according to which, children were but machines,  to be subject in every particular to the authority of the chief engineer-one evening laid her babe, about ten months old, in his crib, for the night.

"You will excuse me, at any rate, from    staying here to see the battle out!" and the uncle left the room. Returning, at the end of an hour, he found the child still screaming-now, in an anguished shriek that rent the man's heart.   The woman and mother sat still and sewed steadily-it seemed,calmly.

This I attribute directly to a terrible fright I had when but four and a half years old. My nurse, a young colored girl-a genuine Topsey, by the way-had early instructed me in the popular belief concerning the personal appearance of His Satanic Majesty, and I had swallowed every word, until his horns, cloven hoof, forked tail, fiery breath, and worst of all, a certain three-pronged fork he was lin the habit of carrying   about with him, that he ,might impale unwary sinners, as Indians spear salmon-  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8001-00000039"/> 74  A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. were articles of as firm faith with me as was the fact of my own existence. He had an inconvenient prac- tice of careering through mid-air-Topsey had added -with this trident already poised, on the lookout for bad little girls, who were supposed to be dainty tid-  bits in his estimation. One day, I was walking in the garden, unconscious of coming ill, when, chanc- ing to look up, I saw, righ. above me, a small, dark cloud, irregular in' outline, and moving swiftly before a strong wind. My first glance caught only this; my second traced, with the rapidity of lightning, the head, the tail, the lower limbs, and, brandishing wildly in air, the right arm, holding the fatal flesh-fork! St. Dunutan or Luther would have stood his ground, as did Christian against Apollyon, but I had not the pluck of these worthies, and had I been endowed with the spirit of all 'three, there were neither tongs, ink- stand, nor two-edged sword handy. So I chose the wiser part of valor, and ran, in frenzied haste, for the house, never stopping until I was safely ensconced under my mother's bed. Here I lay for a long time, quaking with fear, queer shivers running down my spine at thought of the sharp points I had so nar- rowly escaped. Then the supper-bell rang, and I crept out, unperceived. I had no appetite, and must   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS;        75 have worn a strange, scared look, for my-mother asked if I were sick  I answered, ' No," very shame-facedly, and she did not-press her inquiries Children are not apt to be very communicative as to any great fright, except in the excitement of the first alarm. They fear to live it over in the recital. That night, for the first time in my life, I cried to have the lamp left burning in the chamber where I slept. My mother reasoned with me, for a while, tell- ing me that the angels watched over good children, etc. This I did not doubt, but I was by no means sure that I was a good child. The--apparition of the afternoon was frightful circumstantial evidenceto the contrary. At last she scolded me for my cowardice and went away, taking the precious light with her. I wonder that my hair did not turn- white during the ensuing hours of thick darkness. I pity myself now, as I remember the poor, frightened baby, lying trembling on her little bed, and staring into the gloom, peopled by her imagination with horrors. Driven to desperation, I once awoke my older sister, who shared my couch, and, in an awe-stricken whisper, imparted my fears and their origin. She was not credulous or imaginative, and, perhaps, did not quite understand what I said, for her only answer was- "pshaw!" and   &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8001-00000040"/> 76  A CHERISTIAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. she was sound asleep again in a second. How and when slumber came to me I knew not, but my mother reproved me, next morning, for wrapping the coverlet so tightly about my head, saying that I would be smothered some night, if I continued the practice.  Three sentences from eitherof my parents would have laid the hobgoblin to rest forever, and I recol- leet that I did, several timesl essay to broach the subject to my mother, very unskillfully, I dare say, for she did not encourage my preliminary remarks, and resolution failed me before I reached the point. I was a tall girl of fourteen when I confessed to her that, for five or six years, I believed that I had really seen the devil! Lastly-for my rambling "talk" has already trans- cended the limits, I at first assigned to it-Babies have a right to be babies. That precocious and unnatural growth of prudence, propriety, and learning in young children, which is variously described as "old-fashioned," 1"smart," and "wearing a gray head upon green shoulders," is some- times an offensive, always a pitiable sight. A life without childhood is like an arid summer day, to which the dew of morning has been denied.  There e blossoms which the heat of incipient decay has  \     A CHRISTMAS TALK- WITT   H MOTHERS.

Happy is she- who has never had reason to tremble at sight of this early and.'brilliant bloom; -who has not wept unavailing-- tears over the pale blossom, as it lay, crushed and faded, at the grave's mouth! Well is it then for the bereaved mother's peace of mind if she can, in the review of the brief years during which the gifted one was lent to her, comfort herself with the thought that she strove, in patient, far-seeing love, to repress, rather than stimulate, the unhealthy growth of intel- lectual powers that were in danger of outstripping physical vigor; that 'she rose superior to the-vulgar ambition to have her child excel all others of his age in scholarship and showy accomplishments.  Ah I it is not until the golden locks are hidden by the green sod, and the busy brain forever still, that, recalling  the deep sayings and vivid thought-flashes that made us look upon our noble boy with such triumphant affection, we measure the short mound with tear- blinded eyes, and say: 'c We  should  have -known, from the first, that all our bright dreams for him were to suffer rude, terrible awakening hoeel  When we should have looked for the blade only,-the bud *     *  &#xD;<pb n="78 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8001-00000041"/> 78  A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MO T.HERS. appeared and the flowers. The ruit could onlyripen in heaven!" Do not seek to make of your children monstrous, uncomely, infant phenomena. If, by some special inter- position of preserving mercy, their lives and health do not fall a sacrifice to your weak vanity, you will discover, when your prodigy has completed his course of book-study, that he is not one whit better fitted for the actual fight with life and labor than is the fellow-student who used to run wild, with torn hat, trousers out-at the knees, rough fists, chapped by wind and weather, and pockets frightfully distended by a miscellaneous collection of unripe apples, jack-stones, peanuts, top-cord, "taffey," whistles, gingerbread, pocket- knife, hard-boiled eggs, iron nails, of assorted sizes, and, perhaps, a liying specimen or two, in the shape of a spotted terrapin or a June-bug, with a string tied to its leg; the while your Pindar Augustus, in. white linen pants and cheeks to match, sat in learned abstraction from all mean and common things, his spine curved, and his baby-brows knit over his Homer or Euclid. It is distressing, yet instructive, to see how the mill of every-day life grinds down college geniuses into very ordinary men; how the oft-quoted logic of events proves the "bright particular star" of  &#xD;<pb n="-79" xml:id="VAC8001-00000042"/>   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        79 -the family circle and the school-room to be, after all, a luminary of, at best, the fourth or fifth magnitude. You gain nothing except mortification and disappoint- ment, by cheating your wonderful scion out of his childhood. I am afraid that most of us, even those who have not fallen into the gravely absurd error just referred to, are yet apt to expect too much of our bairns. They may be marvels of sweetness, and sprightliness, and filial devotion, but they are only babies after all. "Children should be seen  not heard!" is often re- peated by us in thoughtlessness or ignorance of the real character of the maxim. It is illiberal and cruel, and belongs to the age when a father held almost unlirnited power over the very life of his child; when the younger members of the household never dared to sit down in the presence of their parents, without their express and gracious permission. I agree that a pert, loud-tongued child is an offence, at all times, but do not let us, on this account, condemn to silence the bird-like voices that make sweetest music in our hearts and homes. Even birds sing sometimes when we would rather they should refrain; so let us be forbearing with the clamor of the babies.

"Father!" says a bright-eyed boy, as his parent enters the house at evening, " did you remember to get me the ball you promised?" "I did not, Tom. You. shall certainly have it to- morroW." Tom goes off, in apparent content. In reality, he l  sorely disappointed; but he is a good child, and does not wish to make his father unhappy.   The promise for to-morrow helps him to bear the trial tolerably well. ' The next evening, he is more backs- ward about asking. He hangs around his parent's chair for, some time, in hopeful suspense, but as the longed-for plaything does not appear, he ventures timidly upon a diplomatic "feeler"- "  "- ather, maybe  you' ve. forgot your promise, again?" The father has had a harassing -day-filled with carding card-and the smouldering temper needs but a spark to linluence it. "Boyl" he ays, hastily, "if you ever say 'ball' to me again, you shall not have it at all! I will not be teased out of my life about your jimcracks!" Tom shrinks back, as if he had been struck in the   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        81 face; creeps silently off to his little room, and there, in solitude, cries as if his heart would break. He has had a blow. It is not so much the loss of the toy, but his is a sensitive nature, and his father's words were sharp swords. He meant to be very good, very patient. Nothing was further from his thoughts Than to annoy his usually kind   parent. Mingling with, and embittering hiis grief, is a burning sense of in- justice. He knows that the injury was undeserved. "Father wouldn't have talked so to a grown manI It's just because rIm a poor little boy, and can't help myself!" I fear there is too much truth in this shrewd con- elusion of Tom's. We would not dare insult those of our own   age, as we do our children. "That boy is growing   sulky!" growls the father. "Did you see how glum he looked because I forgot a  paltry plaything? I must take him in hand!" Then is the time for you, the mother of the wronged child, to speak up  boldly in his behalf.  Represent kindly, but candidly, to your irritated lord, the true value of the promised gift to the boy, and the great- ness of the disappointment. "And after all, Papa, we  can not expect Tom  to exercise much self-control or self-denial yet.

There are times and circumstances in which it is very hard to remember that "babies will be babies." Bessy, and Kitty, and Freddy are playing in the nurs- ery adjoining your bedroom, where you lie in the agonies of "on of your headaches." Every not-very- strong mother knows just, what that means.  You have told the-little ones that you are in great pain, and having provided them with books, blocks, slates, and the like "sitting-still plays," as Bessie calls them, and begging them to try and be quiet for half an hour, have withdrawn to your darkened retreat. They are loving, well-mearning children, and, for almost ten minutes, there is a refreshing season of calm. You are just forgetting torture in a soothing slumber, when, thump! bang I down comes the castle, the   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.       83 erection of which has kept Freddy still thus long. He would not be a boy if he did not hurrah at the crash; the girls laugh and clap their hands; and uproar is shortly the order of the hour. Don't spring from your bed, and, confronting them with your pale face and bloodshot eyes, accuse them of disobedience and want of affection for you. They love you very dearly, and they "did mean to mind," they will tell you penitently, "but they just forgot!" It is baby-nature. to be forgetful, and I am glad that it is. The injuries, and slights, and wounded feeling of maturer years are enough to make of mem- ory a whip of scorpions. I am thankful that, with the child, a kiss, a smile, a kind word will-efface the recollection of the hasty reproof, the- cross look, or -I blush for human nature   as illustrated in some women while I write it!-the    impatient blow  that has wrung blood from  the tender little heart. Thank Heaven that babies have short memories I so short that the suffering of cutting one tooth is clean-for- gotten before the next saws its jagged edge through the swollen gum.

The dew-drop must exhale; by and by, but it lingers longest in the bosom of the flower that folds its Hetals most jealously and fondly above it. . The virgin purity of the snow must change, with dust and mel ng, into the hue of the earth beneath; but it is a woeful sight. We would fain delay the process by every means in our power.  Above all, let us make it our prayer that we may never forget that we were once children, and how we felt, reasoned, and acted then. Who of us doers not treasure in her casket of remem- brance certain 'golden days or hours that we would not lose for' the wealth of a kingdom? Your daughter leans against your knee, as, my little five-year old does on mine, with "e Mamma,' please tell me a story about when you were a little girl; how glad you were when your Papa brought you home a new doll, with blue' eyes and curling hair, in place of the one the dogs tore up; or about the grand holidays you used to have in the woods; or  ow your Papa once took you to slide on the ice-pond-and O, Mamma! do tell me about all the Christmases you ever had!" All the Christmases I ever had! I wish I could remember them, every one-for those I do recall are strung upon my memory like pearls upon a silken   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        85 cord, and each is a joy forever.

I was soon told that the obnoxious article was placed there "in fun," by a visitor in the family. I should like to see the visitor who should dsare to practice  such a piece of "fun" upon one of my children! Never deny the babies their Christmas! It is the shining  seal set upon a year, of happiness. If the preparations for it-the delicious mystery with which ' these are invested; the solemn  parade of clean, whole stockings in the chimney corner; or the tree, decked in secret, to be   revealed in glad pomp upon the festal day-if these and many    other features of the anniversary are tedious or contemptible in your sight, you are an   object of pity; but do not defraud your children of joys which are their right, merely because you have  never tasted them.

Some latter-day zealots, more puritanical than wise, have felt themselves called upon, in schools, and before other Juvenile audiences, to deny the claims of the patron of merry Christmas to popular love and gratitude. Theirs is a thankless office; both parents and children feeling themselves to be aggrieved by the gratuitous disclosure, and this is as it should be. If it be wicked to encourage such a delusion in infant minds, it must be a transgression that leans very far indeed to virtues side.
