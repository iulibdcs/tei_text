            <head>MY DEAR FRIEND,—</head>
            <p>Accompanying this you will receive a volume from which you may derive some interest,
               from the fact that the author is no other than the companion of your childhood, and
               the playmate of days long gone by. The announcement may perhaps surprise you, and set
               you to wondering what in the world could have put it into my head to turn authoress
               at this late day. I would tell you if I could; but the same question sometimes comes
               into my own mind, and I am as puzzled as yourself for an answer. Perhaps it was
               because I have lately been so much alone, having given my third and last daughter in
               marriage last winter, as you know, and feeling afterward desirous to find some
               occupation in which I could forget my loneliness.</p>
            <p>Ever since I left that kind home where I was so warmly cherished—that home made so
               dear by countless and continual deeds of love, still blessed by the presence of your
               beloved mother, and over which your father's emancipated spirit seems yet to
               linger—my heart turns with affectionate warmth to the associations connected with its
               memory. Once more I see your father, with his broad-brimmed hat, his straight collar,
               his benevolent smile, and the moral lesson<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6366-00000004"/> son
               in his very aspect; your mother, with her quiet air, and watchful kindness, and her
               neat starched handkerchief pinned so precisely in its place, while the little
               ones—yourself among them—are gathered around her in their neat though plain attire.
               Thus your family circle appeared on the evening when my uncle brought me to your
               home, and never shall I forget the awe with which I regarded your parents until your
               dear mother pressed me fondly in her arms, and in her kindest tones bade me welcome.
               And how surprised I was to find, in those demure-looking children, playmates as fond
               of fun and mischief as my heart could desire! Well, my dear Kitty, those days are
               gone, but the memory of them is bright yet, and affords me many hours of pleasant
               contemplation. Even now it is leading me away from my subject and almost deluding me
               into the belief that I am once more young.</p>
            <p>It has often pained me to find how little is know of your sect in what you would call
               "the world." Persons of extensive information, writers, and even clergymen, are in
               many instances ignorant of their real doctrines, and know the Quaker only by his
               peculiarities. No doubt you have noticed that a Quaker <emph>in a book</emph> is made
               to perform some ridiculous part which a sensible member of the sect in real life,
               would disdain to perpetrate. However, it must be confessed that their peculiarities
               are such as in a measure excuse this mistake; for, keeping within themselves as they
               do, little opportunity is afforded others of an insight into their true character.
               Not much can be known of their religious belief, because they subscribe to no written
               creed, and teach no set form of doctrine, and this allows to their ministers (and
               indeed to any member of the Society) a freedom which constantly subjects them to much
               unmerited obloquy.</p>
            <p>It is seldom remembered that many of their peculiarities belonged equally to the
               Puritans, who discarded certain practices merely because they were adopted by the
               Quakers—as for instance, calling the months and days of the week by numbers rather
               than by names derived from those of heathen deities.</p>
            <p>My gay little friend, Mrs. Bonton, was highly amused, the other day, when I told her
               that the Friends' style of dress was once the fashion.</p>
            <p>It would be useless for me to enter upon any attempted description, or if you will,
               defense of the Quakers. Their principles are such as belong to practical religion
               every where, and will never cease to exist, while many of their peculiarities must
               disappear before the spirit of enlightened progress.</p>
            <p>And now, my friend, there is one request I would make of you, which is, that you will
               not betray me as the author of this little volume. To tell the truth, I have no
               ambition to figure in such a character. Indeed I have only been masquerading a
               little, and shall now retire into my former domestic habits. You would appreciate my
               feelings if you had been here a month ago, when the book was finished and an
               investigation into the condition of household matters<pb n="8-9"
                  xml:id="VAC6366-00000005"/> ters commenced. My best blankets were moth-eaten,
               carpets ditto, table and bed linen stolen, silver spoons missing, the preserve-closet
               a sea of ferment—ants in the sugar barrels, and many such grievances. I was terribly
               mortified, and forthwith began to introduce a reform. My maids all left in high
               dudgeon, because I presumed, as Bridget expressed it, "to interfere wid the
               housekapin." That, however, was soon remedied, and I started afresh with new and
               consequently willing hands, and a determination that if I were ever tempted to begin
               another book it should be with <emph>one</emph> eye, at least, where it ought to be,
               namely, at home. (Methinks I hear some <emph>curious</emph> reader exclaim, "What a
               pity the authoress did not keep them <emph>both</emph> there, instead of using them
               in writing this present volume!")</p>
            <p>With your good mother's permission, I dedicate this book to her in token of my
               gratitude for the kindness she has shown me from childhood upward.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>THE sun of an October day arose clear and bright upon the town of Boston. The calm
                  waters of its placid bay beamed with the crimson glow of early morning, then
                  gradually paling into purer light, they mirrored forth the brightness of a Sabbath
                  day.</p>
               <p>The town itself, built close upon the water's edge, gave but few signs that it
                  contained a living population. No idlers gazed through the small diamond-shaped
                  panes of the square windows, no busy feet hurried along the unpaved walk, no merry
                  laugh of childhood, no sounds of daily toil or daily life issued from those
                  unpretending dwellings. The solemn silence of the wilderness seemed to pervade the
                  place, as though subduing by its mystic spell all human passion, and bearing
                  upward in its viewless wings, in noiseless harmony, the praise of man and
                  nature.</p>
               <p>The day, however, had not far advanced when the<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000006"/> deep roll of a drum was heard sounding from the
                  heart of the town, and floating far away over the bosom of the waters. And forth
                  at its call came from each domicile the family group, which with slow and seemly
                  tread, wended its way unto the house of God. And now the voice of prayer and
                  praise ascends, and the forest wilds give back their echos to the untrodden hills,
                  whose breezes waft the exulting strain to heaven.</p>
               <p>In a small one-story house in the suburb of the town were gathered a few of that
                  despised and persecuted sect called Quakers, who had assembled there to worship
                  God in their own peculiar way. The apartment which contained them was quite bare
                  of furniture, not boasting of even so much as a solitary chair, but seats arranged
                  with rough planks, laid upon upright logs, were placed along the walls, and seated
                  upon these, on either side of the apartment, were the male and female worshipers
                  of this humble sanctuary. So fixed and motionless were their attitudes, so
                  passionless each downcast visage, that a spectator would almost have deemed he
                  gazed not upon living forms, but on quaint figures carved in wood or stone. Their
                  voice ascended not in prayer or praise, the language of instruction from human
                  lips fell not upon their ear, but who shall say that in that solemn silence the
                  words of a higher teaching came not with a realizing sense unto their soul—"Be
                  still, and know that I am God."</p>
               <p>They had not stolen secretly to that lonely spot, but they sought the quiet of the
                  place that their hour of sacred stillness might not be profaned by the idle stare
                  or jeer of passers-by; and as they sat there in their placid silence, they seemed
                  borne above the knowledge that they were a people persecuted and proscribed.</p>
               <p>Yet there was something in each face, though immovable, that told a tale of strife
                  and hardship. It was of that internal strife—that subduing of the mind to the
                  will—that subjection of the feelings which holds in check their ready flow; and
                  there too were written the sterner lines that the conflict between man and man
                  marks upon the human countenance. With the women, this expression had softened
                  into more of sadness, taking the hue of her tenderer nature: as if with the
                  sterner sex these characters had been graven upon stone, and with the other molded
                  on the more yielding wax.</p>
               <p>Thus they sat until the period allotted to their meditation had expired, then
                  turning to each other, each extended his right hand and grasped his neighbor's
                  with a friendly pressure. There was a deep sympathy between them, which gave a
                  solemn meaning to the action. It was as if they then and there sealed a contract
                  of fidelity to their God and to each other, which each heart felt although no
                  tongue had spoken it.</p>
               <p>Among the different groups which left that lonely dwelling was one of an elderly
                  man and a maiden in the bloom of youthful beauty.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6366-00000007"/>
               <p>The two walked on for a while in silence, avoiding the thoroughfares, and pursuing
                  a retired path, where they were not liable to meet the gaze of the idler or
                  encounter the malignant frown of their religious foes. Had John Morrison been
                  alone, he would probably, in that spirit of self-sacrifice, not unmingled with the
                  defiant mood, which often characterizes those who are ready to suffer martyrdom
                  gladly in a holy cause, have firmly trod the public way, regardless of the
                  consequences of his temerity. But watchful of his daughter's safety, he ever
                  avoided exposing her to unnecessary notice. And well might he seek to shield such
                  beauty from the public eye, for as she now walked beside him she was indeed
                  beautiful, despite the homely fashion of her Quaker garb, which discards the aid
                  that dress can offer to render the face and the person attractive.</p>
               <p>"We are still greatly favored, my daughter, in being permitted to enjoy these
                  seasons of peaceful meditation. But it is believed that we are about to be
                  deprived of the privilege."</p>
               <p>"My father, I long for some quiet place to which we might retire, where I could
                  see thee living, without fear of molestation, in the enjoyment of spiritual
                  freedom."</p>
               <p>"There may be such places as thou speakest of, but thinkest thou that it were meet
                  to leave our labors here unperformed to go in quest of that freedom, which
                  methinks thou dost value too highly, when thou canst set it in the way of
                  duty?"</p>
               <p>"It is for thy sake I covet it, for it grieves me much to see thy old age made
                  unhappy."</p>
               <p>"Edith, thy speech is without wisdom. My peace it is not in man's power to take or
                  to bestow. I must do my Master's bidding, even though mine errand offend. But
                  thou, my child must go hence; I have provided for thee the means of safety and
                  shelter from the storm that threatens our people."</p>
               <p>"Father, I will enjoy no safety in which thou dost not share. Think not of me,
                  therefore, unless, indeed, thou wilt prize thine own security for my sake."</p>
               <p>"No, Edith. Dear as thou art to me I must not, through anxiety for thee, be led
                  from my high commission; for doth not our Master himself say, 'He that loveth wife
                  or children more than me is not worthy of me!' To us it is given to lift up the
                  voice against the oppressor and the hireling, and we will be faithful to our
                  trust. But hast thou heard that, by the voice of these men's council, we are
                  banished hence on penalty of death?"</p>
               <p>"Then, surely, thou hast no thought of remaining here? Oh! my father, let us
                  hasten from this wicked place. Thou and the few of thy people who are here can do
                  naught to oppose these cruel rulers. Why, then, should ye stay to become their
                  victims? There are other places where thy voice may be raised in support of thy
                  religion. Wherefore sacrifice thy life in a useless contest?"</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6366-00000008"/>
               <p>"Say no more, Edith. Thy words too plainly show that thou understandest not our
                  divine office. <emph>This</emph> is the spot to which we are sent to proclaim the
                  truth to a stiff-necked generation. Use no more persuasions to make thy father a
                  recreant to his duty. Here I remain; but thou—"</p>
               <p>"Name it not; I will never leave thee. Let thy fate be mine, for I will stay with
                  thee, and where thou diest I will die."</p>
               <p>"Would thou couldst also say, 'Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.'
                  But, alas! my child is ranked among the enemies of my religion. It is a bitter cup
                  which a daughter's hand doth proffer me."</p>
               <p>"No, father; I do not rank myself among those who are enemies to thy religion; nor
                  should it grieve thee that my mother's faith is mine, since thine own lips taught
                  it me long ago. I will go with thee even unto death, but never, no never will I
                  profess their blood-stained faith."</p>
               <p>"Thou speakest in too violent a tone; thy words are not in the meek spirit of
                  humility. A more submissive condition of mind better fitteth thine age and duty to
                  thy parent. Prepare, then, I say, to leave this place ere sunrise of to-morrow,
                  with one who offers thee protection, for, alas, I can afford thee none!"</p>
               <p>"Thou shalt not send me from thee, father. In all else thou mayst claim obedience,
                  but never will I consent sent to leave thee, nor does the duty of a child extend
                  so far. Thou and I are left to each other, and we will cling together so long as
                  life itself holds place within our bosom."</p>
               <p>"Nay, my child, not for thine own safety alone, but for the more faithful
                  performance of my duty, I would have thee depart. Reflect that I am aged, and my
                  health already much enfeebled, and were it to please our heavenly Parent to visit
                  me with imprisonment or to call me hence, where would be thy refuge? For, although
                  thou art not of our sect, thy father's religion places thee in peril, and none
                  dare show kindness to thee, or offer protection to the Quaker's child, though
                  Heaven move his heart, perchance, to pity."</p>
               <p>"All thou hast said to dissuade me only serves to show me a daughter's duty.
                  Should I leave thee because thou art sick and aged, and needest some kind hand to
                  minister to thee? Methinks I hear my mother's voice bidding me desert thee not;
                  nor will I. Wherefore should I go with strangers and forsake thee? Art thou not
                  all I have on earth to cling to? Think not, then, to cast me from thy bosom, for
                  here I will stay, and not even thy command shall, for one moment, shake my
                  resolution."</p>
               <p>The old man's voice was tremulous with emotion as he answered, "Why, Edith, scarce
                  do I know thee in this sudden mood. I should almost judge thy conduct unwomanly,
                  were it not so like my dear departed one.<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6366-00000009"/>
                  Well, I can not force thee hence, my child, although I should much rejoice to know
                  that thou wert safely bestowed elsewhere."</p>
               <p>"Tremble not for me, father; my trust is in Him who is able to protect is both.
                  And, after all, I fear not much these cruel men, although it were not wise to
                  provoke their anger."</p>
               <p>"It is believed they will scarcely go so far as to shed blood, and that they
                  thought this threat would drive us hence in haste and terror. They believe,
                  doubtless, that because we will not fight we shall all the sooner run away,
                  showing how little they know of that very religion whose principles they profess,
                  and whose requirements they pretend to answer."</p>
               <p>They had now nearly reached their humble domicile, when, to Edith's dismay, she
                  saw approaching them two individuals, whom she recognized as Mr. Mildman, a young
                  minister of high popularity, and Mr. Harding, one of the chief magistrates of the
                  town, both being among the most bitter enemies of the Quakers.</p>
               <p>John Morrison and his daughter would have passed them by with a friendly greeting,
                  but their path was intercepted by these worthies, and the simple "Well, friends"
                  of the Quaker met with a sharp response from the indignant magistrate.</p>
               <p>"Why dost thou wear that hat of thine in this goodly presence?" he angrily
                  demanded.</p>
               <p>"Why should I not wear my hat, friend?" was the quiet reply.</p>
               <p>"An' thou art ignorant of the reason, it were well to teach thee," answered
                  Harding, and raising his walking stick he struck it from the old man's head,
                  leaving him standing uncovered in the noonday sun.</p>
               <p>"Wherefore dost thou tarry here," inquired the minister. "Knowest thou not the
                  decree, even as the law of the Medes and Persians, which is pronounced against thy
                  profane sect? If thou leave not this place right speedily thy life stands forfeit
                  to the State. And for thee, maiden, it were well to wear a more meek and seemly
                  aspect. Begone, I say, or to-morrow's sunset may find ye in the dungeon's cell,
                  whence ye shall scarce escape, unless humbled to confess your vile errors, and be
                  received into the bosom of our Church, who nobly extends her arms to embrace the
                  penitent."</p>
               <p>While the Reverend Mr. Mildman thus addressed them, the pair stood in silence
                  before him, and when he closed his remarks John Morrison made a motion as if about
                  to reply, but was checked by a sudden pressure of the arm to which Edith clung;
                  and thus reminded of her peril he remained mute, while she, as they passed on,
                  took up her father's hat from the ground, and reverently replaced it upon his
                  head, the tears of shame and anger starting into her eyes at the insult to which
                  her aged parent had been subjected.</p>
               <p>John Morrison had become a convert to Quakerism<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000010"/> about ten years before the date of the commencement
                  of our story. Up to that time, although little interested in the subject of
                  religion, he had been formally connected with the Church of England. His wife, who
                  still clung fondly to its early teachings, grieved sadly over his defection, while
                  he vainly endeavored to convince her that those views alone were correct which he
                  now newly advocated. This difference in their religious opinions produced,
                  however, no unhappy consequences, so far as their mutual affection and confidence
                  were concerned. Yet it caused the tender wife and mother many an anxious hour, and
                  seeing the storm of persecution raging around them she trembled for the future
                  fate of her husband and her child. Eager to escape from these scenes, she was
                  earnest in her desire to emigrate to that newly found land of peace and freedom
                  which had already afforded a sanctuary to many faithful and zealous souls. Chiefly
                  in compliance with her wishes, and partly in that missionary spirit which leads
                  many a pious adventurer to seek a distant land, he embarked with his family, and a
                  small number of his despised name, for that "land of promise," that far-off
                  wilderness, which lay many a league across the ocean's wave.</p>
               <p>Little did he dream that ere he reached that distant home he should be called to
                  part with his faithful and beloved Margaret. But before they had been many days at
                  sea she was attacked with an alarming illness, and although every attention which
                  their situation afforded was lavished upon her, she felt that death was at hand;
                  and leaving him the sole protector of their darling Edith, she departed,
                  commending both to the guardianship of their heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>Sad was the blow that fell upon the husband's heart, and deep was the grief of
                  Edith at the loss of a mother most tenderly beloved. Just sixteen, she had reached
                  the age to feel daily more and more the loss of such a parent; but anxious to
                  assuage her father's sorrow, she strove to forget her own, and make his comfort
                  and happiness her peculiar care. Indeed his condition called for more than
                  ordinary attention, for being naturally of a delicate constitution his grief now
                  wrought upon both mind and frame, and Edith's task was that of nurse as well as
                  comforter.</p>
               <p>Before they left England Mrs. Morrison had adopted the peculiar style of the
                  Quaker dress in order to identify herself with her husband as much as possible,
                  fearing a separation from him, in case he should be so unfortunate as to incur the
                  rigor of the law. And as they were about to seek a new home, it was greatly
                  repugnant to her feelings that the difference in their religious sentiments should
                  become a subject of public curiosity and comment, and perhaps an excuse for
                  interference in their family concerns. Edith shared in her mother's feelings and
                  followed her example, and now became still more anxious to fulfill these
                  intentions.</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6366-00000011"/>
               <p>They had not resided long in Boston when they discovered that so far from escaping
                  persecution by coming to New England, the Quakers only encountered there more
                  bitter enmity than in the mother country.</p>
               <p>Seeing this was the case, and feeling himself incompetent to protect his daughter
                  from the many dangers by which they were surrounded, John Morrison had several
                  times purposed and arranged to send her back to England. Her mother's sister who
                  resided there would gladly receive her, and endeavor to supply the place of her
                  departed parent. But Edith steadily refused to go, and besought him with tears to
                  think of that step no longer, unless he would himself accompany her and consider
                  England his future home. He, however, conceived it to be his duty to remain in
                  Boston, and bear his testimony against the cruelties to which he saw his brethren
                  subjected. Forced, as he was, to consent to Edith's stay, he consoled himself with
                  the thought that, as she was not a Quaker, she could not incur the full weight of
                  the laws which oppressed that sect, and trusted that in case of his death, some
                  heaven-directed friend would arise as her protector.</p>
               <p>Edith's motive in keeping her religion a secret may easily be seen. She feared
                  that if known, it might serve as an excuse for strong and tyrannical hands to
                  separate her from her beloved and only remaining parent, and he, on his part, knew
                  that he would not be considered competent to have the care of even his own
                  daughter, under existing circumstances. The subject, therefore, was one rarely
                  alluded to.</p>
               <p>The persecution to which she now saw her father subjected, only drew him more
                  closely to her heart, and awoke within her a spirit she knew not she possessed.
                  Always when he permitted her, she accompanied him in his walks, and more than once
                  had language of ready insult and contempt been checked by her steady glance of
                  courage, which inspired their intended assailant with involuntary respect and
                  admiration. Thus, while the father deemed himself her protector, oftener was the
                  daughter the guardian of his path, and her eye averting danger from his way.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>IN the evening twilight Edith sat alone in her cheerless little chamber. The
                  events of the day had fallen with a depressing influence upon her feelings, which,
                  long and painfully suppressed, now broke forth in secret and bitter tears. Grief
                  for her mother's loss yet fresh within her heart, mingled with apprehensions for
                  her father's safety, and the disappointment of those bright anticipations which
                  clustered around their transatlantic home, all served to fill her mind with
                  despondency, and envelop in impenetrable darkness their unpropitious future.</p>
               <p>Leaning her arms upon the window sill, and bowing her young head upon them, she
                  gave way to the rush of emotions so long accumulating within her bosom. So deeply
                  was she absorbed in her sorrow that she scarcely noticed a low and half-frightened
                  tap upon the door, which, contrary to the custom of the time, was secured thus
                  early in the evening, for the threshold of the Quaker dwelling was not sacred from
                  the foot of any who might choose to obtrude there an unwelcome presence.</p>
               <p>A repetition of the summons was without hesitation answered by Edith, who hastened
                  to remove the wooden bar by which the door was fastened, and in another moment she
                  was clasped in the arms of a lovely girl of about her own age, who, kissing away
                  her tears, anxiously and soothingly, inquired into the cause of her distress.</p>
               <p>"Dear Alice, I almost feared thou hadst forsaken me."</p>
               <p>"Forsaken thee, my own Edith! Thou must never judge of me so unkindly, for it is
                  only when I dare not come, that I am absent from thee long. This very evening I
                  did feign sickness, and desired to be alone that I might repose awhile, in order
                  to create this blessed opportunity. And indeed it were no falsehood, for my soul
                  itself was sick for sight of thee. And even now I must fly back like a lapwing,
                  nor tarry many moments in thy sweet company."</p>
               <p>"Alice, thy friendship is dearer to me than thou knowest, yet I tremble for thy
                  safety, and would entreat thee to come here no more, but that my lips almost
                  refuse to pronounce against their mistress so hard a sentence."</p>
               <p>"Thy lips are most discreet, Edith, and thy heart is a naughty little thing for
                  trying to teach them treason to thy only friend. Cease to prate of <emph>my</emph>
                  peril an' thou wouldst not vex me, for it is to warn thee of thine own that I am
                  come hither."</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6366-00000013"/>
               <p>"My father has told me of the danger we stand in, but he will not go, Alice! This
                  was in part the reason why I was so distressed, when thy bright face smiled in
                  upon me like a cheerful sunbeam."</p>
               <p>"Oh, but he has not told thee all! This very afternoon I overheard a conversation
                  between my father and that dear young saint and hypocrite, Mr. Mildman—nay, do not
                  shake thy head and look so reprovingly, for I must speak my mind. (But they knew
                  not of my ear in their councils, I warrant thee!) Edith, I blush with shame to
                  tell thee that my father is the enemy whom you must fear. I witnessed your
                  encounter this morning, and God forgive me, but my heart burned with anger against
                  one I should only love and reverence."</p>
               <p>"Do not let it grieve thee, Alice. I can not but believe God will soften their
                  hearts, although for a time they be filled with anger and cruelty."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I trust so, dear girl. And more, as my father is a tender-hearted man,
                  who would not so much as tread upon a tiny ant in his path. And to think he should
                  be harsh to thee, who saved my poor life so nobly. Oh, he shall hear of that, and
                  then see if he will turn his anger against you!"</p>
               <p>"Thou didst promise, Alice, to keep that a secret within thy own bosom. Indeed,
                  there is nothing I fear more than being brought into the slightest notice. Thou
                  wilt be silent, dear girl, I know, for my sake?"</p>
               <p>"But remember that my promise was with the condition that it should bind me,
                  unless I could one day serve thee by telling all."</p>
               <p>"Farewell then, dearest friend, for I shall never see thee more!"</p>
               <p>"Not yet—not yet, Edith! Indeed it was only the fear that I should be forbidden to
                  come here in future that kept the secret within my lips this very afternoon. But I
                  forget my cruel errand! My father hath pledged himself to come to-morrow morning
                  to seek you, and if he finds you, to bring you before the Governor, and doubtless
                  to the prison. Thou didst say thy father would not go away?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. We must stay here and meet our fate. My father has forbidden me to importune
                  him further on the subject, and I will not obey his command to leave him and seek
                  my own safety."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is madness for him to remain! And thou art a brave and noble-hearted girl,
                  and dost right to stay by his side in time of danger. Yet he should go for thy
                  sake, and not expose thy youth and sex to this peril."</p>
               <p>"Our Saviour saith, 'He that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of
                  me.'"</p>
               <p>"May He protect thee, dear girl! They shall never harm a hair of thy head, if my
                  efforts can avail aught. And Edith, to-morrow morning persuade thy father to keep
                  within, and do thou make no stir about the<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6366-00000014"
                  /> house. I will myself be up with the lark, and accompany my sage parent in his
                  morning ramble, and depend upon it, it shall be no fault of mine if he go not in
                  the wrong track to seek thee."</p>
               <p>"I will endeavor to do as thou sayest Alice, although it will serve for a brief
                  time only."</p>
               <p>"Take courage and despair not, for I have a plan whereby I hope to serve thee a
                  more lasting turn. Yet ask no questions, for thou shalt not know it yet; and
                  perchance if thou did, that wise head of thine would only shake in
                  disapproval."</p>
               <p>"Thou canst never keep a secret long from thine own Edith, I warrant me! But how
                  speeds thy wooing, prythee, Alice fair?"</p>
               <p>A shade passed over the young girl's face, and tears, which she strove to hide,
                  came into her blue eyes, as she answered—</p>
               <p>"Ask me not, I beg thee. Alas, Edith! man's love is short-lived as the dew upon
                  the hill side."</p>
               <p>"We do indeed so read in idle romance, but I can find it in my heart sometimes to
                  doubt that sad conclusion."</p>
               <p>"Mayst thou never have cause to abjure thy faith, my friend. Indeed, thou wilt
                  not; for he whose love is won by such as thou art, will love thee truly, or else
                  prove false to truth itself, so excellent art thou. But I, woe is me; I am a
                  silly, fitful girl, and am scarce worth the loving!" and now fairly weeping, she
                  flung herself upon Edith's neck, and sobbed as if her heart were breaking.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Alice darling, tell me the cause of thy grief, that together we may find the
                  remedy. Weep not so bitterly, for I feel well assured Edward is not the false one
                  thou thinkest him. Come, we will heal this lover's quarrel, and thy tears shall
                  turn into smiles of brightest sunshine."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edith! I have not lain eyes upon him since I was last here!"</p>
               <p>"For three days! three whole days thou sayest? Indeed I must laugh at thee for
                  branding him with falsehood so easily. How knowest thou that some urgent business
                  does not detain him from thee?"</p>
               <p>"Because he told me he should not come again!"</p>
               <p>"Wherefore? There was surely some reason which thou hast not told me."</p>
               <p>"There was. He said he should come no more until I gave consent to his revealing
                  the whole to my father, and asking his sanction to our marriage."</p>
               <p>"And thereby has shown himself the soul of honor instead of the false fickle man
                  thou callest him."</p>
               <p>"It is only an excuse for his coldness. If he did not wish that our intercourse
                  should altogether cease, why should he desire to speak to my father on the
                  subject? Edward knows right well that he is already looked upon with dislike and
                  suspicion, and such a request as his would be answered with a command to think of
                  me no longer."</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6366-00000015"/>
               <p>"Thou art very unjust, Alice. Thou hast no warrant that thy father would so
                  receive him."</p>
               <p>"I have, indeed I have. I have seen his cold looks, and Lisbet knows—"</p>
               <p>"Lisbet is no suitable adviser for thee, dear one. Thy father's cold looks may all
                  spring from the displeasure he feels at Edward's supposed want of confidence in
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Yet Lisbet has heard my father say that if he were but sure of Edward's—(oh,
                  Edith! he calls it 'treachery')—he would forbid him coming to our house any
                  longer. I know not what has turned him so utterly against his friend's son, for
                  when he first came to us my father was most kind and courteous toward him."</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Alice, if I say it is all thy own doing; yet I would not say so did I
                  not believe that thou hast the remedy in thy hands. Thou saidst his patience was
                  well-nigh ended. Oh! trifle no longer with his happiness and thine own, but do thy
                  part to repair this mischief which delay has made, and then, at least, Edward will
                  have no cause to reproach thee."</p>
               <p>"It is too late now, too late. Yet I believe he loves me still, and he will come
                  again. I will think of thy advice, Edith, and should it seem well, and the time
                  propitious, will follow it, too. I should not, at this time, grieve thee with my
                  foolish fears. Edward, doubtless, is true to honor, and I will give my runaway
                  tongue a wholesome biting for uttering such slanders of him. But my plan, girl, my
                  plan! hast thou no woman's curiosity that not a question regarding it has passed
                  thy lips? or is it too worthless to merit a moment's attention?"</p>
               <p>"Why, didst thou not forbid me to ask, and say I should not know it yet?"</p>
               <p>"Short-sighted mortal! know that it was said merely to arouse thy curiosity and
                  elicit thy questioning. Thou knowest yonder goodly young man, our eloquent
                  minister; well, I fancy that my father prefers him for a son-in-law, which is
                  partly the reason why he frowns on Edward. Now, Edith, before I tell thee another
                  word, <emph>thou</emph> shalt make <emph>me</emph> a promise: Say thou wilt preach
                  me no sermon, nor frown, nor shake thy head—in short, that thou wilt not speak one
                  single word against the project I am about to unfold."</p>
               <p>"I will not promise thee. Thy preamble shows that it is something which my
                  conscience will condemn, and, therefore, my tongue shall not be fettered with a
                  promise."</p>
               <p>"Thou wilt annihilate me with thy scrupulous nicety. But I have thee, for all thy
                  cunning. I will just tell it thee, and then run away before thou hast time to
                  lecture me. Now listen, and answer not! This minister, although guarded in his
                  approaches, begins to wear the watchful and attentive guise of a lover. Beshrew me
                  now if I use not his devotion in a better cause than mine own. His voice hath
                  great weight in the councils<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6366-00000016"/> cils, an'
                  woman's wit fail not, it shall yet be raised in thy service."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Alice! now indeed I see that thou art thyself the false one. Edward is true,
                  but thou hast ceased to love him."</p>
               <p>"Not so. Mr. Mildman has turned my father's face against him, and now I have the
                  right to punish the offender. He shall learn to interfere in the affairs of Alice
                  Harding! And fear not for Edward; there is power in smiles, Edith, and when they
                  fail, tears are a potent agency."</p>
               <p>"Alice, dear girl, be warned. I would thou hadst not told me thy secret plans, for
                  they both shock and grieve me. Thou shalt not be false to thy father, to thy
                  lover, to Mr. Mildman, and to thyself—to serve me. I will accept no kindness at
                  thy hands obtained so unfairly."</p>
               <p>"Thou thinkest me dishonorable, Edith, yet I am not without some womanly feelings.
                  My dignity shall not be compromised, and Edward shall suffer no injury at my
                  hands. But my father and the minister have plotted against my peace, and I will
                  return their maneuvering with usury."</p>
               <p>"Thou wilt practice a deception, and all deception is a compromise of sincerity.
                  Once more be persuaded, I entreat thee. Deal openly with thy father, and all will
                  be as thou desirest."</p>
               <p>"Never! I dare not risk Edward's frank and manly bearing against the other's
                  sanctimonious cringing. But I tarry too long, for see, yonder forest shades are
                  already peopled with elf and goblin. Fare thee well, sweet one, and keep within
                  to-morrow, as I bade thee."</p>
               <p>"Farewell, dear mistaken girl. I can not but think thou wilt repent thy dangerous
                  scheming. I would go with thee past yon fairy domain, but my company is more
                  dangerous than that of sprite or fay."</p>
               <p>It was late that night ere either of the two friends closed their eyes in slumber.
                  Edith's mind was perplexed with many anxieties. Fears for her father's safety
                  drove sleep from her pillow long after he had lost all consciousness of care and
                  responsibility in forgetfulness. She mourned, too, over the waywardness of her
                  misguided friend. "Alas!" thought she, "she has never known a mother's
                  teaching!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the sprightly Alice tossed upon her pillow, revolving deeply-laid
                  schemes within her busy brain. She thought she had devised a plan by which she
                  could subdue her pious lover to her influence, and, at the same time, preserve her
                  maidenly dignity, and avoid falling into the snare she was resolved to set for
                  him. "Nay," she soliloquized, as if excusing herself to herself, "it will be but a
                  good work to soften his heart to mercy, and to-morrow I will even condescend to be
                  gracious unto him, at least, so far as I may be, consistently with womanly
                  reserve. Perchance he will<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6366-00000017"/> think he is
                  kind-hearted for <emph>my</emph> sake; but my foolish wit shall teach him that it
                  is much better to be so for <emph>mercy's</emph> own."</p>
               <p>With such thoughts as these in her mind she composed herself to sleep, although
                  she was not without the consciousness that she was embarking in a dangerous
                  enterprise.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>IT was late in the afternoon of the following day when Edith, leaving her father
                  within, walked forth to breathe the refreshing evening air. Choosing the most
                  retired paths which led to the water side, and clambering far out upon the rocks
                  that jutted into the bay, she sought her favorite resting-place behind a steep
                  ridge which served entirely to conceal her from persons standing on the shore. Her
                  seat was reached with difficulty, by sometimes leaping from rock to rock, or
                  clinging to their rough projections. The path led upward among the crags and
                  stones, and bore so uninviting an aspect that few maidens would have ventured
                  thereupon. But Edith loved to steal away thus from every sound that told of busy
                  life and its rude jarrings and contention, and lose herself in memories sacred and
                  most dear. Far away beyond her sight, in the deep bosom of the waters, was her
                  mother's grave; and in the sound of these dashing waves, she seemed to hear a
                  voice of soothing sympathy. Here she could weep unseen, and pour out the secret
                  grief of her bosom. Here her mother's spirit seemed to hover<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000018"/> nearest, and in the undisturbed repose of nature,
                  to hold communion with her sorrowing child. Here, as she cast the world behind
                  her, and approached the verge of the unseen, her mother, standing on the borders
                  of the eternal world, seemed to embrace her with those spiritual arms; and she
                  came thence, strengthened for the next day's conflict, patient to watch and to
                  endure.</p>
               <p>Long she sat there, gazing through misty tears far into the blue expanse before
                  her, where the sky and the waters met to blend in harmony. "Ah," she murmured,
                  "would that I too had passed that unseen boundary, and were now sleeping death's
                  quiet sleep with thee, my mother!"</p>
               <p>Another moment, and the pang of self-reproach smote upon her heart, for the
                  thought of her father started up before her, and remembering that she had been
                  long absent from him, she hastily arose from her seat and turned to descend the
                  rocky path. But so utterly had she lost consciousness of what was passing around
                  her, that the tide had come in unperceived, and the waves were now dashing within
                  a few inches of the spot on which she stood. To return by the accustomed way was
                  impossible, to climb the cliff before her was equally so, nor could any signals
                  she might make be seen from the shore. Was there indeed no way by which she could
                  escape? A sickening apprehension seized her soul, and the watery grave, which a
                  few moments ments before had seemed so peaceful and calm, she now shrunk from with
                  all the feelings natural to humanity. But she was not one to perish without making
                  every effort at self-preservation. She exerted all the power of her voice in
                  calling for aid, and in the intervals of her screams, listened for a reply so
                  intently that she thought she heard the very flowing of her blood through her
                  veins. The hum of the town came to her ear like a far-off murmur; the sound of the
                  clock striking the hour smote upon her brain like her own death-knell. No
                  answering voice cheered her with hope of succor. The evening twilight was fast
                  fading in the west, and the shadows of night fell with solemn silence upon the
                  waters. Nearer and nearer came the ocean's swell, and her garments were moistened
                  with its spray. The next wave washes over her feet. One effort more for life. She
                  kneels upon the now watery seat, and, uplifting her pale countenance to heaven,
                  breathes a silent prayer. Committing her father to that guardian care, and with
                  that dear name, "mother," upon her lips, she throws herself into the sea, with a
                  faint hope that she may reach the shore. For a few moments she struggled with the
                  waves, then felt them closing over her. Again she rose to the surface, and, for a
                  while, kept herself afloat by the motion of her hands. But her strength was soon
                  exhausted, and her limbs cramped by the chilling waters, and life seemed about to
                  desert her. Many mingled sounds<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6366-00000019"/> came to
                  her stifled sense: she thought she heard her father's voice calling to her in
                  tones of anguish; that she saw Alice, with outstretched arms, hastening to her
                  assistance. Then her mother's soothing accents came in gentler cadences to her
                  ear, and—oh! joy—that loved being clasps her to her bosom. At last she feels that
                  long-desired embrace! and upward, upward is she borne, and life sinks away in a
                  delicious calm!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>ALICE HARDING was an only child, and the cherished darling of her loving father.
                  The early loss of her mother, to whom he was most tenderly attached, had doubly
                  endeared to him the sole remaining fruit of their union, and he watched over her
                  infant years with almost a woman's solicitude and patient care. Into his ear she
                  ever poured the story of her childish griefs, and found unfailing sympathy; and he
                  was never happier than when sharing her little sports, and listening to the music
                  of her joyous laughter. Every change in her tiny face was noted, every caprice of
                  appetite, or sign of languor excited his apprehensions; and were the little
                  mistress ill, no hands but his were allowed to tend her, no other eyes to watch
                  beside her pillow.</p>
               <p>Children soon learn to feel their power, and thus indulged, Alice, although
                  possessed of unusual sweetness of disposition, appeared to every one, except her
                  fond parent, a self-willed child.</p>
               <p>As she grew into maturity her promise of beauty ripened into perfect bloom, and
                  her father's heart<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6366-00000020"/> swelled with loving
                  pride to call so fair a maiden "daughter." Yet to him she was still the
                     <emph>little</emph> Alice, and he pictured to himself a long delicious season,
                  ere she should be <emph>old enough</emph> for other than a <emph>parent's</emph>
                  love.</p>
               <p>And when some youth of the village who had gazed upon the young girl's beauty from
                  afar, and felt his heart leap into his mouth, when a stray smile from her rosy
                  lips, by chance, lighted upon him, at last mustered courage to request an
                  interview with papa, and, as the custom of the time demanded, ask permission to
                  become a suitor to the fair one, Mr. Harding would put on his spectacles, and
                  finding himself still unable, with their aid, to see into so profound a mystery,
                  would take them off, rub them for some moments with the corner of his silken
                  handkerchief, then carefully readjusting them on the parental nose, would fix upon
                  the unhappy youth such a gaze of surprise and scrutiny as made him more than half
                  repent his rashness.</p>
               <p>"Pho, pho!" he would say—"my little Alice? Why she is a child, man, and thou art
                  scarce more! Go along with thy love and thy folly and get thee to thy books—dost
                  hear, boy? thy <emph>books,</emph> until thy beard has a chance to grow!"</p>
               <p>And after the poor "boy" had departed, in a state bordering on desperation, and
                  with a firm resolve to hasten home, and seize upon that almost useless though
                  dangerous weapon, his razor, and therewith to revenge the insults his tender chin
                  had received by——shaving himself,—Mr. Harding, regardless of tho anguish he had
                  inflicted, walked up and down his study, laughing and scolding by turns, at such
                  presumption.</p>
               <p>"They would rob me of her, my little 'ewe lamb!' They would take her from my bosom
                  and perhaps make her a slave—the tender little thing! Why, it was only yesterday
                  her mother laid her in these arms, a tiny helpless babe!" and a tear would make
                  its escape from his eye. Then, as the picture of Alice arose before him he thought
                  how it would amuse her to hear of the poor youth's discomfiture, and laughed till
                  the tears came again. "The saucy minx! she shall never know it, not she. It might
                  put mischief into her silly little head to tell her!"</p>
               <p>Alice, hearing some unusual stir below, would now come singing down the stairs,
                  and the study door, like that which always obeyed the fairy's bidding, readily
                  flew open to admit her.</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, what a noise you are making! Methinks you must have here concealed
                  some friend to fun and laughter. Acquaint me with him, I pray, for surely I heard
                  another voice within beside your own."</p>
               <p>"Nay, busy girl, I will have no prying into the secrets of this apartment. There
                  are none here save thyself and me, and our worthy ancestors, who, for aught<pb
                     n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6366-00000021"/> thou knowest, may sometimes step out from
                  their tarnished state and come down to keep me jovial company."</p>
               <p>"No, for surely those grim lips were never so wicked as to smile. But tell me, I
                  beseech you, the cause of your merriment, that I may have my share of it,
                  too."</p>
               <p>"Thou shalt not know it, Alice! Such topics are unmeet for thy years. But come,
                  get thy mufflers and let us out in this warm sunshine."</p>
               <p>"Never a step will I stir until my curiosity is satisfied." And so by dint of
                  teasing and coaxing she would get the whole story from her fond father, and join
                  right heartily, though with an abashed countenance, in the laughter which rang
                  forth at its conclusion.</p>
               <p>But although Alice laughed, her merriment was occasioned by different thoughts
                  than those which caused her father's amusement.</p>
               <p>The conscious glance of admiration she frequently encountered, and the gleam of
                  pleasure which her slightest favors often occasioned, told her their flattering
                  tale; and although she received these as her proper due, and with the tyranny of
                  beauty levied her tax of homage, yet her heart would sometimes flutter at the
                  whispered word that told of something more; that something, which, though ignorant
                  of, she looked forward to as her allotted portion.</p>
               <p>She would fain experience it, but still she would defer the knowledge. She longed,
                  yet feared to taste the cup whose draught has power to clothe in rainbow hues this
                  whole existence, but which doth sometimes cast a gloom upon the face of nature,
                  making life a living death, and the grave a wished-for hiding place. The flowery
                  pathway was before her, but how knew she that a serpent lurked not there? Well
                  might she pause before venturing upon that enchanted ground, for none having
                  entered there may retrace their steps, or coming thence, bring back the gayety of
                  heart with which they sped!</p>
               <p>Alice laughed then, partly because her father laughed, partly at the advice he
                  gave, and still more at the idea of her extreme juvenility; for although her
                  slender form had not attained its full maturity, yet she had grown to woman's
                  stature, and considered herself (as what girl of sixteen does not?) quite
                  competent to inflict misery upon the other sex.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere there came one within her magic circle, the memory of whose
                  thoughtful gaze she strove to banish from her hours of solitude. He was a
                  stranger, and for some reason Alice could not herself quite comprehend, she shrunk
                  from making inquiries into his history. Occasionally she encountered him in her
                  walks, and her eyes fell beneath the glance of those dark orbs, in whose depths a
                  world of emotion lay slumbering.</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6366-00000022"/>
               <p>As is usual in such cases, Alice grew thoughtful and dreamy. Her voice was less
                  often heard in song, and she loved to sit alone with her head leaning on her hand,
                  and her mind absorbed in revery. Sometimes she entirely forgot to sweeten her
                  father's coffee, and when reminded of the omission, in her confusion, she was very
                  apt to put a double quantity of sugar in his cup, a circumstance which was very
                  enigmatical to Mr. Harding, since Alice had, until now, always seemed to hit his
                  taste exactly in this particular.</p>
               <p>There was a mystery about her conduct which made him very uncomfortable. He
                  thought she was surely ill, and not wishing to alarm her by mentioning his
                  suspicions, he queried with her maid as to the cause of these alarming
                  symptoms.</p>
               <p>Lisbet was amazed at the idea of Alice being ill, and answered that there was not
                  a rosier lady in the bonnie realm of old England, much less in the wilds of
                  America.</p>
               <p>"But something is at the root of it, Lisbet. Hast thou not noted the change my
                  good girl?"</p>
               <p>"Why la, sir, Miss Alice is no longer a child, to be all the time singing songs
                  and have no thoughts for any thing but fun and frolic. And may be, sir," she
                  suggested after a pause, "the young minister's fine sermons has summut to do with
                  it. There's many a body been made sober and thoughtful-like by him."</p>
               <p>As Lisbet said this she smoothed her white apron down with both her hands and
                  placed her head aside, displaying a strikingly meek expression of countenance.</p>
               <p>"Why, so it may be, Lisbet. I marvel that thought never occurred to me," said Mr.
                  Harding, in a tone that indicated a much lighter heart. "Perhaps her young mind is
                  led to contemplate that excellent subject, and in reflection upon it, she is
                  amazed into unwonted quietude. But she was always a good child, and methinks hath
                  few transgressions to weigh down her spirit, that she need lose her natural gayety
                  and cheerful temper."</p>
               <p>"We are <emph>all</emph> dreadful sinners, Mr. Harding," said Lisbet, with reproof
                  in her tone, as she raised her eyebrows and drew down the corners of her mouth
                  into an expression of penitential grief; "the best of us is poor sinful creatures,
                  and has naught in ourselves to glory of."</p>
               <p>"Surely, surely, my girl. Thou speakest well, and I commend thee for thy humility.
                  Only," he continued, as he walked away, "there is no reason why it should make a
                  woman of her."</p>
               <p>Now Lisbet was a cunning girl, and knew pretty well by the signs she saw in her
                  lady's behavior, that, to speak in common phrase, she had fallen in love. But
                  Lisbet was discreet too, and did not betray her suspicions to the parental ear.
                  Nor was she disposed to lose her share in the excitement of a love affair, in<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6366-00000023"/> which, she flattered herself, her
                  mistress would require her assistance. Therefore, acting a friendly part toward
                  Alice, she adroitly turned Mr. Harding's attention into another channel. "For,"
                  said she, "I'm no ways sure of it, and if I were, what kind of a lady's maid
                  should I be to be betrayin' of her secrets, last of all to her father? No, indeed,
                  and 'specially the first love, which is always the tenderest, as nobody knows
                  better than myself."</p>
               <p>We will now leave Alice for awhile, to the undisturbed enjoyment of her reveries,
                  while we take a peep into the sanctum of the Reverend Mr. Mildman.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>MR. MILDMAN was a man of more than ordinary talent, although possessing few
                  personal attractions. Of his private motives we will leave our reader to judge as
                  we proceed with our narrative. He was a general favorite, because he was an
                  attentive pastor, was faithful and untiring in the performance of his duties,
                  gifted with eloquence, was young, with a pensive cast of features, and—unmarried,
                  which last qualification insured his popularity with the ladies, at least. For
                  upon nobody will women in general lavish so much tenderness (maternal or sisterly,
                  as the case may be) as on the unmarried parson—unless we except the
                  parson-widower, and in his case all the interest of the first is felt in his
                  welfare, and a world of sympathy beside.</p>
               <p>In short Mr. Mildman was the lion of the town, but lion as he was, he found
                  himself a captive either to a silken, or a golden chain, either to Cupid or
                  cupidity. Perhaps his service was divided between the two; but at any rate he
                     <emph>fancied</emph> himself in love, and the object of his devotion was no
                  other than our coquettish little beauty.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6366-00000024"/>
               <p>Mr. Mildman kept his own secret. His knowledge of human nature told him he was not
                  the man to win the affections of a gay girl in the first flush of youthful beauty;
                  and he knew, too, that he is more sure to win who defers rather than precipitates
                  his wooing. So he was content to bide his time, and determined to set a careful
                  guard over a prize so well worth securing, which his intimacy with Mr. Harding
                  enabled him to do, though not to his entire satisfaction. He kept watch of each
                  guady flutterer around his lady's bower, and managed to clip the pinions of such
                  as attracted her eye, sometimes by well-guarded hints to the easily alarmed
                  parent, and sometimes through other means more ingenious than fair. Yet for all
                  these precautions he was ill at ease, and cast about him for some additional way
                  of guarding his dearest treasure.</p>
               <p>The change which had taken place in Alice had not escaped his notice nor failed to
                  increase his uneasiness. Mr. Harding himself spoke to him of it, and he
                  judiciously advised quiet and retirement for the supposed invalid. Hearing Lisbet
                  mentioned in this connection, it occurred to him that he might make use of the
                  girl in forwarding his plans, but he determined to observe her closely and
                  acquaint himself with her character before intrusting her with such a weighty
                  commission. This he had ready opportunities of doing, for she was in the habit of
                  coming to him for spiritual advice and instruction.</p>
               <p>He was soon convinced that the girl was admirably suited to his purpose, and one
                  day, when she came on her accustomed errand, he commenced operations by kindly
                  inquiring into the health of the family.</p>
               <p>"I grieve to hear that thy young mistress is not well, at least her father's
                  anxieties lead him to fear so, as he tells me."</p>
               <p>A smile lurked around the corners of Lisbet's mouth as she answered that "Mistress
                  Alice was not so gay and light-hearted as she used to be."</p>
               <p>"It were pity that one so young should have cause for sorrow, other than that we
                  should all feel for our shortcomings."</p>
               <p>(Now Lisbet was in her way an example of piety. So great indeed was her zeal, that
                  none of her neighbors faults escaped her notice, and few conducted themselves with
                  sufficient propriety to avoid shocking her moral sense. So anxious was she to
                  correct the errors of all the rest of the world that she usually overlooked her
                  own, and never allowed an opportunity of upholding the right and condemning the
                  wrong to pass by.)</p>
               <p>"Oh, your Worship! there's nobody loves my young lady better than I do, and nobody
                  is more blind-like to her failures (excepting her fond parent, may be, which is
                  naturally born blind to children's faults, though my own father was not, as the
                  chastisins of my childhood can bear witness, and I thank him for them now with all
                  my heart, though I did n't relish 'em at the time),<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000025"/> and I wish I could say it was penitence for her
                  sins that made her so quiet and staid. But alas, sir, I could not say it, no, not
                  in conscience and speaking truth, as I hope my lips may always do, or forever
                  after hold their peace. No, sir, it's not regineration that ails my young
                  lady."</p>
               <p>"And what dost thou think it is, Lisbet? If there be aught upon her mind, her
                  friends should share the burden, or perhaps they might relieve her of it
                  altogether."</p>
               <p>"Not very easy, sir! I've seen such cases afore. It's a heart complaint, if I
                  don't mistake, your Worship."</p>
               <p>"Lisbet!" exclaimed the minister in well-feigned alarm (for he understood the
                  girl's meaning perfectly). "A complaint of the heart, and her father ignorant of
                  it? This must never be! She shall have medical advice immediately!"</p>
               <p>"It would n't do her a bit of good, sir. All the doctors in the world can't cure
                  that disease I've heard tell. Young ladies (and gentlemen, too, is likewise
                  victims) are very liable to it, but they generally outlives it, sir."</p>
               <p>"Speak plainly, my good girl. Thy hints alarm me."</p>
               <p>"Why, sir, the upshot of the matter is, that Mistress Alice has fell in love,
                  according as my suspicion goes."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed!" exclaimed Mr. Mildman with some show of surprise and a good deal of
                  real anxiety, "that is not so bad as I feared, and yet it may be a great deal
                  worse. Hast thou mentioned thy suspicions to any one else, Lisbet?"</p>
               <p>"Not a living soul! Not even to Mr. Harding, though he asked my opinion, and being
                  taken aback like, I told him, perhaps it was your edifine discourses, your honor.
                  I should n't have betrayed my lady's secrets to mortal ears, only I was aware from
                  personal experiments, that in case of no return of sentiment, there's a refuge in
                  religion. Some takes to it as a last resort when nothing else will move their
                  stubborn hearts, and this, may be, is a special Providence to bring Miss Alice in.
                  I thought if it should turn out so fortunate, that you would be the very one to
                  point the way out to her, and so I longed to tell you about it and get it off my
                  mind, sir."</p>
               <p>"Lisbet," said the minister gravely, "thou didst not well to utter a deception to
                  her father, although it was judicious not to reveal the truth. I have seen
                  instances where premature opposition from a parent has driven matters to an
                  unfortunate crisis; therefore it is better Mr. Harding should remain in ignorance
                  for the present. It is in my power to act the part of a friend to both parent and
                  child in the matter, and in thine too, if thou art ruled by discretion."</p>
               <p>"I'm none of your boasters, sir, but you might go a day's journey and find none
                  discreeter. Men is very fond of saying that our sex can't keep secrets, but that's
                  a label that they ought to have pasted on their own<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000026"/> tongues for accusin' innocence. Hows'ever you may
                  try me and judge for yourself, your Excellency."</p>
               <p>"Well, my girl, I like not many words, but doubtless thou wilt be cautious in this
                  matter."</p>
               <p>"La, sir! there is n't a closer mouthed person in all Boston town. Nobody says
                  fewer words; and indeed I'm no ways fond of lettin' my tongue run, I warrant
                  you."</p>
               <p>"It is necessary to know the object of thy lady's affection, in order to discern
                  whether it be a worthy one or no."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I've took care of that! I have my suspicions there, too, but can't be certain
                  quite yet. No longer ago than last Sabbath I sees a soldier-like gentleman, a
                  stranger, sir, and the minute I set eyes on him, says I, that's the object! I
                  shouldn't a been gazing round the church (though I did keep a sharp eye on the
                  service) except for feelin' it a duty-like to guard my dear young lady, being
                  motherless, and it falls on me to have a care over her youth. I'm young enough
                  myself to be talking so, too, but experience is better than age, much better, and
                  I've had sights of that any way."</p>
               <p>"I have seen the youth thou speakest of, and fear there is too much ground for thy
                  surmises. He wears the look of a worldly man, and hath a dangerous aspect."</p>
               <p>"He is just the one, sir, to take my lady's eye. She never favors the meek and the
                  humble. Not she! I'll know if it's yon wolf in lamb's clothing before I sleep this
                  night, sir!"</p>
               <p>"And be cautious in thy communications to me. It must not appear that we have any
                  secret matter between us. Go now, good Lisbet, keep a guard on thy lips, and what
                  thou doest, do it in love and meekness."</p>
               <p>Lisbet hastened home and was (opportunely for her purpose) summoned to assist at
                  her lady's toilet. "Now," thought she, "here is an excellent opportunity, nothing
                  could be better!" And taking the long, fair tresses in her hand, and placing
                  herself so as to secure a view of her mistress' face as she sat before the mirror,
                  with no little address she cautiously approached the subject by speaking of the
                  talented young minister, whose eloquence had turned so many transgressors from
                  their sinful ways. Alice sat silent with her eyes fixed on vacancy, paying little
                  heed to Lisbet's edifying comments.</p>
               <p>"He is a chosen saint, is Mr. Mildman, and I know of more than one lovely lady
                  that's half dead only for love of him."</p>
               <p>"Fie on thee, Lisbet! Thou dost belie our sex's modesty!"</p>
               <p>"Never a whit, mistress, for what can ladies do but love such a dear soul, and not
                  to blame for what they can't help, neither! If I had the making of womankind there
                  should be nothing but a cold, hard stone<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6366-00000027"/>
                  in the place where the heart is put now. But heigh ho! men is so cruel they'd be
                  sure to invent a new way of breaking it in two. Indeed, my dear lady, I could name
                  names if I would, but I can keep a secret, that I can. I'm no mischief-maker, not
                  I, thank heaven!"</p>
               <p>"Thou shouldst never credit a story to thy neighbor's hurt, good Lisbet."</p>
               <p>Lisbet pouted at this rebuke, and mattered that she thought it "no great harm for
                  a lady to be in love if she chose to be. Indeed," she added, "there's a handsome
                  young stranger come to town, and if I'm not mistaken he'll break more hearts with
                  his lovely black eyes than I have fingers on my two hands this minute."</p>
               <p>At this mention of the stranger, Alice started so suddenly from her seat that the
                  comb was jerked from Lisbet's hand and cast upon the floor. The girl, now in high
                  glee at her discovery, apologized for running the comb into her sweet head, which
                  was doubtless the cause of her starting in that violent way. "And to think, my
                  dear lady, that I should hurt you so as to bring all the blood in your body into
                  your face and neck in a moment!" and having accomplished her design so
                  successfully she thought it best to say no more, at this time, on the subject.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>"ALICE! Alice, my girl! come down, I say, and give thy welcome to the son of my
                  dear friend Ned Stanley. What have I been about that I saw him not until now, and
                  he never knew that my home was here! A fine story, truly, that the boy should be
                  loitering around the town for so long and I never know a breath of it, and he a
                  stranger all this time, to be sure, when he should have been like our own!"</p>
               <p>At the word "stranger," something seemed to whisper Alice that this was the
                  unknown, which intimation threw her upon her guard, and she received Edward
                  Stanley with a calm and placid dignity, that betrayed no signs of a former
                  recognition.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding's pleasure at the meeting was great, although damped by intelligence
                  of the death of his valued friend, the father of our hero. The evening was spent
                  mostly in reminiscences of their past lives, and at its close Mr. Harding said, as
                  he laid his hand familiarly on Edward's shoulder, "Well, well, my boy, right glad
                  I am to see thee. Thou shalt find us no strangers to hospitality in this New
                  World. Remember<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6366-00000028"/> ber thy claim on me is
                  one of long standing; forget I am not thy parent and ask of me what favors I can
                  command."</p>
               <p>Thus were these young and susceptible persons thrown together, and thus as the
                  most natural, and under the circumstances, inevitable consequence, a mutual
                  attachment soon followed. And yet no suspicion of the truth flashed across the
                  mind of Mr. Harding, though had Alice at that time permitted her lover to lay the
                  subject before him he would no doubt have given his delighted consent to their
                  union, when the proper time should arrive.</p>
               <p>Edward often importuned her for permission to do so, but she earnestly besought
                  him to delay. "No, no, not yet," she would say, "papa will only tell thee to wait
                  until thy beard shall grow, or perhaps he will advise a journey to Europe, and
                  then I shall lose thee altogether."</p>
               <p>For awhile nothing could exceed Mr. Harding's kindness, but ere long his manner
                  toward Edward became constrained and embarrassed, and soon a decided coldness was
                  perceptible. Edward's conscience smote him sorely for his want of candor, and he
                  now represented to Alice that it was the abuse of his friend's hospitality that
                  had forfeited him his esteem, but she was unaccountably averse to acquainting her
                  father with their circumstances, and still begged for a short delay until his
                  groundless prejudice should have time to wear off. At last. Edward, unable to
                  fathom the mystery of her conduct, or longer to endure the changed looks of Mr.
                  Harding, came to the house but seldom, and then he was forced to behold the tears
                  of his lady-love and to listen to her tender reproaches. It was now she accused
                  him of becoming weary of her love, and the fabric of their golden dream was
                  threatened by internal storms and mutual loss of confidence.</p>
               <p>In all this unhappiness Mr. Mildman's agency may readily be detected. He was kept
                  faithfully informed of every step made in the affair, and the conduct of Alice was
                  influenced in a great measure by him, through the girl's representations. By
                  feigning the warmest sympathy with her lady she easily won her confidence, and
                  became the repository of all her hopes and fears. And Mr. Mildman, while he
                  professed the greatest friendship for young Stanley, did not hesitate to carry on
                  a system of deception with both him and Mr. Harding, poisoning the mind of the
                  latter against him in so insidious a manner as completely to screen himself from
                  any suspicion of malice, and at the same time always careful to say nothing
                  against the former which Mr. Harding could take hold of as a tangible
                  accusation.</p>
               <p>The early training of Alice was not calculated to fit her for the crosses of life.
                  She had been the petted child, the flattered maiden, the honored and absolute<pb
                     n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6366-00000029"/> mistress of her father's household, and
                  she expected to pass through life, receiving the homage of affection (as a matter
                  of course) without contradiction. Over the minds with which she had hitherto come
                  in contact, she had held unlimited sway.</p>
               <p>In short her will had outgrown her reason, and she by no means relished the
                  wholesome prunings of the former, although necessary to the health and perfect
                  development of the latter.</p>
               <p>She looked upon Edward's course as one calculated to bring her to terms, and
                  rebellious pride came to the rescue of her wounded affections.</p>
               <p>Lisbet saw this, and aptly encouraged the feeling, "Indeed, my lady," she would
                  say, "man is a natural tyrant. La, bless you now, what kind of a lover is it that
                  can't give up to a body; and what will he do when he's a husband? Mercy on me! I'd
                  as lief live with a ragin' lion! When a body knows for certain, as you do, my
                  dearest lady, that your father (which you're bound in love and duty to obey,
                  though you're not obliged to render obedience to a lover, leastways not
                     <emph>before</emph> marriage), that your father is bent agin the thing, and
                  would say 'No,' slap down, and like enough forbid him to look on your sweet,
                  lovely face again; why, I say, if such a lover persists in askin', he only
                     <emph>wants</emph> to be said 'No' to."</p>
               <p>Yet after all Lisbet was misled in her deductions, for she was ignorant of the
                  depth of her lady's affection, regarding it as a fitful fancy which would soon
                  pass away and be replaced by another, perhaps still more fleeting.</p>
               <p>But there were times when all Alice's tenderness returned, and when, no human eye
                  beholding her, she wept sadly over her vanishing dream, and bitterly blamed
                  herself as the sole cause of her own and Edward's misery. Then again she was gay
                  and cheerful as ever, her naturally hopeful spirit bearing her up and picturing to
                  her eye a bright and happy future.</p>
               <p>In fact Edward and herself were becoming daily more estranged, and Mr. Mildman
                  began to flatter himself that the breach between them was almost past healing. Mr.
                  Harding's home was no longer the pleasant scene of other days, for constraint had
                  crept in between parent and child, which both felt painfully, though neither
                  seemed to know the remedy. The society of the young minister became almost
                  necessary as a cloak to conceal their discomfort, and Alice rejoiced that her
                  father had such a friend, both on his own account, and because it left her more at
                  liberty, and Mr. Mildman found many opportunities of diverting her attention from
                  herself in such a manner as to render his companionship almost desirable even to
                  her.</p>
               <p>This was the condition of their affairs at the time when the acquaintance between
                  Edith and Alice commenced, and, though with characters so widely differing, they
                  found in each other's society a rare and delightful attraction.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>LISBET had now gained an unfortunate ascendancy over her mistress' mind. She even
                  persuaded her that she was deserted by her lover, and not only so, but that his
                  devotion was proffered at another shrine. Meanwhile, Mr. Mildman continued
                  gradually gaining ground with the fair one, in whose mind the love of coquetry
                  threatened to take the place of a once purer and brighter flame. Encouraged by her
                  treacherous maid, she at last resolved to try if jealousy would not bring back the
                  truant lover to her feet. The minister being the only convenient person at hand,
                  would serve as a safe object on whom she might play off this innocent device. Now
                  this was exactly the plan Mr. Mildman had arranged for her, "for," said he, "let
                  her only give me so fair a pretext, and the prize is all my own."</p>
               <p>Poor Alice; poor, silly little fly!</p>
               <p>As we said before, Edward occasionally came to visit her and she lost no time in
                  showing off this new game before him. Apparently she scarcely noticed his first
                  looks of wonder, then of pain, although in secret her heart beat with new hopes as
                  she read their language; and the minister, on his part, received her favors with
                  the humility of conscious unworthiness, not presuming to interpret them as more
                  than gratifying marks of kindness. This encouraged her to proceed still further,
                  and the infatuated girl, blinded by ill advice, exulted in the unhappiness she was
                  causing.</p>
               <p>And now another motive urged her on, as we have seen in the last interview with
                  the unfortunate Edith. Mr. Mildman fearing the opportunity might slip by, began
                  cautiously to build upon the favor so graciously accorded, which Alice excused
                  herself for, on the ground that he had interfered in her affairs. The charge,
                  however, was but a random stroke, for in reality she saw no reason for the
                  accusation.</p>
               <p>Thus then we leave her, secure in her own resources, hopeful, and sometimes
                  trustful, and herself unconsciously unjust, unfair, and bent upon her own
                  destruction.</p>
               <p>To return after this long digression, to our story. Full of her new scheme for
                  making the influence of the minister serve her friend, Alice on the following day
                  equipped herself for a walk and took the way on which she was most sure of meeting
                  Mr. Mildman. Her expectations were not disappointed, and an unusually gracious
                  "good-morrow" soon brought him to her side.</p>
               <p>It was considered in that prudent time an act of high indiscretion for a youth to
                  be permitted to escort a<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6366-00000031"/> maiden in her
                  walk; and indeed the least approach to familiar intercourse between the sexes was
                  regarded as inconsistent with religious gravity and womanly reserve. And more than
                  this: grave magistrates discussed these sad offenses, and while the affrighted
                  culprits stood before them, decided upon the penalty to be inflicted upon him who
                  had the temerity to approach his profane lips too near the sanctuary of a lovely
                  cheek, which, willing and unresisting bent to the salute, like the rose that bows
                  her head to the kisses of the bold though trembling dew-drops. Yet we know of no
                  time in the annals of the past when that naughty little rogue, Cupid, did not
                  elude the attacks of his most bitter enemies; and doubtless even in that day the
                  downcast eye and blushing cheeks told the same tale as now, while the enamored
                  youth, watchful of his opportunity, whispered in honeyed words his welcome and
                  heart-stirring avowal.</p>
               <p>But the minister of that day was a privileged individual, and walked above
                  suspicion. And so Mr. Mildman kept the place he had taken by the side of Alice,
                  and (I fear) did not confine his attention to the subject of his legitimate
                  ministration.</p>
               <p>"Fair Alice, it well pleases me to see thee with that bright bloom on thy cheeks
                  this morning. Thy sickness could not have been severe which deprived us of thy
                  company but last evening."</p>
               <p>The bloom deepened a little as Alice answered that it was only a slight
                  indisposition that had annoyed her.</p>
               <p>"May I inquire if thine errand is one of charity to the poor, though praiseworthy
                  gossip Golden?"</p>
               <p>Alice thought' that her errand <emph>was</emph> one of charity, though not perhaps
                  to the worthy gossip, and she replied, that she "did purpose going that way."</p>
               <p>"She doth speak well in praise of thy bounty to her, and of thy other virtues,
                  also."</p>
               <p>"Nay, an' she speaks so, it is not well but ill. It pleases me to see her this
                  morning, and I merit no praise for the deed."</p>
               <p>"Thou doest thyself injustice, gentle one. Indeed I have often noted thee, and
                  admired thy womanly bearing and wisdom beyond thy tender years."</p>
               <p>"Call me not wise, I pray you, for wisdom is a grace I covet not. It doth but
                  bring frowns and wrinkles to the brow, and heaviness to the heart, I ween."</p>
               <p>"It doth bring gravity, fair Alice; but wisdom is a heavenly gift, and much to be
                  desired. What, without wisdom, should guide our councils in these dark and
                  troublous times, or keep our church firmly knit together amid so many strifes and
                  dissensions?"</p>
               <p>"I am but a silly girl, yet I would be so rather than a man and have wisdom. For,
                  speak of it as you will, it doth often harden the heart and lead to cruelty."</p>
               <p>"Nor would I have thee other than thou art—a fair and lovely woman, inclining to
                  pity rather than to justice<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6366-00000032"/> ice, and
                  excusing the transgressions which it is our sterner duty to punish."</p>
               <p>"Nay, Mr. Mildman, I am not such a silly girl that I can relish naught but
                  flattery; and as for man, he is too often harsh and cruel, and then calls his
                  deeds by the names of duty and justice."</p>
               <p>"I know it is sometimes so; and the influence of woman's gentleness is needed to
                  subdue our less yielding nature. Dear lady, I will be thy pupil, and thou shalt
                  tutor me as thou wilt."</p>
               <p>"I spoke but of civil rule, and doubtless my words were idle. But it was only
                  yesterday that methought there was talk of some poor wretch whose life was forfeit
                  to these same unyielding laws. I pray you tell me what was the sin for which he
                  must so dearly suffer?"</p>
               <p>"Was it of these stubborn heretics, the Quakers, that the talk ran? I know of none
                  other under so deep a shadow at this time."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; now I remember me, it was so, and my foolish heart sank at the thought
                  of blood. I trust my father has naught to do therewith, for it would grieve me to
                  feel myself shrink from his caresses, which I know right well I should do were his
                  hand darkened with that hateful stain."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Alice, talk not so wildly, I entreat thee! Thy father has the peace and
                  welfare of our infant colony at heart, and he doth with his ripened judgment,
                  wisely assist in framing laws for its protection."</p>
               <p>"But is it not in Holy Writ, that they who rule shall do so in love and
                  meekness?"</p>
               <p>"It is; and we have tried milder means to check this froward people, but in vain.
                  What then is left us but to enforce the laws, and preserve our rising congregation
                  from the contagious influence of this great danger?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! it is a hard and unchristianlike thing for men to take each other's lives
                  thus, and I marvel at their cruelty. Surely all in the council spake not for
                  blood? Was there none to uphold you when <emph>you</emph> spoke, as was fitting in
                  the servant of God, for milder measures?"</p>
               <p>"Alice, I fear to lose thy favor, yet I spoke as I thought fitting in God's
                  servant, in behalf of my defenseless flock. For it is my task to watch over them
                  like a careful shepherd, and to cry out against the wolf, heresy, which prowls
                  about our pastures, and seeks to lead the tender lambs astray."</p>
               <p>"Now, indeed, I see it all. It was through you that my father gave his voice for
                  blood! I did wonder that his tender heart had not rather erred in mercy. You can
                  not gainsay it? Well, I see. I will hasten home and entreat him to wash his hands
                  of this most dangerous matter."</p>
               <p>"Alice, Alice, hearken but a moment! Thou dost mistake me, indeed thou dost. The
                  act has already cost me many a pang, for I knew not it would seem so<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000033"/> hard and grievous. Believe me it was done in too
                  much haste, and I have since feared it may lead to ill."</p>
               <p>"And do you, indeed, repent that it was done?"</p>
               <p>"I do, I do—in that it displeases thee."</p>
               <p>"Not for my sake, but for your own I would see you, as God's minister, the friend
                  of the suffering and unfortunate; the mild pleader in their behalf, and not their
                  unrelenting judge. This, indeed, were meet for the followers of our meek and lowly
                  Master. But my father? I can not rest while this fearful weight is on him, and I
                  must hold you still in condemnation until your influence has undone the work it
                  wrought in him."</p>
               <p>"And when I have done thy bidding, fair one, what reward, I pray thee, shall be
                  mine?"</p>
               <p>"The reward of a quiet mind, of sweet, untroubled dreams, and the blessings of the
                  poor and defenseless."</p>
               <p>"And naught beside?"</p>
               <p>"My father shall thank you for saving him from the pains of remorse, and my
                  gratitude shall be measured with your merits."</p>
               <p>"Alice, as many commands as thou layest upon me, consistent with my sacred
                  calling, shall be executed. Only tell me wherein I may pleasure thee and thou
                  shalt find me as tender and meek-hearted, yea, as <emph>loving</emph> as thyself
                  canst wish!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, it is not for my pleasure, but as a duty you owe to God and to your
                  brethren." And now she stood upon the step at the worthy gossip's door, ready to
                  dismiss the minister with a parting farewell, but he detained her a moment with
                  these words:</p>
               <p>"Dear Alice, I entreat thee to bear in mind that matrimony is a holy condition, to
                  which we are commended in the sacred volume."</p>
               <p>"Far too holy with thee," soliloquized the laughing girl, as she closed the door
                  somewhat hastily behind her, leaving the minister standing on the outside, quite
                  sanguine of the progress he had made in her favor.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>ON the evening of this eventful day, about the time when we left poor Edith
                  struggling with the waves for her life, Alice stole away from her own quiet home
                  to seek a few moments' converse with her friend. Her usual summons to the door
                  was, to her surprise, unanswered, and finding it unfastened, with a foreboding
                  fear she pushed it open and entered. Looking eagerly into every room, and seeing
                  neither of its inmates, she thought for a few moments that they had been persuaded
                  to quit the scene of their danger and escape to a kindlier home. She sought for
                  some parting token of Edith's love, "for," said she, while tears of regret chased
                  each other down her cheeks, "the sweet girl would not have left her friend without
                  some sign of affection." The next moment, however, convinced her that she was
                  mistaken, for every thing about the house betokened their expected return. On the
                  table was an open book, and the old man's spectacles lay upon its page, the chair
                  on which he usually sat was pushed aside as if he had but that moment arisen
                  therefrom. In Edith's chamber things wore their accustomed aspect pect. Here stood
                  her embroidery frame, and in the silken fabric was her needle with its half-used
                  thread.</p>
               <p>Alice wondered what should keep them abroad at this late hour, for John Morrison's
                  health was so feeble that he rarely exposed himself to the chill evening dews. She
                  would not allow herself to think of the possibility of her friend having become
                  the inhabitant of a prison, and hoping every minute would bring the wanderers
                  home, she waited until the shadows took imaginary shapes of fear, then reluctantly
                  turning to go, she fled with hasty steps and anxious heart toward her own
                  dwelling.</p>
               <p>But upon nearly reaching it, she heard the sounds of an unusual disturbance in the
                  street through which she was obliged to pass, and wishing to screen herself from
                  view, she took hasty refuge in a dark alley, from which she could observe what was
                  going on. She was rejoiced to find that she had escaped the annoyance of being
                  thrown among a boisterous and disorderly crowd, but what was her terror at
                  beholding in the center of the throng, and securely guarded to prevent escape, no
                  less a person than John Morrison himself, who, completely aroused from his
                  accustomed serenity, addressed himself to those nearest him in earnest tones and
                  with supplicating gestures. Her next look was for Edith, but she saw her not, and
                  the jests and hootings of the mob prevented her catching the words that fell with
                  passionate energy from the lips of the distracted father.<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000035"/> Her first impulse was to rush forth and inquire for
                  her friend, but fear kept her concealed, and she was enabled to learn something of
                  her fate from the remarks of the passers-by.</p>
               <p>"Here is a Quaker fairly quaking, and a goodly sight it is to see," said one.</p>
               <p>"What says he?" asked another; "does he beg for mercy, as he ought, or is he
                  raving about the hirelings and the priests of Baal?"</p>
               <p>"He is doing neither, goodman, but crying out lustily for one he calls 'Edith.' I
                  know not who it is; his gossip, may be."</p>
               <p>"No, no; it is his daughter, a promising branch of heresy. Why didn't they bring
                  her along too and hang them both up together?"</p>
               <p>"Nay; I hear the Evil One has her soul already. He took her off, body and bones,
                  this blessed day."</p>
               <p>"And now he says they have robbed him of his child, eh? Well, an' they had, it
                  were a goodly thing."</p>
               <p>"It would be giving back an imp to Satan to let him have her again. He's no fit
                  person to have the rearing of a young one."</p>
               <p>"Drowned! did you say? Alack! how was it, goodman?"</p>
               <p>"Alack! and why alack, pray? Yes; I say drowned, neighbor."</p>
               <p>"How was it, how was it, neighbor Goodenough?"</p>
               <p>"It is said that hearing her father was a prisoner and would be hanged, she ran
                  down to the bay and did throw herself into the water."</p>
               <p>"It were no cause of wonder that the man should be distressed, for they say these
                  Quakers have feeling, for all their straight-facedness."</p>
               <p>"The brutes have as much, I warrant me."</p>
               <p>"Poor man," said a tender-hearted father, "an' it were so that his daughter is
                  drowned, I am right sorely grieved for him."</p>
               <p>"Hush, fool!" answered his goodwife, as she poked him with her elbow, "none of
                  that, if thou wouldst not feel the lash on thy back, standing at yonder post. Thou
                  knowest 'tis sin to pity those ranting heretics."</p>
               <p>"Here comes Joe Makefast; I had the whole story from him. Come, Joe, tell thy
                  tale. What was it about the drowning?"</p>
               <p>"The drowning, eh? Why, simply this, that there was a woman drowned. I had it of
                  one who should know—an eye-witness."</p>
               <p>"And what said the witness, good Joe. Tell us, pray."</p>
               <p>"Why, he says this: He saw a woman standing on the ridge out yonder, and thought
                  he heard screams. It was near dark, and what he did not see he guessed at. But she
                  leaped into the water in a mad, frantic-like way, and that was the last he saw of
                  her. It was so far out she could never reach the shore alive, and most like was
                  dashed on some of them sharp rocks and killed<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000036"/> outright. And now yon old dotard misses his
                  daughter, and they do say it was no other but she. I hope it was, rather than an
                  honester body."</p>
               <p>Alice had heard enough to fill her with horror and dismay. She scarcely waited for
                  the crowd to pass by to issue from her hiding-place and fly to her own chamber in
                  breathless haste. The night was spent in an agony of grief and distraction. Her
                  friend was doubtless gone, and the poor old father's fate scarcely less certain.
                  Her heart ached for him, and she strove to devise a way to comfort him. Suddenly
                  she thought of Mr. Mildman's promise, and determined to move him in behalf of the
                  prisoner. Then again she dreaded placing herself in his power so much as to tell
                  him her connection with these unhappy persons. So she decided at last that she
                  would herself go to the prison and confer with John Morrison upon the subject. At
                  any rate, he should know that he was not alone in his distress. Toward evening she
                  summoned Lisbet, and informed her of her intention of visiting the prison at
                  nightfall, and directed her to furnish some disguise for them both.</p>
               <p>Lisbet's surprise at the announcement was very great, although it did not equal
                  the alarm she felt when she learned that the Quaker and his daughter were both
                  well known to her mistress, and that the latter had been her dearest and most
                  familiar friend. She earnestly remonstrated against so rash an undertaking taking,
                  but in vain. Lisbet had never been in such a quandary. She could not now hasten to
                  Mr. Mildman for advice, for although she had acted the spy in the love affair, so
                  faithfully, <emph>this</emph> was another matter and might involve very serious
                  consequences. She knew that the sin of offering kindness to one of that hated
                  sect, was accounted almost as great as that of belonging to their number; and it
                  would never do for the minister, of all persons, to know it, for aside from other
                  considerations, Lisbet began to suspect that his motives were not quite so
                  disinterested as she had at first supposed, and the knowledge of her young lady's
                  last and fatal step might lose her the honor that was in store, of one day
                  becoming the wife of so distinguished an individual. Beside, the danger to herself
                  was not her last thought; but she had little time to deliberate, and at the
                  appointed hour found herself standing with her mistress at the prison-door.</p>
               <p>Alice was well screened from view in her full cloak and close-fitting hood and
                  velvet mask, and she stood quietly in the shadow of the door-way, while Lisbet
                  parleyed with the gruff but kind-hearted jailor.</p>
               <p>"Joseph, I have come to ask a favor of thee."</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha, thou hast, eh? Thou needst not ask it then, for I have favored thee too
                  much already, thou graceless girl."</p>
               <p>"Oh, very well! I know of one that will. So good-by to thee, thou cross,
                  ill-favored man!"</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6366-00000037"/>
               <p>"Don't hurry, don't hurry now. Let's see what it is, Lisbet. In a scrape, girl?
                  Come now, tell me. I can keep secrets tight as well as some other things."</p>
               <p>"Joseph, I know thee for a discreet and kind soul, but thou hast not caught me in
                  a scrape, but a poor friend of mine here," and lowering her voice she
                  whispered—"one of the heretic gang, come to tell yon old dotard of his daughter.
                  Let her in, Joseph, dear, out of pity."</p>
               <p>"Thou makest friends with the heretics, dost thou? That is well! The governor
                  shall hear of it in less than an hour, and I shall have thee here in my nice
                  little box. Ha, ha," said he, rubbing his hands, "why now, wouldn't that be right
                  pleasant. Wouldn't it, eh?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Joe. I'd make trouble for thee. Thou'd be only too glad to open the
                  door and let me out of thy hearing."</p>
               <p>"Hark, Lisbet, thou wouldst make a goodly show with thy head through yonder
                  nice-fitting aperture and the lash waving over thy fair shoulders. And who but Joe
                  Makefast will husband thee after thy fine elevation. Answer me that, sweetheart,
                  answer me!"</p>
               <p>"Have done, Joe, and let this poor damsel in. I risk much in befriending her, but
                  my tender heart was storm-stayed when I found her crying out here under the wall!
                  I told her I knew thee for a good soul and had some knowledge of thee, such as a
                  modest maid may have with one of thy sex, and would speak a kind word for her with
                  thee."</p>
               <p>"Well, go along in; but remember thou shalt marry me for this, or my name's not
                  Joe Makefast. Yon old man is sore distressed, and if thy friend—I say <emph>thy
                     friend,</emph> Lisbet—has comfort for him, she's welcome to bring it along.
                  Here, this way, this way."</p>
               <p>As they entered the cell where the prisoner was confined, he raised his head from
                  the table upon which it leaned and at the sight of Alice's muffled figure, started
                  forward with a look of eager questioning. But as she threw off her mask and lifted
                  her agitated face to his, he turned away with a deep groan of disappointment, but
                  the next moment hastily inquired if she had brought him any tidings of
                     <emph>her?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Alas! I have naught wherewith to comfort thee, but am come hoping to hear
                  something of her fate and to tell thee that there is one who grieves with
                  thee—that thou art not alone in thy sorrows."</p>
               <p>"I thank thee, my child, I thank thee. Thou, too, didst love my gentle one, and
                  thy tears are as balm to my soul. There is little left on earth for me now. I am a
                  crushed and broken-hearted man and feel that my spirit nears its home. This is my
                  chief joy; yet it warms me still to feel thy sympathy. May our Parent above reward
                  thee for this kindness!"</p>
               <p>As soon as Alice could speak for weeping, she informed the prisoner that her
                  errand was in part to<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6366-00000038"/> confer with him as
                  to the best means to be used in obtaining his release, or if that should be
                  impossible, to take some measures to secure his comfort in the jail, which his
                  delicate state of health rendered necessary.</p>
               <p>"Again, I thank thee, Alice, though it matters not. My days here are numbered, and
                  it is little hurt my bitterest enemy can do me now. Bodily comforts bring not
                  mental ease, but rather leave the mind more free to dwell upon its misery.
                  Farewell, my child, and do not risk thy own safety in coming here again. At yonder
                  bar, Alice, tinder thy name shall be written, 'I was sick and in prison and she
                  visited me.'"</p>
               <p>Unable to speak her farewell, Alice took the old man's hand in her own and pressed
                  it to her lips, then turned to leave the cell. But just at this moment the key
                  grated in the lock, the door swung upon its hinges, the terrified face of the
                  jailor looked in and was withdrawn, and in another instant Mr. Mildman, mute with
                  astonishment, stood before her.</p>
               <p>Alice returned the minister's looks of surprise with too much grief and sympathy
                  in her mind to leave room for any anxiety on her own account; while Lisbet, deeply
                  mortified at being discovered by the dear saint whose counsels were her especial
                  delight, put the corner of her apron into her eye and began to sob and bewail her
                  misfortune. Mr. Mildman in a low voice begged Alice to dismiss her handmaid,
                  adding that he himself would see her safely home.</p>
               <p>"Thou mayest go, Lisbet, and should my father inquire for me, tell him—"</p>
               <p>"That thy mistress is under my protection and will soon be with him."</p>
               <p>Lisbet courtesied low as she reluctantly passed through the door, near which,
                  however, she purposed remaining, doubtless in order to catch the pearls of wisdom
                  she expected would fall from his gifted lips, but it happened that the blessed
                  youth read somewhat more deeply into her thoughts than she intended, for he
                  followed her forth and saw her safely beyond all danger of eaves-dropping. In the
                  passage she encountered her friend the unlucky keeper, upon whom she vented her
                  disappointment with some asperity.</p>
               <p>"Get along with thee, thou fool, and never say thou lovest me after bringing the
                  godly man upon me in this fashion. But what should I expect? for never yet did I
                  know of a man that had any wit at his fingers ends. No it's we weak vessels that
                  holds out in a storm!"</p>
               <p>"There now, Lisbet, an' I were thy husband I might consent to be hen-pecked, so
                  please thee to wait a little for that now. Didn't I cough, and hem, and wink at
                  thee to keep behind the door, and slip out when the minister's back was turned?
                  But no, thou'd not see me, not thou! It was all eyes for his reverence, and none
                  for me. I did my best, so spare me, now duckling, I pray thee."</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6366-00000039"/>
               <p>"Duckling, forsooth! When I choose to be a fowl it shall be one with a sharp bill,
                  and afoul of thine eyes thou'lt find me, thou stupid dolt! Couldest thou not have
                  locked the dear soul (always with reverence), into another cell right quickly; and
                  as soon as thou hadst let us out, discover thy error with a goodly show of
                  penitence?"</p>
               <p>"Sweet Lisbet, when thou be'est my help-meet thou shalt teach me such tricks of
                  jugglery. But come now and look more cheery or thy sadness will be like to break
                  my poor heart in twain."</p>
               <p>"More like to break thy head by far. Go along and unlock yon iron gate that I may
                  get me away from the sight of thee."</p>
               <p>"Not a peg do I stir till thou give me a kind word, and the minister is coming too
                  and shall catch thee again, else—"</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, good Joe, open the door, I pray thee. I did but yesterday scout Job
                  Hobnail for thy sake. Hasten!"</p>
               <p>"Well, say thou dost hate Job, say it now, Lisbet."</p>
               <p>"I do indeed, come now—"</p>
               <p>"And dost affect me."</p>
               <p>"I am heart-sick for thee, indeed I am!"</p>
               <p>"Nay now, thou art joking."</p>
               <p>"Not a whit! Sweet Joe, the minister comes, let me forth."</p>
               <p>"Well, go along, and remember thou art pledged to me!"</p>
               <p>"I'll pledge myself now never to get into thy clutch again, thou villian, so
                  good-by to thee, Joseph Make-fast—that can't <emph>keep</emph> fast," and the
                  deceitful Lisbet disappeared around the nearest corner.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>AS Alice walked homeward by Mr. Mildman's side she related, at his request, the
                  circumstances of her first acquaintance with Edith, and the object she had in view
                  in her visit to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>"One pleasant afternoon I strayed down to the beach and climbed out upon the rocks
                  that overhang the water, leaping from stone to stone, until I had gone some
                  distance from the shore. Not sufficiently heeding where I stepped I placed my foot
                  upon a slippery stone and fell over the side of quite a steep rock, into the
                  water. In falling I caught at the branch of a shrub, which fortunately grew from a
                  fissure in the rock, and thus my head was kept above the water. It seemed to me a
                  long time before any answer to my screams was heard. The water chilled me and the
                  weight of my clothing dragged me downward, and I was about to let go my friendly
                  shrub in despair, when to my great joy I heard a voice bidding me keep a firm hold
                  a moment longer. Soon a cord or band, made of portions of clothing torn into
                  strips, was let down to me from above. In the end of it was a loop through which I
                  was directed to pass my head and arms. This I did, by holding with one hand at a
                  time to the branch. My friend exerted all her strength to draw me upward, and I
                  endeavored to assist myself by taking hold of such bushes and rocky projections as
                  offered themselves to my hands. On reaching the top of the rock, I fainted from
                  the effects of fright and exhaustion, and upon recovering, found my head pillowed
                  on Edith's bosom, and her hands bathing my temples with cool water. It was to this
                  brave girl I owed my poor life, and who can blame me for loving her and wishing to
                  afford her father some little comfort in his distress?"</p>
               <p>"I am myself too much in her debt to blame thee. But why heard I not this tale
                  before? I never knew thy precious life was so nearly lost to all who love
                  thee."</p>
               <p>"It was at her request I kept the secret. She dreaded being brought into notice,
                  on her father's account chiefly, and I promised her to reveal it to none, unless I
                  could one day save her by doing so. And now the time is come, and my father shall
                  hear the story ere I slumber."</p>
               <p>"Let me counsel thee to remain silent for the present. Since our conversation
                  yesterday, I am more than ever convinced that the present course pursued toward
                  this people is an injudicious one, and only last evening I opened the subject with
                  thy father, whose tender conscience I find easily turned to a course of<pb
                     n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6366-00000041"/> more lenience. I can accomplish thy kind
                  wishes the more readily, methinks, than if he knew of these circumstances, for,
                  perchance, he might be moved with anger against these Quakers for encouraging thy
                  friendship, as thou knowest, Alice, he would blame any other than thyself.
                  Therefore set thy mind at ease concerning this aged man, for I will procure him
                  both bodily comforts and spiritual counsel, and, perchance, may be favored to
                  rescue him as a brand from the burning. Remember, also, that thou hast my promise
                  to serve thee, and hesitate not to claim my service in any future emergency."</p>
               <p>According to his promise, Mr. Mildman's influence in the council was exerted in
                  behalf of the prisoner, and through these means he was furnished with a
                  comfortable apartment, and allowed the use of "wholesome books," and the freedom
                  of the jail yard. However, he seemed to take but little note of these privileges,
                  for, although his grief was silent, it was deep and absorbing, and, indeed, he was
                  too much of an invalid to enjoy them. Alice was not again permitted to visit him,
                  but she found opportunities, through Mr. Mildman, to furnish him with many little
                  comforts and delicacies. He was grateful for the efforts made to alleviate his
                  distress, but firmly rejected the spiritual counsels of Mr. Mildman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding could not but see that something was upon his daughter's mind. But he
                  was persuaded by her altered treatment of the minister, that she felt a growing
                  kindness toward him. It delighted him greatly to observe her preference for him
                  over young Stanley, for at one time he feared she felt too much interest in that
                  "graceless boy."</p>
               <p>Alice tried her best to conceal her distress, and to appear cheerful and happy in
                  her father's presence, and when he saw her fits of abstraction, he said to
                  himself: "It will all be well, soon! I see, I see—the girl's in love, though she
                  don't know it yet, and my reverend young friend is wise in waiting for the proper
                  time to ask my sanction. The little puss is troubled in her conscience. She knows
                  she has no right to fall in love without my permission; but she has it, she has
                  it, and a goodly pair it will be. I shall have my child with me still, and son
                  Mildman will only be here a little more, that's all!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>THE grief of Alice at the loss of her friend was not alleviated by the fact that
                  of late she had seen nothing of Edward Stanley. While under the anxiety of
                  providing for the comfort of the sick and aged prisoner, and the excitement caused
                  by Edith's disappearance, she lost sight of the probable consequences of her
                  growing intimacy with Mr. Mildman; but as soon as quiet brought her time for
                  reflection, she was struck with dismay at finding herself entangled in a web,
                  partly of her own weaving, and helplessly, almost hopelessly, did she confess to
                  herself that she was about to become the victim of her own well-arranged scheming.
                  The remonstrances of her friend against so dangerous a course, now recurred to
                  her, and that earnest and solemn warning seemed to return like a voice from the
                  tomb. "How," she asked herself, "shall I answer this to Edward? how convince him
                  of my unswerving affection?"</p>
               <p>As if to escape from these thoughts, and hoping chance might throw her in his way,
                  she went forth, little heeding whither. Unconsciously led by her feelings ings,
                  she wandered to a quiet spot where they had sometimes met. It was a shady
                  cedar-grove, through which ran a rippling stream. Looking about her, to her joy
                  she espied a manly form leaning against a tree. It was her own Edward. His back
                  was toward her, and he was apparently absorbed in meditation. With a light step
                  she flew to his side, and, laying her hand upon his arm, looked up into his face
                  with a joyful smile. He raised his head, and without otherwise changing his
                  position, he returned her greeting with a cold and steady gaze. His face was pale
                  and sad, but did not express displeasure; it was something deeper she read there,
                  that told of mental suffering. Her heart smote her, for she knew it was her doing,
                  and, with tears in her eyes, she withdrew the untouched hand from its
                  resting-place. He spoke, and his voice trembled with emotion:</p>
               <p>"Alice, you bade me trust you, and I have trusted."</p>
               <p>"Edward!" she said, reproachfully, "thou canst not doubt my love."</p>
               <p>"Have I not just cause to question it?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed thou hast no real cause, for my heart has never swerved from thee."</p>
               <p>"Then answer me this, Alice. How stands the minister with thee?"</p>
               <p>She looked up quickly as if to speak, then looked down again confused, and replied
                  that she "desired him to stand only as a friend."</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6366-00000043"/>
               <p>"And are his desires as moderate as thine? Thou art silent—and yet dost thou avoid
                  his presence?"</p>
               <p>"I did, indeed I did, until—"</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, Edward, and I will tell thee all. Thou knowest of my love for the
                  young Quaker girl and how our affection began. Well, I saw that she to whom I did
                  owe my life was in danger, and that there was no escape for her but through his
                  influence—" here Alice paused again, and Edward continued—</p>
               <p>"And it was through thee that the man of blood became the advocate for mercy. Is
                  this so?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not blame me if it be! What did I not owe to Edith, and with the power to
                  save her or soothe her father's sorrow, wouldst thou have had me remain silent and
                  inactive?"</p>
               <p>"Thou didst owe her a debt of gratitude, I know; but was thy love to her so great
                  that my happiness and thine own must needs be the sacrifice? It were indeed right
                  to employ all just means in her behalf, but not to tamper thus with his peace of
                  mind, with thine, and with my own."</p>
               <p>"Alas, if I had but heeded her friendly counsel! I never thought to risk thy peace
                  of mind, for thy happiness is my first thought—my dearest care. Look not so coldly
                  upon me, I pray thee, for no other than thyself shall ever claim my love and duty.
                  Not even my father's command shall move me to an union with another other. Edward,
                  forgive my thoughtless errors, and let me be as I once was to thee!"</p>
               <p>"That may never be! Thou hast erred, but I believe it was thoughtlessly, and with
                  the hope of serving thy friend. I speak not now of the lightness of thy coquettish
                  conduct on former occasions, for I forgive thee that, great as was the pain it
                  caused me. But now thou art too far compromised to make an honorable retraction. I
                  leave thee then to fulfill the expectations thou hast raised. I release thee from
                  thy vow to me, and leave thee free to follow thy own fancy. It were better so, for
                  all hope of thy father's acceptance of me is now vain. Thou weepest, Alice, but
                  woman's tears are fleeting. Her smile soon chases them as the sunshine banishes
                  the shade from yonder landscape. <emph>My</emph> grief is too deep to pass away in
                  tears."</p>
               <p>"Edward," answered Alice, and pride spoke in her uplifted head and calmer tone, "I
                  see thou art weary of the tie that binds us, and desirest to cast me from thee. It
                  is <emph>man</emph> whose heart knows but the touch of sorrow, while woman's lies
                  crushed and broken by his short-lived affection."</p>
               <p>"Add not unkindness to thy folly, maiden. Thou hast trifled away the peace of one
                  true soul, and perhaps will trample upon the happiness of another. I do not ask
                  thee to think of me, for that will be a crime when thou art the wife of another. I
                  will strive to banish thy image from my mind, and in the storm of<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000044"/> conflict with savage foes forget, if possible, the
                  greater tumult within. Alice, forget that such a being as Edward Stanley ever
                  crossed thy path, and be happy. Fare thee well."</p>
               <p>She would have spoken, but her lips refused her utterance; she would have clasped
                  the hand which for a moment held her own, but her icy fingers refused to close
                  upon it; she would have rushed forward and thrown herself upon his bosom, but her
                  feet were rooted to the spot whereon she stood, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>Gone and forever, to battle, to danger, perhaps death, driven away by her. Her
                  Edward; alas! he was her's no longer, he had cast her love from him. She sank upon
                  her knees on the bed of withered herbage, and wrung her hands in agony. Then a
                  hope sprung up within her bosom, he should not go, she would send for him and tell
                  her father all, and he should do her justice. Homeward she flew, with difficulty
                  restraining herself from running in unseemly haste along the thoroughfare. She
                  reached her chamber, wrote him hastily a few impassioned words conjuring him to
                  come to her, if only for a moment, ere he departed. Then she called Lisbet, and
                  gave the note into her hand, bidding her hasten with it to Mr. Stanley.</p>
               <p>Lisbet went forth bearing the olive branch, and she <emph>did</emph> hasten with
                  it toward Mr. Mildman's dwelling. On her way thither she met young Stanley, and
                  involuntarily she paused and hesitated. He also paused as expecting her to accost
                  him; but she passed on, and neither spoke. She placed the note in the hands of the
                  minister.</p>
               <p>"Thou hast done well, Lisbet; thou may'st go."</p>
               <p>Lisbet returned from her errand, and her mistress inquired if she had seen
                  Edward.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear lady, I did see him."</p>
               <p>"Did he say aught to thee?"</p>
               <p>"The young master said—'thou hast done well, Lisbet; thou may'st go.'"</p>
               <p>This was consoling. It was an expression of pleasure at the reception of the note.
                  He had commended her messenger for bringing it, and he would come. She was so
                  light of heart that she seemed to walk on air. Every sound startled her and made
                  her heart leap. Her father was delighted to see his darling so gay; it was long
                  since he had so much enjoyed an evening. But the hours waned and her heart began
                  to sink as they flew, and her cheeks, which in the early part of the evening had
                  worn the brilliant hue of excitement, grew pale as death when the signal was made
                  for retiring. As her father gave her his goodnight kiss he held her in his arms a
                  moment and gazed upon her with mingled pride and perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Alice, thou must not let love steal all thy roses!"</p>
               <p>She retired to her chamber, and dismissing her officious maid, mechanically
                  prepared for bed. She did not weep, for her heart seemed frozen within her<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6366-00000045"/> bosom. She knelt to her accustomed
                  prayer, and for the first time since her tiny hands were folded at her mother's
                  knee, she could not call upon her heavenly Parent; she had no words with which to
                  address her Maker. Then she lay down upon her bed with her hands crossed upon her
                  bosom, and remained so still, so statue-like, that she seemed as one from whom
                  life itself had departed.</p>
               <p>When Lisbet came in the morning to assist at her lady's toilet she found her ill
                  with a burning fever. Alice was weary of life, and hoped her time had come to die,
                  but after a few days' languishing, during which no complaints passed her lips, she
                  found herself recovering. Nothing could exceed the affectionate care which her
                  father lavished upon her, and Mr. Mildman came several times a day with anxious
                  inquiries. He guessed the cause of her illness, and said to himself—"It was only a
                  passing fancy—her second love will be of more healthful growth. I may soon urge my
                  suit now. Woman's heart ever awakes to wedded devotion."</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding was delighted when his daughter again appeared in the sitting-room,
                  and when he looked across the table at her pale face, he said, "the poor child is
                  weak and languid, but she will be well soon, and then her cheerfulness will
                  return. She is too feeble yet to receive enjoyment. I marvel that my reverend
                  friend does not speak to me!"</p>
               <p>Alice now took no pains to avoid the minister. She felt that she was
                  compromised—she could never love him—but one day she might make her father happy
                  by becoming his wife. Her morbid feelings led her to look upon herself as the
                  victim of circumstances. She was cast off by him she loved so truly, unkindly cast
                  off—and what remained for her but to atone for her faults in the manner pointed
                  out to her by her former lover. Yes, she deserved to suffer this penalty and she
                  would prepare herself for the sacrifice.</p>
               <p>In fact, Alice looked upon life through a false medium. She had experienced the
                  disappointment of her first blossoming hopes, and the world was now a bleak and
                  barren place—the summer flowers were withered, and only the bitter herb of
                  endurance left for her to taste. More than ever she now felt the loss of her
                  dearest friend. She needed her strength to lean upon, her counsels and her tender
                  sympathy.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>AS soon as she was able she went down to that deserted home to look once more, and
                  perhaps for the last time, upon all that remained of Edith. As she entered the
                  door, tender memories rushed upon her, and she sank upon a seat, overcome with
                  sorrow. They were the first tears she had shed since her parting with Edward, and
                  betokened the return of her feelings into healthy channels.</p>
               <p>Suddenly she was startled by the sound of a footstep upon the threshold, and
                  immediately a stranger entered and stood before her. His respectful bearing gave
                  no cause for displeasure, and with a courteous air he apologized for his
                  intrusion.</p>
               <p>"I crave your pardon, fair maiden, but I knew not of your presence here, and felt
                  no uncommon interest in the appearance of this deserted dwelling. I would these
                  silent walls could tell its history."</p>
               <p>"Could they speak they would indeed tell a tale of sadness."</p>
               <p>"You knew somewhat of its inmates, then. Will you gratify a stranger so far as to
                  tell me of their history tory? Forgive my seeming boldness, for it is no idle
                  curiosity induces me to ask such great indulgence."</p>
               <p>"I would first know whether it is asked in friendship or in enmity to the
                  unfortunate."</p>
               <p>"In friendship, doubt not, fair maiden, and with the hope of being able to serve
                  the unfortunate—surely not to injure them."</p>
               <p>There was a calm dignity in the bearing of her auditor which carried with it an
                  assurance of sincerity, and Alice no longer hesitated to comply with his request.
                  His troubled look on hearing that John Morrison was in prison bore testimony to
                  the interest he felt in his welfare.</p>
               <p>"This is indeed unfortunate. And his grief for Edith, was it violent?"</p>
               <p>Alice looked up in surprise at hearing her friend's name thus familiarly spoken,
                  and bethought her if she had mentioned Edith otherwise than as the "old man's
                  daughter." She replied that although his grief could not be called violent, it was
                  deep and excessive, and had wrought sorely upon his already enfeebled condition.
                  She did not dare to mention that he was befriended in this hour of need and trial,
                  but she could not forbear adding that she had thought herself the only friend of
                  Edith Morrison.</p>
               <p>The young man smiled as he replied that he had himself indulged in that delusion,
                  and that Edith was too considerate of their safety to mention the name of<pb
                     n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6366-00000047"/> either, even to the other, since by so
                  doing she might expose them to danger.</p>
               <p>"And didst thou, too, know her worth and modest virtues?" she asked, as tears
                  again started into her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Not over well, fair lady. My acquaintance was of recent date, yours, doubtless,
                  was of longer standing, as your grief for her loss would indicate."</p>
               <p>"I never knew a sister's love, yet it seems to me that I must have felt it toward
                  that sweet maiden. Thou knowest naught of her death, then?" she inquired,
                  eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I did know somewhat of it," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Oh! then, I pray thee tell it me, that I may console yon afflicted parent with
                  sure tidings of his lost one. Grief is ever hard to bear, but mingled with
                  uncertainty, it eateth into the heart like a cancer."</p>
               <p>"There is no more needed to convince me that you are Edith's friend, and will not
                  use the knowledge I impart to her injury. I will tell you all I know of the
                  circumstance."</p>
               <p>Alice stood leaning forward, with her hands clasped upon her bosom, and her face
                  expressing the most intense interest, as the stranger pursued his narration.</p>
               <p>"It was late in the evening, not more than a fortnight ago, when, as I returned
                  from a fishing excursion, methought I heard the sound of a voice in distress
                  coming faintly over the water. I plied my oars with haste in the direction whence
                  I thought it came. It was so dark that I could see nothing unless the object were
                  very near, but after listening and watching most intently, I thought I espied a
                  white object appearing for a moment above the surface of the water, though, ere I
                  reached it, it was gone again. While waiting for it to reappear (if, indeed, it
                  were not a delusion of the imagination), I suddenly felt a heavy weight upon my
                  oar, and cautiously drawing it toward me, I found it clasped by the delicate hand
                  of a lady. I seized the arm and drew the form still closer. The darkness prevented
                  me seeing more than the general outline of the figure, and with much difficulty I
                  succeeded in lifting the apparently lifeless body into my boat, and hurried toward
                  the shore, hoping life might not yet be quite flown. My mother's dwelling was
                  near, and I lifted the dripping form in my arms, and bore it thither. Every means
                  to restore her were resorted to, for a long time in vain—but you are ill, dear
                  lady! I pray you be seated!"</p>
               <p>"No, no; heed me not, but for the love of heaven, tell me me does Edith live?"</p>
               <p>"Prepare yourself, then, for a joyful surprise! She does; at last she gave signs
                  of life."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" cried Alice, almost with a scream of joy. "She lives! my friend, my Edith!
                  Lead me to her, I beseech thee, without a moment's delay!"</p>
               <p>"My dear lady, your presence now, I fear, would<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000048"/> not benefit her. It is true she lives, although her
                  life hangs in a trembling balance."</p>
               <p>"I will watch beside her sick bed; my hands shall tend her with more than a
                  sister's devotion."</p>
               <p>"You must be patient. She has been at death's doorway, and only to-day turned her
                  face earthward. We have not known so much as her name until now, though I heard
                  somewhat which led me to fear her father was a prisoner, and I came forth at her
                  earnest request to seek him. She must not know this, and how shall I answer her
                  anxious questions concerning him?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! I fear these glad tidings come too late to him. His health has failed
                  rapidly since this sorrow fell upon him, and he looks upon his pilgrimage here as
                  drawing to its close."</p>
               <p>"Joy may do much to restore him. But how shall we contrive that he shall hear of
                  her preservation?"</p>
               <p>"I know of one who shall bear the intelligence to him, and, perhaps (though this I
                  dare not securely promise), through his means the father may be permitted to visit
                  his child. Thou mayest persuade her that for her own safety he forbears to come to
                  her to-day."</p>
               <p>"That is well thought of, maiden. Yet I must remind you that it is not without
                  danger to ourselves we dare thus offer protection to one of this maiden's sect. It
                  is not that I value my own safety, but there are those of whom I am sole
                  protector, and their security is most dear to me. We are not of the favored fold
                  which gathers beneath the shelter of the laws of these colonies, and although I
                  doubt not <emph>your</emph> good faith, I must be certain also of his of whom you
                  speak. I must know that the power you would influence will not in turn be directed
                  against the defenseless ones of my own hearthstone, who have kindly offered aid
                  and shelter to one who demanded their sympathy."</p>
               <p>"What thou sayest is just, and I feel that I am powerless. Wherefore should men
                  frame such cruel laws? Edith, then must know the worst, and the gray hairs of her
                  father descend to the grave in sorrow!"</p>
               <p>"I trust not; nay, it must not be so. Can you give me no pledge of your friend's
                  secrecy? Is there no chord of pity in his soul? Surely, maiden, if you could risk
                  the safety of your friends in his hands, he can not be so lost to human
                  kindness!"</p>
               <p>"I could risk their safety—if there be truth in man, which I somewhat question,"
                  she said, with bitterness. "It were unfair to expose you to a hidden danger. He
                  whose agency I would employ is no other than the Reverend Mr. Mildman. You shall
                  now yourself decide whether he shall know aught of the matter."</p>
               <p>"I have heard that his voice has been raised of late in behalf of this misguided
                  people, and it would betoken him a man of mercy. There are many I could welcome
                  more cordially into our councils, but since it<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000049"/> must be so (and he is called a man of trust), let
                  him come. God's care is greater in degree than even man's treachery."</p>
               <p>"It was surely his hand guided us both here to-day, and my heart doth thank him.
                  Tell that dear girl thou hast seen Alice Harding, and that I wait her better
                  condition with impatience that my eyes may be gladdened by beholding her once
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Fair maiden, I leave all with you. Woman's tact will aid you where I am
                  powerless. May He speed your errand, and to-morrow I will be here, at this
                  self-same hour, to hear the good or the evil tidings you may bring me."</p>
               <p>Alice hastened home, and sent immediately for Mr. Mildman. She unfolded to him,
                  with caution, the joyful discovery she had made, and obtained, not without some
                  argument, his concurrence in the arrangements she had planned. She accomplished it
                  the more readily, because he was gratified that something had occurred to divert
                  her mind from its own sad thoughts. Each step thus taken gave him additional
                  security of his reward, and so he was sometimes led further than, under other
                  circumstances, he could have been induced to go.</p>
               <p>It was therefore arranged that on the following evening, John Morrison should see
                  his daughter, and persuade her that she must not expect him again for the present,
                  since it was unsafe for him to be seen abroad during the day, and Edith knew that
                  the state of his health forbade exposure to the evening air. When she grew better
                  and stronger, she must be informed of his real situation, and the ameliorating
                  circumstances attending it would go far toward reconciling her thereto, especially
                  as he was more safe in his present condition than before his imprisonment, because
                  he was then liable to an arrest at any moment, and to much more rigorous treatment
                  than he was now receiving.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>WHEN Edith began to arouse from her lethargy she looked around her in perplexity.
                  A dim consciousness of her own existence hovered about her, as standing on the
                  confines of another world, life wore to her vision a shadowy and uncertain aspect.
                  For some time she wavered between sleep and waking, and very slowly the objects
                  around her began to assume the form of reality. As memory arose from oblivion, the
                  sound of rushing waters was still in her ears, and she seemed to feel the motion
                  of their waves. Then it was morning, and her father's voice summoned her to arise.
                  At last, with a strong effort, the chain which bound her spirit was burst asunder,
                  and once more she was living in the present, though scarcely less bewildered than
                  before, by the strangeness of every thing around her. The hangings of her bed, the
                  window in the wrong place, the unfamiliar pictures gazing upon her from the walls,
                  and now the kind motherly face that bent over her, the low voice speaking so
                  soothingly, the cool hand placed so gently upon her forehead—whose were they? And
                  where was she, thus kindly cherished in a stranger's home?</p>
               <p>"Ask no questions yet, my love, you are with friends;" and a pleasant drink was
                  offered to her lips, after which drowsiness again stole over her and she sank once
                  more into forgetfulness. This time however, it was a calm, restoring sleep, from
                  which she awoke refreshed and invigorated.</p>
               <p>The motherly lady still sat beside her, holding her hand, and when she saw Edith
                  was awake, she administered some nourishment, which the patient thought had no
                  taste in particular, after which she smiled upon her kindly, and said—</p>
               <p>"I will not be too tyrannical, my dear, and if you have any reasonable request to
                  make you may do so now."</p>
               <p>Edith's voice was very weak as she attempted to thank her for her kindness, and
                  inquired if she could see her father.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, my child—but remember first that it is important you should avoid all
                  exciting thoughts—where is your father to be found?"</p>
               <p>The truth now flashed upon her mind, and she knew that she must have been away
                  from him for some time, and that doubtless he had suffered great anxiety on her
                  account. With some agitation she asked how long she had lain there, and the kind
                  lady reading her thoughts, and not considering it wise to let her know the exact
                  state of the case, replied,</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6366-00000051"/>
               <p>"You have been here a few days, and shall see your father; only tell me his name
                  and the place of his residence."</p>
               <p>This she did, and as we have seen, Louis had gone immediately in quest of him.
                  Meanwhile, as the lady advised, Edith strove to calm her mind by turning her
                  thoughts to Him who had so mercifully restored her to life, and succeeded in
                  regaining her composure.</p>
               <p>It would be difficult to tell whether she or her attentive nurse was more desirous
                  of asking questions of the other, though both refrained from doing so for the
                  present.</p>
               <p>As there is no particular reason why we should follow their example, we will
                  gratify our curiosity by looking somewhat into the history of these newly-found
                  friends of our heroine.</p>
               <p>Sir Roger Hermon, the late husband of this estimable lady, lost his life some
                  years before in the service of his beloved monarch, the unfortunate King Charles.
                  He was the younger son of an old and noble family, and won distinction in the
                  civil wars in which the nation was then plunged, but paid for his dearly-bought
                  honors with both life and possessions.</p>
               <p>His widow, finding neither peace nor safety in her native land, and fearing to
                  lose her only son in the storm which threatened to sweep away all trace of loyalty
                  from the realm, bade farewell to England, and landed, with her little family and
                  the remnant of their fortunes, on the New England shore.</p>
               <p>They had now lived in Boston for several years in the most strict seclusion,
                  avoiding with scrupulous care any action by which their position should be made
                  conspicuous. In accordance with the statute, they were in the habit of attending
                  the services of the Congregational—then the established church of the Colonies—for
                  Mrs. Hermon had already felt too keenly the consequences of openly defying the
                  popular power, to dare again its relentless vengeance. Yet she carefully instilled
                  into her children's minds the doctrines of her mother Church of England, and
                  taught them to cherish as their dearest privilege the hope of one day avowing
                  their religious sentiments.</p>
               <p>Being a woman of superior education and high intellectual attainments, she was
                  able to bestow upon them a degree of culture they could not otherwise have
                  attained, and strove to instill into their minds every noble sentiment, and to
                  guide the enthusiasm of character, which was theirs both by nature and
                  inheritance, into the purest channels.</p>
               <p>Louis now repaid her devotion with the warmest love and admiration which a son can
                  lavish on a parent. He longed to adopt the profession to which his father's life
                  had fallen a sacrifice, but being the only protector upon whom his mother and
                  gentle sister could lean, he<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6366-00000052"/> abandoned
                  the idea, and devoted himself to the very opposite one of medicine.</p>
               <p>Angeline was still a child—a fond and loving one—one of those beings who lean upon
                  others' strength—dependent on the affection.</p>
               <p>But there was another member of Mrs. Hermon's household, toward whom her eye never
                  turned without unconsciously expressing perplexity. Henriette was all that
                  remained to her of a beloved brother. She was an orphan, and had been under Mrs.
                  Hermon's care from early childhood. To a striking deformity of body, she united a
                  still greater one of mind, and from her aunt's first acquaintance with her, her
                  character seemed formed. Though singularly susceptible to intellectual
                  cultivation, Mrs. Hermon's labors, morally, fell upon an unyielding soil.
                  Henriette was keen-witted and intriguing, and her propensity to sarcasm indicated
                  a painful degree of bitter feeling toward her kind. But the trait which gave her
                  aunt the greatest anxiety was her want of truth.</p>
               <p>The only person to whom this singular girl had ever been known to yield a point
                  was Louis, nor would she to him when she suspected he was acting upon his mother's
                  instigation.</p>
               <p>Such were the members of Mrs. Hermon's family, and it was here that Edith found a
                  preserver and friendly hands to minister to her necessities.</p>
               <p>Since that evening when Louis brought in his lifeless burden and consigned her to
                  his mother's care, Mrs. Hermon's attentions had been unremitting, her kindness
                  unbounded. As Edith lay there in her dripping robes, a tender pity sprang up in
                  the matron's heart and hovered like a ministering angel around the motherless and
                  outcast girl. For they saw by the fashion of her garments that she belonged to the
                  sect called "heretic," whom they were forbidden to assist, even in the most dire
                  necessities of hunger, sickness, or other calamity, and against whom the doors of
                  human love and divine pity were by a stern law commanded to be kept firmly closed.
                  But no such law had power to bind the heart of this heroic woman. There was an
                  appeal in that pale countenance which she did not for a moment think of resisting,
                  and when the first signs of returning life were visible, tears, such as saints may
                  shed, fell upon the face of the unconscious Quaker's child.</p>
               <p>Edith was soon wrapped in dry, warm clothing, and placed in a comfortable bed. And
                  now for the first time Louis was questioned as to the circumstances attending this
                  unlooked-for event.</p>
               <p>"Some mother's heart is well-nigh broken this night, I fear," said Mrs.
                  Hermon.</p>
               <p>"Or some lover's," sneered Henriette.</p>
               <p>"Mamma," whispered the trembling little Angeline, "do you think she meant to do
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"We can not tell, my love, but I trust not."</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6366-00000053"/>
               <p>The same idea had occurred to both Louis and his mother, and they exchanged
                  glances of intelligence, as he remarked, "It may be that she was driven to
                  desperation by those stringent laws lately enacted against that sect."</p>
               <p>Henriette laughed scornfully, as she replied, "Or that her pretty face has been
                  her ruin."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon's face was expressive of the deepest pain at these words, for she
                  could not but admit the possibility of their truth, and she thought, in such a
                  case, it were better she had perished. But the next moment she reproached herself
                  for the thought, and rejoiced that if it were true, the poor girl had still time
                  left her for repentance.</p>
               <p>"My children, let us admit no harsh or hasty judgment, for we know not what
                  anguish that young heart may have suffered, or that her purity of mind is not far
                  greater than our own. With us she shall have every kindness, and may the pleasure
                  be ours of restoring her to those who love and mourn her."</p>
               <p>Late that night Louis and herself sat in consultation upon their most wise and
                  prudent action under these difficult circumstances. They had discovered nothing
                  about her person which gave them any clew to her name. A small gold locket,
                  fastened about her neck by a chain, they opened, and found that it contained a
                  lock of brown hair, much the color of her own. It would not do to notify the
                  authorities of the occurrence, for besides bringing themselves into notice, and
                  not only putting it beyond their power to bestow any further kindness upon her, it
                  would probably subject them to a severe penalty for what they had already done,
                  and expose the unfortunate girl and her friends to extreme severity. It was
                  therefore decided that on the morrow Louis should quietly endeavor to ascertain
                  whether the thing were noised abroad, or if inquiries were known to have been
                  made, or search for the missing one.</p>
               <p>Being a stranger to most of the citizens, he could not address himself to them for
                  information, nor could he wisely venture any inquiries without the risk of
                  exciting suspicion or of being questioned in return. He heard therefore only
                  incoherent rumors of an elopement, in which the Evil One himself figured
                  conspicuously, and of a crazy Quaker having been committed to the jail on the
                  previous evening, and although he strongly suspected that the latter was a friend
                  or relation of the unfortunate girl, he had no means of ascertaining whether it
                  were really so or not, or of definitely knowing any thing of the circumstances.
                  The only thing then left for them to do, was to keep the whole matter as quiet as
                  possible, at least until Edith should recover sufficiently to tell her own
                  story.</p>
               <p>The poor girl had suffered so much mental anxiety, that it could not be without
                  its influence upon her frame, and such causes as these combined with the<pb
                     n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6366-00000054"/> effects of her accident, contributed to
                  produce the fever from which she was now prostrate. Her illness was long and
                  severe, and the attention of each member of the family was demanded, by turns,
                  beside her sick bed. Even Angeline was frequently called upon, and proudly did she
                  fulfill the duties of her important post. In watching that pale suffering face,
                  and performing such offices as lay within her ability she soon learned to love the
                  unconscious maiden, thus thrown upon the kindly shore of her own hospitable
                  home.</p>
               <p>Henriette sometimes watched beside her too, but in so doing her heart was not
                  moved to tender or subduing emotions. To see that she was beautiful was to insure
                  her hatred, and beside, there was something in the solemn loveliness of that pure
                  colorless face that reproached this singular girl for her cruel suspicions.
                  Henriette felt it too, and hated her all the more because she knew she had injured
                  her.</p>
               <p>One day when her aunt was wearied out with watching she was summoned to take her
                  place in the sick-chamber.</p>
               <p>As she stood at the bedside, the locket which hung around Edith's neck attracted
                  her attention. She had seen it opened on the night when first Louis brought the
                  fair girl there, and knew they said it contained only hair. Something now struck
                  Henriette as she looked at it, and leaning over the bed she took it in her hand
                  and pressed the spring; it flew open and disclosed the hair. But on viewing it
                  more closely she thought she saw another spring within the first opening. She
                  placed her finger upon it, and the face of a very beautiful female was before
                  her.</p>
               <p>Had Mrs. Hermon but seen what Henriette now looked upon, how would the sight have
                  thrilled her with surprise and tenderness! How would she have cherished that
                  motherless girl on her own maternal bosom, nor ever thought to drive her thence
                  through coldness or distrust! How much misery had been spared herself, her son,
                  and that unconscious sufferer.</p>
               <p>So slight is sometimes the barrier between us and what we would most desire. Thus
                  we struggle with the phantoms of to-day, when but a vail of gossamer hides the
                  truths of to-morrow from our view. We turn from the straight path that lies before
                  us—the path of right—to grope for some hidden way that leads to happiness.</p>
               <p>Henriette closed the locket hastily, for she heard Louis' step approaching the
                  chamber. The young physician stood beside the bed and placed his finger upon the
                  wrist of the patient. Henriette watched his countenance as he bent over the sick
                  girl, and read the look of anxiety which softened into tenderness as he gazed.</p>
               <p>"He never looked so upon <emph>me,</emph>" she thought. "No, I am an object which
                  offends his eye. He loathes me, and he the only being I could love! Yes, I
                     could<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6366-00000055"/> grow beautiful in mind if not
                  in form beneath the life-giving warmth of his affection. I could be gentle as a
                  dove with him, but it shall be love or hate between us, and I can give him either!
                  And this girl—he has saved her life, and now comes her gratitude. Well, we shall
                  see! Let him but dare think of her and he shall feel, ay, and she too, what love
                  turned to hatred can work. I will not be alone in my misery."</p>
               <p>She resolved to watch for the first signs of more than a common interest in one
                  she now viewed as a rival, and was almost continually in the sick room, seemingly
                  anxious to engross the office of attendant there. So well did she succeed in
                  hiding her malevolence that Mrs. Hermon was highly gratified, and told her son
                  that she really thought his cousin's heart was reached at last.</p>
               <p>But although Louis could not see what purpose Henriette had to answer in thus
                  departing so widely from her previous course, he was suspicious of her motives,
                  and became himself more watchful of his charge, until the morning came when Edith
                  awoke from her long lethargy.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>"OH, mamma, is she not lovely, and did you ever see a sweeter smile?"</p>
               <p>"She is very patient and gentle, my dear. There is something about her peculiarly
                  attractive. I supposed that that unfortunate people sometimes controlled their
                  feelings to such an extent as to deaden them, but Edith seems to have reached the
                  happiest point, for while she is no way deficient in warmth, she holds herself in
                  such command as one of well-trained mind only can. She has told me this evening
                  how it all happened."</p>
               <p>"Oh, did she? I know by your looks she didn't mean to do it!"</p>
               <p>Here Mrs. Hermon recounted her story as we have already known it.</p>
               <p>"There, cousin Henriette! I knew she could not be the wicked person you thought
                  her."</p>
               <p>Her aunt's praise of Edith had already been more than Henriette could well bear,
                  and now looking up and, as she fancied, reading in Louis' eye a triumphant
                  justification of his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">protégée,</foreign> she arose in
                  haste and left the room.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6366-00000056"/>
               <p>"Angie! you should be careful not to offend your cousin."</p>
               <p>"I didn't mean to, mamma. I was so glad to find that Edith was not to blame, I
                  thought Henriette would be glad, too!" and the gentle child stole quietly up
                  stairs after her cousin, and tapped on her chamber-door.</p>
               <p>"May I not come in?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"I only wanted to tell you that I didn't intend to offend you."</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>"Can't I kiss you good-night?"</p>
               <p>"You may go kiss your new friend in the other room."</p>
               <p>Angeline was accustomed to her cousin's rebuffs, but the suspicion contained in
                  this wounded her pride.</p>
               <p>"If Henriette thinks I like new friends better than old ones, she 's very much
                  mistaken."</p>
               <p>So she wiped away a tear or two, and resolved to avoid Edith's room just now,
                  although she had intended to go there, because if she did go it would lend some
                  color to the unjust implication. She thought, however, as she was passing the door
                  she would just listen if all were quiet; and finding it so, she would only peep in
                  and see if Edith were asleep. She therefore stole inside on tip-toe—it was not her
                  fault that the floor creaked, which made Edith turn her head, and when she was
                  beckoned to, how could she avoid going all the way into the room and up to the
                  bedside? The invalid passed her hand caressingly over the flaxen curls, and
                  smiled. This was irresistible.</p>
               <p>"Mamma said I must not talk to you; but would you like me to sit here awhile if I
                  don't say any thing?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I would, dear little one. Thou may'st say what pleases thee, too, and I
                  will tell thee when I am weary."</p>
               <p>Angeline seated herself beside the bed, and took one of those transparent hands in
                  her own lovingly. Neither spoke again for some time, but each felt love kindling
                  in her heart toward the other, and the little girl thought how happy she should be
                  if Henriette were like this kind and gentle stranger.</p>
               <p>"Edith is mamma's name. May I call you so?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child, and I am glad it is so, for perhaps it will teach thee to love
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I do love you already; but that <emph>will</emph> teach me to love you more.
                  And," she added after a pause, "I wish there was some reason why <emph>you</emph>
                  should love <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"My dear little girl, I do, indeed, love thee! There are but few on earth to claim
                  my affection, and all the more readily doth it warm to thee and thine!"</p>
               <p>"Have you, then, no dear mother nor sister?"</p>
               <p>"Alas, no! But not long ago I had a mother as tender and loving as thine own."</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6366-00000057"/>
               <p>Angeline did not answer, but put both her arms around Edith's neck, and laid her
                  cheek to her's. Both were wet with tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh," she exclaimed, "I quite forgot what mamma told me. I have done very
                  wrong!"</p>
               <p>"It was all my fault, sweet one. It has done me good. A few more such visits, and
                  I shall need medicine no longer. But, Angeline, thou must not love me without thy
                  mother's sanction!"</p>
               <p>"Why may I not, dear Edith?"</p>
               <p>"Because of my father's religion. Thy mother may object to our friendship."</p>
               <p>Angeline was quite cast down by this. She thought if what her cousin had told her
                  about the Quakers were true, her mother would, indeed, object to an intimacy with
                  her new friend. She feared to ask the privilege, lest it should be prohibited, and
                  as she could not tell Edith this, she did not know what reply to make her.</p>
               <p>"But mamma loves you herself, and it can not be wrong for me to do what she does.
                  Beside the Bible says we must love our enemies."</p>
               <p>"And dost thou think the Quakers are thy enemies, Angeline?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, I didn't mean that, but—but—" the poor child became painfully
                  embarrassed.</p>
               <p>"But that we must love every one. Is not that it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Thank you! Mamma could not object to my loving you now, could she?"</p>
               <p>"No, not to thy loving me in a general sense. That is, just as thou art commanded
                  to love all the world. But why not ask her permission, Angeline?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Edith, she praised you this evening, and I'm sure she does not think I could
                  learn any harm of you, or else she would not let me stay with you here."</p>
               <p>"Ah, but she told thee not to talk to me."</p>
               <p>"But that was because you are weak, and it might hurt you."</p>
               <p>"Angeline, should I not be doing very wrong to encourage thee to do what thy
                  mother might condemn?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear child, it is not for want of love to thee that I say it, but
                  because I must not betray thy mother's confidence; but it is, perhaps, bringing
                  thee into danger for me to encourage thy affection, and I can not do so without
                  her knowledge and consent. Indeed, my sweet one, I had not spoken as I did to thee
                  at first, but that thy bright loving looks were so warming and winning to my heart
                  that I quite lost sight of all this sad and weary reality. Good-night, now, and
                  may thy young bosom never know as much as mine doth of grief and anxiety."</p>

               <p>Edith was in momentary expectation of her father's<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000058"/> visit. Mrs. Hermon sat beside her, endeavoring to
                  calm her agitated feelings, and when his step sounded below she pressed her lips
                  to Edith's forehead, and arose to leave the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh! do not go; let my father see one to whom we both owe so much!"</p>
               <p>In another moment they were clasped in each other's arms. Both wept, though for
                  some time neither spoke.</p>
               <p>"'For this my child was dead and is alive again, she was lost and is found!' It
                  was hard for me and for thee, too, my daughter; but His name be praised, thou art
                  restore to me."</p>
               <p>"My father, and how has it fared with thee? Who has cared for thy comfort in my
                  absence, or consoled thee in thy hour of trial?"</p>
               <p>"Friends arose to me, as to thee, in my sorrow, and for my consolation I have
                  looked to Him who alone is able to succor;" and turning to Mrs. Hermon, he added.
                  "And thou, friend, yea, sister, let me call thee, what shall I say to thee? To
                  thee and to thine do I owe this joy I never thought again to experience. My heart
                  doth bless thee! May God reward you, for He only can."</p>
               <p>After some conversation with his daughter, John Morrison took leave of her, first
                  warning her that she must not expect to see him again for some days, and giving
                  the reasons previously agreed upon between himself and Mr. Mildman. He also bade
                  her take no thought of him, as he was favored with kindness and attention even
                  greater than he could expect of her.</p>
               <p>She did not perceive that he had grown much more feeble, for the room was dimly
                  lighted in order to conceal this fact from her notice. He therefore left her quite
                  cheerful, under the impression that his comfort was well provided for. This was
                  indeed the case; though, had she known he was a prisoner, her apprehensions would
                  have been excited, and the anxiety she must have suffered might have proved fatal
                  in her already enfeebled condition.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon found an opportunity of assuring John Morrison, before he left her
                  house, that her utmost care should be bestowed upon his daughter, and that so long
                  as she required her protection it should be freely extended. Thus both father and
                  child separated with comfort and satisfaction in their hearts, and each blessed
                  the kind Providence who had raised up friends to them in their hour of trial.</p>

               <p>"COME hither, Alice; I have somewhat to say to thee."</p>
               <p>She placed herself upon her father's knee, and threw an arm over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"My child, art thou happy in thy father's home?"</p>
               <p>"Papa!"—the tears came, and she hid her face in his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Nay, my pet, I did not ask the question doubtingly. But, Alice, thou knowest I
                  may not keep thee always."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father, thou mayest keep me. Indeed I will never, never leave thee!"</p>
               <p>"There, there, don't cry; why, thou art making a woman of thy old father."</p>
               <p>"Let me be always thy own little Alice?"</p>
               <p>"And so thou shalt; for indeed they shall never separate us."</p>
               <p>Alice was a little reassured by this, although she still trembled, and hid her
                  face, fearing the worst was to come.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, look up, for I have pleasant news for thee. Didst think thy old
                  father was blind all this time—eh, Alice?"</p>
               <p>Her very heart stood still with terror.</p>
               <p>"Nay, now, never fear my censure. I know all about it, and thou hast my consent to
                  be as much in love as thou shalt please. I was once, and have not forgotten!"</p>
               <p>"Do not ask me to love any other than thee."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, I see thou art a true woman—they'll sooner die than confess it. But
                  thou needst not blush to acknowledge it now, for he has spoken to me, and hath my
                  free consent and approbation to urge his own suit with thee; and since I must give
                  thee up, there is none upon whom I could so willingly bestow thee. What! weeping
                  still? It is just as thy mother did when I first called her mine own. But dry thy
                  tears soon, my love, for thy betrothed will be here ere long, and this were but a
                  sad reception."</p>
               <p>"Father, bid him excuse my absence for this day. To-morrow—"</p>
               <p>"What saidst thou? not see him? Daughter, this is not the occasion thou shouldst
                  choose to be whimsical; a womanly dignity is more fitting. Thou didst not mean it,
                  surely! Our reverend friend tells me that thou hast given him some countenance,
                  though no more than a modest maiden and dutiful daughter may. He has, therefore, a
                  right to expect a kind reception. Go, then, and come down soon with thy
                     brightest<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6366-00000060"/> looks, for Mr. Mildman is
                  indeed worthy to possess thy affection."</p>
               <p>Alice obeyed her father in every thing except the "looks;" and when, by-and-by,
                  she did come down, she was indeed calm, but the lily would almost have been
                  ashamed beside her pale cheek. She seated herself by the window of her parlor,
                  which looked out upon a bed of flowers. In the glad spring-time, when her heart
                  was gay, she had sown the seeds from which these gaudy blossoms sprang. All faded
                  were they now in the autumnal days, as the withering blight of disappointment had
                  fallen upon her. Oh! that she had died while these bright hopes were young, nor
                  lived to feel her weary soul beating its torn wings against the bars of its
                  prison!</p>
               <p>She had been there only a little while when one stood beside her. She knew he was
                  there, but did not turn her head nor move. He took her icy hand in his and pressed
                  it against his throbbing heart. His warm lips pressed her cheeks, but the touch
                  sent no electric thrill through her frame. Her pulse beat with calm mechanical
                  regularity, and she did not withdraw from his embrace. A statue could not have
                  seemed more insensible to his presence. It would not have surprised him to find
                  her in tears, or to hear her protest that she loved him not. But he was quite
                  unprepared for this, and felt with deep pain that the chasm between them was wider
                  than he had imagined. He was alarmed, beside, to see her in this unnatural
                  condition.</p>
               <p>"Art thou ill, Alice? Shall I summon thy father or thine handmaid?"</p>
               <p>She shook her head negatively.</p>
               <p>"This conduct wounds me, Alice. Is it kind?"</p>
               <p>What could she say? She did not answer him.</p>
               <p>"I will relieve thee of my presence. Perhaps tomorrow thou wilt have one kind word
                  for him whose whole soul is bound up in thee. Have I merited this at thy
                  hands?"</p>
               <p>"I know—I know. It is my own fault."</p>
               <p>"Do not reproach thyself, dear girl. I have done what I could for thy
                  pleasure—though I speak not of it boastingly—but to show thee how thy wish finds
                  its second in my action. Alice, it shall be thus through life! Fear not, then, to
                  intrust thy happiness to one who will guard it as the miser guards his gold—as the
                  mother shields her babe from unknown dangers—ay, as the Christian cherishes his
                  soul, that dear pledge of immortality! I ask in return that thou wilt not close
                  thy heart against me. Have I thy promise, Alice?"</p>
               <p>"Thou hast it."</p>
               <p>"Then all is well. My truth thou shalt have no cause to question, and thine shall
                  be to me a rock of trust. Dear girl, we are bound by no idle pledge—no common tie.
                  Our betrothal is witnessed by angels,<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6366-00000061"/>
                  and our vow recorded among the things ordained to live forever."</p>
               <p>Whether Mr. Mildman loved Alice or not in those days when he first marked her as
                  his own, we will not say. But she had now become very dear to him, and the
                  protestations he made her were sincere. He resolved to win her affections in
                  return, that if indulgence and unfailing patience and devotion could effect it,
                  she should respond to his love.</p>
               <p>We commend his course to unfortunate youths who mourn over unreciprocated
                  affection. He did not weary Alice with his presence, although he was careful she
                  should know how much his self-denial cost him. He did not persecute her with
                  protestations, nor urged her to name "the happy day." She was grateful for the
                  delicacy of his behavior, and did not find it as irksome as she had fancied to be
                  Mr. Mildman's betrothed, and to know that there was one whose chief delight lay in
                  anticipating her very wish, and to whom her very faults seemed to endear her
                  more.</p>
               <p>But although she had before resolved upon this sacrifice of self to what she
                  looked upon as duty, heroic as the idea was, she found it very difficult in
                  practice, and but for the fact that she was allowed to wear her chain so lightly,
                  it would soon have become insufferable to her impatient spirit. She tried to keep
                  her promise, she strove to banish Edward's image from her mind, but the lingering
                  hope of one day meeting him again and becoming reconciled, would cling to her,
                  and, like a bird she had taught to love her, this thought still claimed a home in
                  her bosom, and though she drove it thence again and again, it returned as often on
                  its errand of love, and folded its bright wing on its accustomed
                  resting-place.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>EDITH was fast convalescing. She sat now, supported in a chair, still pale and
                  weak, but with the color of returning health stealing once more into her cheek.
                  Alice was on a low stool at her feet. It was her first visit to the invalid.</p>
               <p>Edith gazed long and earnestly upon the fair pensive countenance, for as Alice
                  raised her eyes to her's, she missed their sudden flashes of joyful brightness.
                  The once gay girl was surely changed, and her friend called to mind her rash
                  declaration, made on that quiet Sabbath evening, of the use she intended to make
                  of her influence over the minister. "Can it be," she thought, "that the kindness
                  of which my father spoke was purchased at the expense of this dear girl's
                  happiness?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Alice, for I was not permitted to question my father on the subject, who
                  are those friends of whom he speaks with so much warmth, whose kindness cheered
                  his lonely hours of sorrow? I know thou wert one, dear girl—and the others?"</p>
               <p>"I know of but one, Edith; and that one was Mr. Mildman."</p>
               <p>"And it was through thee!"</p>
               <p>"There was only a word from me. Thank him, if thou wilt thank any."</p>
               <p>"And his guerdon—what was it?"</p>
               <p>"Thinkest thou he is so base he can not do a kind deed but for guerdon?"</p>
               <p>"Think not I ask thy confidence, Alice. But I will thank no one until I know the
                  meaning of all this strangeness, at least not until I am assured that thy
                  happiness has suffered no shock, no change, therefrom."</p>
               <p>"My dream was over, Edith, ere that time came."</p>
               <p>"What meanest thou, Alice, that thy dream is over?"</p>
               <p>"Edith, when I saw thee last, I was a foolish trusting girl, who dreamed that such
                  a thing as happiness was in store for me. I awoke from that vain conceit, and am
                  now a woman, armed with will to subdue my softer nature, with scorn of the
                  love-sick fancies of yesterday. Years have passed over me since last I saw thee!
                  Therefore do not expect to find me the same, for youth is dead, with its gay and
                  airy visions, and another spirit dwells within my frame!"</p>
               <p>"Would I could think thee but jesting, Alice. Yet I feel thou art the victim of
                  some strange delusion. What, throw happiness from thee, and call it a sickly
                  dream! I tell thee life is not such as thou dost picture it. He who made us hath
                  given us capacity for enjoyment<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6366-00000063"/> ment,
                  and it is only the diseased mind which views life as a dull and wearisome
                  thing!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, thou hast never loved! And never mayest thou, for it is but another name for
                  misery! What if thou shouldst bind thy whole being up in one who vowed eternal
                  truth to thee—if thou shouldst take from thy heart its very life and place it in
                  his bosom, living only through him and almost forgetting the worship due thy
                  heavenly parent in an earth-born adoration? And then what if thou shouldst see him
                  cast thy gift from him and trample it in the dust, crushing out the very light and
                  life of thy existence? Where were thy belief in this world's good? Wouldst thou
                  not turn, weary, from the dull, plodding path before thee, and wish to hide thy
                  sorrow in the grave?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Alice, it is not, it can not be thus with thee."</p>
               <p>"It is. Yet do not weep for me. My tears are all shed, and my heart has grown too
                  hard for grief. Indeed I scarcely feel aught; sorrow hath little power over me,
                  and joy none. Edith, this world seems no longer a reality, and every thing wears a
                  dream-like and unreal aspect. Even though I hold thee here I scarce know whether
                  it is thou or some phantom wearing thy form."</p>
               <p>"I grieve for thee deeply, but not hopelessly. This strange humor shall have an
                  end. But—think not I would touch thy wound with other than a healing hand—where is
                  he whom thou callest false to himself and thee?"</p>
               <p>"I know not. It is my daily task to banish him from my remembrance, and if this
                  heart and life part in the struggle, it must be. Do not seek to awaken those dead
                  hopes from their ashes! Thou must help me to attain my victory."</p>
               <p>"Oh, place thy hope in Him who upholds the weak and strengthens the fainting soul.
                  If thy love has indeed been spent on an unworthy object, with His help thou shalt
                  take up thy burden, and be sustained beneath its weight."</p>
               <p>"Edith, He is far away. Since that day my faith and my love are cold, and God's
                  face is turned from my prayer."</p>
               <p>"Alice, either thou art wrong, or else all those dear promises are vain! Thinkest
                  thou to attain this conquest of thyself, or dost thou confess thy weakness and
                  call upon Him in child-like earnestness for aid?"</p>
               <p>"I feel not the will to be humble. Thou canst not know the bitterness of my wound.
                  Edith it is more difficult to confess my error to Him whose kindness and
                  forgiveness I am assured of, than to man, in whose bosom there is no chord of
                  pity. I did acknowledge my folly and ask to be received into his heart once more;
                  would perfect love have denied such a petition? Was my fault so great that no
                  excuse could serve? Oh, should he come before me now and say not even 'forgive,'
                  but 'receive me,' would not my whole soul spring into life once more? Alas what do
                  I say?<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6366-00000064"/> How wildly I am raving! I, the
                  betrothed of another!"</p>
               <p>"Alice!"</p>
               <p>"It is true."</p>
               <p>"Thou art not deceiving <emph>him?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Edith, he knows I love him not, yet he is content to trust me. I am, indeed,
                  unworthy his high affection. He loves me, and I am not ungrateful. Yes, in some
                  future time I shall even love him, not with the wayward passion of early youth,
                  but calmly and placidly as these fading autumn days glide away. This storm can not
                  last always, rest will come, and although the beauty of summer and the fruits of
                  autumn be swept away by the tempest, there is quiet in the wintery landscape,
                  there is repose in its icy bondage!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Alice, I can not bear to hear thee talk so! It must not be, and yet what can
                  I do to save thee? Why wilt thou not see thine error, but art bent thus upon thine
                  own destruction?"</p>
               <p>"Do not mourn so uselessly. It is destiny, and I must yield to its unchanging
                  laws."</p>
               <p>"There is no such thing as that thou speakest of! Did we but walk in the straight
                  path before us—the path of truth—following the better instincts of our nature, and
                  leaving the rest in the hands of God, we should have naught to fear. But some
                  shadow in the way affrights our timid souls, and we step aside, thinking by our
                  own wisdom to secure the end desired, and so we lose ourselves in a deceitful
                  maze, and sit down despairingly and cry out against 'Fate' and 'Destiny!'"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, blame me as thou wilt, my punishment exceeds my faults. Remember
                  this, and let it soften thy condemnation."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Alice, it is not yet too late to avoid the greatest fault of all!"</p>
               <p>"My happiness and my life are now of too little moment to strive for further. All
                  I ask or expect is to make atonement for the past by submission to the future.
                  Edith, I marvel thou wouldst turn me backward, for I thought thy friendly
                  encouragement would cheer me on!"</p>
               <p>"And so it should, could my conscience approve thy course."</p>
               <p>"Edith, if the gallows stood in thy conscience's way thou wouldst walk to it with
                  that same unflinching eye. So would not I, for out of pure fright I should turn
                  and fly."</p>
               <p>"There are some things harder to me than death would be, though my late lesson has
                  taught me life's value. But Alice, thou talkest of this victory. Promise me at
                  least this, that until self-conquest is achieved thou wilt not become the wife of
                  any."</p>
               <p>"And thus throw down my only prop? Dost thou think I would strive for it unless
                  bound as I now am? No, for then I should only nurse my grief and carry<pb
                     n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6366-00000065"/> it through life in my bosom. I should
                  sink at once into the easy lap of sorrow (for it is so in comparison with this
                  continual strife), and revel in its luxury!"</p>
               <p>"My friend, cast not from thee His aid and His comfort! Put away pride and
                  self-sufficiency, and humbly seek His footstool. I pray that this cloud may pass
                  from thy spirit, and the light of faith soon penetrate its mystery."</p>
               <p>"Sweet friend, I have done wrong to throw its shadow over thee, but I have longed
                  for thy sympathy, and the darkness is less already for its cheering ray. But
                  enough of this. I have seen thy friend, Edith, and time was when the dark orbs of
                  thy gallant knight might have endangered my heart's citadel. Beware, fair maiden,
                  put on armor of proof, for except that I should grieve to see thee a victim, it
                  would delight me to behold Cupid playing his pranks with my sober little
                  Quakeress!"</p>
               <p>As Alice said these words she bestowed upon Edith a parting caress and turned to
                  leave the chamber, when, to her great surprise, she suddenly came upon a little
                  bent figure, whose eyes glared upon her with an expression between contempt and
                  anger, but before either of the girls had time to recover from her astonishment at
                  this unexpected intrusion, Henriette abruptly left them.</p>
               <p>"Who is that strange creature, Edith? I trust she did not hear my silly jesting,
                  but what a look she gave me! Am I not almost annihilated? have I not shrunk to
                  half my natural proportions? Heaven preserve thee from her wrath, and me from
                  another such encounter!"</p>

               <p>"I WONDER what can be the matter with Angeline. Within these few days she seems to
                  have lost her natural gayety. Have you not observed the change in her, my
                  son?"</p>
               <p>"I have, and doubt not that Henriette is at the root of it. Come hither, my little
                  sister, and tell me why that face of thine wears such stately gravity!"</p>
               <p>"I suppose, brother, you think I am not wise enough to be grave sometimes."</p>
               <p>"Why, here is a precocious sage, truly. What, my oracle, my bird of wisdom, my
                  Pallas! Think of it, mother, Angeline has become suddenly wise. She has sprung
                  into it, like Jack's bean, all in a night!"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Louis, you shall not tease the child so! Go to your own dusty
                  volumes, Esculapius, and leave Angeline and myself to confer together!"</p>
               <p>"But I am all curiosity. Will you promise to enlighten me as to these strange
                  developments?"</p>
               <p>"We will make you no promises. Go, you are banished from our councils."</p>
               <p>"I submit to the powers that be; but whist, mother, perhaps my sister considers
                  herself sufficiently matured to be in love. And if so, I insist upon my right to
                  raise objections."</p>
               <p>"For shame, Louis, even to hint at such things!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I thought young ladies never had secrets of any other nature. At least that
                  they never kept any."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> thought, mamma, that none but women ever had any
                  curiosity!"</p>
               <p>"That shaft has pierced me. I am gone!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me, my love, is there any thing that troubles you? I think you are not as
                  happy as usual. My little daughter has nothing to conceal from mamma, I hope?"</p>
               <p>Angeline leaned her head against her mother's bosom as she answered, "I have done
                  something very wrong; will you forgive me, dear mamma?"</p>
               <p>"I hope, my dear, it is something which your sensibility exaggerates, and that it
                  does not really call for tears."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes it does, for I have deceived my mother!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me in what way, love, and do not fear to speak thy whole mind."</p>
               <p>"I wanted to make friends with a stranger, and did not wish to ask your permission
                  because—because I was afraid you would not approve."</p>
               <p>"I trust you have formed no improper acquaintance, or if you have, that it will
                  not be difficult to break it off, as it must be recent."</p>
               <p>"It was not exactly that, mother, for I loved her<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000067"/> before I thought you might disapprove, and so I
                  told her, and she loved me, too; and I was so happy to have found a friend. And
                  then the wrong came, mamma, for she told me that perhaps you would not consider
                  her a safe friend for me, and bade me ask you; and I tried to persuade her that it
                  was not wrong to love any body, because I was afraid you would forbid it if I did
                  ask you."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, whoever this friend is, her honorable conduct entitles her to our
                  respect; but what reason is there why I should object to your intimacy?"</p>
               <p>"Because she says it might be dangerous to me and to you and all of us, and
                  Henriette told me that if any body knew of it they might put us all in jail to
                  punish us."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean all this about Edith, my child?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mamma, I do."</p>
               <p>"And is this the reason why you have been so quiet and sad?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mamma. I felt so badly because I wanted to deceive you, and because I had to
                  stay away from Edith, and was afraid she would think I was angry or ill-tempered,
                  or else that she might suspect you had forbidden me to come to her; and that would
                  wound her feelings. But I could not see her without loving her more every time,
                  and so I staid away. And I hope it is not wrong; but I can't help loving her more
                  and more."</p>
               <p>"You have done quite right, my dear, to stay away from her and to tell me all
                  this, too. In my zeal for her I have lost sight of prudence, and we must not allow
                  our feelings to carry us away too far. Very soon she will be able to return to her
                  friends, and as we shall not probably see her after that, it would not be worth
                  while for you to form any intimacy. I am sorry, my child, to deny you this
                  pleasure, but you need no longer reproach yourself for what is past. Go, now, to
                  your lessons, Angeline, and let me see you once more happy and cheerful."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"You are looking brighter and stronger to-day, Edith."</p>
               <p>"Thanks to the kind care extended me, I am; but, dear lady, I would gladly begone,
                  lest my presence bring danger to those who have saved and sheltered me."</p>
               <p>"Edith, we must do our duty and fear not. Let not this thought distress you. My
                  child, you must long to see your father again."</p>
               <p>"It has seemed very, very long since he was here, and I would not ask that he
                  should come again. Dost thou not think I could soon go to him? Our home must be a
                  lonely place for him."</p>
               <p>"Not quite yet; we must risk nothing. Edith, you are in no condition to resume the
                  duties of a housewife. Have you no friends with whom you could both remain for a
                  time?"</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6366-00000068"/>
               <p>"I know of none. Could I but persuade my father to return to England, we were
                  better and happier there. But that is vain. Once more in our quiet home, my
                  strength will soon be quite, restored."</p>
               <p>"My child, you know your father has found friends. Since you have been here he has
                  been kindly cared for, his comfort well secured, and such attention paid his
                  feeble health as should be. He is more secure from the dangers you feared for him
                  than before, therefore do not be alarmed to hear that you would not at present
                  find him in your former home."</p>
               <p>"Where is he, then? Oh! speak, dear lady! What has happened? He has not gone hence
                  to return no more? Oh! say he has not!"</p>
               <p>"Surely not, my dear. Your father is as well in health as when you last saw him.
                  But when he missed you he was maddened by anxiety and apprehension, and incurred
                  the anger of the governor, who ordered him—"</p>
               <p>"He is in prison! Oh! merciful Heaven, why did I live to see these dreadful fears
                  realized?"</p>
               <p>"Be calm, my child. He has a powerful friend in the kind and excellent young
                  minister. No harm shall come to him; and we trust, ere long, he may be released to
                  you, and suffered to go where he will."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I must go to him. I have been living here in peace and ease, unconscious of
                  his condition. Detain me no longer," she said, rising; "I will demand admittance
                  to his cell, and they shall take us both—these cruel, blood-thirsty men!"</p>
               <p>She sank back again exhausted in her chair, and Mrs. Hermon earnestly sought to
                  soothe and calm her agitation.</p>
               <p>"Edith, it might be much worse with him than it is. Did I not tell you he has
                  powerful friends? Your father spake with gratitude to God for his mercies."</p>
               <p>"I feel thy rebuke, my more than friend. I will strive to be patient and humble
                  under this blow, and God forgive the wrongful spirit in which I spoke a moment
                  ago!"</p>
               <p>She bowed her head and wept, and Mrs. Hermon left her to relieve her overburdened
                  heart with tears and prayer. She related their conversation to her son, and also
                  that between herself and Angeline, commenting upon Edith's upright conduct toward
                  the child, and speaking in warm terms of the integrity and nobleness of her
                  general behavior.</p>
               <p>"I do not see what harm it could do to indulge Angeline in this particular," said
                  Louis.</p>
               <p>"I fear only the severe penalties of the law; for Angeline could only gain
                  honorable sentiments from the contact."</p>
               <p>"There is no danger to the child from these laws you speak of. Surely they do not
                  carry them to such an excess in the execution."</p>
               <p>"I should never have believed that I could feel so<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000069"/> much tenderness toward a stranger. There is
                  something about this girl which singularly affects me, and seems strangely
                  associated with some early memory. Would that Henriette were like her!"</p>
               <p>"They are as widely separated as the antipodes! And, mother, you should watch my
                  cousin, for, if I mistake not, she feels malevolence toward the maiden, and may
                  take an opportunity to show it."</p>
               <p>"She has been talking to Angeline on the subject of the Quakers, and I doubt not
                  thought to frighten her out of her affection for Edith. Poor girl! she is so sad
                  about her father that I am tempted to send the child to comfort her."</p>
               <p>"I thought your kind heart would yield, mother," said her son, with unfeigned
                  pleasure. "Shall I call my sister to you?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon struggled for a moment with her fears, then yielding to her better
                  impulse, she bade him summon her.</p>
               <p>When the little girl came in, traces of tears were still visible, but she strove
                  to wear a cheerful smile, and obeyed the call with alacrity.</p>
               <p>"My dear, upon further reflection, I have changed my opinion, and you may go to
                  Edith and try to comfort her. She is sad and downcast because she has just heard
                  that her father is confined in prison."</p>
               <p>Angeline stood still a moment in incredulous surprise, then her face beamed all
                  over with sunny delight. She looked at Louis, as if suspecting that she owed her
                  pleasure to his intercession, then flew to her mother's bosom. Throwing her arms
                  around her neck, she almost smothered her with kisses. Her brother was then
                  subjected to the same operation, and afterward she would have hastened to Edith's
                  room, but Louis held her fast. He wanted some excuse for another look at her
                  childish loveliness.</p>
               <p>"Mother, my sister is certainly distraught! Let me see, pulse high, indicative of
                  excitement, cheeks flushed and feverish. One moment she is gravity and wisdom
                  personified, and the next she throws both to the winds, and indulges in outbursts
                  quiet alarming. I saw she was smothering you, and just as I was about to interfere
                  to save your ruff, pounce she comes upon me! And now, if I do not prevent her, she
                  will endanger the existence of all the other members of the family."</p>
               <p>"Dear brother, let me go. I am afraid you will induce mamma to change her mind
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Now, mother, do you hear that? She has no respect for either of us. If you will
                  not punish her, I shall take the matter into my own hands and inflict—"</p>
               <p>"A pill, I dare say, good doctor."</p>
               <p>"Again? daring child! Get thee gone then, ere I transfix thee with—"</p>
               <p>"A cataplasm!"</p>
               <p>Edith did not hear the light step in her chamber, but she felt an arm passed
                  gently around her neck and<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6366-00000070"/> a small hand
                  stealing coaxingly into her own, and looking up, she saw, "as it had been the face
                  of an angel" regarding her with tenderest sympathy. That winning smile seemed to
                  calm the tumult within her, and she thought what a blessed thing is the affection
                  of a child.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edith, mamma sent me, and I did not ask her permission until this
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"Bless her; it was the kindest deed of all."</p>
               <p>"And we may be friends now, I am sure, and you shall teach me, oh! so many things,
                  and we will love each other like sisters. Will we not, dear Edith?"</p>
               <p>"For a little while, sweet one. But do not count too much upon our friendship, for
                  it may be very brief."</p>
               <p>"But you will not leave us for a long time yet. You are not strong enough to go,
                  you know."</p>
               <p>"I shall be very soon. We often gather strength from duty."</p>
               <p>"You will be glad to leave us, and I shall be so sorry."</p>
               <p>"Angeline, I shall be glad to go, but only because my presence here involves you
                  in danger. Beside, my father, to whom I owe life, and duty, and affection,
                  requires my care."</p>
               <p>"But, Edith, you can not be with him now, because they will not let you."</p>
               <p>"Yes; I can share his prison."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you can not mean to go there, to stay in that hateful place."</p>
               <p>"Why, my child? it is not the place that is terrible, but the idea of crime with
                  which it is associated. An innocent person can be as happy in a prison as in a
                  palace, and it does not follow that all are wicked who are there."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I know that, because Saint John was put into prison by Herod; and Saint
                  Peter, too, was there, and an angel came and let him out; beside, mamma has told
                  me of a great many Christians who have been kept in jail because they would not
                  deny their religion, and I have read of unfortunate people being there who had not
                  committed any crime at all."</p>
               <p>"And dost thou not think that they were far happier thus than if they had
                  disobeyed God's commands and tried to please the kings of this world?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I do; and, Edith, I think I would do just as they did."</p>
               <p>"And suppose thy own dear mother were in yonder jail now, and thou knewest she was
                  sick and suffering for thy care, what wouldst thou do, Angeline?"</p>
               <p>"I would go to the prison door and ask them to let me in."</p>
               <p>"Would it not be too terrible and frightful a place for thee to venture into?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; not if mamma were there! And if they refused me, Edith, I would do
                     something—not<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6366-00000071"/> really wicked, you
                  know—but whatever mamma had done, for instance, so as to make them put me
                  there."</p>
               <p>"But suppose some kind friend urged thee to remain with her and share her pleasant
                  home, leaving thy mother to pine away in loneliness?"</p>
               <p>"But suppose some kind friend urged thee to remain with her and share her pleasant
                  home, leaving thy mother to pine away in loneliness?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edith! you know I would not do that. I hope you don't think me so ungrateful
                  and hard-hearted."</p>
               <p>"Certainly I do not; and I hope thou dost not think so of me."</p>
               <p>"Edith, you make me think you right, just as you did the other day about our
                  friendship! But still I can not bear you to go there. Shall you not be
                  afraid?"</p>
               <p>"Afraid of what, little one?"</p>
               <p>"I don't exactly know; and yet it seems fearful to me, too."</p>
               <p>"God is as powerful to protect His children there as elsewhere; and beside, I have
                  been taught to do what I feel is right without hesitating for fear of the
                  consequences."</p>
               <p>Angeline looked as if she would have spoken, but hesitated a moment, and then
                  relapsed into silence, and seemed absorbed in thought.</p>
               <p>"What is it thou wouldst say, my child?"</p>
               <p>She blushed, and was embarrassed as she replied—"It would not be right; that is,
                  it would not be polite, perhaps, to say it."</p>
               <p>"I will excuse all the rudeness, so thou mayst speak thy mind."</p>
               <p>"I was going to ask if—that is, if all the Quakers are like you."</p>
               <p>"In what respect, dost thou mean?"</p>
               <p>"Why, in doing what is right, and—and about trusting in God."</p>
               <p>"I never knew one who did not trust and believe in God our Saviour, and their
                  moral courage is undoubted. Indeed, they have not so much fear of man as I wish
                  they had, or rather, they do not yield, as I think they might consistently, to the
                  prejudices of the time. Do not judge of them by me, however, or thou wilt do many
                  of them sad injustice."</p>
               <p>"But do you think it is right for them to disobey the laws and to disturb public
                  worship, as some of them have done?"</p>
               <p>"No, my dear; I can not approve of it; but we must remember that persecution often
                  drives people further than reason excuses, and that in all ages the zeal of
                  Christians has led them into extravagances. Alas! that His name should be made the
                  watchword for hate and dissension."</p>
               <p>That night, before she slept, Edith unfolded her plans to Mrs. Hermon. The kind
                  lady at first remonstrated, but, like Angeline, was forced to admit that she was
                  in the right, for her father needed—more than Edith was aware of—her care and
                  attention. One thing, however, Mrs. Hermon insisted upon, that she should
                     remain<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6366-00000072"/> there a few days longer to
                  regain her strength, and Edith reluctantly yielded to her judgment in this
                  particular. She also proposed to send for Mr. Mildman, and endeavor, through his
                  agency, to obtain permission for the young girl to share her father's prison, but
                  Edith besought her not to do so, adding that reasons, not her own, influenced her
                  in rejecting his assistance, as far as possible, or rather in forbearing to
                  solicit it. In fact, Edith was determined that Alice should not, through her
                  actions, be laid under further obligations to the minister, and she resolved,
                  alone and unattended, to visit the Governor, and make her own appeal to his
                  mercy.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Hermon first heard of Mr. Mildman's interposition in their favor, she
                  began to suspect that it arose from more than a common interest in the fair young
                  Quakeress, and perhaps this was the reason why she so freely expressed to Louis
                  the admiration she felt for Edith's character. Had she known the effect of her
                  praises upon her son's mind, she would perhaps have experienced some reasonable
                  alarm. On his part, Louis more nearly guessed the truth, for his interview with
                  Alice, on the morning of their first meeting, led him to another conclusion. For
                  some reason he did not reveal this to his mother, but allowed her to indulge in
                  her own more satisfactory surmises. She was somewhat surprised when she found Mr.
                  Mildman's counsel and aid set aside on the present occasion, and could only
                  reconcile it with her former ideas on the ground of Edith's over-anxiety for his
                  safety.</p>
               <p>It was no more than natural that Louis should feel interested in the young girl
                  whom he had rescued from death, and whose misfortunes claimed his sympathy, and it
                  was only the fear of involving his mother in the consequences that withheld him
                  from going boldly before the Governor and pleading the cause of Edith and her
                  father. He was brave, enthusiastic, and generous, and, on his own account,
                  fearless of the result. He knew that Edith would be closely questioned with regard
                  to her secret friends, and from his knowledge of her character, felt little doubt
                  that she would keep the secret, however closely pressed. He could illy brook the
                  thought that his cowardice might recoil upon this frail and delicately-nurtured
                  girl; and without mentioning his intention to his mother, he resolved to come
                  forward, in case of necessity, and take upon himself both the blame and the
                  penalty. Through Mr. Mildman he could be informed of the progress of her cause,
                  and would hold himself in readiness to appear in an emergency. But his kind
                  intentions were defeated by Edith's prompt and independent action.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>"DEAR Edith! I have mamma's permission to bring you down to tea. Come, lean upon
                  my shoulder, and don't fear to bear your weight upon me because I'm little. There!
                  do we not get along nicely? Why, you can walk much better than I thought you
                  could."</p>
               <p>But by the time they had descended the stairs, Edith was quite exhausted, and as
                  she tottered into the family-room, overcome by emotion as well as fatigue, Louis
                  sprang to her side, and assisting her to his mother's chair, tenderly placed her
                  therein. Mrs. Hermon hastened to bring her a glass of home-brewed wine, while
                  Angeline brought cushions and a footstool, and Henriette stood apart, regarding
                  them all in silence.</p>
               <p>Edith was very lovely as she sat there in her simple white robe, and Angeline
                  gazed upon her protégéee—as she was pleased to consider her—in undisguised
                  admiration. Louis, too, who had admired her death-like beauty through her tedious
                  illness, could not but now confess that life was much more lovely and attractive.
                  She had never yet felt that she could speak her thanks for all she owed him, but
                  the grateful eloquence of her glance as their eyes met, told more perfectly than
                  words could do, her sense of obligation.</p>
               <p>The evening meal was over, and the family assembled for prayer. When Mrs. Hermon's
                  voice was raised in the words of those familiar petitions which she had not heard
                  spoken since she and her mother last knelt together to offer up the worship of
                  their souls to God, Edith's heart was moved to deep and stirring emotions. It was
                  the first intimation she had had that their faith and her own were the same, and
                  how she longed to pour out her heart's fervency to those stirring responses. And
                  when Mrs. Hermon proceeded in a still more solemn voice to offer thanks to Heaven
                  for her own restoration to life and health, Edith's low "amen" was uttered amid
                  sobs and tears. Indeed, so overcome was she, that she could not regain her
                  composure, and when their devotions were ended, she arose to retire. Mrs. Hermon's
                  supporting arm was placed around her, and as she laid her upon her bed and
                  tenderly kissed her forehead, Edith felt the warm tears of sympathy fall upon her
                  brow, and pressed that friendly hand to her lips and to her fast beating heart as
                  she whispered,</p>
               <p>"Oh! do not wonder it has moved me so; I have heard it often around our own hearth
                  in happier days."</p>
               <p>"Alas!" thought Mrs. Hermon, "that it was ever set aside." But as Edith said no
                  more, she did not question her on the subject, nor did she suspect that so dear a
                  tie bound the young girl's heart to her own.</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6366-00000074"/>
               <p>Henriette was skilled in music beyond what was usual in those days, and it was her
                  custom after family prayer to awaken her harp's melodious strains, and the mother
                  and children united their voices with its harmony.</p>
               <p>But on this evening each member of the family seemed absorbed in his or her own
                  meditation, and Henriette and her harp were quite forgotten. Finding this to be
                  the case, after vainly trying to attract their attention by touches of their
                  favorite airs, she retired to her chamber, and, fastening the door, gave vent to
                  the evil passions that raged within her bosom.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she exclaimed, as she paced her narrow room, "it is but the fulfillment of
                  my prediction! Those tears—and no man but is fool enough to be subdued by
                  them—will do her work. What if I should weep, would it melt my good cousin's
                  heart?"</p>
               <p>As she said these words she caught sight of her bent figure in a little mirror
                  which hung against the wall. She rushed at it, and with one angry blow dashed the
                  truth-telling monitor to atoms, and stamped her foot upon its fragments.</p>
               <p>"Why did they not strangle me when I was born a crushed and unsightly object. No
                  human heart has ever loved me—no, not one! And there is only one being on earth I
                  ever could love, and he—no, he dare not, he shall not think of this Quaker girl.
                  But why do I fear it? There is too wide a barrier between them, and I will make it
                  still wider!"</p>
               <p>As this thought strengthened, she grew more calm, and even laughed when she
                  thought of the insuperable obstacles she could place in the way of their love.</p>
               <p>"He may slight me if he will, I can bear that if he love not her; but far better
                  could I endure to see him die than to behold his life devoted to another."</p>
               <p>Edith's anxiety to be with her father increased daily, but she felt that her
                  strength would not yet support her through the task she had assigned herself.
                  Although he did not come again to visit her, he wrote her, frequently and
                  affectionately, words of cheer and encouragement, which she in like manner
                  returned. Mr. Mildman was the means through which their notes were transmitted,
                  and the correspondence proved a source of great mutual comfort and satisfaction.
                  Since being assured of his daughter's safety, John Morrison's health had
                  apparently much improved; but this was chiefly from the fact that his mind was
                  relieved from a weight of sorrow, and not because his bodily condition had
                  undergone any material or permanent change for the better.</p>
               <p>"Henriette, my dear, give us a little of your sweet music now."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, aunt; I am not in the humor," she<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000075"/> answered, for she was resolved to avenge the insult
                  of the previous evening. The request was not repeated, for every one knew it was
                  useless to importune her.</p>
               <p>Angeline stole from her seat by Edith's side and whispered a word in her mother's
                  ear.</p>
               <p>"Did she tell you so? But perhaps she has objections to doing it, my dear."</p>
               <p>"She says she does not think it wrong."</p>
               <p>"Edith, this little tell-tale has betrayed you. Will you take Henriette's place?
                  that is, if you have no scruples on the subject."</p>
               <p>"My hand has been long unpracticed, however, if you will forgive this, I shall be
                  glad to contribute to your pleasure, if it lies in my power to do so."</p>
               <p>Henriette's performances were quite put to shame by those of the new musician,
                  who, to the surprise of every one, exhibited an extraordinary degree of taste and
                  cultivation in the science. Music was her delight, and her pleasure in it now was
                  greatly enhanced by the fact that it had been long denied her. Louis sat charmed
                  by her side, and their voices mingled in such sweet strains that Mrs. Hermon and
                  Angeline were entranced with enjoyment, and Henriette bitterly regretted her
                  perverseness, and her heart burned with angry envy.</p>
               <p>When Edith was alone, Henriette stole softly into her chamber. After some remarks
                  upon indifferent topics, she reverted to the music, and said, "How is it, Edith? I
                  thought you Quakers disdained such worldly things."</p>
               <p>"The Quakers do not disdain music; but they consider that the solemn duties of
                  life, if properly fulfilled, leave no time for the practice or acquirement of
                  light accomplishments."</p>
               <p>"But you are not consistent, for it seems to me that <emph>your</emph> life
                  especially calls for the exercise of most solemn duties."</p>
               <p>"I trust I have never allowed the one to interfere with the performance of the
                  other. I was taught music in early childhood, and through love of it acquired it
                  readily. I can never learn to think it wrong as some do, although, since our
                  connection with this poor persecuted people, I have ceased to indulge in it."</p>
               <p>"For my part, I should make an admirable Quaker in some respects, for I confess to
                  little taste in religious mummeries. I can not see why my aunt should insist upon
                  reading those tiresome prayers twice a day."</p>
               <p>"Henriette, it ill becomes me to rebuke thee, but I can not hear thee speak so
                  without expressing my disapprobation."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I dare say you will defend what my aunt does, in spite of your Quakerism.
                  Nay, now, you need not look the picture of insulted dignity, for although you may
                  think my mode of speaking rough, it is at least honest. But do you know, Edith,
                  what my aunt's greatest dread is at present?"</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6366-00000076"/>
               <p>"I do not wish to hear aught of thy aunt's concerns, other than she is herself
                  pleased to impart to me."</p>
               <p>"But I will tell you, because you are interested in it: her greatest dread is,
                  that the governor, or some of these pious straight faces, will find out that she
                  has given you shelter, and that you still remain under her roof."</p>
               <p>"Henriette, I had never willingly exposed these kind friends to this danger, and
                  it is only through this dear lady's solicitation that I am here thus long; and,
                  moreover, I can not and will not believe that she is not all sincerity."</p>
               <p>"But what could she do? she could not turn you out into the street; and she knows
                  you have nowhere else to go, except to jail. And now I will tell you what her
                  great dread is next to this, and, indeed, perhaps I ought to have placed it first:
                  It is that you and my Cousin Louis—"</p>
               <p>"I will not hear another word from thee; and in order to prevent it either thou or
                  I must leave this apartment!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Edith, now I really admire you! I did not think to find this spirit in my
                  meek-eyed Quakeress. Since you have got so far as to order a member of my aunt's
                  family out of the room, I should really like to have you for my friend. Come,
                  Edith, all I have said was only a jest, and intended merely to try your mettle.
                  Say we shall be friends, for I have not seen any one so like myself in many a day,
                  and I fancy it amazingly!"</p>
               <p>"Henriette, I am sorry I allowed myself to become so excited by what thou hast
                  said. I was betrayed into a haste which I can not excuse to myself or to
                  thee."</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind excusing it. I am only glad to see you are not the gentle,
                  inoffensive person you seem. I wondered if there was not a fiery spark beneath
                  that calm exterior!"</p>
               <p>"I am, indeed, but human, and moved too easily by hasty passions. Yet methinks my
                  anger was no more than any sensitive mind might be moved to by thy goading. Thou
                  hast deeply wounded me, but I forgive thee, and would now ask to be alone."</p>
               <p>"I thank you most humbly for your generous pardon. But I can not help laughing,
                  Edith, to think how astonished my aunt would have been just now to see you. And
                  Louis, too! I am afraid you would have lost all you gained by your sacrifice of
                  principle in singing so sweetly for his entertainment. By the way, Edith, I have
                  no doubt you could induce him to play the true and trusty knight in your service.
                  A little persuasion from you might prevail upon him to brave the council or
                  perhaps to share your prison."</p>
               <p>"His generosity shall not be further tested. I go alone and unattended on my
                  errand, except by that Guardian Arm which will support me."</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6366-00000077"/>
               <p>"Well, we shall see how you succeed. You Quakers are fond of trusting in
                  supernatural aid, although it does not seem to arrive very promptly for your
                  purposes. Now, Edith, I suppose you would not be surprised if an angel in visible
                  shape were to come down and plead your cause for you before yon worthy
                  magistrates."</p>
               <p>"Henriette, thou shalt not move me again to haste or anger. The aid I rely upon is
                  that which is the hope of all Christians, and it never fails in the hour of need.
                  I know not how I have incurred thy hatred, for I see thou hast come here to insult
                  and torment me. Stay then, if thou wilt, I will place myself above thy rudeness
                  and heed it no longer!"</p>
               <p>As Edith said this she took her little Bible in her hand, and sat down by the
                  light to read. Henriette laughed with scorn, and said that she supposed she was
                  now to be exorcised. She made several useless attempts to distract Edith's
                  attention, and seeing she was calm and immovable, she presently prepared to leave
                  the room with this parting salutation:</p>
               <p>"Fare you well, Edith, I am sorry that prudence will henceforth prevent me
                  recognizing you as a former acquaintance, but I share in the prejudice of my dear
                  aunt and her family, and since they have not the candor to do so, I will speak for
                  them. We admire you, Edith; we are charmed by the amiability of your conduct and
                  by your perfect self-command; and did circumstances favor the continuance of our
                  acquaintance, that is, if it did not involve us in a risk which we are unwilling
                  to incur for your sake, we should be glad still to consider you a friend. But I
                  must request that should we hereafter meet, you will look upon us with no signs of
                  recognition, unless indeed, my good cousin should soon succeed in persuading you
                  to change your religion (I doubt not an easy matter), for that of the only true
                  church, and the worship of the powerful deity—Cupid!"</p>
               <p>Henriette courtesied low with mock-humility, but Edith did not raise her eyes from
                  her book until she had left her, and she heard the door of her own chamber close
                  behind her. Then she arose and secured the entrance to her room, after which she
                  threw herself upon her knees, and raised her eyes streaming with tears, in agony
                  to heaven. Long she remained thus before she became sufficiently composed to lift
                  her heart in prayer.</p>
               <p>After awhile she arose from her kneeling posture with a sweet peace brooding over
                  her spirit, and sat down by the little table and wrote. When she finished her
                  letter (for such it appeared to be), she folded it, placed it upon the table with
                  the address upward, and was soon wrapped in sweet and undisturbed slumber.</p>
               <p>On the following morning the family assembled as usual for their devotions, and
                  after waiting some time for Edith to appear, Angeline said,</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6366-00000078"/>
               <p>"May I go and see why she does not come, mamma? Perhaps she is not well this
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my love; but if she is still sleeping do not disturb her, for the poor child
                  requires rest."</p>
               <p>Angeline tapped very softly upon the door, and receiving no answer, she raised the
                  latch and entered the room noiselessly. To her surprise Edith was not there, but
                  on the table she found the letter addressed to her mother. She ran down stairs in
                  haste, her face expressing so much consternation that Mrs. Hermon was not a little
                  alarmed and started from her seat, fearing Edith was again ill. She asked the
                  question hurriedly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, mamma, but she is gone!" and the little girl burst into tears as she
                  handed the letter to her mother.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon opened it and read. Several times in the course of it she was obliged
                  to wipe the tears that arose in her own eyes, and dimmed her sight. When she had
                  concluded she handed it to Louis, and requested him to read it aloud. He complied
                  in a voice that testified to his strong emotion:</p>
               <p>"My dearest friend, think me not ungrateful for thus leaving thy kind protection.
                  I go to the performance of a strong and urgent duty, yet one which it is my
                  dearest pleasure to fulfill. But ere I go, I must give utterance to some of the
                  feelings that move me. I say<emph>some,</emph> because there are those deep
                  emotions of the soul which disdain the garb of language, and breathe only in a
                  spiritual air. Oh, my more than mother, how can I thank thee for thy ministering
                  care, for thy kindness which has striven to make the obligations thou bestowed
                  seem of little worth, for the delicacy that has guarded my feelings from every
                  shock, for the tender sympathy which moved thy soul! How shall I thank thy
                  noble-hearted son, for the life I owe him, the power to soothe an aged parent's
                  declining days, to watch and ease a father's hours of suffering! How shall I thank
                  that precious child for the balm of her beautiful affection! How bright the
                  garment of angelic purity which her love would throw around me! Alas for the power
                  that is wanting to perform the wishes of my soul! In that better world where we
                  may hope to meet again, where spirit shall commune with spirit in the language of
                  Heaven, then will I breathe to you the soul's warm benison, then will the power be
                  yours to hear and understand. The blessings of this life and of the life to come
                  rest upon your home. Be your hearth consecrated to love and unity and peace. My
                  mother's spirit hovers over you, and breathes its benediction on the hearts in
                  which her child was cherished. I have left thus secretly because I would not
                  involve you in my misfortunes. Do not seek me again. Your lot is one of peace, and
                  I must tread the weary way of sorrow,<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6366-00000079"/>
                  therefore I pray that our paths may diverge widely. Yet my trust is in Him who
                  alone is strong to succor, and leaning upon the Everlasting Arm I go upon my
                  pilgrimage with faith and fearlessly.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>EDITH had arisen very early in the morning, and placing her cause in the hands of
                  the great Advocate, beseeching Him to soften man's heart to mercy, she went forth
                  to seek the Governor.</p>
               <p>When she reached Governor Endicott's dwelling and requested to speak with him, she
                  was informed that he was walking in his garden. She did not allow him to be
                  summoned, but asking that the way might be pointed out to her, sought him there.
                  She saw him advancing up a distant path, holding a little girl by the hand, with
                  whom he appeared to be conversing, and stood respectfully awaiting his approach.
                  As he drew near, she knelt upon the walk which intercepted his way.</p>
               <p>"How now? Who have we here? Maiden, who art thou, and what is thy errand, that
                  thou appearest thus humbly in our presence?"</p>
               <p>"I am come to ask a great boon, and therefore I appear here, most humbly, as
                  fitteth the importance of my errand."</p>
               <p>"What! another of these heretics! Now, as I live, my patience is well-nigh wearied
                  out with them. If<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6366-00000080"/> thou comest here to
                  ask pardon for those rebellious persons whom the law condemns to death, through
                  their own blind obstinacy, I tell thee thy petition is vain; I will hear none of
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"That is not my errand. I come to entreat thee to set at liberty one who suffers
                  sickness and bondage in your dismal prison; or if thou wilt not do this, to permit
                  me, his daughter, to share his captivity."</p>
               <p>"And what is the crime for which he is confined there? Is he that noisy, uncivil
                  man, who unjustly accused us of robbing him of his child?"</p>
               <p>"He is the same. But I entreat thee to have pity on the aged man who knew not what
                  he did, but was driven by desperate sorrow to that extreme. He was always a quiet
                  and unoffending citizen, and took no part in the unruly disturbances which some
                  were led into."</p>
               <p>"And whence comest thou, girl, and where hast thou concealed thyself? Some said
                  thou wast dead, and others, whose story appears most worthy of credit, didst say
                  that thou hadst forsaken thy aged parent and gone away secretly with a paramour.
                  Come, my saintly damsel, tell us now, was it love that betrayed thee into this
                  treacherous snare?"</p>
               <p>"It was a sad accident befell me, from which I was rescued by God's mercy. It was
                  followed by an illness so severe that I am but now able to appear before thee and
                  plead the cause of my father."</p>
               <p>"But tell us, now how this marvelous affair did chance; for I nothing doubt thou
                  canst give us a goodly tale, if the truth were known. What was the accident, and
                  where are the instruments of thy deliverance?"</p>
               <p>Edith here recounted the history of her fearful adventure, but cautiously avoided
                  giving any clew to the means of her escape.</p>
               <p>"Well, well; this may do so far, but it is not enough. We must know the rest, and
                  where thou hast concealed thyself."</p>
               <p>"I crave thy pardon, but humbly implore that I may not be questioned of that
                  matter."</p>
               <p>"So, so, here we have it again. I marveled at thy humility, but now I see thy
                  Quaker obstinacy looking forth. Thou shalt indeed go to prison, but not to thy
                  father, my cunning maiden, unless without further words thou tell us who are thy
                  secret friends, and where they are to be found."</p>
               <p>"I beseech thee to consider that I may not, without extreme baseness, betray the
                  friends who rescued me from a violent death. Thou canst not ask, oh, thou wouldst
                  not, that I should make them to suffer through my treachery!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, come now. What if thou shouldst thereby obtain thy father's liberty,
                  and thine own, and permission to remain unmolested within our jurisdiction?"</p>
               <p>"I should greatly wrong my father and myself by<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000081"/> such a course. An evil requital would it be of his
                  teachings, nor would he accept a liberty so purchased."</p>
               <p>"What, not if thou hadst our warrant that thy friends should be lightly dealt
                  with?"</p>
               <p>"Not even then. Oh, I <emph>could</emph> not do it. Ask me to serve thee, to do
                  aught at thy command from which my sense of right would not recoil, and I will do
                  it joyfully."</p>
               <p>"Dost thou then presume to doubt our guaranty?"</p>
               <p>"Not so. But I can not consent to expose them to the rebuke which their kindness
                  might subject them to."</p>
               <p>"But consider what thou owest to him who gave thee birth, to the parent who has
                  nurtured thee—illy, to be sure, but still he claims thy gratitude."</p>
               <p>"I should do him a grievous wrong in obeying thee. I should do violence to my own
                  feelings also. Thou dost but seek to try me. I have been ill and am yet weak, I
                  pray thee let me go to my father."</p>
               <p>"As a reward for thy refusal to satisfy me! A touching appeal, truly! How knowest
                  thou that thy father may not suffer through thy rebellion?"</p>
               <p>"Thou couldst not make it an excuse for severity to him. Remember he is sick and
                  aged, and hath no tender hand to minister to his wants or to ease his weary hours
                  of suffering. Have mercy, as thou wouldst one day obtain it, and, in God's name,
                  permit me to go my ways to his prison!"</p>
               <p>"It is more likely that we shall order thee to be bound to the cart's tail and
                  whipped through the streets daily, upon thy naked shoulders. Ha! thy cheek pales
                  at last. We have found a way now to obtain thy precious secret!"</p>
               <p>"Death were easier far than to endure this exposure; yet a thousand deaths and
                  shameful disgrace would not wring it from my bosom!"</p>
               <p>Governor Endicott turned aside for a moment, and muttered, "There is witchcraft
                  among these Quakers, surely, for even their sucking babes possess this indomitable
                  spirit!"</p>
               <p>Edith continued, "I beseech your Excellency to consider that they who rescued me
                  from death could not in humanity have done less. They knew me not until that time,
                  nor knew I them, nor indeed for many days after, because my mind wandered long
                  from its mansion, and returned only a short time ago. Sure am I that naught would
                  persuade thee to pursue a course so dishonorable as to betray those who had
                  rescued thee or this sweet child, from a fate so terrible!"</p>
               <p>It was not that Edith attempted through flattery to soften the heart of the stern
                  man, but because, in her straightforward simplicity, it seemed a matter almost
                  beyond credit that <emph>any one,</emph> unless deep in degradation, could stoop
                  to such an action. The remark was not without its effect, however, and the
                  Governor's voice and manner became less stern as he replied,</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6366-00000082"/>
               <p>"God forbid that we should strive to persuade thee to an act which were indeed
                  deserving our contempt, did not powerful considerations render it necessary to
                  urge it. In the performance of duty we must sometimes smother the warmer feelings
                  of our nature. Maiden, I do strongly incline to grant thy petition, for thou
                  reasonest well, and seemest to be one gifted with more than ordinary powers of
                  penetration. These friends, for whom thou sufferest a needless degree of anxiety,
                  shall not be harshly dealt with. We give thee our word for this; therefore lay
                  aside thy scruples, and tell us who they be, and thy father is a free man, and so
                  long as he and thou conduct yourselves with quiet and order, ye shall receive our
                  protection."</p>
               <p>"Far be it from me to doubt thy gracious promises; do not thus interpret my
                  refusal, for I am deeply grateful for thy kindness; but in the name of Him to whom
                  we all look for mercy, I beseech thee to remove this impossible condition!"</p>
               <p>"What, art thou still obstinate, still unyielding? Then suffer the consequences of
                  thy folly. There are yet means, stubborn girl, to wring from thee what thy rash
                  obstinacy prompts thee to conceal! Begone from our presence, we have listened too
                  long to thy idle prating! Thomas! Thomas! I say, call the guard. Thou shalt indeed
                  go to the prison; but think not to find thy father again until thou hast resolved
                  to comply with our demand!"</p>
               <p>"Be it so, then! God alone must be my refuge. Mayest thou one day find with Him
                  the mercy thou deniest me this day!"</p>
               <p>The little girl had remained watching the scene with intense interest, and
                  although she did not comprehend all its meaning, she fully understood that the
                  pale maiden was to go to that fearful place, the jail. Leaving her father's side,
                  she hurried to Edith, and taking her hand, looked up imploringly, and said, "Oh,
                  papa, do not send the sweet, sick lady to that wicked place! Naughty father, God
                  is displeased with thee for giving her to the dark man, yonder!" and she hid her
                  sorrowing face in Edith's garments, and wept aloud. Edith stooped and caressed the
                  little one, endeavoring to soothe her distress, her own tears falling the while,
                  "Oh," she cried, "Henriette was right, an angel is indeed here, and intercedes in
                  my behalf!"</p>
               <p>Governor Endicott was touched by the scene before him, and the artless words of
                  the little girl conveyed an unlooked for reproof. Giving way to a kindly impulse,
                  he said,</p>
               <p>"Well, well; cease thy tears, little Charity, the maiden shall go to her father
                  for the present, until we have time to consider what is best to be done
                  further."</p>
               <p>"No, no," insisted the child, "her father must go home with her. If you send the
                  pretty lady to the dark house, I will not love you any more. You will not be my
                  dear, kind papa, any longer!"</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6366-00000083"/>
               <p>"My sweet pleader," said Edith, "it is enough. I will ask no more now, but accept
                  this favor with thanks and a daughter's blessing."</p>
               <p>"And does it please thee then right well?" looking up into her face doubtingly,
                  with the tears still resting on her round rosy cheeks.</p>
               <p>"It pleases me right well, and I thank God, thy father, and thyself, for so dear a
                  privilege!"</p>
               <p>"And papa is not a naughty papa now, is he?" asked she, with something of
                  exultation in her tone.</p>
               <p>"No," answered Edith, with a smile, while the child, resuming her place by her
                  father, showed her pleasure by laughing and capering at his side once more.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said the Governor, before they parted, "a few days' reflection will
                  persuade thee to alter thy determination, and in that case thou knowest that thy
                  father has his liberty."</p>
               <p>"We are more free confined between prison walls than with conscience in bondage.
                  Again I thank thee for the privilege already accorded me, and will pray God to
                  soften thy heart to remit this stern condition."</p>
               <p>"And, after all," he soliloquized, after dismissing her with a few lines to the
                  jailor, "I like her better than if she had consented to betray them. There is
                  loftiness of character as well as delicacy of training in her mien and conduct.
                  But alas for the delusions of the human mind! Why will men stray thus from the
                  straight and only path which leads to life?"</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>With a heart full of grateful emotions Edith took the nearest way that led to the
                  prison. Joe Makefast, who answered her summons, upon opening the door, stood back
                  in mute surprise. The pallor of recent illness and excessive fatigue overspread
                  the face of the heroic girl, but the peace that dwelt within spoke sweetly through
                  her weariness. In his wonder at beholding so unexpected a visitor, Joe forgot
                  entirely to read the note she had placed in his hand, but stood regarding her with
                  a vacant stare. She motioned him to do so, and passing in took her seat quietly,
                  and awaited his somewhat tardy motions with some impatience. The mystified keeper
                  read and re-read the note, turned it to the light and inspected the signature from
                  various points of view. Then, after another penetrating glance at the maiden, he
                  beckoned her to follow him, and, leading her through several damp and winding
                  passages, finally admitted her into the apartment occupied by her father.</p>
               <p>Poor Edith was not prepared for the change which a few weeks had made in her
                  father's appearance, and her heart sank at sight of his feeble and wasted figure.
                  His surprise at seeing her was lessened by the fact that she had privately
                  informed him some days before of her intention. Yet his embrace, as he<pb
                     n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6366-00000084"/> clasped her tenderly to his bosom, had
                  in it a touch of pity which Edith understood too well. And as they sat down side
                  by side, with their hands clasped in each others, they felt that it was not now
                  man's feeble power they feared again to separate them.</p>
               <p>At the request of the prisoner Edith related her morning's adventure, and her
                  conduct received his warm approval.</p>
               <p>"My child, thou hast done only what was right. These walls shall receive my last
                  breath ere I will accept a freedom basely purchased. Never, whatever be the
                  inducements offered thee, never swerve from the true course. Though thy heart be
                  sorely tempted, yield not, and remember that death itself would be sweet to me
                  compared to the pain I should feel in seeing thee depart from the line of truth.
                  Be firm always in that wherein thou hast the approval of God and thy conscience,
                  and fear to do wrong far more than the power of man to injure thee."</p>
               <p>After locking the door upon the young girl and her father, the poor jailor still
                  remained in the deepest perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "what'll come next, I wonder! It's the first time in the
                  course of my experience that any body ever asked to be let in here. It's a
                  privilege, a great privilege, I know," and poor Joe laughed at what he considered
                  his own witticism; "but ain't it curious, now, that people in gineral don't 'pear
                  to be sensible of it? But what <emph>is</emph> this young creetur, any way; that's
                  what I'd like to be informed of? Bees she an ooman, or bees she a sperrit? Come,
                  now, answer me that?" he demanded, in the tone of one who has silenced every
                  auditor. "<emph>I</emph> should say," he continued, looking at the empty chairs
                  around him with an air of triumph, as if he were the only individual present
                  capable of explaining the mystery—"<emph>I</emph> should say it was a sperrit with
                  a bonnet on!</p>
               <p>"I don't like it nohow, for lookee here," continuing to address his attentive
                  audience, "it was some sich creetur as this that let the 'Postle Peter out o'
                  jail—yes, and what come o' the keepers?" Here Joe thrust both hands in his
                  pantaloons' pockets, and continued for some time walking up and down, and shaking
                  his head very uneasily.</p>
               <p>"But, ha!" he presently exclaimed, again triumphant, "<emph>that</emph> sperrit
                  didn't bring an order! But if this bein' had a come in the midnight hour, and had
                  a stood over my bed, and said, 'Joseph Makefast, rise up and unlock the prison
                  door,' would I a riz? Yes, that I would, and every hair on my scalp would a done
                  the same, and I would a said that it was n't flesh and blood commanded me!</p>
               <p>"Lord save us! now I see it all. It's her as was drownded, and her sperrit's come
                  back to haunt the earth! And that letter—where is it, any way?"</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6366-00000085"/>
               <p>The poor jailor was now thoroughly terrified. He hastily searched his pockets for
                  the governor's order, and failing to find it, retraced his steps through each
                  passage, and vainly sought for it in every nook and corner. In fact, he had
                  dropped it in the prisoner's room, and the father and daughter were at that moment
                  looking over it together.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lord a ma'cy! it wasn't a letter at all. What'll become of me? It was
                  altogether a plan of the enemy to git me in his clutches. I'll lock the doors, and
                  run up to his honor's worship's the minister's, and fetch him right down. But
                  what's the use of locks? what's locks to sperrits? Didn't Peter's angel strike the
                  chains off with a touch of its walkin'-stick? Oh! dear, dear, dear, I'm a ruined
                  man, and all for livin' this way, so lonesome like! Now if I only had a help-meet
                  this would never a happened. I'll get one, that I will. I'll speak to Lisbet
                  to-morrow, though, in gineral, I know women's cowardly, too, but for all that
                  there sharper witted than men be, and it ain't sich an easy thing to make fools on
                  'em!"</p>
               <p>Poor Joe was almost in despair. He was quite convinced that Edith was a visitor
                  from the spirit-land, and whenever he was obliged to pass near her father's door,
                  he felt his scalp creep, and a cold shiver run over him, much as I myself have
                  felt, when a child, in passing a grave-yard in the evening, or, when in the dark,
                  I have embodied an indistinct fear in some outline line imperfectly defined.
                  Joseph's eyes half started from their sockets as he looked that way, momentarily
                  expecting to behold a supernatural appearance; and when the hour came to open the
                  prisoner's door and leave him at liberty to take his airing in the jail-yard, he
                  could not muster courage to do so. There was nothing in the order (which he
                  resolved to insist upon) to warrant him in doing so now, and besides, if they
                  wanted to get out they could just as well go through the key-hole invisible, or
                  through the grating of the narrow window.</p>
               <p>When the dinner-hour arrived, he had another struggle. The sperrit would not
                  surely want any thing to eat. Should he therefore carry in a double allowance of
                  food for the meal? After due reflection, he concluded it was more prudent to do
                  so, that by betraying his suspicions he might subject himself to some wrathful
                  visitation, and therefore he decided to convey to the apartment an amount of food
                  sufficient for two humanly constituted individuals.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, fortifying himself with texts of Scripture and ejaculatory prayers,
                  he entered the cell with knees smiting each other, and hands trembling. It
                  happened that the safety of a bowl of savory soup was endangered by his agitation,
                  which Edith seeing, she stepped forward and took it from his hand.</p>
               <p>"We must not lose any portion of our dinner," she said, "for I suppose, like
                  careless children who spill<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6366-00000086"/> their
                  porridge, we shall be punished by not being allowed a fresh supply, and beside, as
                  I have eaten nothing to-day, and exercise has given an edge to appetite, I should
                  be loth to see the loss of this goodly 'mess of pottage.' Come, my father, for if
                  thou art not wary, I may devour thy share of our meal as well as my own."</p>
               <p>This remark savored so strongly of humanity, that Joseph almost forgot his alarm,
                  and looked "the sperrit" in the face quiet courageously.</p>
               <p>"Good Joseph, thou didst not come to let my father out of his cage this
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"I crave pardon," said Joseph quite humbly, though with the air of one who was not
                  rashly to be drawn into conversation, "I—I—it wasn't in the order, mistress."</p>
               <p>"Oh, then, it was because of my presence. Nay, I think thou needst not fear I
                  shall be in haste to get away, since I overcame some difficulties in getting
                  here."</p>
               <p>"Joseph is in the right, however," said her father, "and we will forego the
                  privilege until the opportunity offers to obtain permission."</p>
               <p>"The old fox!" said Joseph, as he closed the door behind him, "he thinks he can
                  get out now, and no thanks to me, and as for the—. Well, she looks more like a
                  human bein' than she did—but I'm not to be juggled by her—not I. She spoke
                  pleasant-like too, but it may all be to get on the blind side of me. 'Ain't eat
                  nothing to-day'—how should she? Soup ain't very plenty I reckon in the regents she
                  came from. And the 'mess of pottage' she spoke of—she thought I didn't see through
                  that, I reckon—but I do. She thinks she'll trick me as Jacob did his blind father.
                  But I ain't so dim-eyed as she thinks for—no I ain't. I'll keep one eye on her any
                  way."</p>
               <p>As Edith said, her walk had quickened her appetite, and her father seeing this,
                  ate his meal with an unusual relish. Still the daughter stole many an anxious
                  glance toward the pallid face of her parent, and although she strove to enliven
                  their meal with affectionate efforts at cheerfulness, she succeeded with
                  difficulty in concealing her anxiety and disguising the fact that there lay at her
                  heart a sickening weight of apprehension.</p>
               <p>Several days passed away, during which Edith strove to devise some means to obtain
                  her father's liberty. On account of the condition of his health she was doubly
                  anxious for his release, for she hoped the free, pure air of heaven would do much
                  toward restoring the strength of which the last few weeks had deprived him. She
                  hesitated about making another appeal to the Governor, lest she should be again
                  assailed on the subject of her undiscovered benefactors; and, on the other hand,
                  she trembled lest her silence should be made a pretext for further restrictions
                  upon him.</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6366-00000087"/>
               <p>Her appearance among the other prisoners, or those of them who were likewise
                  allowed the privilege of the jail yard, created no slight sensation, for already
                  had Joseph's suspicions been whispered among them. In consequence of this, they
                  with sly looks avoided her, and wherever she moved, she soon saw that she was an
                  object to be shunned. She attributed this to their impressions of her religious
                  belief, and continued to bestow kind and pitying looks and actions, as far as
                  opportunities offered, where she received in return only forbidding glances, or a
                  silent and unthankful stare. There was no criminal among them, however degraded,
                  who would not have felt himself contaminated by intercourse with these misguided
                  heretics, and no crime, whatever its character, which did not, in their eyes, call
                  for more sympathy than that of being a Quaker.</p>
               <p>One morning John Morrison and his daughter received a summons to appear before the
                  council. As they prepared to obey it, Edith's heart almost sank within her with
                  fear and apprehension. Her father appeared to be quite unmoved, and seemed
                  absorbed in thought, and when Edith timidly besought him to be cautious in using
                  language which might incense their judges, he only answered—"When they deliver you
                  up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that
                  same hour what ye shall speak."</p>
               <p>When they entered the council-chamber, at a sign from Mr. Mildman, the prisoner's
                  hat was removed by an attendant. This was done to prevent the discussion of that
                  subject, which the minister knew would be pretty sure to follow, were it not in
                  some such manner averted. John Morrison stood erect and undaunted in the presence
                  of his judges, as if, conscious of rectitude, he knew no cause for fear. His calm
                  exterior afforded a striking contrast to the appearance of those before whom he
                  stood arraigned, as with bent brows and angry looks some regarded him, while the
                  few who inclined toward his side exhibited in their countenances the uneasy fear
                  of failure. The prisoner rested his arm upon the shoulder of the trembling girl at
                  his side, who cast an anxious and hurried glance along the line of faces turned
                  upon her, as if hoping to discover that of some sympathizing friend to whom she
                  might look for aid in a dire extremity.</p>
               <p>"John Morrison, if thou hast any thing to say for thyself, thou art at liberty to
                  speak."</p>
               <p>"Friend, I would inquire wherefore I am considered worthy of these bonds."</p>
               <p>"Thou hast come in among us, with others of thy people, to sow dissension in our
                  quiet vineyard, to trample on our laws, and to corrupt the minds of our youth with
                  false and dangerous doctrines."</p>
               <p>"Can any one present show that he has seen me or known me to be engaged in either
                  of the ways thou speakest of?"</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6366-00000088"/>
               <p>"We know well enough that if we can not say so, it is true, and that thou
                  upholdest those who are busied in these mischiefs. Dost thou not refuse to bear
                  arms in the service of thy rightful sovereign, to pay thy dues toward the support
                  of God's church and its ministers, and dost thou not hold strange and abominable
                  doctrines, by which delusion the young and ignorant are in danger of being led
                  away?"</p>
               <p>"We refuse to bear arms in obedience to the command of our Great Master, who said,
                  'My kingdom is not of this world, else would my servants fight.' And counting
                  oursleves first of all His servants, and secondly the servants of the king, we
                  must obey the commands of our Sovereign Lord, and deny only such claims of our
                  earthly monarch as are in conflict with them. 'Freely ye have received, freely
                  give.' 'Without money and without price.' What is more plain, would ye but listen
                  to its teaching? And for the third accusation thou bringest against us—"</p>
               <p>"If it please your Excellency"—broke in Mr. Mildman—"we have heard all this till
                  we are thrice weary. There is little profit in discussing these knotty questions,
                  for this is a stiff-necked people, and not to be turned from its errors. Let us,
                  therefore, pass to the especial subject before us, which is the individual conduct
                  of the prisoner. From all I can learn, he has taken little part in the turbulent
                  conduct of some of this sect, and was always a retired and peaceful member of the
                  community."</p>
               <p>"I thank thee, my friend, that thou speakest in my behalf; but think not to serve
                  me by setting me apart from my brethren. My mode of life has been quiet, for my
                  feeble state of health prevents me laboring as I desire to do in the Lord's
                  vineyard."</p>
               <p>"Thou shouldst thank the Lord that it prevents thee running thy neck into a noose
                  then!" exclaimed the Secretary.</p>
               <p>"Methinks," said Mr. Harding, "there is little mischief to be feared from an old
                  man who hath already one foot in the grave. Wherefore should we spend our valuable
                  time in this discussion?"</p>
               <p>"Thou canst not be answerable, brother," said a reverend divine, "for what he may
                  do of evil. And if the old tree is decayed and broken, the young shoot remains to
                  take root and flourish. Better to destroy the tares now than leave them to swallow
                  up a goodly harvest."</p>
               <p>"Better still," said Mr. Mildman, "to engraft upon the young tree a precious
                  shoot, which shall in time bring forth an hundredfold to fill our garners."</p>
               <p>The first speaker shook his head doubtingly. "Ah, there is still poison at the
                  root! We should not leave a fiber of it to encumber the soil. Young and old, root
                  and branch, should be gathered and burned; yea,<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000089"/> none should be spared from the fire that consumes
                  and purifies!"</p>
               <p>"We will speak to this young sprig of heresy, brethren. Maiden, hast thou
                  reflected upon our late offer of clemency?"</p>
               <p>"I have. And reflection has served only to strengthen my former resolution. I
                  beseech thee spare me that. I can not do otherwise, if my life should be the
                  forfeit!"</p>
               <p>"But what if thy <emph>father's</emph> life be the forfeit? Know that thy
                  obstinacy may send him to the gallows in company with those who are already
                  condemned to suffer death for their offenses!"</p>
               <p>"Edith, lift up thy spirit in prayer. Lean on the Rock of strength, and fear
                  not!"</p>
               <p>Edith was deadly pale, and there was untold agony in her accents, as she
                  cried—"Oh, let my life atone for it, but touch not his whom the angel of death has
                  already beckoned from afar." She threw herself upon her knees as she said this,
                  and raised her streaming eyes toward heaven.</p>
               <p>"Arise, my daughter. This position belongs only to a higher court, to a Judge not
                  swayed by human passions."</p>
               <p>"Let her alone, old man! Had thy people more of the spirit of humility it might be
                  better for you; but you come here to demand what you should ask, to claim what it
                  would better become you to sue for."</p>
               <p>"I know not that we should sue for the privilege of worshiping God in our own
                  peculiar way. I am yet to learn that it becomes frail man to ask permission of his
                  erring brother to follow the unerring guide within—the lamp of Truth."</p>
               <p>"You shall know somewhat more than you seem to know ere you are done with us.
                  Brethren, you see this girl before you. She steadily refuses to give up to justice
                  those persons, who, in defiance of our wholesome laws have dared to afford shelter
                  and protection to one of her accursed sect. We are in the midst of quicksands, and
                  shall we not know where they lie before our tender youth be drawn into the vortex?
                  Is our authority to be set aside by every puny child who is thus incited to rebel
                  against it? No. I tell you it must not be. She <emph>shall</emph> yield, or let
                  her father's blood be upon her own head!"</p>
               <p>"My blood shall not be upon her, but on thee—on thee, stern, cruel man, shall it
                  be! He who looks down upon the deeds of this day and of other days—the deeds ye
                  have wrought and still purpose to work upon us whom ye call accursed—He will
                  demand of you—'Where is thy brother?' And how think ye to conceal from him your
                  blood-guiltiness?"</p>
               <p>"I pray you leave the girl to me," said Mr. Mildman. "Mild measures may be of more
                  avail than stringent ones. Give her more time, and it may be she will at last
                  yield to this demand."</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6366-00000090"/>
               <p>"Alas," exclaimed the other minister—"how hast thou fallen away, my brother! I
                  grieve and mourn in spirit over the sad change that has come upon thee—upon thee,
                  who wast once our pillar of strength, and our bulwark!"</p>
               <p>"We all know that our reverend brother doth of late, lean to a mild policy (I
                  trust not unwisely nor with excess of tenderness), and we will not now be ruled by
                  his counsel. The girl has already had ample time given her, and now for the last
                  time I demand of thee, maiden, thy decision."</p>
               <p>"Hear first what I have to say," exclaimed the prisoner—"You bring this tender
                  child hither, and you offer her terms by which my life is to be lost or won. In
                  order to comply with your demand, she must peril the peace of a now happy family,
                  to whom she owes her life; and because she will not do this you threaten her with
                  her father's blood. Know then that did she comply with your demand, that life you
                  offer me on such terms I would disdain to accept. Take from me, if you will, the
                  gift which God gave, make this child an orphan and an outcast—but ye can never rob
                  us of a dearer treasure. You have no power to deprive us of the peace of an
                  approving conscience."</p>
               <p>"For one," exclaimed Mr. Harding, now rising, "I disclaim all share in these
                  unjust proceedings. If your Excellency really intends to execute this violent
                  threat, I will here resign my seat in this council. Brethren—I am myself a father,
                  and were that maiden mine own child, I should be proud to call her so; and should
                  she basely yield, I could almost find it in my heart to cast her forever from my
                  bosom! But you do not, surely, intend to do this thing. I wrong you by supposing
                  it! It would, indeed, be something hitherto unheard of in a court of justice."</p>
               <p>"What, Gideon Harding, did not thy voice uphold our decree against this people?
                  Are we to change our, course with every shifting breeze? Thou knowest right well
                  that this man has already transgressed our laws and set our authority at naught,
                  and that he deserves to suffer the penalty!"</p>
               <p>"God forgive me that false step! Would I could repair the error; and I will strive
                  to do it. This man is sick and aged, let him depart. God himself hath measured his
                  span, and shall we presume to touch a life whose period is thus noted?"</p>
               <p>"There is nothing to be feared from him," cried another, "let the old man go.
                  There is no warrant for pushing these matters to such extremes."</p>
               <p>"Beware," said the aforesaid divine, "lest like Jonah, ye be swallowed up by God's
                  wrath for refusing to pronounce his judgments."</p>
               <p>"Thank God I am not afraid to do my duty," exclaimed the Governor. "Call the
                  guard! Jailor take this old man back to prison. Nay—touch not the maiden—she goes
                  not yet! John Morrison, hear the<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6366-00000091"/>
                  sentence we pronounce against thee! Thou shalt go hence to the prison—"</p>
               <p>He was interrupted by a piercing cry, and Edith fell back into her father's arms
                  in a fainting fit. As he held her lifeless form to his bosom, he raised his
                  trembling voice in prayer:</p>
               <p>"Father of mercies, take this the only child of my love to thy bosom! Call her
                  spirit back to thee, and never let it return to inhabit this earthly tenement! And
                  thou, stern, unmerciful man, beware lest God's curse light upon thy household!
                  Tremble lest thou live to see the children of thy home blighted and cut off as
                  thou wouldst crush this tender vine!"</p>
               <p>Governor Endicott's heart was not all stone, and at these words his thoughts
                  turned upon the little girl who had pleaded Edith's cause before. From the first
                  he never meant to carry into effect his cruel threat, but incensed at Edith's
                  obstinacy (as he considered it), he determined to try her to the last stretch,
                  thinking she would finally yield. But now that he was convinced of her firmness in
                  adhering to what she considered a principle of duty, he regretted having carried
                  the matter so far, and would gladly have yielded, could he have done so without
                  appearing to be overborne by opposition. Mr. Mildman probably read his thoughts,
                  for he said, "Perhaps your Excellency will consent to defer this sentence for the
                  present. Let them return to the prison now, if it please you, and we will further
                  discuss the question on another occasion. We must not utterly deny the claims of
                  humanity; the old man himself is exhausted with the length of our debate, and the
                  maiden, as you all see, is in no condition to endure it longer. Let it not be said
                  of us that even our enemies had not mercy at our hands!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, and ye would be so merciful that our whole land would feel the plague, and
                  our households be smitten, our young ones be led into error, and our seasons for
                  peaceful worship made the time for angry and seditious disturbances."</p>
               <p>"Brethren, let not dissensions invade our council, and if we err, be it on the
                  side of mercy, so that when we come to stand ourselves before the high tribunal,
                  we may hope to obtain it even as we now bestow."</p>
               <p>"Friend," said John Morrison, as he stood once more before them, while his
                  daughter, now bitterly weeping, clung convulsively to his bosom, "ask not for me
                  the mercy denied to my brethren. But if ye shed our blood it will cry to God from
                  this soil, and future generations shall point to it with sorrow, and your children
                  and children's children vainly strive to efface the shameful stain!"</p>
               <p>"Take them away, jailor! He will provoke us to greater severity than we
                  intend."</p>
               <p>Edith had been so much overcome by the occurrences of the morning that it required
                  both her father's feeble assistance and that of the jailor to aid her in<pb
                     n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6366-00000092"/> reaching the prison. But she did not
                  long allow herself to be thus overcome, remembering how much her father stood in
                  need of her attention; and when the jailor brought in their noonday meal, he found
                  John Morrison, exhausted by excitement and fatigue, reclining upon his bed, and
                  Edith sitting beside him bathing his hands and forehead. The poor girl looked so
                  sad and weary that Joe's kind heart reproached him for his hasty judgment of her.
                  In fact, he felt for them more sympathy than he dared express, except by an
                  awkward officiousness, which was easily understood, and which received their
                  gratitude.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>When Mr. Harding returned to his home, Alice noticed that he was unusually quiet,
                  and even sad. Throughout the day he continued silent and abstracted, as if
                  something weighed heavily upon his mind, and even his daughter's affectionate
                  caresses were received with only a half-conscious air.</p>
               <p>"My father, something, I am sure, weighs upon thy spirits. Is it aught in which a
                  daughter's sympathy can bear part?"</p>
               <p>"Alice, I have seen to-day a sight which moved my very soul! Two prisoners were
                  brought before the council, an aged, white-haired man, and a tender maiden. But
                  why do I grieve thee with the tale? Thy cheek is pale at the very name of
                  misery!"</p>
               <p>"Go on, I pray thee, my father! Of what crime were they accused?"</p>
               <p>"Of belonging to that strange, deluded people, the Quakers. Would to Heaven I had
                  never seen one of their sect, for since yon poor wretches were condemned to die, I
                  have not known a night of peaceful slumber. And yet I did all I could to save
                  them!"</p>
               <p>"But the prisoners, dear papa—the old man and his daughter, saidst thou not?—what
                  more of them?"</p>
               <p>"She is his daughter, and a brave girl, too, I warrant thee! None who witnessed
                  her conduct this day but were forced to respect her motives. Poor child, poor
                  child; her lot is one of hardship."</p>
               <p>"And what was done? Oh, father, they could not be harsh to <emph>her</emph>—to one
                  so tender and so frail!"</p>
               <p>"Too harsh, too cold and stern! Ah, Alice, little knowest thou to what extremes
                  man's heart will sometimes lead him! Alas, why should he deem that religion
                  demands of him to forget every touch of pity and humanity. I like not these harsh
                  doctrines, and surely our incarnate Lord taught us a far different lesson in his
                  intercourse with earth!"</p>
               <p>"But, father, had thy voice no weight? Alas! were there none to take the maiden's
                  part? Were all turned against them—against a feeble sick old man and a defenseless
                  girl?"</p>
               <p>"No, not <emph>all,</emph> Alice. Thank God all hearts are not so hard. Woe to
                  those judges who show not the mercy<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6366-00000093"/>
                  they must one day need! But my child, thou tremblest, and—yes, thou art weeping! I
                  should not have told thee of this. But do not grieve so, my darling. They dare not
                  go to extremes in this. There are those who will move in it whose strength and
                  influence will force their enemies to yield. Be encouraged, Alice, I will with my
                  feeble might assist this brave girl and her father; and let them do to me as they
                  list, she shall not want protection. This shall be my task, and God grant that it
                  may atone for that one fault—that cruel error!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! thanks, thanks, my father," cried Alice joyfully, as she threw her arms
                  around him. "They dare not call thee to account for what thou doest, and Ed—, that
                  is, Mr. Mildman tells me that the maiden is worthy his own and thy protection.
                  With two such powerful friends, she can not come to evil."</p>
               <p>"I would, my darling, that these men had one grain of thy compassionate nature!
                  But, methinks, that such gentle virtues are given but to few. Could they be more
                  equally dispensed, there were no need of any other law than that of love to bind
                  us. I fear me, dear child, if thou givest to every unfortunate stranger the
                  measure of sympathy thou bestowest on these, that thy whole life will be a scene
                  of grief for others' sorrow."</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, do not praise me," said Alice, as a flush of shame dyed her cheeks and
                  forehead. "Thou dost not know my secret heart, what a vain and treacherous thing
                  it can sometimes be!"</p>
               <p>"I commend thee all the more, my darling, that thy modesty would disclaim all
                  merit. It is ever thus with the pure and good. Humility is the crown of virtue,
                  and well fitted is this dear brow to wear her chaplet!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father, forbear, I beseech thee. Alas! why do I wear a mask which hides my
                  true character from thine eyes?" and tears of grief and mortification chased one
                  another down the daughter's cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Alice, thy sensibility will one day run away with thee. Thy feelings have
                  been overwrought by the tale I told thee. Come, now, let us forth to the water's
                  side; and haste thee, that we may be in time to see the sparkle of the sunset on
                  the waves."</p>
               <p>"Dear child," thought her father, as she hurried to obey his bidding, "it is
                  marvelous what a tender heart she hath! And to see her weep because I praised her.
                  She is a step above humanity, methinks, my own precious darling!"</p>
               <p>And what thought Alice? "Woe is me that I am become such a deceiver! But I can
                  not, and will not endure it longer. Why should I be thus bound in his thralldom?
                  This very evening I will speak to him and tell him that my father
                     <emph>must</emph> know the history of my acquaintance with Edith—dear girl, how
                  hard it was for me not to tell him! Oh! that first false step, into what a
                  labyrinth has it led me! Would I had never departed from the open path of
                  truthfulness!"</p>

               <p>Late in the evening of this melancholy day, the jailor, to his great joy, received
                  from the Governor's hand an order for the liberation of John Morrison and his
                  daughter, accompanied with permission to remain in their late dwelling until his
                  health should be sufficiently restored to permit him to journey, when they were
                  commanded to depart, and, on penalty of death, forbidden to return to that
                  jurisdiction. This was upon condition of their quiet and orderly behavior during
                  the time of their residence within the town of Boston.</p>
               <p>Late as was the hour when Joseph received the order, he hastened with it to the
                  prisoners' apartment. "For I know right well," said he, "that's better to be kept
                  awake by joy than by sorrow, and I warrant me, my pretty mistress'll lay there and
                  cry all night, and never sleep a wink, and be spilin' the looks of her eyes by
                  morning. It's hard to see'em cry—I'd prefer a lashin' any day. And women's ways is
                  queer now, ain't they? Yes, indeed, they <emph>are</emph> a curious sect, and I'll
                  vow that Lisbet Lane's the curiousest one of 'em all."</p>
               <p>Edith's heart thrilled with joy at the tidings that they were once more free, and
                  new strength seemed to infuse itself into her father's frame.</p>
               <p>"Heaven's free air is sweet," he said, "to him who has languished within the
                  narrow bound of prison walls. I would our brethren also could enjoy the blessed
                  privilege of freedom, and since God has so far softened the stern hearts of these
                  men, it may be that he will further bend them to his gracious will. I trust it
                  will indeed be so. My daughter, let us here bow the knee to Him whose mercy is
                  over all, and offer up the incense of our gratitude, together with our earnest
                  petitions in their behalf."</p>
               <p>Accordingly Edith knelt by her father's side, and her spirit was borne on the
                  wings of his petition to the heavenly throne. The jailor, who stood holding the
                  door in his hand, awed by the solemnity of the scene, bent his knee also on the
                  stony floor, and listened in subdued reverence to the language which flowed warm
                  and eloquent from the lips of the imprisoned Quaker.</p>
               <p>It was with hearts glowing with gratitude that the young girl and her father
                  sought their rest for the last time beneath the roof of a prison. And when the
                  morning sunshine streamed upon the face of the slumbering maiden, and recalled her
                  from a peaceful dream, she welcomed the warm harbinger as a token from heaven of a
                  happier and brighter day.</p>
               <p>The kind jailor was up betimes, and had their simple morning meal neatly spread in
                  his own private apartment. "It wouldn't be jest the thing to let 'em go away on
                  empty stomicks—it wouldn't reflect credit on the house. And maybe, if I didn't do
                  it, my young mistress wouldn't have nothin' in their own house to eat, and nobody
                  to get it ready and com'fable like for 'em. I wish his honor the minister had a
                  heard that<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6366-00000095"/> prayer. It beats him even—it
                  came so glib and easy-like—talkin's nothing to them Quaker folk, they say. They
                  call 'em heretics, too, and so I 'spose they be, though I shouldn't a found it out
                  from that prayer. And to hear him callin' down blessins on his enemies! Well,
                  thinks I, old man, Christian as <emph>I</emph> am I couldn't a done it; no, I'm
                  sure I couldn't, and if I had as little breath as you, I'd not spend it on folks
                  as hates me! But I'll jest go and listen if I hear 'em a-stirrin'."</p>
               <p>He did hear them stirring, and after a civil knock upon the door which he had
                  locked the night before only, as he assured them, with an apologetic air—"to be
                  certain that no harm should come to them"—he entered, and delivering his
                  invitation to breakfast with awkward courtesy, received a gratifying and hearty
                  acceptance.</p>
               <p>After the meal was ended and Edith had gathered up the few articles belonging to
                  them, they thanked the jailor for his kind civility, and slipping into his hand a
                  more substantial proof of gratitude, bade him farewell and left the prison.</p>
               <p>Joseph closed the door behind them and proceeded to examine the parting token.
                  "Gold!" he exclaimed, "well now, I didn't expect that. I hope he hain't robbed
                  hisself to give it to me! It looks like the true metal" (examining it on both
                  sides), "and has the proper ring" (throwing it down); "but I don't know, it may be
                  fairy gold for all that. I never could see what become of that note of the
                  Governor's, but if close keepin' will hold this it shan't serve me the trick the
                  letter did; and if it don't get away through the key-hole or turn to a wooden
                  button or a wiper, or some sich, I'll see if it won't buy a marriage token that'll
                  take Lisbet's fancy. Aha! that's the way to captivate the female sect. Jest dazzle
                  their eyes with a trinket or a gaudy-colored gown, and while they're taken up with
                  lookin' at it, slip on the bridle—and when they're once married to a man and know
                  they're tied for life, heaven knows they'll stick like a burr, and follow him from
                  Dan to Beersheba! Howsever, Lisbet's not one to be driv, not she; and after all, I
                  don't know as marriage is such a <emph>dreadful</emph> happy condition. It's
                  sartain to bring more mouths to feed, and the devil only (forgive us) knows how
                  many of 'em may come. Then there's chance knocks a body gits—and curtain lectures
                  as I've heard on, and there's the onruly member, ugh—Lisbet's tongue is not the
                     <emph>shortest</emph> tongue in Boston neither! Hows'ever, I don't know as I'd
                  mind all these disadvantages put together as much as that sing'lar way women folks
                  has of goin' into sterick fits! Poor Tom Jones has got a stericky wife, and he
                  says there ain't nothin' on earth to compare it to. Tom ain't what he used to be,
                  neither. He used to hold up his head so pert, and look as bold as a fightin'-cock.
                  I've been there sometimes when he's put on the old way, and only let<pb
                     n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6366-00000096"/> his gossip come in, and down goes his
                  fine feathers, and he drags along for all the world like a rooster as has been out
                  in the rain. If I thought Lisbet was stericky!" Here Joseph shook his head,
                  doubtingly, and remained for some moments in silent contemplation. He seemed to be
                  weighing each side of the question gravely in his mind. At last it appeared to be
                  settled to his satisfaction. His air expressed a manly confidence in his own
                  abilities. He felt himself prepared for emergencies. "Well, well, may be Lisbet
                     <emph>is</emph> a trifle skittish, but I'd rather have her so than too solemn.
                  Now there's that young mistress, why her very smile is so sorrowful that it melts
                  a body's heart down just as if it was made of bees'-wax. Poor young thing! it
                  ain't much wonder, for I guess she sees that the old 'un ain't long for this
                  world. Well, I'm glad they're gone, any way. It's been a weight on my mind, and if
                  I was n't as kind to 'em in the first place as I might a been, why I made up for
                  it at the end. But bless my soul, there hain't a critter of these folks had their
                  breakfast!"</p>
               <p>So Joseph, by way of a charm against witchcraft being exercised upon his golden
                  treasure, with which he promised himself he should purchase what to him would be
                  as the world's wealth to a monarch, placed it between the leaves of his Bible, and
                  locking it in a secret drawer, went about his usual avocations. Several times
                  during the day he came to take a look at his treasure, and finding it still there,
                  gained confidence each time in its reality, and when night came he retired to his
                  pillow to dream of wealth and happiness. His dream was that of prince, of noble,
                  and of peasant—it was the dream of the whole slumbering world!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>EDITH and her father reached their humble home, and had the satisfaction of
                  finding that it exhibited no marks of intrusion, except that the Quaker's books
                  had entirely disappeared and were replaced by others of a different character.
                  They were such as were deemed helpful to persons groping in the hidden ways of the
                  enemy.</p>
               <p>In Edith's little pantry was found a covered basket containing provisions ready
                  prepared for their use, as well as two or three small bottles of excellent wine—a
                  luxury not to be purchased at that day in the orderly town of Boston—and doubly
                  acceptable to the sick man in his enfeebled condition.</p>
               <p>"Alice must have done this," exclaimed Edith; and she was right. Alice contrived
                  that her father himself should propose the matter to her, and as it may be
                  believed, it met with her hearty co-operation. But she did not tell him the
                  history of her acquaintance with the prisoners in whom he seemed to take so warm
                  an interest, for upon hearing they were once more at liberty, she feared that by
                  doing so she should deprive herself of the privilege of occasionally visiting
                  Edith in her quiet home.</p>
               <p>After carefully attending to her father's comfort, our heroine ascended to her
                  chamber with a heart full of the most powerful emotions. She looked around upon
                  each familiar object with a sense of disappointment at not experiencing the
                  pleasure she had promised herself in beholding them again. Involuntarily her
                  thoughts turned to that other home where she had been so kindly cherished, and the
                  contrast, as that picture arose before her fancy, increased the cheerless aspect
                  of her own. There, for awhile, did she experience a sweet relief from the conflict
                  of her eventful life, and lived in an atmosphere of love and sympathy. But now,
                  once more she was alone, struggling with the adversities of her lot, and dreading
                  to look into the sad and solemn future which she was soon to tread, unsupported by
                  human strength, and uncheered by human sympathy. Too well she knew that her
                  father's days on earth must be of short duration; and beyond that little space of
                  time all was darkness. She could not ask his life, because she knew that her
                  petition must be vain. She could only bow to her heavenly Parent's will, almost
                  crushed beneath the consciousness of her weakness, and vailing her eyes against a
                  future so cheerless and so overwhelming!</p>
               <p>Edith had not yet recovered from her recent illness. Her frame had not regained
                  its wonted strength, nor<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6366-00000098"/> her mind its
                  accustomed energy. Her faith was dim, her hope was clouded. Perhaps it was the
                  glimpse she had had into something happier and brighter, but in which she was
                  forbidden to participate, which made her now feel that her lot was a harder one
                  than she could well endure. The feeling filled her with despondency—we had almost
                  said despair. From thoughts like these it was her custom to seek refuge in
                  prayer—now, that desire seemed dead within her soul, and there was something
                  rebellious in the mood with which she contemplated her lot. Even the circumstance
                  of their release from prison failed to awaken her gratitude, and she thought it
                  had been almost preferable to share the fate of those who were soon to die a death
                  of violence than to languish thus in helpless and hopeless misery.</p>
               <p>But the habit of pouring her sorrows into the ever-listening ear of her heavenly
                  Parent was too strongly fixed upon Edith for her to continue long in this unhappy
                  condition, and soon, when the violence of her emotions had been spent in tears,
                  and a more calm and quiet frame of mind succeeded, she hnmbled herself before the
                  throne of Him whom she had lately been almost ready to reproach as a hard and
                  cruel task-master, and obtained the needful strength to support her in the
                  exercise of her arduous duties.</p>
               <p>As she arose from her knees, a slight sound attracted her attention, and turning
                  hastily around, she was astonished tonished at the discovery that she was not
                  alone. The individual who thus intruded upon her privacy was one whose appearance
                  was calculated to surprise, if not to alarm her. The figure was that of a tall and
                  stately Indian girl, clad in a garb which denoted some little intercourse with her
                  own civilized race. Her dress consisted of a short garment of scarlet cloth,
                  reaching to the knees, and confined around the waist by a belt of wampum. A long
                  scarf of the same material was wrapped around the upper part of her form, and so
                  disposed as to cover her bosom, and the whole was ornamented with strings of beads
                  and the perforated teeth of animals. The same ornaments bound her arms and ankles,
                  and her feet were encased in moccasins, Her long raven hair hung loose around her
                  neck and shoulders, while a string of acorns were wound several times about her
                  head, and a dagger glittered in her girdle. She stood in Edith's presence with a
                  mien at once proud and humble, her arms crossed upon her bosom, and her eyes
                  regarding her with a subdued expression, which bestowed, rather than solicited,
                  pity.</p>
               <p>Edith did not intend that her countenance should betray alarm, although she feared
                  that this girl might be only one of a party concealed about the house or
                  neighborhood, and that their designs were hostile. Her pale cheek grew a shade
                  paler at the thought, and her voice was slightly tremulous, as she demanded,<pb
                     n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6366-00000099"/> "Who art thou, maiden? and what has
                  brought thee hither?"</p>
               <p>Great was her surprise when the girl replied in English, as clear and distinct as
                  her own:</p>
               <p>"Maretah fled from her father's wigwam. She is weary and seeks rest."</p>
               <p>"Didst thou come hither alone?"</p>
               <p>"The Indian girl flew like the swift-footed roe over the prairie. One only
                  followed, and," laying her hand upon her dagger, "his step pursues her no
                  longer."</p>
               <p>A cold shudder ran over Edith's frame at this; the girl saw her fear, and
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Fear nothing. The pale maiden is sad—the old man is sick; let Maretah be their
                  friend! She will dwell here, and her hand shall prepare their meat and their corn.
                  She will bring the healing root from the forest, and when my sister weeps her
                  tears shall fall on Maretah's bosom."</p>
               <p>"I thank thee, maiden," replied Edith, as tears filled her eyes at this
                  unlooked-for sympathy. "Thou hast journeyed far, and must be both hungry and
                  weary. Rest until I bring thee food, and when thou art refreshed thou shalt tell
                  my father thy story. He will judge kindly and wisely what is best to be done."</p>
               <p>"Maretah has rested here since the sun went down behind yonder hill. Let us go to
                  the old man; if he is kind, I will call him 'father,' and if he will not hear me,
                  I must depart once more."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Edith led her into her father's presence, and briefly related to him
                  as much of her history as she herself knew. At his request, Maretah, who seated
                  herself upon the floor at his bedside, proceeded to relate her story:</p>
               <p>"Long ago, when Maretah's years were few, the warriors of our tribe went forth to
                  battle. Four moons passed over us before their songs of triumph rang through our
                  valley, and the youths and maidens answered their shouts with cries of welcome.
                  They brought with them trophies such as we had never seen before, taken from the
                  pale-faced strangers, who came in winged canoes across the mighty waters, and made
                  their homes upon our fathers' graves. My mother wept in secret when she saw the
                  scalps of fair-haired maidens and tender babes hanging to their belts, and heard
                  Ouana tell how their fathers and their youths fought to save them, and how mothers
                  prayed for their little ones, and with their dying lips kissed their last breath
                  away.</p>
               <p>"There were prisoners among them, too. Our women pitied them, and washed their
                  wounds, and gave them food; but they were doomed to die. On the morrow they were
                  bound and fastened to separate trees that our young warriors might learn to cast
                  the tomahawk at their foes. There was a pale, sad boy, and he was my father's
                  captive. Maretah could not see him die, for he was beautiful as the morning,
                     and<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6366-00000100"/> I loved him. My mother, too,
                  begged for his life, for my sake. She was Ouana's heart's core, and he could not
                  refuse her prayer, so he spared Albert's life, and bade him teach his little
                  sister the white man's cunning arts and strange language. I loved to sit at his
                  feet and hear him tell of the wonders that lay far over the great ocean where his
                  home was; of the land of your fathers—its mighty cities—its powerful kings—its
                  wars and its glory. He told me, too, that there was another God than the great
                  spirits of good and evil, and that it was for love of Him that he and his brethren
                  fled from their homes to seek a refuge in the land of the savage. Oh, Albert! for
                  thy sake I seek the God of thy worship, and in those happy hunting-grounds where
                  thou dwellest, forget not to watch for the swift footsteps of Maretah!"</p>
               <p>For a few moments the Indian girl paused, overcome by her emotions, then raising
                  her head proudly, as if ashamed of having betrayed her agitation, she
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Day after day I sat at Albert's feet and learned of him. It was my joy to watch
                  his eye and catch his words, and I learned his language so well, that sometimes my
                  father took me with him on his journeys of peace and traffic with the white man,
                  that I might speak between them. Thus I learned where the track lay that led to
                  his dwelling.</p>
               <p>"Magawan was a young brave, and Ouana loved him, and promised to give him his
                  daughter. He came to the door of our wigwam, but I would not follow him. My father
                  bade me go, but I went not. My heart was with the captive, and as I could not be
                  the wife of my father's foe, I would go with none. Magawan saw I loved his enemy,
                  and persuaded my father to bind him to the fatal stake. I flew to his side, and
                  with a stroke cut the bands which held him. My father's anger was kindled, and he
                  bade them tighten Albert's cords, and, with his own hand, bound me to a
                  neighboring tree that I might see him die. He was my brother; he had taught me to
                  love the Christian's God, and dried my tears when our low-voiced mother departed.
                  Yes; I saw Magawan's tomahawk drink his life's-blood! He died, and 'Maretah' was
                  the last word on Albert's lips!</p>
               <p>"For days our spirits would not separate. I could not let him go without me to the
                  mighty Father, but my soul lingered on the borders of his happy home, and strove
                  to enter the gate through which his had passed away. But I was forced to return. I
                  came back to earth with a fever consuming my heart—it was the thirst for revenge!
                  Then I remembered Albert's teachings, and felt that if I would meet him again, I
                  must not stain my hand with blood. What then? I could not live to see his murderer
                  before me, day by day, only waiting until strength returned to my wasted limbs, to
                  bid me once more follow him to his wigwam<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6366-00000101"
                  /> and become his slave! I felt that so sure as I obeyed that command of Ouana, to
                  become his wife, that it would only be to lie by his side until I saw him
                  sleeping, and then to plunge my knife into his heart!</p>
               <p>"At length the day came when my father, pointing to the setting-sun, bade me
                  behold it. I answered not, but my heart grew hard and cold beneath his stern look.
                  Then, stretching his hand toward the eastern sky, he said, 'When his step is seen
                  there Magawan comes to claim thee. Maretah will go!'</p>
               <p>"I would have thrown myself at his feet, and prayed him to let me live only for
                  him—to let me nurse his coming age, and sit beside his sick bed—but I knew his eye
                  too well. My prayer would have been vain.</p>
               <p>"When night spread her dark wings over us, I fled. Swifter than the deer's foot
                  was mine, over the prairie, and toward the white man's dwelling. I heard the howl
                  of the hungry wolf in my track, the eyes of the wild-cat glared on me through the
                  night, but Maretah feared them not. I thought of Albert and his cruel death, and
                  there was a wolf within my bosom more fierce than the one in my path. It was this
                  I fled from. He had told me that your God once gave you a Holy Book in which his
                  commands were written, and Albert's voice rang in my ears—'Thou shalt do no
                  murder!'</p>
               <p>"When the step of the mighty hunter was first seen in the east I was far from my
                  father's wigwam. All day I journeyed on, but when evening fell, I heard their
                  cries behind me. In the heart of a great tree I concealed myself until they had
                  passed me by—all but Magawan! With a tiger's scent he followed my retreat. His
                  laugh of triumph, as he saw me, filled me with rage. Nearer and nearer he came,
                  the fire of his eyes burning into my heart. The hand that slew Albert was
                  stretched out to seize another victim. That moment I forgot the voice of my
                  beloved—I forgot the white man's God, and with a spring, I plunged my knife into
                  his bosom. This blade—" and she drew it from her belt, and raised the hand that
                  held it toward Heaven—"this blade drank his life. Albert was avenged! But, oh!
                  Christians, can your God forgive?"</p>
               <p>"Maretah," said John Morrison, after a short silence, "I grieve that thou didst
                  rashly stain thy hand with a brother's blood—but know that the God we worship is
                  ever ready to forgive the sins of his repentant children. 'Vengeance is mine, I
                  will repay,' He saith, and to Him shouldst thou have left the stroke of
                  retribution. Yet I know, my child, that thou wast sorely pressed, and considering
                  the character of thy birth and nurture, thou didst well restrain thy hand. But
                  Maretah, if thou wilt worship the white man's God thou must learn the lesson of
                  forgiveness. In His holy word thou wilt find a guide for thy uncertain footsteps,
                  and a lamp unto thy pathway."</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6366-00000102"/>
               <p>"For Albert's sake I seek the white man's God. In the dark hour which tore his
                  spirit from its dwelling, that God was by his side, and sent death smiling to his
                  lips. He gave him power to pray for his enemies, and told him to call upon the
                  poor Indian girl to be a Christian."</p>
               <p>"It boots not to tell thee, maiden, that for Himself thou must love our heavenly
                  Parent. Yet, if thou art first won to Him through an earthly affection, be it so,
                  for as soon as knowledge of Him, and of His great and wondrous love to us doth
                  penetrate thy soul, thou shalt be led to adore Him with feelings beyond those
                  which we bestow upon earthly and perishing objects. If thou desire to tarry with
                  us, thou art welcome to the shelter of our dwelling, and we will endeavor to
                  instruct thee in the knowledge thou art seeking."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my father! Maretah will stay."</p>
               <p>"But Maretah, thou canst have no need of that dangerous and deadly weapon which
                  thou wearest. It may be the means of leading thee into further crime, which may
                  not be attended with palliating circumstances. We must put away from us the means
                  of temptation, if we would not fall into its snare."</p>
               <p>"Fear not, my father. There is but one life which Maretah's knife shall ever turn
                  against now."</p>
               <p>"My child, what meanest thou? Such purposes can not be reconciled with the
                  principles of the religion of Christ. Wilt thou again do murder?"</p>
               <p>"No. The life I spoke of was mine own. Maretah listens for the steps of her
                  pursuers, and when she hears their echo, she has sworn that this knife shall again
                  become her friend!"</p>
               <p>It was in vain that the Quaker sought to convince her of the error of her purpose.
                  No arguments could persuade the Indian girl that her life was not her own, or that
                  the crime of self-destruction was greater than the disgrace of returning a captive
                  to her tribe. She yielded to Edith's wish that she should change her wild attire
                  for habiliments of a more civilized character, although her awkward movements
                  under such restraint provoked a smile from her kind protectress: yet she insisted
                  upon wearing, concealed in her bosom, the dagger, which was to save her from
                  disgrace and misery.</p>
               <p>Little reason had Edith and her father to regret the accident which brought the
                  Indian girl to their home. In the duties of housekeeping Edith found her an
                  invaluable assistant, and her kindness and tenderness as a nurse elicited the
                  warmest praises of the invalid. Though scarce herself older than Edith, she was
                  watchful of her as a mother of her child, and often when she was weary would
                  persuade her to recline upon her bed, and sitting beside her, would sing in a low
                  musical chant, some tale of forest love or warfare, or interesting legend of the
                  prairie. In return, Edith instructed her in letters, of which she was not
                     ignorant<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6366-00000103"/> rant, as well as in the use
                  of the needle and other arts of civilized female life; and many an otherwise
                  desolate hour was pleasantly wiled away in her society.</p>
               <p>Yet we can not say but Edith's thoughts often wandered to the home where she had
                  passed those peaceful days, when, ignorant of her father's misfortunes, she
                  yielded to the sweet influences around her, and felt the beauty of a home
                  undisturbed by shadows of evil. And if her mind dwelt longest upon one member of
                  that dear circle, upon him to whom she owed her life, it was with a melancholy,
                  though tender feeling that thenceforth their paths through life must diverge
                  widely. A sigh of regret at this reflection would escape from her bosom, which, if
                  she did not seek to smother, spoke to her only of a sweet lingering shade of
                  sadness over a picture which might else have glowed with the warmth and light of
                  summer. She was unconscious of a hope which lay beneath the ashes of the past,
                  ready to ignite at the first breath of encouragement, for the cloud that rested
                  upon her future hid from her all that was bright and cheering, and forbade her
                  indulging in the dear though sometimes delusive visions of youth's fair
                  season.</p>
               <p>She never alluded now to her long-cherished wish that her father would at last be
                  persuaded to return to England. In truth that step which once seemed to her so
                  desirable, had lost its whole attraction, and her heart was bound to those foreign
                  and inhospitable shores by a mysterious tie. Sometimes she vaguely wondered at
                  this change of feeling; and then the remembrance of her father's feeble condition
                  coming over her, she looked no further for its solution, and resigned herself,
                  without reluctance, to the necessity of remaining in their present home.</p>
               <p>The melancholy winds of autumn were fast scattering the remaining vestiges of
                  summer, and the drear and gloomy forest mourned over its faded glory. The strength
                  of the invalid failed with the year's vanishing brightness, and he was now unable
                  to leave his chamber. Edith rarely left him, unless upon an errand of his
                  devising, that she might obtain needful air and exercise, rather than as he would
                  have persuaded her, for his convenience or accommodation; and at such times
                  Maretah was his kind and attentive companion.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>ONE morning the young girl, absorbed in her own sad thoughts, passed thus on her
                  unobtrusive way, when she was suddenly aroused from her reverie by the sound of a
                  drum, and the rush of an approaching throng. Edith looked about her for some way
                  of escape from such an encounter, but seeing none, and unable to extricate herself
                  from the crowd, which by this time surrounded her, she was borne along by its
                  impetuous tide. There were no loud acclamations from the multitude, betokening joy
                  or triumph, but a murmur, like the rush of an approaching storm, denoted that some
                  mightier power was stirring its deeper passions.</p>
               <p>Men gazed upon each other with faces paled by fear, and shook their heads with
                  dark foreboding, and women drew their children into a closer and firmer grasp, and
                  hushed the wailing infants in their arms. Even the very little ones seemed to have
                  caught the general panic, for their shouts of mirth, and even of terror, were
                  silenced as their wondering eyes sought the paternal countenance.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere Edith found herself standing in view of a scene which struck
                  terror into her very soul. Directly in front of her arose a scaffold, and
                  approaching it advanced a procession, consisting of about two hundred armed men,
                  beside horsemen, in the midst of whom walked hand-in-hand three individuals, whom
                  she recognized as belonging to her father's persuasion, and whom she had
                  frequently seen at their private religious assemblies. It did not directly occur
                  to the astonished girl that these could be the destined victims of a fate so
                  terrible, for while every countenance around them was either pale with fear or
                  horror, or distorted by angry passions, theirs alone were calm and tranquil,
                  indicating that their spirits were already lifted above the scenes of earth, and
                  transported to a resting-place of peace and joy.</p>
               <p>As Edith gazed upon them the calm that was diffused over their faces and attitude
                  seemed to impart itself in a measure to her own agitated mind. She saw them—two
                  young men on either side of a female advanced in years, hand in hand ascend the
                  steps of the platform, followed by their stern and scowling foes—as it might be
                  the Divine impersonation of Religion leading to the altar of her sacrifice the
                  victims of dark-browed Superstition. She saw that several attempts on their part
                  to speak to the crowd were rudely prevented; and it was not until the executioner
                  advanced to bind them, that a realizing sense of the scene before<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000105"/> her struck like death upon her brain. Then with a
                  shriek she turned to fly, and the people around her, noticing for the first time
                  the peculiarity of her dress and supposing her to be a relative or dear friend of
                  one of the prisoners, humanely made for her a way of egress. One or two of the
                  soldiers who mingled among the crowd to preserve order made a movement to arrest
                  her progress, but their path was cut off by the people, and one man, braver than
                  the rest, with a threatening frown reminded them that there was already blood
                  enough to be shed. In an instant a hundred voices joined in the dissatisfied
                  chorus, and warned the armed officials that their act was not in accordance with
                  the united will of the people.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile preparations for the execution were going on, and the foremost of the
                  two male prisoners ascended the ladder. The rope was adjusted about his neck, and
                  in a loud voice he cried—"I suffer for Christ, in whom I live and for whom I die."
                  In another moment his body hung suspended in the air and his spirit stood before
                  his God in sorrowful accusing of his murderers.</p>
               <p>His friend then stepping up the ladder, exclaimed. "Be it known unto all, this
                  day, that we suffer not as evil-doers, but for conscience' sake. This day shall we
                  be at rest with the Lord!" and he, too, had received the martyrs' crown.</p>
               <p>Then Mary Dyer, whose presence of mind had not forsaken her through all this
                  trying scene, stepped up the ladder, ready to share the fate of her companions.
                  Her feet were bound, the halter placed about her neck, and a hankerchief being
                  desired by the hangman to cover her face, one was handed him by a divine, who
                  stood by in all the delegated majesty of a servant of the Lord. But now a cry is
                  heard from the outskirts of the throng, and echoed by glad voices far and near,
                  "Stop, stop; she is reprieved!"<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>Mary Dyer was at this time reprieved and banished from Boston, but on
                     returning the following year to bear her testimony against the cruelties
                     exercised toward her brethren, she was condemned, and executed on the 1st
                     day of April, 1660.</p>
               </note>
               <p>That night there was scarce an individual in Boston whose rest was not disturbed
                  by the events of that fearful day. Children started from their dreams—which should
                  be only of innocent delights—to cling, with screams of terror, to their parents'
                  protecting arms. And parents themselves, so far from reproving their fears as
                  groundless, trembled as they tried to soothe their excited fancy.</p>
               <p>So far from being a popular measure, the execution of the Quakers aroused the
                  censure and indignation of many, and from that day friends began to arise and
                  declare themselves fearlessly in behalf of the persecuted sect, and from many
                  quarters loud and earnest remonstrances were made against the severity of such
                  proceedings.</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6366-00000106"/>
               <p>It was a dark day for New England, when her virgin soil was doomed to blush
                  forever with the blood thus shed by her adopted sons. The Genius of history, with
                  a glow of triumph on her cheek, had hitherto recorded the noble deeds of the
                  Patriot Pilgrims; but now, with the stain of shame mounting to her brow, she turns
                  her truth-telling face from futurity, and with the tender hand of a mother,
                  strives to hide the record of her children's sin!</p>

               <p>EDITH swiftly fled from that scene of terror, scarce conscious where her
                  frightened footsteps led her. On and on she hurried, as if distance could erase
                  that fearful picture from her mind. Unwilling to present herself before her
                  father, in her present excited condition, she avoided her own home, and took the
                  path that led her to the water's side, and when exhausted by fatigue and emotion,
                  she slackened her pace and ventured to cast a hurried glance behind; she saw that
                  she had been followed by an individual who was endeavoring by earnest gestures to
                  arrest her attention. Deeming that perhaps in that solitary spot she had more to
                  fear from such an encounter than from the uncertain impulses of a crowd, and not
                  being in a state to reflect upon her course, she once more turned and hurried on
                  her way, with accelerated speed. But her pursuer was soon at her side, and seized
                  her arm, just as she reached the water's edge.</p>
               <p>"Edith, Edith, what mean you, and why do you come here in this wild haste?" he
                  exclaimed, with a face and manner full of apprehension and distrust.</p>
               <p>She turned and saw that it was her friend, and<pb n="212-213"

                  time before she could recover her composure, sufficiently to answer him.</p>
               <p>"Alas, what have I seen! Oh, they will not, they dare not do a deed so
                  fearful!"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that you have been a witness of what is transpiring yonder? You
                  should not have come abroad on such a day."</p>
               <p>"I knew nothing of it, indeed, until I found myself in the midst of a crowd, and
                  in fearful vicinity to the scene. "Oh," she cried, clasping her hands eagerly, and
                  starting forward, "perhaps it is not yet too late to prevent a crime so
                  deadly."</p>
               <p>"Stop, Edith, you can do nothing. It is, indeed, a crime displeasing to God and
                  man, but nothing can avail now. Let me lead you home before the crowd disperses,
                  and every path and by way becomes alive with loiterers."</p>
               <p>"I will go, but thou must not come with me. God alone is our defense now, and
                  He—but no, it can not be that He ever deserts his children."</p>
               <p>"I can not permit you to go alone. It is unsafe, and beside, I have something to
                  say to you which concerns your father's welfare."</p>
               <p>"I beg that thou will say it, then, in as few words as possible, and leave me. I
                  have no fear in going my way alone; and with thanks for thy kindness, must request
                  that I may be allowed to do so."</p>
               <p>"You are offended, Edith, and not without cause. My late conduct requires an
                  explanation, and I will give it with candor sufficient to satisfy even you. I saw
                  you running in such haste as led me to fear that some danger pursued you, and I
                  followed to defend you at all hazards. But when you ran so wildly down this path,
                  knowing its termination, a more terrible thought crossed my mind, and filled it
                  with a momentary distrust of one whom I believed to be the soul of rectitude.
                  Pardon me, Edith, for that moment I feared you meditated an act from which I now
                  feel your soul would shrink—the act of self-destruction. It was this that for an
                  instant caused my manner toward you to become constrained."</p>
               <p>Edith turned her dark eyes on him with a smile, in which mingled so much of
                  wounded feeling, that Louis almost repented his candor. "Didst thou indeed suspect
                  me, even for a moment, of entertaining such a purpose? Couldst thou believe me so
                  lost to every feeling of duty, every restraint of conscience?"</p>
               <p>At this moment the cries which announced that Mary Dyer was reprieved, were borne
                  upon the air from the distance, and ignorant of their real cause, each supposed
                  them to be the expression of inhuman joy from the crowd, upon witnessing the last
                  act of that day's tragedy. With a shudder they quickened their steps, and drawing
                  Edith's trembling hand within his own, Louis led her by the most secluded way<pb
                     n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6366-00000108"/> toward her home. Wishing to divert her
                  thoughts from this agitating topic, he spoke of her father and inquired into his
                  condition.</p>
               <p>"This is a fortunate encounter, for it gives me the opportunity of consulting with
                  you upon a plan I have been forming. Most gladly would I do all in my power to
                  contribute to his recovery, or to alleviate his sufferings. Think you he will
                  trust himself in the hands of such a poor adviser?"</p>
               <p>Much had occurred in the short experience of poor Edith to deprive her of the
                  elasticity of mind natural to her years and character, yet there was enough of
                  buoyancy left to lift her spirit on the wing of a bright hope which these words
                  conjured. "Was it not possible that medical aid might yet reach the root of his
                  malady?" Oh! how beautiful was the thought that darted across her mind, of that
                  dear parent restored to life and health once more! In an instant the sunshine of
                  happiness broke from the clouds behind which it had long been hidden, and illumed
                  the vision of the future with its joyous rays.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" she cried, "who can tell that it may not yet be? For my sake he must, he
                  will! and yet—" and the shadow once more fell upon her spirit as she remembered
                  the danger in which such a step would involve her friend—"no, no; I see it can not
                  be! What right have we to risk thy safety thus? My father will not consent, and I
                  dare not urge it!"</p>
               <p>"But indeed you may, for I have been so bold as to obtain permission to become
                  your father's physician. Edith, it was a duty I owed to them whose only protector
                  I am. Through Mr. Mildman's intercession it was accomplished, and so, in lieu of
                  better and more skillful aid, you must, for aught I see, accept mine. I will not
                  intrude now, however, lest your father, unconscious of my dignity, should slight
                  my newly-born honors."</p>
               <p>As the young physician turned to retrace his steps, his thoughts still lingered
                  around the dwelling of the Quaker. Doubtless they would have been less pleasant
                  had he known that envious hatred had pursued him thither. Too often it is the
                  case, that the treacherous spider weaves his net within the bower where peace and
                  joy might reign; but although for a brief time falsehood may prevail,
                  truth—unswerving and unerring—will at last assert her power, and maintain the
                  "even tenor of her way."</p>
               <p>It required some little persuasion on the part of Edith to induce her father to
                  accept the services of a medical attendant, for he was well persuaded that his
                  disease was one that defied all human skill, yet for her sake he at length
                  consented that it should be so, and Louis now became a daily visitor at their
                  domicile.</p>
               <p>But although his remedies afforded a temporary relief to the sufferer, they
                  effected no permanent change, and he, too, was soon convinced that his patient's
                     case<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6366-00000109"/> lay beyond all help, save from
                  the hand of the Great Physician. Still, it was a comfort to the lonely girl to
                  feel that she had his deepest sympathy, and his kind attentions to her dying
                  parent awoke her livliest gratitude.</p>
               <p>And no one told her that he was dying, for they saw by the subdued calmness of her
                  air, by her growing pallor, and her patient watchfulness, that she already knew it
                  but too well. And how many an agonizing thought struggled within her bosom as she
                  saw that parent's tender, pitying gaze follow her about the chamber, or sometimes
                  turn away from her as if the sight were more than he could endure. Then she strove
                  to wear a cheerful look, or to hide her starting tears, until, in the silence of
                  her chamber, and alone with God, she could pour out the bitterness of her sorrow.
                  There she sought and found strength to bear her through each wearying
                  day—wearying, though every moment as it wore away seemed like a vanished treasure.
                  Yes! she knew that she should soon be an orphan—perhaps friendless and outcast in
                  a world of strangers. And what sustained her under the pressure of this knowledge?
                  Ah! what, indeed, but her unfaltering trust in God!</p>

               <p>THE visits of the young physician afforded Edith an additional pleasure, because
                  they gave her an opportunity of hearing from his family, and through him she often
                  received from Angeline a token of remembrance in the shape of a trifle of
                  needlework, wrought by her own delicate hand, or an eloquent, though more simple
                  one of a single fragrant flower; and these afiectionate gifts she returned by
                  others of a similar character. Occasionally Maretah's forest skill contributed to
                  the child's precious hoard, though nothing gave her so much pleasure as a sketch
                  from the ready pencil of her friend. These it was her delight to try to imitate,
                  and she would sit for hours together laboring to produce something resembling the
                  valued original. One day when she was thus employed, and thoroughly intent upon
                  her occupation, her mother softly crept behind her, intending, unobserved, to
                  watch her progress. She was engaged in attempting to copy a female head, of
                  singular and touching beauty, which appeared to be a creation of the fancy. But as
                  soon as Mrs. Hermon fixed her eyes upon it, she uttered<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000110"/> tered an exclamation of surprise, and seizing the
                  paper, remained for some moments lost in its contemplation.</p>
               <p>"Dear mamma, how you startled me! What makes you look so surprised and so
                  sorry?"</p>
               <p>"Angeline, how did you come by this?" asked her mother, her eyes still fixed upon
                  the picture, and her face expressing not a little emotion.</p>
               <p>"'Tis one that Edith sent me. I thought I had shown it you before."</p>
               <p>"It is a singular resemblance, but more sad in the expression"—and going to a
                  drawer she took from it a miniature which she compared with the sketch in her
                  hand. It was the picture of a bright and laughing girl, and few would have
                  detected any resemblance between it and the mature beauty of the other, tempered
                  by matron gravity, and a spiritual sadness which looked from the depths of those
                  eyes subdued by sorrow.</p>
               <p>"Not so much like her, after all. Strange, that I should have thought so! I now
                  see what memory of the past it was that haunted me whenever I looked at Edith, for
                  there certainly is a resemblance to her here. Dear Margaret! would I knew whether,
                  after all, her lot proved a happy one."</p>

               <p>The winter was passing away, and Louis was almost the only visitor at the cottage,
                  though Mr. Mildman sometimes came to inquire into their progress and to endeavor
                  with Christian-like zeal to turn the heart of the dying man to what he deemed the
                  true and only way to perfect peace, when one day just as Edith had retired for a
                  short repose from the duties of the sickroom, she was both surprised and
                  disappointed at seeing Henriette unexpectedly enter her chamber.</p>
               <p>"Why, Edith, how are you? I am so glad to find you at last, and what work I have
                  had to do it! I see you are delighted to see me—nay, do not trouble your
                  conscience (which I know is very tender) by making useless protestations! Bless
                  me! who would imagine you had such a luxurious corner here all to yourself. Ah,
                  ha! Edith, a pretty martyr you are, truly! By the way, did you go to the Quaker
                  dance the other day? I thought possibly you and your father would be invited.
                  Indeed, it was quite a slight to omit asking you!"</p>
               <p>"Thou hast had a cold walk, Henriette," was Edith's only answer; though her heart
                  sank at the thought of being subjected to the persecutions of this bitter-spirited
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it <emph>is</emph> cold; but you have such a nice little fire here that I
                  shall make myself comfortable. Indeed, now that I have found you, you may expect
                  to see me often. Then you have all these pretty trifles about your chamber to
                  amuse one with, books, paintings, and embroidery. The music, I suppose you keep to
                  charm my simple cousin with when your father is<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000111"/> away. And pray, which is his patient, Edith, you or
                  your father? for I fancy his illness is somewhat fabulous, after all. But really,
                  Edith, it is laughable to see your dismay. Now, if my dear aunt (who would not run
                  the risk for the world) were to come to see you, I warrant you would not look so.
                  But I am the only one who is willing to defy the lash for the sake of keeping up
                  your acquaintance, and yet you look as much like a victim as if you were suffering
                  the penalty of the law and sitting in the stocks;" and Henriette laughed
                  immoderately.</p>
               <p>"Henriette, I have no desire—indeed, more than that, I do insist that thou wilt
                  not expose thyself and thy kind aunt's family by coming hither. I will be entirely
                  candid with thee and say that no good can come of it, for I am sure that it is not
                  for love of me thou seekest our home!"</p>
               <p>"That is true, Edith; it is purely for amusement! You may rest assured, however,
                  that I shall come whenever the humor takes me. I like to watch the progress of a
                  love affair, and this between yourself and my cousin is quite a little romance. I
                  am curious to see what device you will try next in case this of a sick father
                  should fail. You have tried drowning yourself, you know, and that came very near
                  succeeding."</p>
               <p>"Henriette, thou art an orphan, and I shall soon be the same. My lot is one of
                  grief and hardship. My cup of bitterness well nigh o'erflows the brim. Why
                  shouldst thou wish to mingle in it more of pain and sorrow than that with which
                  God visits me?"</p>
               <p>"Why how ungrateful you are, Edith! What is your lot in comparison with mine? An
                  orphan! Who cares for that? But look at me! behold the bent form with which I am
                  cursed! What, think you, would I care for grief and hardship if I had your form
                  and beauty, which could win all hearts to love me? Why was I sent on earth in this
                  shape? Was it to be kind and gentle and patient—was it to beg for the affection
                  which beauty can command or disdain at pleasure? I am an object of hatred and
                  loathing. No child sees me but turns to look again and stand in wonder; and no
                  mother beholds me but blesses God that her child was not born like me! And yet I
                  should be meek and humble, and thank heaven for my existence. No! I will not. I
                  will give hate for hate, and those who can not love shall fear me; they shall feel
                  the sting of my revenge!"</p>
               <p>"Thou doest thyself injustice, Henriette. What is the most beautiful form if a
                  corresponding spirit do not inhabit it? Does not a violent and undisciplined mind
                  distort the most symmetrical shape, and render beauty but a mockery? And will not
                  a kind and gentle spirit clothe the homeliest in more than earthly beauty? None
                  are placed here but in kindness and mercy, and affection ever yields to affection
                  its grateful tribute."</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6366-00000112"/>
               <p>"It is false!" cried Henriette, starting from her seat, while her face was livid
                  with anger. "Love is not the return for love, but hatred often stings the heart
                  that should receive its meed of affection. How dare you tell me this! Is it to
                  taunt me with a coldness of which you are the cause? Proud girl, you shall yet
                  know what I suffer. You shall feel the pangs of disappointed hope. You shall
                  suffer the agony of a heart despised and trampled on. Do not flatter yourself that
                  you shall ever realize the happiness you dream of. And now I leave you to your
                  reflections, but be sure you shall see me again. Oh, yes!" she continued, with a
                  taunting laugh, for by this time she had recovered her composure, "I shall come
                  again, never fear—and now we understand each other."</p>
               <p>Just then she turned to go, and Maretah entering the room at the moment, each
                  stood for a short time regarding the other with looks of astonishment, and, as if
                  mutually recognizing an enemy, their expression changed to one of proud defiance,
                  until at last Henriette brushed passed the Indian girl and vanished from the
                  chamber.</p>
               <p>The latter approached the bed-side, and gazed anxiously upon Edith's pallid
                  countenance, for, although she retained her composure of manner, her face wore so
                  harassed an expression, that the kind-hearted girl knelt beside her, and drawing
                  her head toward her until it rested upon her bosom, commenced in a low and
                  soothing voice to murmur a wild lullaby. For awhile Edith's tears continued to
                  fall silently, but gradually she yielded to its influence, and, wearied with the
                  excess of her emotions, slept on the friendly bosom of the forest child. Tenderly,
                  as if she were an infant, Maretah watched her slumbers, and when Edith awoke, she
                  found herself still cradled in her arms, and those soft dark eyes smilingly bent
                  upon her.</p>

               <p>IT was not without anxiety that Mrs. Hermon had consented to her son's plan of
                  becoming John Morrison's medical adviser. Yet she felt it would be almost inhuman
                  to withhold such assistance from him, and the sanction of the Council being
                  obtained through the intercession of Mr. Mildman, her fears were quite allayed.
                  Then, too, her mind was prepossessed with the idea that the minister was Edith's
                  accepted suitor, otherwise she might have apprehended for her son another danger
                  in coming so frequently into contact with one, who, she believed, possessed every
                  high womanly quality, and to whom she herself could not forbear rendering the just
                  tribute of respect and admiration.</p>
               <p>They had heard, through Mr. Mildman, the circumstances of her solitary interview
                  with the Governor, and also his account of her father's conduct and her own when
                  summoned to appear before the Council, and had felt their regard deepen and their

               <p>One day, however, Mrs. Hermon's confidence in the Quaker's daughter received a
                  check, in consequence of the following letter, which was placed in her hand by an
                  unknown messenger.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>"Forgive this interference in your family concerns of one who has your
                              welfare deeply at heart. But aware of a danger which threatens you,
                              and of which I am sure you must be ignorant. I should not be
                              performing the part of a friend did I not seek to warn you of your
                              peril. You have cherished in your home and near your too tender heart,
                              one in whom you are deceived most strangely. Fear not because your
                              secret is known to me, for by me it is regarded as sacred. In your
                              conduct you obeyed the dictates of humanity, for which I am the last
                              to condemn you. But I can not see your confidence betrayed—your
                              kindness turned against your own peace. Beware lest fruitless
                              self-sacrifice and misplaced sympathy involve you in
                              unhappiness—perhaps in ruin. Withdraw your son from the dangerous
                              intercourse of treachery and design. Save him, while it is yet in your
                              power. The arts and devices of woman are beyond compare. It is
                              necessary that you should be guarded in your means. Do not yet seek to
                              convince him that his confidence is misplaced. And, above all, keep
                              all knowledge of this communication from him—at least for the present.
                              When your object is obtained you may reveal all, but,<pb n="226-227"

                              purpose, keep this secret now. At least obtain his confidence first,
                              and you will find that I am right, and that you have deceived
                              yourself. May God help you, is the sincere prayer of</p>

               <p>Mrs. Hermon was not one to be easily alarmed by an anonymous communication, and
                  yet, as she read and re-read the above, she felt her mind awake to all the fond
                  alarms it was calculated to produce. There was but one application she could make
                  of its meaning, and although she was reluctant to believe that she had been so
                  entirely deceived in the character of the Quaker's daughter, appealing as this did
                  to her maternal instinct, it caused her much uneasiness and some vexation.</p>
               <p>It is no less strange than true, and not greatly to the credit of humanity, that
                  while virtue must labor long and diligently to win our esteem, a single breath of
                  slander is too often enough to overthrow those fruits of patient toil. The
                  gossamer web of opinion is destroyed by the besom of suspicion, wielded by a
                  careless or designing hand. Only strike the chord of self, and in a moment its
                  response drowns the claims of timid and low-voiced merit.</p>
               <p>It was a difficult matter for Mrs. Hermon to determine how she should proceed to
                  bring about the result she desired, of ascertaining if her son's feelings had
                  already become seriously interested in the young girl, and if so, how to convince
                  him of his error, and to prevent its fatal consequences. She resolved to follow
                  the advice of her secret informer in concealing the fact of the letter having been
                  received, and to make her anxiety appear as the result of mature reflection; and
                  she consoled herself with the conviction that at all events she should be able to
                  obtain his promise of forbearing to enter into any marriage-engagement without her
                  sanction.</p>
               <p>The troubled expression of her countenance throughout the day did not escape his
                  observation, and when, as was their custom, they sat together, after the other
                  members of the family had retired, to enjoy a few moments of mutual confidence and
                  undisturbed intercourse, he tenderly inquired into the cause of her anxiety.</p>
               <p>"My son, I fear that for once we have both been strangely imprudent, and that I
                  especially am to blame for want of reflection and foresight."</p>
               <p>"It would be strange indeed if my mother had been wanting in either of these—her
                  especial attributes. But why do you speak and look so anxiously?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! Louis, it is on your account; and could I only be certain that you have not
                  already fallen into the snare, I should once more breathe freely."</p>
               <p>"Why, mother, what can you mean? A snare? Only show me the rash fowler who is
                  trying to catch your unwary boy!"</p>
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6366-00000115"/>
               <p>"My dear, I must beg you will be serious. It is too important a matter to be made
                  a jest of!"</p>
               <p>"Well, mother, I will be serious, then, although I am sure your maternal fears are
                  aroused needlessly."</p>
               <p>"God grant they are! But we are often on the very brink of the precipice before we
                  dream that there is one in our way."</p>
               <p>"But why this apprehension? I beg you to tell me in plain words, what it is you
                  fear, and what danger you imagine besets me?"</p>
               <p>"In plain words, then, Louis, I fear that our sympathy for these unfortunate
                  Quakers has blinded us as to the possible consequences."</p>
               <p>"But how can that be, when you know that what I am now doing is by consent of the
                  Council? Besides, our humane friend, Mr. Mildman, was so guarded on our account,
                  that he took upon himself the task of selecting a physician for Mr. Morrison,
                  without letting our good counselors know that I offered my poor services."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I know all that, but it does not in the least obviate the difficulty. It
                  is a danger of a more insiduous character, and one from which neither I nor the
                  council can secure you. It rests with yourself only, my son!"</p>
               <p>"You are more mysterious than ever!" he exclaimed, while something of a flush
                  passed over his face at the remark.</p>
               <p>The sign of emotion did not pass undetected by the watchful mother, and a start of
                  pain crossed her heart as she beheld it.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Louis, think in what misery an unfortunate attachment of this nature would
                  involve us!"</p>
               <p>"Mother!" he cried, as he started from his seat, and with strong marks of
                  agitation paced the apartment—"mother, be assured you shall never be involved in
                  misery through my means!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! my son, sit down again beside me, and say that this warning has not come too
                  late—that my apprehensions are groundless. Say that your heart is untouched by an
                  unhappy passion—that your affections are yet free! Tell me that my boy is not the
                  victim of these cruel circumstances!"</p>
               <p>"Mother," he answered, resuming his seat, and taking her hand in both his own,
                  while his face grew so pale as to cause her inexpressible alarm, "you have taken
                  me by surprise; you do not give me time to think, to know my own feelings. How is
                  it, think you? Can one who calls himself a man steel his heart against what is
                  most pure and beautiful? Could you imagine that a young and susceptible boy, like
                  me," and he strove to smile gayly as he said this, "could behold such loveliness
                  in distress, could see with what noble heroism and angelic patience that frail
                  girl has borne the adversities of her lot—think you I could note her daily
                  self-sacrifice, suffered without a murmur or complaint<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000116"/> plaint; her courage in submitting to insult and
                  cruel threats rather than betray us to suspicion (and mark you, mother, we should
                  never have known a breath of it from her!)—do you imagine I could see all this
                  with indifference and deny the just tribute of admiration? It is more than you
                  yourself could resist, and what is it you expect of me?"</p>
               <p>"Alas, alas! I see it is too true! Why was I so deceived, so blinded? What is a
                  mother's instinct if it did not warn me of this? I have been too secure, too proud
                  in my happiness—and behold my punishment!"</p>
               <p>"Mother, mother!" cried he, as he threw his arms fondly around her, "do not let it
                  grieve you so! What is it you desire of me that is not my duty, nay, my pleasure
                  to yield? Your happiness is far dearer to me than mine own. Ask what you will,
                  mother, only do not let me see you shed tears, and feel that I am the cause of
                  your distress!"</p>
               <p>"It is for your sake, I grieved, and I can never forgive my own folly in not
                  thinking to warn you of this, from the first."</p>
               <p>"And, on the other hand, I will not forgive you if you continue to reproach
                  yourself thus. In doing so, you are really unkind. How could you be expected to
                  foresee it? and indeed if you had, mother, it might only have put the mischief
                  into my mind all the sooner, instead of preventing it."</p>
               <p>"And now, what can I do to banish it? If I could only aid you, by any sacrifice of
                  my own feelings, in attaining the necessary result, I should indeed rejoice!"</p>
               <p>"What necessary result do you speak of, mother?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Louis, is it possible you do not understand me, or is it because you will
                  not, that you speak so?"</p>
               <p>"I believe I understand what you mean, but <emph>why</emph> you should mean it, is
                  not so clear. Why is it necessary, my dear mother, that I should banish this idea
                  (which I confess is so attractive, that it would be no easy task to do so) from my
                  mind?"</p>
               <p>"For your own peace and happiness, in the first place; and in the second, for that
                  of your unworthy mother."</p>
               <p>"Say for your own first; though God forbid it should be so. Why should my interest
                  in one of the worthiest of her sex, result in unhappiness to either?"</p>
               <p>"Your imagination deceives you, my son. Perhaps when you have calmly watched the
                  developments of her character, the task will become less difficult."</p>
               <p>"What change is this, mother? It was only yesterday you praised and admired her,
                  and now—mother! you would not—no, I wrong you by the thought—descend to other than
                  fair and open means to bring about your desires! But you did not mean to breathe a
                  suspicion against her. I was too hasty—forgive me for my rash zeal, I beg
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Much as it pains me to do so, Louis, and much as<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000117"/> it may grieve you to hear it, it is my duty to say,
                  that public condemnation of an attachment to one of this sect is not the chief
                  objection in my mind. It would weigh more with me to know that you had bestowed
                  your pure and generous affection on an object unworthy your high regard."</p>
               <p>"You surprise me beyond expression, mother, and yet what you say is a relief to my
                  mind, because I am now sure that <emph>you</emph> are the victim of a delusion,
                  and I only ask for time to convince you of your error."</p>
               <p>"Time! time for you to become more and more deeply involved in this unhappy
                  affair. Time for her to complete the design she has undertaken!"</p>
               <p>"Now, indeed, for the first time in my life, I must believe my mother to be
                  unjust! Who has poisoned your mind thus? for some one I am sure has been secretly
                  working upon your feelings. But beware, lest by such means you increase the cause
                  of your grief. Your son is but human, and injustice may drive me to the extreme
                  you most fear!"</p>
               <p>"Is it my son who speaks to me thus? Behold the fruits of this new influence
                  already! Can that be for good which divides the hearts of parent and child, and
                  sows dissension where all before was love and harmony?"</p>
               <p>"It shall not be so, mother. Did I not say that no grief should come to you
                  through my means? Hear now what I have to promise you before God, who witnesses
                  nesses my sincerity: I love the Quakers' daughter, and yet until your hand shall
                  place in mine that gift which I count the greatest that this world can have in
                  store for me, I will not seek to obtain it. And believe me when I add, that I am
                  happier thus bound to you than if bound by other and not more solemn vows to
                  her—wanting your approbation to complete my happiness! Does this satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>"It does, my dear, my noble boy, and God reward you for it! But I thought there
                  was something between the minister and this unfortunate girl. Did not you, too,
                  fancy so? or have you indeed too much reason to know that there is no such
                  obstacle in the way of a return of your affection?"</p>
               <p>"Mother, do you think I would deceive you thus? I have been as it were, in a
                  dream, and you aroused me to the reality. It was only when asked to relinquish
                  this thought, that I became aware how deeply it was fixed in my heart."</p>
               <p>"Thank heaven for this! for if you were ignorant of it until now, it can not be so
                  deeply implanted in your heart, as your words led me to fear. And time, I trust,
                  will soon heal this first wound, especially if it should convince you—"</p>
               <p>"Mother," he interrupted, with an expression of pain upon his handsome
                  countenance, "I have something to ask of you in return for the promise given. It
                  is that you will forbear to wound me by expressing<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000118"/> doubts unworthy both yourself and the woman whom I
                  admire and love. Let me be candid with you, you shall understand me now, at least.
                  I have not pledged myself to try to crush the new feelings that spring up in my
                  heart, for in doing so, I should promise to subdue all that is generous and manly,
                  and that I feel elevates me by its influence. But I am content to wait until
                  circumstances shall become more favorable to my wishes, and Edith's integrity
                  triumphs—as I am sure it will—over your sudden prejudice. And when you are
                  prepared to crown my happiness, by taking her to your heart, I shall owe you
                  another obligation, in addition to those you have been heaping upon me all my
                  life."</p>
               <p>"I accede to your request, my son. You shall hear no remarks from me, calculated
                  to give you pain; but there is one thing more. You will not, under this change of
                  circumstances, continue your visits there? Mr. Mildman can readily procure other,
                  and perhaps, more experienced counsel."</p>
               <p>"Ask no more of me, mother. I can not and will not consent to desert this dying
                  man. Have no fears for me. I am not so weak as to forget the duty I owe you, in
                  performing that I owe to humanity. Goodnight, dearest and best of mothers. I need
                  not say, remember your unworthy son in your secret prayers."</p>
               <p>"Good-night, dearest and best of sons, never will I stand in the way of your real
                  happiness, believe me!"</p>
               <p>After Mrs. Hermon retired to her chamber, Louis remained for some time lost in
                  reflection. So surprised was he at the sudden discovery of his feelings that it
                  was long before he could think coherently upon his future course and dreary
                  prospects, and the more deeply he did consider them the more formidable each
                  obstacle became, until like lovers in general, he thought himself of all men the
                  most miserable.</p>
               <p>It was not that he regretted the promise made his mother, for he felt that to be a
                  duty he owed her; nor would he be willing to involve her in the consequences of a
                  rash union with this proscribed people. Neither did the sudden prejudice which
                  seemed to have taken possession of her mind occasion him serious anxiety, for he
                  was too confident that this would give way before the steadfast virtue in which he
                  trusted, long ere the other obstacle would be overcome.</p>
               <p>But it was a source of bitter pain to him to feel that at the very time when the
                  friendless girl might most require an arm to defend her and a voice to speak in
                  her behalf, his arm and his voice must both refuse to aid her; and how could he
                  with honor, remain silent and inactive, beholding her he loved exposed to dangers,
                  perhaps to cruel persecutions?</p>
               <p>It was some relief to his generous nature that he could recall no sign on her part
                  of more than a grateful recognition of his kindness—no betrayal of a stronger
                  feeling—no conscious blush when her glance met his own—no timid shrinking from his
                  eye as if<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6366-00000119"/> there were aught within her
                  heart she would conceal therefrom. <emph>She</emph> he hoped, was saved the pain
                  he must suffer. And yet a vague disappointment mingled with his sense of relief.
                  It would be a consolation to know that at least she understood him and was not
                  ungrateful for his love. Then he remembered how carefully he must guard his
                  conduct to prevent his sentiments being discerned by her, and tried to feel glad
                  for her sake that his secret was untold.</p>
               <p>Poor Louis! how hard he struggled to resist the tempting visions of happiness that
                  floated through his brain. "No, no," he cried, "I must not yield to the charms of
                  imagination—I will not give myself up to its sweet delusions! No, my mother, I
                  will be true to my promise; yet is it not strange that one who has experienced
                  such deep affection as she cherished for my father, should so soon appear to
                  forget its strength? And to believe that because I was ignorant of it until now, I
                  shall forget it the sooner! Ah, <emph>she</emph> forgets how the insidious disease
                  becomes so firmly rooted ere its presence is developed, that it can seldom be
                  removed. Well, let her deceive herself so. She shall never know how much I suffer.
                  If the happiness of either is to be sacrificed, let it be mine, for Fate has
                  already spent its fury upon her; and be it my task now to guard her against
                  further pain and suffering!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon's feelings were of a different character from those which agitated her
                  son. But although his promise relieved her mind of its chief source of anxiety, it
                  distressed her to know that he still cherished the hope of being one day united to
                  the young Quakeress. Yet, feeling that he would do nothing rashly, she persuaded
                  herself that time would wear away all traces of his present fancy; and that after
                  awhile he would voluntarily abandon all thought of such a connection, even if he
                  did not become convinced of the unworthiness of her to whom he was attached.</p>
               <p>She wondered who the unknown friend could be from whom the letter came, and could
                  think of no one among her acquaintance who took such an extraordinary interest in
                  their affairs. Suddenly it dawned upon her that possibly it was the minister
                  himself; and that perhaps it was dictated less by disinterested kindness than by
                  the jealous fear of rivalry. It must be confessed that this conjecture did not add
                  to the good lady's satisfaction, for she began to feel some compunction for having
                  yielded too readily to suspicions of one in whose conduct she was obliged to
                  confess to herself she had never witnessed any thing in the least inconsistent
                  with maidenly dignity and propriety. Yet for all that the letter appeared to be
                  dictated by sincere motives; and there might very probably be those who knew
                  Edith's real character much better than she, and who detected under a winning
                  disguise the arts and practices of an accomplished deceiver.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>IT was a long time since Edith had seen the once gay and sprightly Alice; but amid
                  all the grief and sadness that overhung her home, she often cast an anxious
                  thought upon her friend, and cherished a deep and abiding interest in her
                  happiness. One dreary evening as she sat reflecting upon this very theme, the
                  light foot of Alice ascended the stairs, and ere Edith was aware of her presence,
                  her arms were thrown about her, and those blue eyes looking fondly up into her
                  own. But the first flash of delight at seeing her again was checked by a second
                  look at her once rosy and laughing face, for she was pale and wasted as if disease
                  had marked her for its own. Edith was so painfully surprised that for a moment she
                  forgot to speak a single word of welcome, but sat gazing upon the fair girl who
                  knelt before her, with a look of dismay.</p>
               <p>"What, dearest, not one word of pleasure at again beholding me? I thought thou
                  wouldst at least have greeted me with a smile of welcome!"</p>
               <p>"Alice, dear girl, I forgot myself. I am indeed rejoiced to see thee once more,
                  but," taking another look at her, she burst into tears and hid her face on the
                  shoulder of her friend.</p>
               <p>"Why, what aileth thee, Edith? No ill has befallen thee, I trust. Has aught
                  happened to thy father or to thee to distress thee thus? Speak, Edith, for thy
                  tears do much alarm me!"</p>
               <p>"Nothing has happened, but thou didst come so suddenly, and I believe I am grown
                  somewhat childish of late. Forgive me, and sit here close beside me—yes, lean upon
                  me, dear one, for thou lookest weary."</p>
               <p>"Edith, I do believe that thou hast grown to be the weakest of us too, and I must
                  tutor thee! Thou gavest me a sad reception, and that, too, when I came on a brave
                  errand!"</p>
               <p>"Think no more of it, darling, but come, tell me thy errand now, and thou shalt
                  not again complain of weakness."</p>
               <p>"Canst thou guess nothing? Wilt thou be so cruel as to force me to explain? Do I
                  not look like a gay and happy bride?"</p>
               <p>Edith only gazed upon her in silent consternation.</p>
               <p>"There, now! thou saidst I should have no cause to complain of thee again. And yet
                  thou only starest at me so when I came to bid thee to my bridal!"</p>
               <p>"Alice!"</p>
               <p>"And is that all? Hast thou no words of joy for me, and I am to be wedded
                  to-morrow? Is it only 'Alice!'"</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6366-00000121"/>
               <p>"Thou art jesting with me. Is this kind?"</p>
               <p>"Jesting! Edith, do I look like jesting?" She asked so solemnly that a shudder ran
                  over Edith's frame.</p>
               <p>"No," she continued, "I do not think thou hast reason to accuse me of that.
                  To-morrow is to be my bridal morn, and I am here to bid thee come!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Alice! art thou resolved then, and can nothing save thee? Surely thou wilt
                  not go before the sacred altar, and bestow thy hand where thou hast no heart to
                  give! Forgive me, my sister, my best and dearest friend, but I can not in silence
                  see thee make the sacrifice!"</p>
               <p>"Sacrifice! Yes, the victim is already bound to the horns of the altar. But what
                  am I saying? Thou hast disturbed me, Edith. I charge thee, speak not another word
                  against it. To-morrow I go, and nothing, no, nothing must prevent me."</p>
               <p>"But, Alice, ere thou goest, tell thy father all. Oh! tell him, I conjure thee,
                  and let him save thee from this cruel doom."</p>
               <p>"Tell <emph>him?</emph> Didst thou never read in the Holy Word how Abraham was
                  about to offer up his son, his only child?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, indeed I have, and God prevented him!"</p>
               <p>"But there is no poor lamb now to take my place! No; the child was sinless and
                  pure, and what am I? Edith, do I look as if there were blood here? Wear I the
                  aspect of a murderess?"</p>
               <p>Her eyes were so wild, and her words seemed so strange as she said this, at the
                  same time spreading out her transparent hands, and looking at them in such terror,
                  as if she almost expected to behold the guilty stain upon them, that Edith, in
                  affright, threw her arms around her, and began to utter soothing words, though
                  scarcely knowing what she said.</p>
               <p>"Do not fear. I am not distraught. But, Edith," she said, lowering her voice to a
                  whisper, "He is dead—dead—and I, who loved him more by far than I did my own poor
                  life, yes <emph>I</emph> am the murderess! But, ah me, how I frighten thee—do not
                  tremble so—he forgives me! I know he does indeed, for last night he came to my
                  bed-side, and gazed so tenderly upon me, and said, 'Alice, I forgive thee; it is
                  better to die than to live as thou livest, for thy sufferings are fearful. But do
                  not forget me, and when thou art a wedded bride, sometimes think of him who had
                  thy first affection.' And then he stooped until his lips touched my cheek. They
                  were cold—cold as marble. I have not been warm since, Edith, and yet their touch
                  left a burning spot, look here; and it burns and burns into my heart, and seems to
                  be drinking my life's blood! But do not hold me so! Thou thinkest I am crazed, but
                  I am not. I knew it was only a dream—but, oh! what a dream!"</p>
               <p>"Alice, thou art not well; thou must not be wedded on the morrow. Defer it a
                  little—do, dearest, for my<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6366-00000122"/> sake. Surely
                  he will not urge thee. Only wait a short time until thou art better. Thou must
                  not—indeed thou must not," she said earnestly, for she was so agitated, fearing
                  for her poor friend's reason, that she scarcely knew what to say.</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes, but I must. And thou shalt come to the church—say thou wilt. Every one
                  will be gay and happy, the bells will ring merrily, and all shall say I am a fair
                  bride. Yes, Edith, I shall be calm and composed when it is over; it will be better
                  for me, too. But I must have thee there—say thou will not refuse me this. I have
                  set my heart upon it, and thou must not disappoint me."</p>
               <p>"It is thy unalterable resolve, then?"</p>
               <p>"It is; and, my friend, believe me when I say, that it is for the best. Yes,
                  Edith, Edward is dead, and all I can do now, is to try to perform a wife's duty,
                  and to forget the past in laboring to make the future happy for him who is to be
                  my husband. Forget what I have said to thee so wildly. I have no friend but thee
                  to confide in, and I was selfish to distress thee with my folly. But promise me to
                  come to-morrow, for I shall have no bride's-maid but thyself."</p>
               <p>"Alice, I will do so if it is any joy to thee. But I must be where none will
                  notice me, for thy sake."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, dear one. I knew thou wouldst not refuse me; and thou must stand beside
                  the south pillar nearest the altar, where I shall look for thee when I come in,
                  and mind I see thee there!"</p>
               <p>"I will be there, darling, and will pray God to give thee happiness."</p>
               <p>"Nay, that is more than my portion. Yet pray for me, I need the petitions of some
                  such saint-like souls. But ere I go, I have a word for thee. Never love, guard thy
                  heart and give its wealth to none. These may be the only words of truth and wisdom
                  thou ever hadst from the lips of thy Alice, and mark them. Keep thy heart within
                  thine own bosom, and never let it thence, or thou wilt be wretched. And now,
                  farewell, but stay—if thou needest a friend, I know of one who is pledged to serve
                  thee; it is my father, and he would have come here long ago, but he—that is, Mr.
                  Mildman—thought it needless."</p>
               <p>"I know, Alice, and we thank him. And dost thou remember the evening when we two
                  mourned over their cruelty, and prayed that God would turn their hearts to
                  mercy?"</p>
               <p>"I do. I have thought of it often; and it is my chief consolation to know that my
                  father is changed in this respect. Oh! I have not lived all in vain, after
                  all!"</p>
               <p>"And let it show thee, dear girl, how great His mercy is toward those who call
                  upon Him. Oh! my friend, believe me none ever came to him sorrowing but went on
                  their way strengthened, if not rejoicing!"</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6366-00000123"/>
               <p>"I know it—I believe it, and trust the time will come when I shall experience it;
                  but the cloud still hangs over me. To-morrow, when this sacrifice is made, it may
                  be lifted. Farewell to thee, and remember to stand beside the south pillar. But
                  stop once more. Hast thou no bridal-gift for thy Alice? no offering to remind me
                  of thy love, on the morrow?"</p>
               <p>Edith bethought her a moment, and then going to the window upon which there was a
                  rose-tree just coming into bloom, she laid her hand upon a snowy bud that seemed
                  just ready to expand into full beauty, but her first touch shook its snowy petals
                  in a shower upon the flower.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," cried Alice, "it is a token of my own early blighted youth. Nay,
                  seek no other, the emblem suiteth me not;" but Edith insisted, and gathering the
                  only others that remained, she placed them with a smile in her friend's hand.</p>
               <p>"Look, Alice, they are bound together in one stem, emblematic of our affection.
                  The sun of prosperity shall expand them into perfect bloom."</p>
               <p>"They shall deck my bosom on the morrow, and I will wear thy affection there long
                  after its frail emblem is faded."</p>
               <p>In the morning, Lisbet prepared for the duties of the toilet with a pride
                  exceeding that of any other waiting-woman in the colonies. Alice sat passive
                  beneath neath her hands, paying no heed to the girl's attempts to arouse her
                  attention or amuse her during the operation.</p>
               <p>"There's ne'er a lady in Boston town but is clear burned up with envy of my dear
                  mistress this bright morning; and did any body ever see a beautifuller day for a
                  weddin'! The sun shines as clear and bright as if he'd been and washed his face
                  for the 'casion; and there's a white cloud layin' under him, just like a towel
                  that he'd wiped it on and then throwed down at his feet. Of course he's ordered
                  the wind to carry it out o' sight, which it'll do shortly. (There's a lovely
                  curl!)</p>
               <p>"Lack-a-day! Who'd a thought when I came here that the time was so near when she
                  which was then a careless, blithesome child was to grow into a woman and git
                  married! It appears like only yisterday, and here I stand a deckin' that child as
                  was then, in her bride's clothin'. (There never was a gown set so splendid as
                  that!) 'Marriage is a lottery,' folks says, only the difference is, that one's
                  against the law and tother ain't. Howsever, it ain't often that a prize is drew on
                  both sides as in the present instant. Such a bridegroom Venus herself might be
                  proud of—so tall and beautiful, and what a mind! That's what I look at! He has the
                  spirit of a saint—he has; and I'll be bound he'll never cross <emph>his</emph>
                  wife—not he! Just to behold these flowers that the governor hisself has sent.<pb
                     n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6366-00000124"/> There's rosebuds that looks as plump as
                  Deacon Grigson after a hearty dinner; and sich splendid 'amelias—ah! these is the
                  brides' own flowers. How that does look in your hair! and this one's to go on the
                  other side—there, there couldn't be any thing handsomer. But, mercy! Miss
                  Alice—you ain't a goin' to spoil it all by puttin' them ugly little withered
                  things in your bosom, and here's such magnificent ones layin' all about! Now,
                  please—but, gracious me, there's the carriage come!" and Mr. Harding coming to the
                  door at the moment, and calling, "Alice, my love, art thou ready?" in a tremulous
                  voice. Lisbet had only time to throw her lady's cloak around her and don her own
                  wrapping, muttering to herself as she did so, "To think she would go and spoil it
                  all with those ugly little roses! Well, if Mr. Mildman don't have his hands full,
                  I'm mistaken!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding cast a look of pride upon his lovely child, and folding her tenderly
                  to his bosom, whispered, "My own little darling, always!" then hurrying her to the
                  carriage, they were seen walking together up the church aisle to the altar.</p>
               <p>As they passed on, Alice cast a hurried glance toward the south pillar, and a half
                  smile of pleasure lighted up her face as she placed her hand upon the token in her
                  bosom, but the next instant the smile was arrested, a deadly pallor overspread her
                  countenance, and a wild gaze of terror shot from her eyes. Mr. Mildman took his
                  place by her side, and her father supported her on the other hand. The officiating
                  minister made what he considered an appropriate address—somewhat lengthy, and
                  entering, perhaps, more minutely than in our day would be deemed necessary—upon
                  the duties of the marriage relation; after which he asked the usual question—"If
                  any one knew cause," etc. At this there were two persons present who moved
                  involuntarily—one was Edith, who clasped her hands tightly over her bosom, and the
                  other a youth, apparently a stranger, who started forward a pace or two, and then,
                  as if recollecting himself, resumed his former position. When they were directed
                  to join their right hands, Mr. Mildman extended his to receive his bride's, but
                  Alice made no movement; her eyes remained wildly fixed upon space. Mr. Mildman
                  noticed her peculiar manner with much alarm, and tried by whispers to arouse her,
                  but in vain. It was not, however, until he had taken the marriage vow, and
                  promised to protect and cherish the fair young girl at his side, from that time
                  forward, and the same had been demanded of the bride, that the officiating
                  minister, fixing his eyes upon Alice, became aware of her unnatural expression. At
                  the same moment, astonished at the pause, Mr. Harding, who had been until now
                  absorbed by his own emotions, looked up, and was struck with consternation at her
                  appearance. He threw his arms about her, and addressed her by every<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000125"/> endearing epithet—"My child, Alice, art thou ill?
                  Speak to thy father? What is it aileth thee, my own?" But her eyes moved not from
                  the spot upon which they had at first become fixed, and the color of life did not
                  return.</p>
               <p>"She is ill," exclaimed the minister. "The ceremony can not proceed at present.
                  She had better be removed."</p>
               <p>They attempted to lead her away, but at this she resisted, saying in a clear,
                  articulate whisper—"Look, look, he has come to reproach me! See, he beckons me—I
                  must away. I am false, he reproaches me. Hark! they are my own words he
                  utters—"Not even my father's command shall compel me to an union with
                  another!"</p>
               <p>"This is no fit place for her," said Mr. Mildman—"Alice," he whispered—"come
                  Alice, let us go!"</p>
               <p>"Not with thee! No, I am not thy bride, but his. I am wedded, but it is with the
                  dead. He calls me to him now, and I must away. The grave shall witness our
                  bridal."</p>
               <p>"My child, my child, what meanest thou? Alas, her mind wanders"—cried the
                  distressed father—"come home with me, dearest, and fear no one."</p>
               <p>"No, not with thee, thou wilt not let me go with him—thou didst never love him.
                  Where is Edith—she was his only friend—my only true adviser. This is a false and
                  cruel world, and we two will go." So saying, she broke from her father and lover,
                  who sought to restrain her, and making her way to Edith's side she seized her hand
                  and drew her toward the door. Mr. Mildman followed, and whispered to the trembling
                  girl—"Go with her for God's sake, and get her from this crowd as speedily as may
                  be!"</p>
               <p>Edith passed her arm around her and led her gently toward the entrance, but just
                  as they were about to leave the house Alice grasped her arm so tightly that she
                  could scarcely refrain from crying out with pain. Edith followed the direction of
                  her gaze, and what was her surprise at beholding her former lover, Edward Stanley,
                  endeavoring to make his way through the crowd that thronged the entrance. In a
                  moment the strange excitement of her friend was explained. "Alice," she whispered,
                  "I see him too—it is Edward. Thou hast made a strange mistake, for this is his
                  living and bodily shape. He is not dead, for there he stands before our eyes."</p>
               <p>The eyes of Alice sought her face with a glance half of doubt and half entreaty.
                  "They have all deceived me but thee"—her overstrained strength yielded, and she
                  fell back fainting into her father's arms.</p>
               <p>They lifted her, insensible, into the carriage, and Edith, who could not release
                  herself from her grasp, was obliged to follow, which Mr. Harding seeing, he
                  desired her to go with his daughter. She complied, and they were quickly at his
                  own home.</p>
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6366-00000126"/>
               <p>When Edward Stanley saw Alice fall he pressed nearer and regarded her for a moment
                  in silent distress. He then waited until Mr. Mildman came forward to assist in
                  getting her into the carriage, when he approached him and said in a voice audible
                  only to him—"You shall account for this!" The minister, however, seemed to pay him
                  no attention, but quietly made his way out of the crowd and disappeared.</p>
               <p>Alice was soon divested of her bridal robes and put to bed; and although many
                  restoratives were resorted to, it was long before any of them seemed to produce an
                  effect. Mr. Harding paced the apartment in an agony of alarm, and Lisbet threw
                  herself upon her knees by the bedside, wringing her hands and uttering various
                  expressions of self-reproach.</p>
               <p>Occasionally Mr. Harding approached the bed and called upon his daughter in tones
                  expressive of the deepest tenderness to speak to him, if only a word, and tell him
                  what had disturbed her so strangely.</p>
               <p>Edith was the only one who retained her presence of mind sufficiently to follow
                  the directions of the physician, which she did most assiduously.</p>
               <p>"She has been unhappy—I know it. I have not guarded her as I ought. I blindly
                  hastened this day, thinking it would bring back her health and gladness.
                  Doctor—doctor—will she—oh, she <emph>must</emph> recover from this, and then I
                  will know every thing from her own lips, for she has been hiding something from
                  her old father—my poor lamb!"</p>
               <p>"Alack, alack! it is my fault," chimed in Lisbet—"but I only did as I was bid. My
                  dear sweet mistress, only say that you forgive me!"</p>
               <p>"What does the girl mean?" cried the father. "Rise this instant and explain this,
                  if thou canst!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir—I can not, I dare not. Woe is me to deceive so sweet a lady!"</p>
               <p>"It were best this room were quiet, sir. If you will have the goodness to send
                  that girl away and to leave your daughter to this kind maiden and myself, it will
                  be better for her. I will bring you word of the slightest perceptible
                  improvement."</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding mastered his feelings, and took his station outside the chamber-door,
                  where he strained every nerve to catch the first sound of his daughter's
                  voice.</p>
               <p>At length his stout heart bounded, as the door was gently opened and the doctor
                  with his hand raised to command silence, appeared, and giving him a nod of
                  encouragement, once more closed the door upon him.</p>
               <p>He fell upon his knees on the threshold, and raised his streaming eyes in
                  gratitude to heaven, while his stout frame quivered with suppressed emotion.</p>
               <p>Alice opened her eyes and gazed around in wonder, then fixed them upon Edith's
                  face, who bent over her with a cheerful smile and kissed her forehead.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6366-00000127"/>
               <p>"Edith; thou here? But what does it all mean? Was it a dream? ah, no, it could not
                  be," and she pressed her hand to her forehead and began to look bewildered
                  again.</p>
               <p>"It is all well, dearest, and just as thou couldst wish."</p>
               <p>"And where was I a moment ago, where is my father and—and—oh, Edith," and another
                  look of alarm came into her face, "am I—tell me—was I not—"</p>
               <p>"Thou art here safe in thy own chamber, Alice, and art Alice Harding still, so do
                  not trouble thyself further now, I beg thee."</p>
               <p>"Then I am not wedded," she cried, with a look of joy, but also of
                  apprehension.</p>
               <p>"No, thank God, thou art not!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, thank God, indeed, for that; but, Edith, there was something more. I saw
                  a fearful vision," and a shudder ran over her frame.</p>
               <p>"And I saw a vision too, but not a fearful one," answered Edith, smiling.</p>
               <p>"What was it, Edith?—but thou dost not understand me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I do. It was a vision of flesh and blood. I saw him, and what is more,
                  I touched him; he was real and not a spirit, as thou didst fancy."</p>
               <p>"Edith, oh tell me who it was thou saw. In pity, tell me truly, for yet I fear
                  thou understandest me not!"</p>
               <p>"It was Edward Stanley, as surely as thou see'st me now. How couldst thou be so
                  mistaken, Alice, in regard to him?"</p>
               <p>"Now, indeed, I thank God that I have not his blood upon me! Edith, the dark cloud
                  is leaving me, and I see a ray of brightness." She gave vent to her feelings in
                  tears, which the physician seeing, he left her, saying she would do very well now
                  and required his presence no longer. He assured Mr. Harding of this as he passed
                  him at the door, telling him that her strange attack was caused by extreme nervous
                  excitement, and warning him that every thing of an agitating nature must be
                  carefully avoided.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Harding could entirely control his feelings, he visited his daughter's
                  chamber, and smilingly expressed his pleasure at seeing her so far recovered. And
                  now, for the first time, he noticed that the two girls whom he had supposed
                  strangers to each other, appeared to be on terms of friendly intimacy, and that
                  Alice's selection of Edith from among the crowd was not the result of accident.
                  Doubtless his countenance betrayed what was passing in his mind, for Alice said,
                  "My father, already thou knowest this dear maiden, and thou shalt soon hear how
                  she became my friend, and why I have such cause to prize her friendship. I have
                  much to tell thee, for—yes, Edith, I have done forever with concealments now."</p>
               <p>"Say no more at present, for thy own health's sake.<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000128"/> I must leave thee now," and seeing her friend's
                  look of disappointment, she added, "I have been absent from my father a long
                  time."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, go then. I was selfish to keep thee from him, but to-morrow come again.
                  I shall need thy presence to sustain me."</p>
               <p>"Maiden," said Mr. Harding, "I know not how to thank thee for thy kindness. But
                  for thy calmness and wisdom it would have fared but sadly with my poor child. I
                  would thou couldst tarry with her, but we must not ask it at present."</p>
               <p>"Farewell, dear Edith," said Alice, and drawing her closer, she whispered, "thou
                  hast been more than bride's-maid to me to-day, and see, here is thy little token.
                  I have kept it through all."</p>
               <p>Alice was now so eager to tell her father every thing, that she could scarcely
                  wait with patience for the day to go by. On his part he was thoroughly mystified.
                  Pained as he was at the discovery that she did not really love Mr. Mildman, he was
                  resolved that nothing should oppose her wishes, but that she should be left
                  entirely at liberty to follow her own inclinations. Alice herself, quite ignorant
                  of the unfair means her lover had employed to make her his own, could not
                  sufficiently condemn herself for causing him such pain and mortification. But she
                  no longer persisted in the error of resolving to become his wife, in order to
                  atone for the injury she imagined she had done him. She saw that her mistake lay
                  further back than that, and by so doing she should only be involving them both in
                  a deeper error, and one beyond repair.</p>
               <p>While engaged in these reflections, her father once more entered to inform her
                  that the minister desired to speak with her, and marking the pallor that
                  overspread her face, he added, "I told him, Alice, that thou must be spared all
                  excitement to-day, and he bade me say to thee, that what he had to impart could
                  only give thee joy, and relieve thy mind of much anxiety. Nevertheless, it shall
                  be as thou pleasest. Be influenced in this, as in more important matters, by thy
                  own wishes, and remember, Alice, there is nothing thou canst ask of me, which
                  shall not be joyfully granted thee."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my father, how I have wronged thee! I ill deserve this kindness from thy
                  hand. But let him come. I should do him this justice, for I fear I have greatly
                  injured him."</p>
               <p>In a few moments Mr. Mildman entered the room. His face was very pale and haggard,
                  and Alice was alarmed at seeing him look so ill. For a short time neither spoke,
                  and then Alice, extending toward him her trembling hand, said, in a voice that was
                  scarcely audible, "Canst thou, oh canst thou indeed, forgive me?"</p>
               <p>"Alice," he replied, in a tone that sounded sepulchral<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000129"/> chral, and without touching the hand she held
                  toward him. "It is I who am come to ask thy forgiveness, and to resign the hope so
                  long and ardently cherished, of one day making thee my own!"</p>
               <p>The sorrow and self-reproach that Alice felt could not prevent her heart bounding
                  with joy at this declaration.</p>
               <p>"Yes, thou whom I thought this day to call my bride, I come hither to renounce
                  that precious claim, and oh, Alice, not only that, but to sink myself forever in
                  thy esteem; to be to thee worse than a stranger, for thou wilt henceforth remember
                  me only to scorn me and to despise. I shall be below thy pity, who so lately
                  thought to find more than earthly happiness in thy love!"</p>
               <p>"Forbear, I beseech you, Mr. Mildman. It is I who have crossed your path for evil.
                  Woe is me, that the devices of a silly girl should work such misery!"</p>
               <p>"Do not weep, Alice, nor reproach thyself. Thou hast been but the innocent
                  butterfly that sported through thy summer hour in the sunshine, and I was the
                  treacherous and cruel enemy that entangled thee in its snare. Thou knowest not the
                  means I used to attain my object, but thou shalt know, thou and thy trusting
                  father too, and he also who with thee I have so deeply injured—ye shall all hear
                  my story. It is a bitter atonement I must make for the sins into which my evil
                  passions led me. I will acknowledge all; and when my tale is told I will go hence
                  to labor in a new and arduous field, and strive to make the toils and self-denial
                  of the future atone for the falsehood of the past.</p>
               <p>"Alice, I would not have disturbed thee to-day, but I knew that what I had to tell
                  thee would give thee joy. Yes, though it wrings my heart so terribly, I know it
                  thrills thine with grateful happiness! Fear not I shall ever darken thy pathway
                  more, and I thank God, dear girl, that His hand intervened to-day to prevent our
                  unhallowed union! I thank Him that He interposed to save thee from such misery,
                  and me from so great a sin. And now it is my chief wish to secure thy happiness,
                  and if I can so far atone for my faults as to succeed therein, it shall be the
                  dearest solace of my remaining days. To-morrow thou shalt hear my story. We shall
                  meet then, when I will bid thee farewell forever!"</p>
               <p>"I, too, have some errors to confess. I am sorely to blame, but I thought to atone
                  for it all by a life of devotion, if not of affection."</p>
               <p>"I knew thou wouldst make such a sacrifice, and I selfishly thought to exact it of
                  thee. But I must not say too much now lest I weary thee. Yet Alice, do not
                  reproach thyself for aught thou mayst deem injurious to me. What do I not owe to
                  thee! Thou taughtst me the path of duty in which God's servant should walk. I was
                  vain and puffed up with selfish<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6366-00000130"/> pride.
                  Man's praises rang in my ears, and I loved the voice of adulation. Through my love
                  to thee I have learned humility. Yes, I have repented in tears and mourning. Oh,
                  Alice, thou hast been my Guardian Angel, and must I lose thee forever?"</p>
               <p>Alice answered not except by tears and sobs; but her tears were such as relieve
                  the o'erburdened heart, and while she wept, prayers of joy and gratitude mingled
                  with her sorrow.</p>
               <p>"When I part from thee, I part from all that makes the sunshine of this life to
                  me. I go to labor through the long night of sorrow and repentance, and to fix my
                  only hope of happiness upon the bright eternal morning. Yet it would glad my
                  solitude to think that sometimes in thy joy thou cast'st a thought of pity and
                  forgiveness on one who deserves only scorn and detestation. Oh, Alice, think not
                  always of me thus; but let it soften thy condemnation to know how deep my love has
                  been to thee, and how the hope of winning the gift of thy affection had almost
                  lost me heaven!"</p>
               <p>When Alice looked up, he was gone; and the now humbled girl sank upon her knees
                  and poured out the first heart-felt prayer she had for a long time been able to
                  utter. Submissive as a little child she acknowledged her errors, and sought that
                  peace and pardon which none ever seek in vain. "Ah," she thought— "I see now why I
                  had not a blessing on my prayers before. It was because I persisted in wrong. It
                  was because I was obstinately bent upon a course which I knew had not heaven's
                  approval!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <p>ON the following morning a little company had assembled in Mr. Harding's study.
                  Alice, pale from the excitement of the previous day, but with the old light
                  rekindled in her eyes, that had for a long time been hidden, nestled close to her
                  father's side, and he, looking as if some long missing treasure were restored to
                  him. Edith's chair stood close by that of her friend, and they exchanged frequent
                  glances of affectionate kindness and sympathy. Mr. Harding had already heard the
                  history of their acquaintance from his daughter's lips, and formed a secret
                  resolve that, come what would, so long as he had power to protect her, the
                  Quaker's daughter should never want a friend.</p>
               <p>In a little while, he who was to have been the bridegroom of yesterday made his
                  appearance, and all were startled by the change a few hours had made in him. But
                  he came not alone. Alice did not dare to raise her eyes, for she knew that his
                  companion was Edward Stanley. Her father received him with a quiet dignity of
                  manner, though there was some embarrassment on the part of each. He did not
                  attempt to speak to Alice, but took his seat in another part of the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mildman glanced around, and then remarked with an effort, "There is another
                  person who should be present: it is Lisbet." Mr. Harding and Alice both looked up
                  astonished, and he added, "it is no more than justice."</p>
               <p>"Nay," answered Mr. Harding, "methinks that is unnecessary. She is an unfit
                  recipient of such matters."</p>
               <p>"She has looked more deeply into the secrets of some present than thou knowest of,
                  my friend; for I will call thee so, once more. I beg that she may be
                  summoned."</p>
               <p>Lisbet, who had either been sick or feigning sickness since the previous morning,
                  was, with some difficulty, prevailed upon to make her appearance. At length she
                  stole into the room, with her apron to her eyes, and dropped into the seat nearest
                  the door.</p>
               <p>"You all know," began Mr. Mildman, with a painful effort, "that within a few
                  months a change has come over this then happy family. In me you behold the cause
                  of this change, and it now becomes my duty to endeavor to repair the injury.</p>
               <p>"Since that fair girl sprung from the child into the maiden, I have marked her as
                  my own. I set her apart from others, and said, 'this flower shall be mine, no
                  other hand shall cull the lovely blossom.' Yet think not it was affection that
                  first prompted me to the conclusion, for avarice and ambition were the motives by
                  which I was actuated. Accordingly, I made myself<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000132"/> self a spy upon her every movement, I watched her
                  with a jealous eye, and many a gay and youthful rival was banished her presence
                  through my influence. But the time came when her heart was won by a noble-minded
                  youth, well worthy her pure affection. I saw it, and resolved to thwart their
                  mutual love. To aid me in this, I placed a spy about her, and thus wrought my
                  secret purpose. God forgive me for leading astray an ignorant though zealous soul,
                  who came to me for counsel. Through my means, Alice was persuaded to conceal from
                  her father the state of her affections, and to resist the honorable entreaties of
                  him who loved her, to reveal their attachment to her natural protector. Meanwhile
                  I sought to turn the father's mind against the youth, and finally succeeded. His
                  once warm and hearty welcome was turned into a forbidding frown. Doubt and
                  distrust were sown between them, and at length this youth, toward whom I was
                  professing the warmest friendship, was driven by my acts to leave this
                  neighborhood; and no sooner was he gone, than I began to devise a plan by which I
                  might entangle the maiden in my toils, and at last claim her as my own.</p>
               <p>"At this time an opportunity offered, favorable to my purpose. An accident, with
                  which you are already acquainted, brought Alice into contact with a member of the
                  much persecuted sect called Quakers, and awoke in her kind and grateful heart a
                  lively interest in them."</p>
               <p>"Let me say a word, now," interrupted Alice, "for here I am most deeply culpable.
                  I thought to use the influence I knew I possessed on you to effect my own
                  purposes. And had I then yielded to Edith's counsels all this unhappiness might
                  have been avoided. But I was willfully blind, and it was only just I should suffer
                  the penalty, though I would none other were involved in the misery my conduct has
                  caused."</p>
               <p>"Hush, Alice—thy conduct child! Thou little knowest what a small share thou had'st
                  therein, how thou wast hedged in by me, and how thy actions were controlled by the
                  secret influences I employed."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my sweet mistress," now cried Lisbet, coming forward, and throwing herself at
                  Alice's feet, "you will never forgive me, I know, for playing the spy upon you as
                  I have done!"</p>
               <p>"Thou, Lisbet!" cried Alice and her father, in the same breath of
                  astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed I did, and I don't wonder you're surprised to hear it, for I'm aware
                  that nobody would a suspected <emph>me</emph> of sich like conduct toward my
                  benefactions! Indeed, and indeed, dear master and mistress, I hain't had a night
                  of quiet rest, but has been troubled with night-mare and awful dreams, ever since
                  I carried that letter to the wrong individual that was give me to take to Mr.
                  Stanley!"</p>
               <p>"What does she mean? What letter, girl? Speak the truth, or on my life—" but Mr.
                  Harding checked<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6366-00000133"/> his wrath which had
                  been rising for some time, and set his teeth hard as Lisbet went on.</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, it was one Miss Alice give me the night before she was took so sudden,
                  and nobody but Mr. Mildman and me knew what ailed her. But, mercy alive, what am I
                  a saying, dear, dear," (in fact Lisbet began to fear that should she remain silent
                  and leave the minister to tell all the story, she should gain no credit for her
                  part of the confession, but on the contrary might not only lose her excellent
                  place, but also the reputation she so highly valued, of exemplary piety.)</p>
               <p>"Alice, with thy consent I will explain her meaning. It was a note which Alice
                  wrote to Edward in her excess of sorrow at his expected departure. It was intended
                  to recall him, and she further purposed, even at that late day, to try to remedy
                  her fault by confessing every thing to her father. This, however, did not suit
                  with my opposing plans; and as to the girl, she had my orders to intercept all
                  such communications. Restrain thine anger, young man, thou spendest on it one
                  whose actions have injured himself far more than thee!"</p>
               <p>"Alice," said Mr. Harding, in a tone indicating the deepest sorrow, "wherefore was
                  all this hidden from thy father? Have I been so harsh and stern a parent to thee
                  that my severity merited this usage?"</p>
               <p>She threw herself weeping upon her father's neck.</p>
               <p>"Do not blame her, that too was my work. Through this girl, I filled her mind with
                  doubts and suspicions even of thee, for I feared that her candor would defeat my
                  deep designs. But let me be brief, for this scene grows too painful for my
                  endurance, and the worst is yet untold."</p>
               <p>"Nay, thou hast told enough," cried Alice. "Oh, father, surely he has made amends;
                  bid him say no more!"</p>
               <p>"Thy kindness shall not spare me! When all these obstacles were removed from my
                  path, I obtained this fair girl's consent to our betrothal. I knew she could not
                  love me, but let me do myself the justice to say that the passions which first
                  moved me had given place to the deeper one of devoted affection. I knew she loved
                  another, and witnessed her efforts to banish his image from her heart, and I also
                  knew she struggled vainly. It was interwoven with the very chords of life, and I
                  pondered long for a plan by which to sunder them. At last a cruel device took
                  possession of my mind; I told her Edward was no more!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Mildman paused, and a shudder ran over his audience. "Yes, I told her he was
                  dead! How it has wrought upon the poor girl's mind, you have seen in the change
                  which has come over her. I saw it, and alarmed at the fearful effect, I hastened
                  our intended marriage, hoping that wedded devotion would atone for all the past,
                  and trusting in the power of such deep<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6366-00000134"/>
                  love as I felt toward her to once more make bright the pathway I had shaded. But
                  it pleased God to defeat my purposes, and from my very soul I thank him!</p>
               <p>"The maiden, already well-nigh driven to distraction, saw thee, Edward, among the
                  crowd assembled to witness our bridal, and believing thee dead already, her
                  bewildered senses quite deserted her, and she mistook thy living and breathing
                  form for a messenger from the grave.</p>
               <p>"The rest is known to you. For me, I have little more to do here, and soon I go
                  where no eye that has ever looked upon me shall behold me again.</p>
               <p>"Lisbet, come hither. My poor girl, I fear the injury I have done thee is beyond
                  repair. Thou camest to me for ghostly counsel, and hast learned other lessons of a
                  dark, and perhaps a fatal character!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir," sobbed Lisbet, "don't talk so, don't, for the love of Heaven! If it
                  hadn't been for you, sir, I should a been the worst and most unmanageables girl in
                  all Boston, instead of being considered a tolerable sincere Christian—leastways as
                  much so as this fallen nature is capable of, under some circumstances. But I've
                  been wicked, and was too easy led away to deceive my own dear lady, though, as you
                  know, sir, it was hoping to be the means, through affliction, of fetching her into
                  the fold. Indeed I've learnt a lesson, and if earthly natures is so gracious as to
                  forgive me—which they'll surely do, followin' the example set by them as is above
                  the best of us—why, I'll never hold—my head—so—so high above—my
                  neigh—neighbors—again, sir, in—in—dee—deed—s—sir!"</p>
               <p>"Thou hast yet much to learn of true humility, Lisbet, and God grant that this
                  prove a lesson and not a snare to thee! I have said all that concerns thee to
                  hear."</p>
               <p>But Lisbet did not go, and Mr. Harding casting an angry glance toward her, added,
                  "dost thou hear, wench?" upon which her sobs redoubled, and with an anxious look
                  at Alice, she remarked, "that her mistress looked so bad that she thought she
                  might want her to stay and assist her." To which observation she received no
                  reply, and slowly turning to leave the room, she again remarked, with some
                  asperity in her tone, that she "hoped her benefactions would remember that what
                  she had done was out of pure Christian zeal for her mistress, and according to the
                  advice of her superiors."</p>
               <p>The minister continued, now addressing himself to the Quaker's daughter, "Maiden,
                  thou hast this day heard a tale calculated to shock a mind less grieved by
                  utterance of falsehood than thine own. There are some of thy people who deem they
                  owe me a debt of gratitude for my efforts in their behalf. It is due to them to
                  say that although at first my motives were not pure, yet since I have witnessed
                  the purity of their private life and the Christian patience with which they<pb
                     n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6366-00000135"/> submit to outrage and injustice,
                  fearing naught in the performance of what they regard their duty, and making truth
                  their guide—what was once bitter enmity in my mind against them, is changed into
                  sincere pity and respect. Their errors I do deeply deplore, and while I would
                  guard others against falling into the same, I would point them to many
                  characteristics worthy their imitation. It is enough to say of thee, that I have
                  striven to separate thy fair friend from thy influence, because I felt that it was
                  such as must defeat my own designs. In thy father's lot and thine own, I shall
                  ever feel a deep interest. Thou hast friends in this household, and I can desire
                  for thee no more efficient protection.</p>
               <p>"But there is one more act of justice I would see done," and he turned toward
                  Alice, whose face was still hidden in her father's bosom, and then to Edward, to
                  whom Mr. Harding now extended his hand.</p>
               <p>"Spare yourself further interference, sir, I will speak for myself here!" said the
                  young man, in a scornful tone, as he advanced and clasped once more the hand of
                  his father's friend.</p>
               <p>"It is enough," said Mr. Mildman, as if he would be spared the scene further, "my
                  labors here are ended. I go to reclaim the souls that lie in the darkness of
                  ignorance and midnight superstition. Into the wigwam of the Indian will I bear the
                  fruits of knowledge gained in the bitterness of self-humiliation; and God permit
                  that my sins may be atoned for by zealous and unceasing labors for the good of my
                  brethren! I would leave these scenes in peace with all men, and for the injury I
                  have done them ask their kind forgiveness, though knowing that it is far more than
                  I merit. Let my humiliation this day bespeak my penitence, and he who was never
                  God's servant so truly as now, dares to pray that upon each one of you may rest
                  his blessing."</p>
               <p>"Forgive him, father," whispered Alice, in a tone of entreaty, and Mr. Harding
                  answered,</p>
               <p>"God has been good to me, and in token of gratitude to him I can, I do. But had
                  thy treacherous designs succeeded, methinks thou had forfeited all forgiveness,
                  either of earth or heaven. But I tread not on a fallen enemy. Go thy ways in
                  peace, and may He permit thee to find the consolation thou art seeking!"</p>
               <p>It is always easy to pardon an unsuccessful rival, and Edward bestowed upon the
                  minister such forgiveness as in his newly dawning happiness he could well afford
                  to one who had his hearty contempt. Mr. Mildman felt that this was so, and turned
                  from him with a sigh of pain.</p>
               <p>"It is what I merit. Alice, I have a trust to commit to thee. The wrong that I
                  have done that ignorant girl weighs upon me heavily, and I must leave it to thee
                  to restore her faith in all that is pure and holy. Watch over her as one whose
                  soul is in danger, and, for the sake of my peace, strive to reclaim her."</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6366-00000136"/>
               <p>Alice did not speak, but to the great annoyance of Edward, who looked as if he
                  thought the touch pollution, extended her hand to the minister. He took it in both
                  his own, and, almost overpowered by his emotions, he murmured—"Farewell! farewell
                  to thee, and to the brightness of this life forever!"</p>
               <p>He was gone, and they never saw him again. But years after they heard of a
                  white-haired holy man who dwelt amid the prairies, and pointed many a forest child
                  the way that leads to heaven.</p>

               <p>EDITH made her escape so quietly that no one knew the moment of her disappearance,
                  and she returned to her own sad home without one selfish thought to cloud the joy
                  she felt in the happiness of her own dear Alice. Scarcely had she reached her
                  father's bed-side when Mr. Harding was beside her.</p>
               <p>"I come," he said, "to perform a willing duty, friend, we have met before—dost

               <p>"I remember thee as one who interceded in behalf of myself and my child in an hour
                  of danger and sore trial, and I thank thee!"</p>
               <p>"Thou art too generous. Think not I am here to remind thee of a debt so trifling;
                  but to ask thy forgiveness for an act which I now blush to acknowledge."</p>
               <p>"I am ignorant of what thou speakest, and recall no act of thine which calls for
                  my forgiveness."</p>

                  of."</p>
               <p>"Friend, my memory is indeed at fault here, and I must ask thee to excuse it in
                  one whose mind has been engrossed by cares and anxieties."</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6366-00000137"/>
               <p>"Well, well, I could never have believed it! and am the more deeply ashamed
                  because thy generosity has buried it in oblivion. It was I who, one day
                  encountering thee in thy quiet walks, assailed thee with a rudeness for which I
                  desire to make amends."</p>
               <p>"Say no more. Enough that it was forgotten. By this thou mayst be sure I cherished
                  no malice."</p>
               <p>"It is a proof of the nobleness of thy mind! Would I had that within
                     <emph>me</emph> which would enable me so freely to forgive injuries. Friend,
                  thou art ill and feeble, how fares it with thee? Maiden, with thy consent, I will
                  speak with thy father alone. Thou need'st not fear now to trust him with me
                  thus."</p>
               <p>John Morrison watched her retreating form until she disappeared through the
                  doorway, when he heaved a deep sigh. "The time that remains to me is short, and
                  but for that one anxious thought I should go on my way hence rejoicing!"</p>
               <p>"Old man! let not this disturb thy departing moments. I owe thy daughter a debt
                  which I can never repay—it is not only the life, but the happiness of my own and
                  only child. Thou knew'st it not? Nor did I, believe me, until to-day, or I should
                  have shown my sense of the obligation sooner. Yes, my Alice declares that but for
                  her she would long ago have ceased to struggle with what she imagined was her
                  fate. Brother, our children are most dear to each other. Alice loves Edith with a
                  sister's love, and shall share with her a father's protection. Her welfare and
                  happiness shall be dear to us as our own; for we have marked her modest worth and
                  noble virtues, and there are few who would not do well to emulate them!"</p>
               <p>"What shall I render unto the Lord for all his mercies unto me! I have believed
                  that this day would come at last, that friends would arise to her in her hour of
                  need. My friend, thou hast the blessing of a dying man. Thou hast removed from
                  death its only sting; thou hast robbed the grave of its victory!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, it is not I. It is the reward of thy own and her deserts. The hand of God
                  is here!"</p>
               <p>"I feel that it is the hand of a good and merciful father! 'Lord, now lettest thou
                  thy servant depart in peace!'"</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding was moved to tears at witnessing his deep emotion, and kindly pressed
                  his hand in token of sympathy.</p>
               <p>"I am myself a father, and 'God do so with me and more' if I be not one to thy
                  child!"</p>
               <p>The dying man then confided his affairs to his new friend, and although his own
                  care and foresight had arranged them so as to cause his daughter as little
                  annoyance as possible, it was a great relief that he could place them in the hands
                  of Mr. Harding, and thus save her the otherwise necessary pain of giving them her
                  attention. In the course of their conversation the Quaker informed him that he had
                  already written to<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6366-00000138"/> Edith's aunt, their
                  only remaining relative to whom she could look for protection, informing her of
                  his wish to place Edith under her care; and that as soon as was practicable, after
                  his decease, he proposed her return to England, accompanied by Maretah who had
                  declared her intention never to desert her, and for whom he had made ample
                  provision in the settlement of his affairs; adding that, for the brief time that
                  would probably intervene between his death and their departure, Mr. Harding's
                  protection would not only be most gratefully received, but that without it their
                  purpose might be altogether defeated. He also said that it would grieve him to
                  think that any kindness of Mr. Harding's toward his child would involve him in
                  difficulty or subject him to suspicion; but that reasons existed which tended to
                  remove that apprehension from his mind, and that these reasons Edith would
                  herself, probably, reveal to him.</p>
               <p>"Believe me, my brother, these matters shall receive my faithful attention; and
                  should it result, as possibly it may, in thy daughter remaining among us, she
                  shall be, as it were, a sacred trust committed to my keeping."</p>
               <p>"I should do my feelings wrong did I attempt to express my sense of thy kindness.
                  I have conversed with Edith on that subject, and she thinks with me. Nevertheless,
                  we are short-sighted mortals, and I leave it with thee to say to her that I desire
                  her to do as may be most fitting her own wishes."</p>
               <p>"And do not think me obtrusive if I touch upon another subject which interests me
                  because it concerns thy spiritual welfare."</p>
               <p>"Speak thy mind, friend. Methinks I partly divine thy meaning."</p>
               <p>"I am aware that thy sect rejects what we regard as the command of our Master to
                  keep His death in remembrance by the performance of an act which most Christians
                  regard as their duty."</p>
               <p>"Thou referest to the Supper of our Lord. Far be it from me to assume a merit
                  which none can claim; but friend, I require not to receive from the hand of man
                  what comes to the soul direct from that of the Great High Priest Himself. Let me
                  ask thee if in thus striving to comply literally with what ye regard as his
                  command, thou believest there is any spiritual profit to be derived from the
                  external emblem?"</p>
               <p>"Not from the external emblem, but from the act of obedience. In childlike faith
                  we should perform his command, and that according to the manner of his
                  instruction. If we presume to set that aside, what warrant have we that we shall
                  receive the spirit—how know we that he will vouchsafe it in any other way than
                  that through which he instructs us we may obtain it?"</p>
               <p>"Thou believest then that the outward and the spiritual manifestations are
                  inseparable."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6366-00000139"/>
               <p>"Not so, else we should require the constant presence of the external form,
                  because God should be always within our hearts, and not only when we perform the
                  outward act of obedience."</p>
               <p>"And if he thus manifests himself, what need is there of an occasional or
                  periodical observance of a form which may exist as void, conveying no nurture to
                  the soul, while we know and daily experience the necessity of a constant renewal
                  of our strength by coming directly to the living fountain and partaking of its
                  reviving waters?"</p>
               <p>"Simply as I said before, because we have no guaranty if we reject the means he
                  offers us of reaching his presence to-day, that to-morrow, when those means are no
                  longer at hand, if we come in our sin and weakness to ask his mercy, he will
                  receive us."</p>
               <p>"But the Scripture is full of such promises as show us that in truly humbling
                  ourselves before Him and asking his gracious presence by which alone we have
                  spiritual life, we shall obtain what we need. Thine own doctrine teaches thee that
                  thou must, by repentance, come to Him, ere thou art deemed fit to approach the
                  symbol. We have not so understood Christ as to believe that we can reach him only
                  through a perishing medium. There is too much danger that an idol be made of the
                  outward sign, and that in merely partaking thereof men deem they have complied
                  with God's whole command. It is therefore better to turn away from it entirely,
                  and place our whole trust on that within, which is Christ born in our hearts."</p>
               <p>"What do I hear? I thought thou hadst been one of that sect which men call
                  Quakers!"</p>
               <p>"And so indeed I am."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that they entertain such doctrines? Do they indeed believe on Him
                  who died that we might live?"</p>
               <p>"Verily they do. But it is too often the case that man refuses that justice to his
                  fellow, which, if Christian love did move him, he would joyfully accord. On the
                  other hand it is his nature to resist oppression. There is often much contention
                  among brethren in consequence of refusing to call things by a common name. 'One is
                  of Paul,' 'another of Apollos,' when all should say 'I am of Christ.'"</p>
               <p>"If this be so, God forgive the blindness of those who have sinned against Him in
                  persecuting their Christian brethren. Methinks though, thy people have been to
                  blame in setting above these spiritual things matters of trifling moment, such as
                  wearing the hat, and refusing to yield respect to your superiors, and many other
                  peculiarities of manner ye persist in."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said the Quaker, with a smile—"thou hast come to it at last. When ye can no
                  longer condemn our faith ye fall back upon such points as these, and<pb
                     n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6366-00000140"/> it is for wearing the hat and for
                  offending those in authority by addressing them as equals that we are driven to
                  banishment, and even to the gallows! But I mean not to speak unkindly; do not so
                  consider it, my brother."</p>
               <p>"No, no; but what have I been thinking of to tarry with thee thus, wearying thee
                  beyond thy strength! Believe me, however, what I have this day heard from thy lips
                  has not fallen upon unyielding soil. With God's blessing on my efforts I will make
                  it my task to labor for the good of thy people, and there are not wanting men of
                  strength who will arise in their behalf, for many are discontented and outraged by
                  recent acts of wrong and severity. Ah, maiden, thou art come to chide me! But for
                  the interest with which thy father's conversation has inspired me, I should have
                  gone long ago. However, I go now, but, with God's permission (not regarding man's
                  as necessary) will ere long visit you again."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <p>AFTER the interview with Mr. Harding, Edith noticed that her father's mind
                  appeared to be more tranquil, though with a breaking heart she also saw that he
                  was rapidly declining. The kind physician continued his frequent visits, and
                  although his manner was somewhat more constrained than formerly, she read in it
                  only the sad confirmation of her fears. Sometimes she caught his eye fixed upon
                  her with an expression of mental pain which she attributed to sympathy, and was
                  deeply grateful for the kindness from which his feelings sprung.</p>
               <p>One evening, after a day of intense suffering, he came in to make his usual visit.
                  His anxious look on ascertaining his patient's condition, did not escape the
                  daughter's watchful eye, and when, after a whispered word with him, Louis informed
                  her that he should return and remain with her father during a portion of the
                  night, she understood his meaning but too well.</p>
               <p>As soon as he had gone to make some preparatory arrangements, the sick man called
                  his daughter to his bedside.</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6366-00000141"/>
               <p>"My daughter, ask our Heavenly Parent to strengthen thee for this night. The hour
                  has come when I am called to leave thee, but hearken to my words, my child, and
                  God give me strength to say what I desire to say to thee!</p>
               <p>"Praised be His name, I leave thee not without protection, but feel that thou wilt
                  be more safe under the guardianship offered than thou hast been under mine own.
                  Our kind friend, Gideon Harding, has promised to be a father to thee, and I have
                  confided to him such matters as would only weary thee to hear of, and also my
                  views with regard to thy future movements.</p>
               <p>"Edith, there is one thing further I would say to thee. It was once a source of
                  grief to me that thy spiritual views should differ from mine own. It is so no
                  longer. I believe thou hast what is needful to secure thy everlasting peace, and
                  it is a subject rather of rejoicing that I bequeath not this cause of dissension,
                  perhaps of persecution, to my child. Though we have chosen different paths through
                  which to journey thither, I believe that we shall meet at the final goal.
                  To-morrow, my daughter, think that thy dear mother's spirit and mine own are
                  reunited for eternity, and view this life as but a brief day of trial, at the
                  close of which thou too shall rejoice in our society.</p>
               <p>"And now bring hither the Holy Book, and read to me once more from its pages the
                  promises which are sufficient for our support even in an hour like this. Ah, they
                  have belied us who say that we reject its sacred counsels!"</p>
               <p>Edith listened to her father's dying words, and complied with his request, with a
                  degree of composure astonishing to herself. How kind is the provision of our
                  Heavenly Father which, in moments of our deepest trial, renders the mind incapable
                  of comprehending their reality! It is only when the occasion has gone by, and
                  time, in a measure, accustoms us to our loss, that the truth begins to dawn
                  gradually upon the mind, and we realize that our dear ones are departed forever.
                  Forever?—no! for with this mournful thought comes the consoling assurance that we
                  shall meet them in a happier home, and continue through eternity the intercourse
                  which time had just begun!</p>
               <p>When Louis returned, he found the sick man sleeping, while Edith sat beside him,
                  clasping his hand in both her own, and listening for each fitful breath as if she
                  feared it would be the last she should hear. He stood regarding them in silent
                  emotion. "Why may I not say to this dying man, Leave thy daughter with me. I love
                  her with an affection which shall take the place of thine. On my bosom shall her
                  grief be soothed, and my arm shall shield her from the ills that threaten! But no,
                  it can not be. My mother, for thy sake I can not. Duty claims the conquest over
                  love, and this dying man must pass away without such consoling<pb n="282-283"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000142"/> soling assurance to calm his last moments upon
                  earth!"</p>
               <p>The sick man now awoke, and desired to be raised a little. This being done, he
                  attempted in a faint voice to thank Louis for his unfailing kindness. Then calling
                  upon Maretah he gave her a few words of Christian counsel, and commended his
                  daughter to her kindness.</p>
               <p>"My father," answered the Indian girl, "Maretah's love shall soothe her sister's
                  sorrow, and Maretah's hand (placing it upon her dagger) shall be swift to avenge
                  her injuries!"</p>
               <p>"Not so, my child! Thou must learn to leave vengeance to Him who alone knoweth how
                  to wield it. Edith will teach thee these milder principles of Christian
                  doctrine."</p>
               <p>"Forgive my haste, father! The Indian's blood yet runs wildly through my heart.
                  Maretah forgot she was no longer the daughter of the forest. But she will be her
                  weak sister's mother and her father. She will wipe away her tears, and when danger
                  threatens, it shall reach her only through Maretah's bosom!"</p>
               <p>He spoke no word to Edith, but casting upon her a look full eloquent, he opened
                  his arms, and she flung herself weeping upon his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Heavenly Parent behold her! Let thine arm sustain, thy care defend her, and thy
                  kindness bless!" His breath came faster, a slight shadow passed over his frame.
                  There was a silence of some moments, when Louis approached quietly and saw the
                  spirit had departed. He stole noiselessly away, and left the daughter to her
                  sorrow.</p>
               <p>The gray dawn crept painfully through the lattice of the silent chamber, making
                  the heart sick and faint with its unwelcome revealings, and Edith turned from its
                  unsympathizing brightness with the feeling that life had now indeed but little
                  left for her to cling to. There were in her conduct no loud nor violent
                  demonstrations of sorrow, but the silent tokens of a deeper agony; and thrice
                  welcome on that solemn morning had been the messenger of death to her—the
                  sorrowing orphan. Gladly would she have lain her young head to rest forever in her
                  father's grave, and joyfully have bidden farewell to a world wherein she had
                  experienced as yet, little else than sorrow.</p>
               <p>It was forbidden that "Quakers and other hereticks" should be interred in
                  consecrated ground, but there was a little secluded spot which was privately used
                  as a burial-place for those who died in the faith of the Church of England, where
                  Louis knew he could obtain permission for the Quaker's dust to repose. It was
                  necessary to consult Edith on these matters, which was done as gently as possible,
                  and all needful arrangements being completed, she was left for this day with the
                  Indian girl, to sit for the last time by her father's bedside. As she took her
                  seat there and clasped his<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6366-00000143"/> lifeless
                  hand in her own, Maretah placed herself at the foot of the bed and began a chant
                  for the departed. There was something so soft and mournful in her tone and action,
                  that it could not jar upon the daughter's feelings, but rather served to soothe
                  and calm her mind. <q>

                        <l>When the sunbeam calls the hunter to the hills?</l>
                        <l>He has gone to the happy hunting-grounds—</l>
                        <l>Never shall we welcome him again!</l>
                        <l>Grieved and weary was he with his burden.—</l>
                        <l>In the land of rest he lays it down!</l>
                        <l>There is one who hastes to give him welcome,</l>
                        <l>There is one who takes him by the hand.</l>
                        <l>'Tis the wife who has waited for his coming,</l>
                        <l>Who has listened for his footsteps long!</l>
                        <l>She waited on the brow of the mountain,</l>
                        <l>Her white hand beckoned him to come,</l>
                        <l>And together through the mists of the morning,</l>
                        <l>On the wings of the breezes they are flown!"</l>

               </p>
               <p>The first sunbeams of the early morning fell upon a solemn group assembled around
                  a new-made grave. Mr. Harding's arm supported the drooping form of the sorrowing
                  daughter, while Maretah knelt at her side and bathed the hand she held with
                  sympathizing tears. Louis stood by the side of the grave, and in a tremulous voice
                  read, at Edith's request, the burial service of the Church of England. When the
                  coffin was lowered into the grave, and "ashes to ashes, dust to dust," was said,
                  Edith left the friendly arm that sustained her and threw herself upon her knees
                  beside the open grave. She cast one long, lingering look upon the coffin, and
                  then, raising her glance to heaven, she lifted her clasped hands upward, and
                  seemed to breathe a silent prayer, after which she suffered herself to be led
                  away. And once more in her now desolate home, so deep was the aspect of grief she
                  wore, that each one who approached her felt that words of comfort were but an idle
                  and discordant sound. Nothing could exceed the tender delicacy of Maretah, who, by
                  many an unobtrusive act of kindness, showed her appreciation of her sister's
                  sorrow; thus soothing her grief with the sympathy of her untutored feelings; for
                  Edith was not one to remain insensible to such affection, and in the midst of her
                  distress, she did not forget to thank her heavenly Father for bestowing upon her
                  in her need so true and kind a friend as this, the daughter of the forest.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <p>"EDITH, thou must share our home. Come to us, and as my father has already told
                  thee, so long as thou wilt remain with us, thou shalt be as our own."</p>
               <p>"Not yet, not yet, dear Alice! Oh, I can not so soon leave this spot where his
                  spirit seems to linger!"</p>
               <p>"It is no longer safe, dearest; and our love shall strive to comfort thee!" Alice
                  urged gently.</p>
               <p>"There is naught on earth I fear now. Yet I will come, for it was his wish. Only
                  let me stay in this now sacred place a little longer, for as soon as may be I must
                  leave these scenes forever!"</p>
               <p>"What dost thou mean? Leave these scenes? Oh, Edith, whither wilt thou go?"</p>
               <p>"To England," she answered, with an effort. "To that far off land, no longer dear
                  to me!"</p>
               <p>"Then why wilt thou go, when we who so dearly love thee desire thee to remain with
                  us, and thou thyself, oh, Edith, surely thou dost not wish to leave us!"</p>
               <p>"No, Alice; all that is dearest to me is here. But this life has ever been to me a
                  scene of duty and self-sacrifice. I can not do as I would."</p>
               <p>"And why not? what should call thee there except it were thy own free will to
                  go?"</p>
               <p>"Duty; duty to the sister of my mother who claims from me a daughter's love—to
                  you, my friends here, who risk so much in my behalf—and lastly, I owe it to myself
                  to go!"</p>
               <p>"Edith, if I could find it in my heart to be angry with thee, I should be so now.
                  'Duty, duty!' is there naught on earth but that, that thou must be forever harping
                  upon 'duty' and sacrificing thyself to others instead of sometimes consulting
                  thine own pleasure?"</p>
               <p>"Thou forgettest, Alice, that the one is so closely allied with the other, that I
                  can not separate the two without destruction to the latter. Where should I find
                  pleasure were I to forget my duty in the pursuit of it?"</p>
               <p>"And on the other hand, can not pleasure exist and be enjoyed innocently without
                  some grim phantom standing by its side to affright one withal? I would not have
                  thee other than thou art, and yet I wish thy conscience were a trifle less
                  tender."</p>
               <p>"No, no; thou dost not, Alice. But thou canst not know all the reasons that
                  influence me in this decision—and I can not tell them to thee. But those I have
                  mentioned are sufficient, and beside that, thou dost forget, Alice, that I am
                  under sentence of banishment."</p>
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6366-00000145"/>
               <p>"Banishment! sentence of banishment!"</p>
               <p>"It is true, dear girl, and so thou see'st I have no choice but to go. Indeed, I
                  had almost forgotten it too, so much has my mind been filled with other
                  thoughts."</p>
               <p>"But Edith, surely that sentence does not weigh against thee, and my father's
                  voice has sufficient influence to procure thee some favor. Nay, the Governor has
                  often called me his little pet, and I will go myself and importune him so that he
                  will be glad to dismiss me with my petition granted. Fear not but we shall remove
                  this obstacle, and when we have accomplished that we will set about overthrowing
                  the others!"</p>
               <p>"Dear Alice, I must ask thee as a favor that thou wilt do nothing of this kind,
                  for believe me it would be useless."</p>
               <p>"Then thou wilt go after all, and I just fancied I had found a sister! Edith, thou
                  didst foretell the dawn of my happiness—do not forget that thine own was to be
                  united with it. Alas, I can not rejoice in my newly-found joy if thou dost not
                  share it with me!"</p>
               <p>"Alice, dearest, I am indeed happy in thy returning delight. Think not that even
                  grief can drown the spark of sympathy."</p>
               <p>"Can I never make thee think of thyself? Wilt thou not see—dost thou not
                  understand that there are reasons why thou shouldst not, at least, hasten thy
                  departure? Be not rash! others' happiness as well as thine own may depend upon thy
                  decision."</p>
               <p>"I scorn the affectation of misunderstanding thee, Alice, but the reasons thou
                  dost urge are the very ones which hasten my departure, though I had thought not to
                  mention them. At a time like this I would not permit such thoughts to have place
                  within my mind, did I not feel it incumbent upon me, for others' peace. And Alice,
                  thou canst urge me no longer when I tell thee that in going hence I avoid a danger
                  which I must encounter in remaining."</p>
               <p>Alice said no more upon the subject, but in her secret heart she cherished the
                  belief that something would yet interpose to prevent the accomplishment of Edith's
                  purpose, and formed a resolution to defeat it, if such a thing were possible. So,
                  after obtaining her promise to come to them ere long, she left her, happy in the
                  brightness that now enveloped her own future, and, in the fullness of her joy,
                  investing that of her friend with the glow of its reflected beauty.</p>

               <p>"WHAT makes you look so sorry, brother? Are you ill?"</p>
               <p>"No, Angeline; but I have seen that which grieves me."</p>
               <p>"May I know what it is?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my little sister. You know that Edith's father has been a long time
                  ill."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I hope it is not any thing sad that concerns her!"</p>
               <p>"But it is, for she is an orphan."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Louis! is her father really dead?" asked the tender-hearted child, now
                  weeping.</p>
               <p>"He is, my dear; he died soiree days ago."</p>
               <p>"Poor Edith! who will take care of her?"</p>
               <p>"Her heavenly Father! for I know of no earthly protector she, has now," and Louis
                  arose and paced the room, deeply moved.</p>
               <p>"Mamma!"</p>
               <p>"What, my love?"</p>
               <p>"Did you know that Edith had lost her father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear, and I am very sorry for her."</p>
               <p>"And brother says she has no one to take care of her!"</p>
               <p>"It is very unfortunate. But I think she told me she had relations in England. I
                  would advise her to go thither!"</p>
               <p>"I hope she won't do that, for if she does, we shall never see her again!"</p>
               <p>"No very great misfortune!" thought Mrs. Hermon, though she said nothing.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma, if she could only come here, how happy it would make me!"</p>
               <p>"That is impossible, Angeline."</p>
               <p>"And can not I ever go to see her, and tell her how sorry I am for her?"</p>
               <p>"It would be very improper to permit you to do so."</p>
               <p>"But, dear mamma, what is to become of her?"</p>
               <p>"My dear, you seem in some sort to hold me responsible for her welfare. It is not
                  in my power to become so. I must consider first the safety of my own family."</p>
               <p>"But I thought Mr. Mildman told us that every body was sorry for Edith's
                  misfortunes, because every one respected her, and that even the Governor himself
                  could not help admiring her; and I am sure God is too good to allow any one to
                  suffer for being kind to such a person!"</p>
               <p>"Angeline, you speak of matters you do not understand. It is scarcely becoming in
                  a little girl to express such decided opinions."</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6366-00000147"/>
               <p>The child looked at her mother in surprise; for once she did not comprehend her.
                  The tears filled her eyes as she answered, "I am very sorry if I said any thing
                  wrong;" and then she stole away to relieve her wounded feelings, and to grieve in
                  secret over the sorrows she was not permitted to soothe.</p>
               <p>In fact, Mrs. Hermon was in the predicament of one who commences by taking a wrong
                  course, and then tries to persuade herself that it is right, and persists in it
                  accordingly. The prejudice she had acquired against Edith was not lessened by the
                  continual fear she felt that even should Louis refrain from declaring his
                  affection for her, he might very naturally betray it in his conduct; and setting
                  this danger aside, it irritated the affectionate mother to notice that his manner
                  had become more grave than formerly; and that when he thought himself unobserved,
                  he gave way to an air of sadness which was fast becoming habitual.</p>
               <p>When Angeline was gone, he took his seat beside his mother and said with what
                  composure he could command,</p>
               <p>"Do you not think that after all my sister's remarks were just?"</p>
               <p>"Louis! you certainly can not expect me to receive this girl again into the
                  family!"</p>
               <p>"Let me at least tell you my plan, mother. Before Mr. Mildman went away—I think it
                  was because he partly suspected what my feelings toward Edith were— he took an
                  opportunity of telling me that he had reason to think the sentence of banishment
                  under which the members of this sect at present rest, would cease to include Edith
                  as soon as her father's death should occur. He added that Mr. Harding's feelings
                  were interested in her, and that his influence might easily obtain permission for
                  her to remain here without fear of molestation. Now, mother, what I would ask of
                  you is, that if such permission be procured (in which event of course you would
                  incur no risk in so doing), you will, for a short time, offer this friendless girl
                  your protection. My object in this is to give you the opportunity of becoming more
                  perfectly acquainted with her, and of satisfying yourself with regard to her true
                  character. Meanwhile, to relieve your mind of anxiety on this point, I will take
                  the opportunity to make that long anticipated journey through the colonies, which
                  you know I planned some time ago. And, if you are really convinced, on the closest
                  scrutiny (and I consent that you use all fair means of ascertaining the truth),
                  that she is not a worthy wife for your unworthy son, I will then promise you to
                  give her up forever, and never again cast so much as a regret on my decision."</p>
               <p>"I am surprised, Louis, that you do not see the difficulties in the way of all
                  this. In the first place, should I invite Edith here, it would perhaps be
                  encouraging a false expectation on her part; and even were every other obstacle to
                  your union with her removed, there<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6366-00000148"/>
                  still remains the insuperable one of the difference in your religious opinions—a
                  fruitful source of unhappiness and contention in the marriage connection."</p>
               <p>"Mother, I have thought of this, and feel perfectly convinced that no unhappy
                  consequences would result from it; because my love for her has had its source in
                  admiration and respect for those very qualities that go to make up the true
                  Christian character. And who knows, dear mother, but we might at last make her a
                  convert to our own chosen religion?"</p>
               <p>"I should respect her less for abjuring her father's faith to win our favor, than
                  if she remained the most obstinate Quaker in the colonies! And, Louis, I am forced
                  to tell you that the promise you made me adds but little to my comfort so long as
                  you continue to importune me on this subject, and in your heart to accuse me—as I
                  feel you do—of injustice, and indifference to your happiness. Alas, why will yot
                  not renounce this hope, which, it is my duty to tell you, you can never reasonably
                  expect to realize; and let us be once more happy, as we were before this girl came
                  into our circle, to bring distrust and misery where all before was peace and
                  unity!"—and her appeal ended in a flood of tears.</p>
               <p>What could poor Louis do? His mother had always been the object of his highest
                  admiration and most devoted love; and he was the more closely bound to her,
                  because he felt that she looked on him as her protector, and relied upon his
                  strength as her chief dependence. This was the first cause of difference that had
                  arisen between them, and until now, the dutiful son had never known his mother
                  swerve from justice or refuse her ready sympathy to virtue in distress. That she
                  required of him more than was reasonable, and not only so, but that she used means
                  to attain her object which could scarcely be called fair, the young man felt with
                  pain. But he also felt that he had yielded as much as duty required of him
                  already, and that to comply with her demand was a thing not to be thought of, and
                  next to impossible. To remonstrate would be vain, to remain and witness her
                  distress, which he was made to feel he was the cause of, was more than he could
                  endure; and when Mrs. Hermon looked up after her paroxysm of grief was exhausted,
                  she found herself alone.</p>
               <p>In such a case, tears are a final resort in a tottering cause. They are an
                  auxiliary furnished the weaker sex by nature, and sometimes come to our aid when
                  other means are unavailing. The storm of words may rage, the sunshine of smiles
                  strike upon the flinty heart in vain, but it is seldom that the 'gentle dew of
                  tears' well refined, fails to call forth the fragrance of young feeling. But,
                  sisters, we would warn you not to use the weapon rashly! Cautiously displayed, its
                  power is magic; but shown injudiciously or too often, the spell is broken, and
                  man—stern, unrelenting tyrant—triumphs<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6366-00000149"/>
                  umphs over the anguish he inflicts, and laughs exultingly at what should wring his
                  heart with remorseful pain!</p>
               <p>We do not mean to say <emph>Louis</emph> laughed—not he! Under such circumstances
                  what youthful lover could? He merely took his hat and went out, which was natural.
                  Men usually do so in such cases. What woman who has had any experience with the
                  sex does not know it?</p>
               <p>A walk of some distance wore off his doubt as well as his excitement, and he
                  resolved to visit Edith, and after the manner of a kind friend (nothing more!) to
                  offer his services in any matters wherein she might require advice or assistance.
                  It was a dangerous step, but was as little as he could do—and as much!</p>
               <p>It was then that Edith informed him of Mr. Harding's kindness in relieving her of
                  the necessity of attending to her business affairs, and also of his fearless offer
                  of protection, and her decision to accept it for a short time, and gratefully
                  declined his proffered assistance. She scarcely dared enter upon a subject so
                  nearly touching her feelings, as to return her thanks to him and to his family for
                  all they had done for her and for her departed parent, and after faintly
                  endeavoring to express her sense of obligation, was obliged to leave the rest to
                  his delicacy of apprehension. But when, for the first time, he learned her
                  intention of returning soon to England, his agitation was too great to escape her
                  observation. He felt now, indeed, that his hopes had received a death-blow, and he
                  would have been utterly unable to repress the spontaneous outbreak of his
                  feelings, but for the calmness of the young girl's demeanor, and the dignity of
                  grief with which she was invested. He left her with a breaking heart, not knowing
                  that he should again behold her whom he loved more than aught else that earth
                  contained, but from whom he seemed separated by a cruel and unavoidable
                  destiny.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>IT may be asked what reason the Quaker's daughter now had for continuing to
                  conceal the true state of her religious opinions; but it must be remembered that
                  she was placed in embarrassing circumstances. It would be but a short time that
                  she should remain in Boston, and respect for her father's memory induced her for
                  that time to preserve silence on the subject. It would benefit her but little to
                  have it known, for although the knowledge of her views might screen her against
                  open persecution, it would not remove the suspicion attached to her as her
                  father's daughter. No one seemed in the least, to suspect her of holding opinions
                  differing from those of her departed parent, and it now appeared to her a
                  sacrilege to disturb that impression.</p>
               <p>And there was another reason, which operated strongly upon her feelings of
                  delicacy, if not upon her sentiments of filial duty. Should she now declare her
                  self to be a member of the Church of England, what inference, regarding her
                  relation with the young physician might be drawn therefrom? Probably this was the
                  chief obstacle in the way of his half-told attachment (for his agitation on the
                  occasion of their last interview had revealed to her woman's heart what it gave
                  her, she feared, too much delight to know), and should she voluntarily appear as
                  if too anxious or ready to remove it? Her delicacy took alarm at the thought, and
                  Henriette's ill-natured remarks and unfounded suspicions, had their share in
                  bringing about her decision.</p>
               <p>And then she regarded her return to England as a necessity beyond all question,
                  for she felt that she owed a daughter's duty to the sister of her beloved mother.
                  She, therefore, did not allow herself to indulge in dreams of happiness, which,
                  however tempting they might be, could only lead to disappointment, and the young
                  girl—schooled in self-denial—armed herself to combat this sorrow also, and
                  submitted to her lot in silent resignation.</p>
               <p>She was now residing under the shelter of Mr. Harding's roof, and the happiness of
                  Alice would have been complete, except for the thought that would every little
                  while intrude, that she was soon to lose her forever. She had Edith's promise,
                  however, to delay her departure until after her marriage, which was to take place
                  in May, and Alice did not yet relinquish the hope that something would occur to
                  detain her still longer.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"It should be looked to, neighbor. Were thou or I to take such a stand how would
                  it fare with us, think<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6366-00000151"/> est thou? Fines
                  and the lash were none too much for us to smart under, I warrant thee!"</p>
               <p>"It is a shame, goodman, and a scoffing of religion and law. I tell thee, this
                  Harding waxes of too much consequence. Pride, neighbor, pride, I say, should be
                  humbled were it only for the good of the soul."</p>
               <p>"It is a sad example for our youth, a sad example, and an awful victory for the
                  enemy. And it rests on my conscience that we are responsible for a share of the
                  evil while we pass it by thus quietly."</p>
               <p>"True, true! Thou speakest with force and wisdom. Mark how God's judgment visited
                  that pious and gifted youth—his servant, Ichabod Mildman. There was some secret
                  mystery in that, neighbor."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay, indeed there was. And Gideon Harding's daughter was the instrument.
                  Goodman, there is a sin I desire not to name, but love constrains me. It is the
                  sin of witchcraft!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, name it not, though it was on my very tongue's end at the moment.
                  They said this Quaker's daughter stood by when the marriage was going on, and that
                  the child of our dear brother Gideon fell under her eye. They also said the
                  heretic woman desired to wed this goodly youth herself, and so she wrought her
                  spell on the maiden, and brought her so near death's door that it was only by
                  God's providence she was restored to reason."</p>
               <p>"An awful tale indeed, and further than that, my spouse had it from good authority
                  that the strangest part of all was that although the maiden was filled with love
                  and affection for the youth up to that morning, that no sooner did the heretic's
                  eye fall on her than it turned to the most bitter hatred, even to gall and
                  wormwood!"</p>
               <p>"And lo! what a blight fell on the goodly man, even as on Jonah's gourd, which in
                  one night was cut down and withered. There was something wrong there, else why did
                  God permit this to come on his faithful servant?"</p>
               <p>"Dost thou not see, neighbor? Doubtless it came of pitying these vile heretics. I
                  trust his mind was not tainted with their sinful doctrines."</p>
               <p>"Ah, ah, it all comes of showing too much mercy. An' I had had a voice in the
                  matter, there should not have been spared a single shoot of this poison vine. Cut
                  and burn—tear out and destroy root and branch, and then our vineyard would indeed
                  flourish!"</p>
               <p>"Thou sayest true! But dost see, goodman, thou and I have no voice in the matter.
                  No, we are not gifted with wealth to buy us honor among men. Nevertheless, mayhap
                  God has chosen us as his instruments in this, and we must not shrink from our duty
                  though it may be painful."</p>
               <p>"Let us go to the Governor straightway. We may receive favor to move him in this
                  righteous cause.<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6366-00000152"/> The souls of our dear
                  brother Gideon and his goodly child are in peril."</p>
               <p>"Amen, brother; and God put the sword of the Spirit into our hands wherewith to
                  defeat the enemy. An' I had my way this heretic maiden should be bound to the
                  cart's tail and whipped beyond the jurisdiction, according to the wholesome letter
                  of the law."</p>
               <p>"And a refreshing sight for Christian eyes to behold—a precious example for our
                  youth! It is the Lord's command to disperse his enemies, and woe to the man who
                  gives way to the weakness of pity."</p>
               <p>"Pity! don't name it, brother! It is a device of the enemy to turn men's hearts
                  from justice. Remember Ichabod Mildman, and what befell him for suffering that
                  folly to overtake him!"</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>A cheerful circle was assembled around Mr. Harding's hearth, and he, not the least
                  happy among them, looked with proud delight upon his once more gay and blooming
                  daughter, who seemed like one restored to him after a long and weary separation.
                  Edith's pensive features, over which a shade of sorrow lingered, offered a
                  pleasing contrast to those of her laughing companion. Had you entered that little
                  apartment you would scarcely have known whether to sympathize most with the joyful
                  brightness ness of the one, or to give your deeper attention to the subdued
                  sadness of the other.</p>
               <p>Edward Stanley was there too, and as he carefully inquired what task it was upon
                  which the more serious maiden bestowed her attention, Alice, her face and neck
                  glowing with a sudden and unwonted bloom, half in play and half earnest, seized
                  the gossamer-like fabric, and holding it behind her with one hand, placed the
                  other upon Edith's lips, as if to prevent the betrayal of a most important secret.
                  In fact it was the bridal vail upon which she wrought, and as some of our lady
                  readers may be interested to know the pattern of the workmanship, we will state
                  that it was a border of rose-buds, which Alice declared should always be her pet
                  device; (we regret that the exact style of the pattern and its arrangement have
                  not descended to the present generation, the vail itself, we are assured by good
                  authority, being some time after, cut up and converted into a little dress to be
                  worn at a christening).</p>
               <p>While this was going on within, there was a loud and somewhat impatient summons
                  upon the street door, and soon after Mr. Harding was called into his study. In a
                  few moments Edward received a request to join him there, and the two girls thought
                  they heard voices in angry altercation. After a while Edward returned, but his
                  greatest efforts at cheerfulness<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6366-00000153"/>
                  fulness did not serve to conceal a certain degree of embarrassment and anxiety. To
                  the many and close questions to which he was subjected by Alice, both regarding
                  the individuals who had been there, and her father's errand from home at that
                  unusual hour, he returned evasive answers, and soon something of gloom and
                  apprehension seemed to have spread itself over the little party.</p>
               <p>In less than an hour Mr. Harding returned, and his companions with him, and as he
                  entered the parlor Alice saw that his face wore a troubled as well as an angry
                  expression, a thing so unusual that it alarmed her, and springing eagerly to his
                  side, she inquired what was the matter. Edward too, hastily came forward, and Mr.
                  Harding, looking at him significantly, exclaimed "It is all in vain. The obstinate
                  fools will not be put off!" Edith looked up from her work in quiet surprise, and
                  seeing that both the gentlemen had their eyes fixed upon her with an expression of
                  pained embarrassment, she arose from her seat, and in some little agitation
                  inquired if there were any matters stirring which concerned her.</p>
               <p>At this moment a rough-looking individual pushed his way into the room as if
                  already angered by the needless delay, and casting a glance at each of the two
                  maidens, he fixed his eyes upon Edith, and advancing toward her and taking a rough
                  hold upon her arm, he said: "You must come along with me, my pretty little
                  heretic!"</p>
               <p>"Villain, how dare thou!" cried Mr. Harding, approaching with a hasty stride.
                  "Take thy hand off the maiden, or, by all that is sacred, I will teach thee
                  manners in mine own dwelling!"</p>
               <p>Somewhat abashed at this outburst, the man stood back with rather more respect in
                  his behavior, while Edith, deeply grieved that she had brought this upon her
                  friends, and thinking of them far more than of herself, besought her kind
                  protector not to anger any one on her account, and added that, "if that person
                  would consent to leave the room a moment, she had something to impart to Mr.
                  Harding, which, perhaps, she had done wrong in not revealing sooner."</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding accordingly turned to the man, and desired him to withdraw; but he
                  refused.</p>
               <p>"I've had trouble enough with these here Quaker folk. The gal don't git out o' my
                  grip so easy. I ain't to be cheated that way, for I've seen sich tricks played
                  afore to-day!" he said, shaking his head in self-satisfaction at his own
                  shrewdness.</p>
               <p>"But I do not intend to leave the room, friend; thou wilt find me here on thy
                  return, and I give thee my word to go with thee then if it be needful."</p>
               <p>The officer was still inclined to be obstinate, but at a summons from another
                  party outside, he moved toward the door, still, however, keeping a sharp look-out
                     upon<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6366-00000154"/> the motions of each individual
                  within. Edith glanced that way and saw the good-humored countenance of her old
                  acquaintance, Joe Makefast, and smiled as he made a motion with his foot and
                  pulled his foretop in respect to her.</p>
               <p>"Come along, boy," he said, "I knows the leddy well, and you may trust her; what
                  she says she'll do, she'll do, I've know'd heaps and heaps of these Quakers, and
                  entertained 'em too in my fine large house, and I hain't never know'd one on 'em
                  to break promise."</p>
               <p>Thus assured, though as if still doubting the propriety of the step, his companion
                  consented to retire, and slowly left the room; when he was gone, Edith appeared
                  for a moment to be struggling with some hidden emotion, then, by a strong effort,
                  subduing her feelings, she said:</p>
               <p>"I would gladly have gone hence, as I trusted I might, without revealing what I
                  must now make known for your sakes; and if I have been to blame in concealing it,
                  it was through respect for my father's memory, and not for any want of confidence
                  toward you on my part. These persons are mistaken. I am not what they take me for;
                  I am not, and never have been a Quaker!"</p>
               <p>Nothing could exceed the surprise of two of her auditors at this announcement.
                  Alice, who from the first had clung to her as if determined they should not be
                  separated, uttered a cry of joy, and Edward, whose surprise was equal to her own,
                  expressed a similar degree of astonishment. But Mr. Harding did not seem to share
                  in their amazement, although he participated warmly in their pleasure.</p>
               <p>"I suspected somewhat of this from a word thy father let fall to me. These
                  villains shall be disappointed of their prey; but, Edith, it is needful thou
                  shouldst go with me before the Governor."</p>
               <p>She hastily prepared to do so, while Alice would consent to remain behind only
                  upon her father's repeated assurances that he would bring her friend back with
                  him, and that no one now had any authority to detain her. But the affectionate
                  girl still clung to her as if she feared to let her go; and the interval of their
                  absence was passed by her in a state of restless anxiety.</p>
               <p>Closely followed by the two officers, Mr. Harding and Edith took their way to the
                  mansion of the Governor. It was only by great urgency that they obtained an
                  interview, and the irritation of his Excellency at being disturbed at so late an
                  hour, boded little good to their errand.</p>
               <p>"What now, Harding—must thou still tease me with this unmannerly girl's affairs?
                  Methinks she has given us sufficient trouble already. Maiden, thou and thy father
                  were released on condition that you left this place as soon as possible. Why art
                  thou found lingering here still?"</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6366-00000155"/>
               <p>"It is my purpose to depart as soon as I can find a passage in a vessel bound for
                  England."</p>
               <p>"Well, we will see that thou dost; and meanwhile, we will have thee in safe
                  keeping."</p>
               <p>"On what grounds does your Excellency commit this maiden again to prison?"
                  demanded Mr. Harding.</p>
               <p>"Why ask so idle a question, Harding? It is but trifling with my patience!"</p>
               <p>"Not so! I supposed it was because you believed her to belong to the people called
                  Quakers."</p>
               <p>"Surely; and a sufficient reason too. We must look that no further mischief is
                  done by spreading abroad their baneful doctrines. We would save others, even
                  thyself, Harding, and thy fair daughter from the judgment that visited that bright
                  luminary of our Church and colony—Ichabod Mildman—all in consequence, as it is
                  believed, of his error in defending these heretics against the merited wrath of
                  Heaven."</p>
               <p>"You speak of Mr. Mildman, but your Excellency is mistaken. I could tell you that
                  would soon convince you that these people had naught to do with his sudden
                  withdrawal. Are there no other grounds of offense against the maiden?"</p>
               <p>"No other! Now I do indeed marvel at thy blindness. God grant that naught of evil
                  come to thee for this; but I trust we shall yet save thee as a brand from the
                  burning!"</p>
               <p>"But what if I should convince you that you are mistaken here too, and that the
                  maiden is held responsible for opinions she does not entertain?"</p>
               <p>"What mean you, Harding? If the girl is ready to renounce these vile opinions, and
                  be received into the bosom of our righteous congregation, God forbid we should
                  deny her the blessed privilege! How is it, wilt thou stand beneath the gallows and
                  declare thyself purged from the sin and disgrace of heresy?"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency does not understand. I have never held the opinions you denounce
                  as heretical."</p>
               <p>"What does the girl mean? As I live, if she dares brave us as she once did, she
                  shall not escape, as we then mercifully permitted her to do!"</p>
               <p>"I would simply explain that my parents were formerly connected with the Church of
                  England, and that my mother continued in that belief and communion as long as she
                  lived. My father held other views, it is true, but they were such as he considered
                  consistent with his duty to God and man. My faith in the religion of my youth is
                  unchanged and ever has been!"</p>
               <p>"Why then hast thou falsely appeared to hold those other pernicious doctrines? and
                  wherefore hast thou obstinately withheld the knowledge of this from those who
                  wished thee well?"</p>
               <p>"It was to avoid a forcible separation from my only remaining parent, and if I
                  have, in doing so, appeared in a false light, it was owing to the severity of
                  those laws which drove me to the measure."</p>
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6366-00000156"/>
               <p>"How dare thou condemn the righteous laws for a sin which thou must thyself
                  answer. If thou hast declared thyself to be what thou wast not, nothing else shall
                  serve thee but to stand in the place of the guilty, even at the gallow's foot and
                  publicly proclaim thyself to be what thou art!"</p>
               <p>"It was for love of a sick and aged parent, and in the desire of performing a
                  daughter's duty to him, that I pursued the course I did. It was that I might have
                  the right to soothe his declining days, and render him the devotion which a child
                  should ever yield to a parent. Thou, who art thyself a father, can scarcely blame
                  me for this, and if I sinned therein, I pray my Heavenly Parent to forgive
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless thou art to be condemned, for when thy father gave his soul over to
                  the enemy, he forfeited the claims of nature and affection."</p>
               <p>"Nay, the enemy never had a victory over his righteous soul! In all things, so far
                  as man may, my father obeyed the commands of our blessed Lord, and especially in
                  those things which call for true Christian charity. He loved his enemies, did good
                  to them who hated him, and prayed for them who despitefully used him and
                  persecuted him!"</p>
               <p>"On my soul this is a bold girl! She hath the Quaker's daring, if not his
                  doctrine. We, who in the spirit of true charity and patience labored with this
                  man, and for the good of his soul strove to lead him from his errors, she calls
                  his enemies and persecutors! What now, saucy wench; how dare thou speak to us in
                  this manner?"</p>
               <p>"I meant not to speak in disrespect, but as a daughter may, who would vindicate
                  the character of a departed parent. If aught in my language seemed unbecoming in a
                  maiden like me, to one in authority, I pray you to consider that such was not my
                  meaning."</p>
               <p>"This is more as it should be! nevertheless thou needest for thy good, a taste of
                  rigor. It will serve to take some of thy high-spirited pride out of thee. We will
                  see that the wholesome potion be administered!"</p>
               <p>"Beware what you do," exclaimed Mr. Harding. "You lay your hands now on what may
                  sear you in the handling. This girl is connected with a Church of which we have
                  many quiet and useful members in our community!"</p>
               <p>"She is the Quaker's daughter, for all that, and it is scarcely better that she
                  belongs to that Babylonish Church, with which she declares fellowship. Leave the
                  girl with me, Harding, and come to-morrow to the Council. It will not hurt her to
                  spend one night in custody, and to-morrow we will decide what is best to be done
                  in her matter. Nay—say no more, she deserves this for the contempt she has shown
                  us tonight."</p>
               <p>"If you are really determined to send her to prison, you shall send us thither in
                  company, for I declare that<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6366-00000157"/> if
                     <emph>she</emph> has been guilty of contempt (which she disclaims), I have been
                  equally culpable; for in naught that she has said, have I discovered any thing to
                  condemn, or that I do not entirely coincide in! And further than that ye must look
                  for other counsel than mine to assist in your deliberations, for I find the care
                  of State pressing too heavily upon me, and it is my purpose to withdraw from them
                  entirely!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Harding, what dost thou mean? Nay, this will never do, brother; thou must
                  not hold such a thought! These troublous times call for our wisest action, and the
                  zeal of some should be tempered by milder policy—such as thine. No, no, thou must
                  not desert us; we can not, and we will not dispense with the weight of thy
                  wisdom!"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency is too kind, but these are indeed perilous times and call for
                  judicious action. There are differences among us too, and it should not be
                  so."</p>
               <p>"Thou sayest true, brother. I have been lately harassed by complaints of
                  dissatisfied men, and but this day thought to summon thee to assist me with thy
                  advice. It may be, brother, that, as thou sayest, the 'cares of State' have lately
                  pressed upon <emph>me</emph> too heavily, and somewhat wearied my patience. If my
                  conduct toward thee to-night has seemed to indicate this, I beg thou wilt forget
                  it, and let us part in peace and brotherly kindness."</p>
               <p>"Willingly, willingly, indeed; but I can not go home to-night except on one
                  condition, and I am sure your Excellency would not oblige me to leave my daughter
                  without a father's protection, even for so brief a season!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my pretty Mistress Alice, how fares it with her? Nay, I must not so distress
                  my favorite as to keep you from her too long. Well, name your condition, brother,
                  and get you home, for it grows late for quiet and orderly men to be abroad."</p>
               <p>"I promised Alice not to come without her little friend here, and ventured to
                  assure her that she would be free to accompany me. But, notwithstanding that, if
                  your Excellency deem it best, I will willingly spend the night with our good
                  Joseph here, and only for the loss of a few hours' quiet slumber, feel myself none
                  the worse for the company I have been keeping."</p>
               <p>"If thou shouldst lose thy sleep, I fear thou wouldst bring less wisdom to our
                  councils to-morrow. Therefore we would recommend thee to go home, and for my
                  pretty Alice's sake take this brave maiden with thee, if thou wilt."</p>
               <p>"I thank your Excellency much, and so will Alice, I am sure; and you may hold me
                  responsible for the good conduct of our young friend here as long as she remains
                  among us."</p>
               <p>"And I, too, thank you from my heart," said Edith, "and beg you to be assured that
                  I had no intention of disrespect in aught I have said to-night. And if a<pb
                     n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6366-00000158"/> daughter's zeal has led me into saying
                  what might appear as such, I pray you to excuse it."</p>
               <p>"Well, maiden, though methinks I see somewhat of the Quaker in thy free speaking,
                  I rejoice to learn that thou art free from the errors of their doctrine. I wish
                  thee well, and would say that the sentence of banishment, which as a measure of
                  safety to ourselves and our children, we have thought wise to enact against them,
                  can not now of course include thee. Thou art, therefore, free to come and go where
                  thou wilt, and God's favor go with thee, even to the further enlightening of thy
                  understanding, until thou art brought, as I trust thou may'st be, within the fold
                  of His own chosen congregation."</p>
               <p>Edith briefly thanked the Governor in such terms as she deemed appropriate, and
                  was soon on her way back to Mr. Harding's with a lighter heart than she carried
                  thence. As they passed through the ante-room in which the jailor and the other
                  dignitary were waiting, the latter cast upon her a stare of surprise and
                  disappointment: perhaps he felt dissatisfied at being cheated of his prey But
                  honest Joe came forward with a double scrape, and offered his homely but sincere
                  congratulations.</p>
               <p>"I'm wery uncommon glad, missus, that I hain't got to turn key on you again; not
                  that I object to the company, understand, but bekase it weighs heavy on my heart
                  to see creeturs of your tender sect in sich a harryin' situation!"</p>
               <p>"I thank thee much, good Joseph," answered Edith, with a pleasant smile; "and if
                  it should ever be my lot again to be confined in prison, I will only ask to have
                  as kind a person as thou art for my keeper."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">LETTER TO MRS. HERMON.</head>
               <q>
                  <p>"FROM one who wishes well to you and yours, come these lines. Dear lady,
                     forgive a second intrusion, which only the deepest interest, and the most
                     earnest desire to serve you, can excuse. You have been warned, heretofore, of a
                     danger by which your family peace was menaced; alas! that danger has not passed
                     by, but daily grows more imminent. It will soon come to your ears that she you
                     wot of stands no longer in fear of the laws which have hitherto restrained her.
                     And why? Because in the depth of her designing mind she has revolved a plan
                     whereby to evade them, and to remove from her path the obstacles which stood
                     between her and one she is resolved to win. She has abjured the religion of her
                     father, and declared herself to be in communion with a Church to which she
                     knows he is warmly attached! Further than this, she has at length prevailed
                     upon her friends—I should say her dupes—whose influence with the Governor is
                     great, to remove the sentence of banishment under which she lay, and to grant
                     her free permission to remain in Boston ton. Nevertheless, she will continue
                     her pretended preparations to depart, as a lure to secure her object.</p>
                  <p>"I have informed you of this, in order to place you once more upon your guard;
                     and if a mother's tears and prayers are unavailing to save your son from such a
                     fate, a mother's command is no more than the urgency of the case will justify,
                     nay, than it demands.</p>
                  <p>"May Heaven avert from you this great calamity, and let not your kind bosom be
                     stung by the serpent you have warmed!"</p>
               </q>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon's feelings, upon reading this communication, may readily be imagined.
                  If this were true, what further proof could she require of this artful girl's
                  designs? That her son should fix his affections upon a Quaker girl was
                  sufficiently unfortunate, but how greatly preferable that he should love and even
                  wed such a maiden as she once believed Edith to be, than this false and designing
                  creature who now spread her toils to entrap him!</p>
               <p>However, she still had the comfort of his promise, which she was sure he would
                  never violate; and she resolved that if matters should grow as stringent as they
                  appeared to threaten, to interpose her positive command to prevent so fatal an
                  issue.</p>
               <p>She also hoped that motives which were so palpable would entirely disgust Louis
                  with the object of his present admiration, for she knew there was no point<pb
                     n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6366-00000160"/> upon which he was more sensitive than
                  that of womanly delicacy.</p>
               <p>However, when he came in to dinner she saw with pain that something had occurred
                  to give him unusual pleasure, for his countenance betrayed an internal
                  satisfaction to which it had of late been a stranger. She thought it best not to
                  appear to notice his sudden increase of spirits.</p>
               <p>Not so Angeline, who having missed and deplored the loss of her brother's former
                  playfulness, was delighted to see this first promise of returning enjoyment.</p>
               <p>"Brother," she cried, "what has put you in so fine an humor? I begin to think of
                  coaxing you into an old-fashioned romp after dinner; for my head really aches for
                  want of a little fun!"</p>
               <p>"Why, Angeline, have I been so morose that you did not dare to challenge me to a
                  romp before?"</p>
               <p>"No, not morose; but you looked so solemn, and seemed to be thinking of something
                  so serious that I did not think you wanted to play with me."</p>
               <p>"I did not know I was so inconsiderate of your enjoyment. But I give you leave to
                  challenge me to any kind of a game you may wish to engage in hereafter. I will not
                  promise always to accept your guage, but I would strain a point sometimes for your
                  pleasure."</p>
               <p>"Thank you very much, dear brother. I will remember your promise, perhaps better
                  than you will fancy."</p>
               <p>"You doubt my sincerity, do you? Well, to give you a proof of it, I hereby tender
                  a challenge to you, and demand satisfaction in the shape of a game of 'puss in the
                  corner,' after dinner."</p>
               <p>"I'll let you off from a game to-day—thank you, partly because I don't think it
                  would suit my poor head, and partly because I would rather hear what has happened
                  to please you so much this morning!"</p>
               <p>Her brother's face flushed at this, and looking up from his plate, he caught
                  Henriette's eye fixed upon him with a scrutiny he would gladly have avoided. It
                  served, however, immediately to restore his self-possession, and although he did
                  not desire to speak at this moment on a subject so nearly interesting his
                  feelings, he could not now avoid it without suspicion.</p>
               <p>"Why, Angeline, I heard something this morning which will please you as much as it
                  has myself. It concerns Edith, in whom you seem to feel so kind an interest."</p>
               <p>Angeline dropped her knife and fork, and sat eagerly waiting for him to go on.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am glad indeed if you have any thing good to tell that has befallen her,
                  for it has always been the other way with poor dear Edith!"</p>
               <p>"The Governor has removed the sentence of banishment he pronounced upon her while
                  her father lived, and she is as free as any of us to go or stay where she
                  will."</p>
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6366-00000161"/>
               <p>"And can we go to visit her now, and can she come to see us without—without it
                  being wrong, at least I mean, without any body blaming us for it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—that is, without any fear of the consequences."</p>
               <p>"Pray, cousin," asked Henriette, "how is it? Have the Quakers obtained the King's
                  mercy, as I hear they have been striving to do?"</p>
               <p>"No, Henriette, not that I know of; but Edith is not a Quaker."</p>
               <p>"Not a Quaker!" cried Angeline, with joy unfeigned.</p>
               <p>"Not a Quaker!" echoed Henriette, in an incredulous tone.</p>
               <p>To the great surprise of Louis, his mother said nothing; nor did her countenance
                  express either astonishment or pleasure; but instead of either, it wore a look of
                  extreme pain and annoyance.</p>
               <p>"Alas," she thought, "my unknown friend was right indeed. This too certainly
                  confirms my worst suspicions!"</p>
               <p>"Mother, you certainly did not know of this, and yet you do not seem at all
                  surprised at what has astonished us so greatly!"</p>
               <p>"I heard it only this morning," Mrs. Hermon replied, coldly.</p>
               <p>"But are you not delighted, mamma? Just to think of it; we may have Edith with us
                  now, and see as much of her as we wish; and I will learn to sing her sweet songs,
                  although they are sad, and do make one feel mournful sometimes; and I will ask her
                  to teach me to draw, which I know she will do, and so many things! Oh, it will be
                  delightful!"</p>
               <p>But Angeline checked herself, for she saw her mother did not look as if she
                  thought it <emph>would</emph> be delightful, or in the least pleasant.</p>
               <p>"I am glad, my dear, if Edith's views of religion are <emph>really</emph> changed,
                  even though the change be so sudden as to surprise us somewhat."</p>
               <p>"And these straight-faced Presbyterians have obtained a great victory, I suppose
                  they consider! But pray is Edith willing to stand underneath the gallows and
                  abjure her father's heresies, or has she already done so, and united herself with
                  the Established Church of the colonies?"</p>
               <p>"She is not united to the Presbyterian Chuch, nor does she profess communion
                  therewith."</p>
               <p>"Oh, then, I suppose she has no religion at all, but is ready to be made a convert
                  of. Perhaps she might be induced to unite herself with the 'only true Church.'
                  Would it not be worth the trying?"</p>
               <p>"I doubt very much, Henriette, that <emph>you</emph> would be able to convert
                  Edith to <emph>your</emph> religion," replied Louis, rather too quickly.
                  "However," he added, "we may save ourselves further discussion on this subject, as
                  she is already a member of the Church of England!"</p>
               <p>Angeline opened her large eyes wider than ever,<pb n="322-323"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000162"/> and Mrs. Hermon's annoyance increased visibly,
                  while Henriette laughed dryly, and remarked:</p>
               <p>"Oh, then, there is nothing strange about it, after all! It is only what I have
                  been long expecting. Edith is a convert of the heart, and not of the head,
                  doubtless!"</p>
               <p>"She is not a <emph>convert</emph> either way," answered Louis, quietly. "It is
                  the religion in which she was born and nurtured, and her mother died in its
                  communion."</p>
               <p>"Pray, then, what was her object in concealing it so long?"</p>
               <p>"It was on her father's account, no doubt, that she did so."</p>
               <p>"I should ask, rather," remarked Mrs. Hermon, "what is now her object in revealing
                  it?" and she fixed a penetrating glance upon her son.</p>
               <p>"I understand that such was not her intention, but that being arrested last
                  evening, and remanded to prison for not sooner leaving the jurisdiction, she was
                  obliged, on her own account as well as Mr. Harding's, to do so."</p>
               <p>"But, methinks it was scarcely acting fairly and openly by her friends to keep
                  them so long in ignorance of her real opinions, meanwhile subjecting them (as I
                  learn their kindness to her has) to coldness and suspicion, if not to the
                  penalties of justice."</p>
               <p>"You mean of 'law,' my dear mother. You can not have changed your opinion on
                     <emph>this</emph> point also," retorted Louis, stung by the sarcasms that were
                  heaped upon him. "And <emph>you,</emph> whose ideas of filial duty are so
                  extraordinary, can not blame this girl for subjecting herself to suspicion, and
                  even to persecution, rather than do what seemed a violence to her father's
                  memory!"</p>
               <p>"I did not know that her father's reputation stood so high in the community that
                  it would be injured by the knowledge of his daughter being Episcopalian. Now, for
                  my part, I should rather suppose that to be something in his favor," said
                  Henriette.</p>
               <p>"The world's opinion makes little difference in such a case. If others have
                  misunderstood or misconstrued the character of a departed parent, it becomes a
                  child to guard his memory with increased reverence. By avowing religious
                  sentiments different from those which he was condemned for holding, his daughter
                  doubtless felt that by some she too might be considered as ranking herself among
                  his judges."</p>
               <p>"And so it was the world's opinion, after all, that kept her silent!"</p>
               <p>"Not so, but the high regard she had for his memory, and the delicate care she
                  took that nothing on her part should seem to imply censure of his opinions, which,
                  governing his conduct as they did, made his life and example those of a true
                  Christian."</p>
               <p>"Well, cousin, we are likely to have a romance out of this Quaker's daughter yet,
                  I see! Only it is a pity, to make it more complete, that you had not been a
                     Roman<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6366-00000163"/> man Catholic, for you have
                  already appeared as her physician, and your zealous defense of her certainly
                  entitles you to be considered her lawyer, and since this remarkable girl can be
                  any thing the occasion calls for, we should in the other case have seen her going
                  over to papacy, when, in all probability, she would have chosen you as her
                  confessor. I presume the closing act of the drama is yet to come, when you will
                  merge these three characters into one which I need not name, as it already begins
                  to develop itself but too plainly." And Henriette pushed her chair back from the
                  table and left the room.</p>
               <p>A constraint fell upon the rest of the party, and the dinner was concluded in
                  silence. Louis was convinced now that his mother's mind was filled with prejudice
                  and suspicion, and resolved to make one more effort to ascertain the source whence
                  her impressions were derived. And Angeline was so puzzled for a reason why her
                  mother and Henriette, but especially the former, did not sympathize in so great a
                  cause of rejoicing, that it set her little head to aching violently, and feeling
                  that perhaps her company was the cause of the restraint upon her mother and
                  brother, and that they could not talk together as freely as if she were not by,
                  she quietly glided from the room and resorted to her birds and her books for
                  amusement. But the birds seemed so gay and happy and unsympathizing, and beside
                  this, their singing wearied her as it had never done before; and as to reading,
                  her mind wandered so from the subject before her, that she did not retain a single
                  word of all those over which she had been poring, and she gave it up with a sigh,
                  and went to her box of treasures (what child is there who has not such a
                  deposit?), and taking out each article, she inspected them one by one, and laid
                  them in again in better order, and fitting more neatly together, than before. Here
                  was a tiny pair of moccasins that Maretah had made, and here a withered rose,
                  whose perfume was perceptible through all the contents of the box; this came from
                  Edith; and here a neatly-made needle-book from the same kind hand.</p>
               <p>She lingered over her friend's gifts with affectionate looks, and dropped a tear
                  on the sketch which had attracted her mother's attention. But after awhile even
                  this failed to give her pleasure, and she wandered from room to room, feeling as
                  she had never felt before, and wondering why she was not as happy as usual. At
                  last the forlorn child threw herself upon her bed, and was soon wrapped in a deep
                  and heavy sleep from which she did not awaken until the chamber was darkened by
                  the shadows of twilight, and the tea-bell announced the evening meal. At first she
                  thought it was the morning hour, and noticing that she still had on her clothes,
                  wondered if she had lain so all night, and forgotten to prepare for bed; but
                  slowly and dimly the reality came back to her mind and she attempted<pb
                     n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6366-00000164"/> tempted to rise, when her head became
                  so dizzy that she was obliged to lie down again and remain quiet.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Hermon and her son were left alone, Louis eagerly sought the explanation
                  which Mrs. Hermon would gladly have avoided. He was determined to know, if
                  possible, the secret of his mother's prejudice, and to dispel the mystery by which
                  her conduct was enveloped.</p>
               <p>"Mother," he said, "I thought the news I brought home to-day would have given you
                  pleasure!"</p>
               <p>"You mean the account of the Quaker girl's conversion!"</p>
               <p>"I mean the discovery of her real religious opinions. Mother, I have ever
                  respected and reverenced your judgment—have I not?"</p>
               <p>"Surely, my son. I never knew you dispute it until now."</p>
               <p>"It is not your <emph>judgment</emph> I call in question now. But I do believe,
                  mother, that in this case you are acting in contradiction to your usual course.
                  You are permitting yourself to be influenced by something apart from your own
                  judgment or observation. Will you not tell me what that something is?"</p>
               <p>"Louis, you ask too much of me. You ask that which I can not comply with; I do not
                  feel it best for your own sake. Nor would it make any difference with you, since
                  you can suspect me of being unfairly influenced."</p>
               <p>"Is it too much to ask an explanation of your conduct when my happiness is at
                  stake? Why will you not be candid with me, mother? Do I conceal any thing, even my
                  most secret thoughts, from you, and who but you taught me a principle (and I thank
                  you for it from my very soul) by which I shall ever strive to guide my
                  conduct—that of frankness? How often have you told me that it is a bad cause only
                  which fears investigation!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon felt the inclination to be plain and open—she almost resolved to be
                  so—and then she thought, "If I tell him, if I show him these letters, it will put
                  an end to it all, and as soon as he discovers that I have been influenced by these
                  anonymous communications, he will never have the same confidence in me again. By
                  doing so, I should lose what I shall never be able to regain!"</p>
               <p>"You hesitate, mother, and now I am sure you are going to be candid with me—to be
                  yourself once more!"</p>
               <p>But she was not.</p>
               <p>"I will be candid with you thus far. I <emph>have</emph> means of knowing her
                  character which you can not have, and I ask you to trust me—to believe in my
                  disinterested motives. It is to secure your happiness that I watch and pray. Is
                  this enough to satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>"No, mother! I believe in your sincerity and in your affection, as I do in the
                  words of that sacred<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6366-00000165"/> volume, but you
                  must not expect me to be satisfied as long as you practice a mystery; no good ever
                  came of concealments. Tell me the grounds of your suspicions, and if you have seen
                  aught to justify them, let me see it too. Only give me the proofs, and I promise
                  you to look at them with an impartial eye. If you can show me good reason to doubt
                  this girl's purity of mind and motive, I will yield; yes, even if it should
                  destroy my confidence in all that seems good and upright!"</p>
               <p>"Give me time to do this, my son; only give me time, and if I do not show you
                  them, then <emph>I</emph> yield, and promise to oppose your wishes no longer!"</p>
               <p>"But time presses! In a little while she will be gone forever, for although her
                  sentence of banishment is removed, she still holds her purpose."</p>
               <p>"I suspect her purpose is such as may be easily shaken!"</p>
               <p>"Now you are ungenerous! You have me in your power, and I am without means to meet
                  you in such a contest. But you say, 'Give me time'—time for what? To examine into
                  her character impartially? That I will do joyfully—so that you will consent to
                  look with your own eyes and see with your own unprejudiced vision. The objection
                  you once urged against bringing her here is now removed; will you not reconsider
                  my proposition to do so?"</p>
               <p>"It is not always by watching that we can detect the true character under a
                  disguise. It is possible to guard the conduct so closely as to defy human skill to
                  read the motives that lurk beneath it."</p>
               <p>"And did you ever <emph>see</emph> any thing in her to weaken your confidence?
                  Have you ever detected a shade of deceit—a selfish or corrupt thought? Surely you
                  had the opportunity, if such existed."</p>
               <p>"I did not. When she left this house, I believed her all that a pure and
                  high-minded maiden should be. It is since that time I have changed my
                  opinion."</p>
               <p>"And not from observation, for you have never so much as seen her since. It must
                  must be then through another. Can it be the work of that smooth-faced minister? I
                  never liked his over-righteous way!"</p>
               <p>"No; he was gone before. Louis, I will not be forced into telling you what my
                  judgment pronounces unwise. I asked you to trust me: have you so little confidence
                  left in me that you can not?"</p>
               <p>"But, mother, as I told you before—I <emph>can not</emph> be satisfied—it is
                  impossible as long as you deny me all just means of satisfaction. When I was a
                  boy—a child—your word was enough for me—I never asked your reasons. But it is
                  different now. Is it possible that—but no—I do you injustice in the thought!"</p>
               <p>"Of what—Louis?"</p>
               <p>"That Henriette has a hand in it. Her sarcasms are too visibly ill-natured to
                  affect you."</p>
               <p>"We all know poor Henriette too well for that.<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000166"/> What an unfortunate temper that girl has! I
                  sometimes fear it will involve her in serious trouble!"</p>
               <p>"Mother, I have one word more to say to you. I have used every argument that an
                  affectionate son can use to persuade you to deal with me in this matter fairly and
                  openly, but as yet I have failed to move you. You have my happiness in your hands.
                  It rests with you to destroy the dearest hopes of my existence, making life no
                  more than a routine of duty—and perhaps you have it also in your power to make it
                  happier than I ever before knew this life could be!</p>
               <p>"I am as yet ignorant of Edith's feelings toward me—it may be she would reject my
                  suit—or it may be that by the use of fair means you might convince me of her
                  unworthiness: in either of these cases, though I should suffer something—yes, much
                  of regret and disappointment, I should not give myself up to unavailing grief or
                  despondency, but try to bear my lot with patience, hoping for some amends from the
                  future. But mother, if I yield to you blindly in this matter, as you require,
                  though I should still strive to perform my duty for your sake, and guard your
                  peace of mind from every shock—yet I will not deny that it would be to relinquish
                  the best part of life in this world, and to look for nothing further than the
                  satisfaction that springs from a good and pure conscience. This is the last appeal
                  I shall ever make to you on the subject; but beware, mother, beware lest you
                  hesitate too long—lest you in thus doing lose the opportunity of being just to
                  her, and for an unfounded prejudice throw away your son's happiness, in this
                  world, forever!"</p>
               <p>And how many mothers have thrown away their children's happiness on as slight a
                  cause—have used their influence, too often secretly, to bring about a state of
                  things they afterward vainly wished to remedy! How many from opposition only have
                  thwarted the dearest wishes of the heart, and sowed the seeds of bitterness and
                  pain where joy and harmony would have entwined. And some have done it in the worse
                  than idle hope, born of ambition, of something higher and better in store for
                  their dear ones than <emph>mere</emph> affection! These parents (stranger still!)
                  are often the very ones who "married for love"—perhaps setting aside the authority
                  that would have restrained <emph>them.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>What mother with her little ones around her knee does not dream of the time coming
                  when the "wolf, Love," shall prowl around her dear domain, seeking to devour her
                  lambs, as it did herself and their "Grandam" before her? But what parent ever
                  watched as <emph>she</emph> will watch for the enemy, and so guard her flock, that
                  only with her consent shall her "little Red-riding-hood" bid him enter, or be
                  attracted by<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6366-00000167"/> his wiles! It is true that
                  in her own young days he "ate <emph>her</emph> all up" before her watchful mother,
                  or even herself, suspected his design, or so much as knew him under his disguise.
                  But what of that? Having seen him once and fallen a victim to his arts, he will
                  never be able to deceive her again! But lo! while she dreams thus, behold the
                  "wolf" already watching her pet lamb; and she, pretty unsuspecting innocent, bids
                  him "pull the string and the door will fly open!" And so the "wolf, Love," goes on
                  devouring little Red-riding-hoods to the end of time!</p>

               <p>"ANGELINE, Angeline! why, where can the child be? Henriette, have you seen your
                  cousin since dinner?"</p>
               <p>"I saw her asleep in your chamber, but that was more than an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"Ah, she is here still. What, my dear, sleeping at this time of day! Did you not
                  hear the tea-bell ringing?"—but Angeline did not seem to hear, and her mother laid
                  her hand upon hers to arouse her. As soon as she touched the child, she felt that
                  she was very much heated with fever, and it needed only a look to assure her that
                  Angeline was ill.</p>
               <p>They used every means to avert an illness, but in vain, and in a few days she was
                  so sick that life hung in a trembling balance. Much of the time she slept in that
                  deep unnatural state when the spirit seems to wander so far from its frail house
                  that we tremble lest the door of human life should close against it forever.</p>
               <p>With anxious hearts the mother and brother watched<pb n="334-335"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000168"/> by her bed of pain, and prayed God to spare to them
                  the dear child around whom seemed to center the brightness of their home.</p>
               <p>Sometimes she opened her blue eyes, dry and glazed and languid, and smiled upon
                  them lovingly, or thanked them in a faint voice for their kindness.</p>
               <p>Her mother seldom left her, except when she was obliged to steal away, to relieve
                  her o'erburdened heart, in secret tears and prayers for the young life so dear to
                  her; and Louis, with untiring devotion, bent every thought and effort to subdue
                  his sister's pain. Even Henriette, whose keen restless eyes were scarcely ever
                  moistened by the gentle dew of sympathizing tears, sometimes came quietly into the
                  chamber, and after gazing awhile on the changed face of her little cousin, turned
                  away with a sigh, and stepped cautiously lest she should disturb her rest.</p>
               <p>One night Louis persuaded his mother to retire and try to obtain some sleep, while
                  he kept anxious watch by his sister's bedside. As he bent over, she opened her
                  faded eyes, and looking up into his face with a smile, smoothed the hair from his
                  forehead with her feverish hands.</p>
               <p>"How very kind in you, dear brother, to sit beside me so, all through the long
                  night!"</p>
               <p>"Never mind, darling; I shall make you do something for me in return, as soon as
                  you are well."</p>
               <p>"As soon as I am well!" echoed the child, sadly, and with a mournful glance that
                  sent a shock of pain through his heart. "Oh, brother!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear—which I hope will be soon. Do you not feel a little—a very little
                  better to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I am; but my head aches badly."</p>
               <p>"I will bathe it with this cool water, and that will refresh you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it feels so pleasant. But, brother, I have something I want to ask you!"</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"Dear Louis, what <emph>has</emph> Edith done to displease mamma so much?"</p>
               <p>"I do not think she has done any thing intentionally, Angie. Perhaps mamma is
                  mistaken, and will change her mind when she knows her better."</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>so</emph> glad to hear you say so; for I do want to see her very much.
                  Do you think, brother, mamma will let her come to see me once, just once
                  before—before I die?" She said these last words in a very low and tremulous
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Don't talk so, darling! You are not so ill as that. I trust you will soon be well
                  enough to romp with me again; and to see Edith a great many times, and enjoy her
                  friendship without fear or interruption. But you must not talk any more now; for
                  that will excite you and make your head worse, you know."</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>must</emph> tell you, Louis, because I can not tell mamma; and
                  something makes me feel as if I should<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6366-00000169"/>
                  never have another opportunity of talking to <emph>you.</emph> I dreamed that I
                  was going away, far away, never to come back here again; and that angels were sent
                  to bring me with them; but I did not want to go. Then they persuaded me, and told
                  me what a beautiful world they lived in; and that dear papa was expecting me, and
                  had been waiting for me a long time. I told them I could not leave you and mamma;
                  that mamma had no daughter but me to comfort her; and what do you think they said,
                  brother? They said <emph>Edith</emph> would comfort her, and be a daughter to her
                  instead of me; and that she would love you too, and make both you and mamma happy.
                  And when I heard that I was content to go; only I asked them to let me come and
                  tell Edith what they said, and they consented. And so it seemed to me that that
                  was just what I was awake for now, if I only <emph>could</emph> see her,
                  brother!"</p>
               <p>Louis had some difficulty in mastering his emotion; but as soon as he had done so,
                  he said cheerfully:</p>
               <p>"Why, Angie, dear, don't you see you have only been dreaming? However, go to sleep
                  now, and I will ask mamma to-morrow; and I am sure she will not object to Edith
                  coming to see you, or to any thing else you would fancy. So if there is any thing
                  you want, just let me know and you shall have it; for mamma would feel badly if
                  she thought you hesitated to ask her!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, darling brother; you are always kind. But if it should happen
                  that—that I never <emph>should</emph> see Edith again, will you tell this dream to
                  her for me?"</p>
               <p>"I will; at least, I will tell mamma, and get her to do it; or see that it is
                  done, at all events. So rest now, dear; I can not permit you to say another
                  word!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you can; for you told me to speak if I wanted any thing, and I do. I want to
                  tell you how much good your promise has done me; and now sing to me, brother. Sing
                  that little hymn about heaven, that you and she used to sing together!"</p>
               <p>Louis complied, subduing his voice so that it could scarcely be heard beyond the
                  walls of the chamber, and sometimes forced to pause and compose his feelings. <q>

               </p>
               <p>When he ceased, the child once more opened her eyes and smiled, after which she
                  fell into an uneasy sleep, and as Louis bent over her, he breathed a silent prayer
                  that his gentle sister should not leave them thus. "Heaven spare this lovely one
                  to live and twine about our hearts full long! Oh, God, take not the brightness of
                  her presence from our home!"</p>
               <p>By morning her disease had taken the turn they dreaded. Her mind was darkened, and
                  she spoke only as one unconscious of what was passing around her. Frequently she
                  called upon Edith, and besought her mother to let her see her once more before she
                  died. Mrs. Hermon now remembered with pain how she had rebuked her little daughter
                  for so warmly espousing Edith's cause, and sent immediately to the Quaker's
                  daughter, begging her to come without delay.</p>
               <p>Edith was not long in complying with the request, although it had not escaped her
                  that of late Mrs. Hermon did not seem to sympathize, as she once did, either in
                  her joy or sorrow, and if her greeting was not as cordial and affectionate as her
                  once motherly tenderness might warrant Edith in expecting, she passed it by,
                  thinking this neither the time nor occasion when she should appear to notice
                  it.</p>
               <p>No sooner was the sound of Edith's low voice heard in her apartment, than it
                  attracted Angeline's attention, and she turned her face toward the direction
                  whence it came, and listened for it to be repeated.</p>
               <p>"Speak to her, Edith. It is possible she may recognize you."</p>
               <p>Edith did as she was requested, and the little one replied, "Yes, yes, I know you.
                  How kind of you to come. But I can not go away with you, because mamma is not
                  willing."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to take thee away, dear child, but I will sit here beside thee, if
                  thou desirest it, and hold thy hand, so, in mine own."</p>
               <p>"Oh do!—that is, if mamma is willing; but does she not tell you to go away and
                  leave me?"</p>
               <p>"No, Angeline. She sent for me to come, and wishes me to stay as long as it
                  pleases thee, and so I will."</p>
               <p>"Dear mamma! And will you go with me to Heaven too? But no, you are to stay and
                  comfort them here! Look; do you see these angels? Are they not kind to come from
                  Heaven to watch a little girl like me?—<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6366-00000171"/>
                  <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                     </lg>
                  </q> Sing it to me; for I am so weary!"</p>
               <p>Edith sang, and soon the child slept again, holding tightly to her hand, so that
                  she scarcely dared move for fear of disturbing her, and Mrs. Hermon turned away
                  her face and wept.</p>
               <p>For several days Angeline continued in this alarming condition, and the mother,
                  already wearied with grief and anxiety, yielded her post of watcher by the
                  bedside, for the most part, to Edith. Maretah was there, too; for she considered
                  it her especial charge to watch over her pale sister, and when she was summoned
                  thither, the Indian girl would not permit her to depart alone, and now she proved
                  again a very valuable assistant. Often when Edith went to take needful rest, and
                  the nearly exhausted mother, throwing herself down by the side of her darling,
                  forgot her anxiety in sleep, Maretah, never weary, supplied their vacant place.
                  Her dark eyes were ever on the alert. Her usual seat was on the floor by the foot
                  of the bed, where she watched the countenance of each one in attendance, seeming
                  to anticipate their wishes, and by her keen perception and rapid though noiseless
                  movements, saved them many a weary step, and greatly lightened the burden of their
                  anxious vigils.</p>
               <p>One day when Edith sat there alone, the child suddenly fixed her eyes upon her
                  with less of vacancy than usual, and seeming to struggle with consciousness, she
                  said, reproachfully, "Oh, Edith, what wrong is it you have done?"</p>
               <p>Her tone was so natural that Edith was almost deceived into thinking she spoke
                  rationally.</p>
               <p>"What wrong? Many wrong things, I fear, my child!" she answered, rather
                  reflectively than in reply to the question.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, not many. But I did not think you would offend mamma; because she used to
                  love you so, and she does not now. No; and it must have been something very bad, I
                  am sure!"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, my dear. But it was nothing intentional, at least!"</p>
               <p>"Then tell mamma you are sorry; oh do! and we shall all be happy once more; for
                  brother loves you, and so do I—but Henriette, ah, poor Henriette!" and she shook
                  her head sadly.</p>
               <p>She seemed to become excited; and thinking to soothe her, Edith commenced
                  murmuring in a low voice one of her favorite songs.</p>
               <p>"They are the angels coming back! hark; do you not hear them? <emph>They</emph>
                  love us always, even when we are wrong; they are so good and beautiful. But you,
                  Edith, it was not kind of you, indeed!" Thus she continued until she fell asleep
                  again, and Edith would not have given a thought to what she said, except that
                  having noticed Mrs. Hermon's coldness, she suspected<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000172"/> that Angeline's remarks were not entirely owing to
                  the visions of a disordered mind.</p>
               <p>"How selfish and wrong I am to give it any attention. It shall not disturb me
                  again, for I will banish it from my mind altogether!"</p>
               <p>But for all that, it kept intruding again, and again, paining her sensitive
                  nature. "What wrong have you done?" and "brother loves you!"</p>
               <p>"Alas! what <emph>have</emph> I done?—'Brother loves you!' Is this the secret of
                  it all? Why did I ever come here to bring nothing but sorrow? But I will go! yes,
                  I will soon go where they shall never hear of me again, and then he will
                  forget—and I!"</p>
               <p>What of thee, poor patient sufferer? Thou wilt hide thy secret in thy own wounded
                  heart, and pursue thy weary pilgrimage as many an one hath done, bearing an arrow
                  in thy bleeding bosom!</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Hermon returned to the room, she found Edith's head pillowed near her
                  own darling's, their hands clasped in each other's, and both sleeping quietly. But
                  on the faces of one were traces of tears, and a sigh occasionally struggled from
                  her seemingly troubled breast. Again she was struck with a resemblance between
                  that sad face and the sketch she had seen in the hands of Angeline; and the old
                  association recurred, which she had so long been unable to trace; connected as it
                  was with her younger days, it led her back far along the path of the checkered
                  past; and while she gazed, the spell seemed once again to bind her, and she longed
                  to take the motherless one to her heart, and say: "Grieve no more: here will I
                  cherish thee!"</p>
               <p>Touched by her affectionate devotion to her little one, Mrs. Hermon now began to
                  reflect upon her late treatment of the almost unfriended orphan with some
                  self-reproach. "Is it possible that I have all this time been doing her wrong,
                  blinded by a cruel prejudice, and that too through one who dares not make his
                  charges openly and in the light of day?" Then turning to the sweet faded flower
                  that lay withering before her, she started as the thought crossed her mind—"who
                  can tell but this is my punishment! Perhaps God has brought this upon me in
                  correction of my fault!" And in her turn she sought to banish the intrusive
                  thoughts from her mind, but vainly; and finally determined that if she had been
                  unjust, she would be so no longer. She would comply with her son's earnest wish,
                  and discern for herself the truth or the falsehood of these secret accusations.
                  With this resolution came a more comfortable state of mind than she had
                  experienced for a long time—in fact since she had first entertained these
                  suspicions. "It was wrong, I see now; but with God's help I will try to remedy the
                  error!"</p>
               <p>And where was Henriette all this time? She felt as one useless and forgotten. The
                  place that should be hers was usurped by another; and if she now came at<pb
                     n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6366-00000173"/> all into the sick room, it was when she
                  heard her cousin's footsteps there, and she came to watch him. She saw him cast
                  many a look of tender gratitude upon her whom she considered her rival, and heard
                  him often remonstrate against her too constant and earnest watchings; and she also
                  saw that her aunt's kind manner had returned. But closely as she eyed Edith's
                  pensive countenance, to detect one stray or accidental glance that would tell a
                  tale of tenderness toward him, or scrutinized her conduct for an unguarded act or
                  sign calculated to attract him—she failed. There was no secret in her eyes or
                  manner, but a sadness, or rather a prevailing quiet, undisturbed by passions such
                  as raged within her own unhappy heart. It was like the mist that broods over the
                  still autumnal landscape, softening the beauty which it does not hide.</p>
               <p>Had not Henriette been so absorbed by other feelings, she would have grieved over
                  the condition of her little cousin; for cold and unanswering as her nature was,
                  even <emph>she</emph> could not live in the same atmosphere with a child so gentle
                  and loving, and remain altogether untouched. It was not Angeline, pale and
                  wasted—perhaps dying—that she saw in that chamber. It was a rival beloved and
                  admired, stealing the hearts of all away from her; and with art too consummate for
                  detection, gradually accomplishing her victory.</p>
               <p>And if Edith's face were, so to speak, a mild and sad, though placid landscape,
                  Henriette's was a scene of wild and stormy tumult—of whirlwind rage, that tore and
                  scattered from its path each gentle feeling.</p>
               <p>But in that solemn chamber, where angels full of love and pity hovered, and human
                  hearts grew faint and still with fear, no eye saw the storm that raged in
                  Henriette's bosom, save the ever-watchful one of the faithful Indian girl.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>IT was the midnight hour, and throughout the house reigned a stillness such as
                  they only know who have watched by the bed-side of one who sleeps a sleep from
                  which he may never awaken. It was not the peaceful silence that wraps itself about
                  the home where loving hearts, folded in sweet dreams, repose. Nor was it the
                  peaceful quiet of the death hour, when grief itself is hushed in its intensity. It
                  was a silence that each trembled to break, for life fluttered fearfully within its
                  caged dwelling. Fond eyes kept vigil, holding back their very tears, and hearts
                  almost seemed to cease their beating, lest their motion should affright the
                  trembling soul, and send it soaring forever beyond the bound of its frail
                  prison-house.</p>
               <p>Thus, Mrs. Hermon and her son together watched the flickering spark of life that
                  lingered in the bosom of the sleeping child.</p>
               <p>Edith, yielding to their entreaties, had thrown herself upon her bed to obtain a
                  short repose. Exhausted by long watching, she scarcely touched the pillow when she
                  slept heavily. Maretah lay upon a low couch at her feet. It was the Indian girl's
                  habit always when she slept to hold her dagger in her hand, thus arming herself
                  against Magawan's avengers. The weapon now lay on the pillow beside her,
                  glittering in the moonlight that streamed through the open window. Her thoughts
                  were busy among the scenes of her past life. Again she trod the forest path, again
                  she chanted a welcome to the braves. Once more she was a child kneeling in her
                  father's wigwam at her Albert's feet, her hands crossed upon his knees, and her
                  eyes drinking in the language of his eloquent face before she had learned by words
                  to comprehend his meaning. Again she saw him bound to the fatal stake, and shrunk
                  affrighted from the sight of death. Then she was a fugitive, and the cry of her
                  pursuers on her path. And now she sees Magawan's eyes glaring on her with exulting
                  joy.</p>
               <p>But what shadow is that intercepting the moonlight, what figure steals noiselessly
                  across the room? Why comes it in that still midnight hour, and with the action of
                  an enemy? The figure bends over the pillow of the Indian girl, and seems to
                  listen—its breath steals serpent-like across her cheek. Yes, she sleeps!
                  Cautiously, and with a cat-like movement, it clutches at the dagger. Ah, this is
                  well. The golden opportunity is all its own!</p>
               <p>Who art thou, dark intruder on the dreams of innocence? What purpose moves thee to
                  come stealing<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6366-00000175"/> ing thus upon them? Is it
                  indeed to avenge the red man's blood that the same dagger that drank the purple
                  stream of <emph>his</emph> life, shall be dipped in that of her, the injured and
                  undisciplined one o'er whom thou now art bending?</p>
               <p>But no! the shadow lurks there only a moment, and then darkly moves to where the
                  orphan lies, happy in visions that exist for her, on earth, no longer; of a home
                  and dear affections.</p>
               <p>How canst thou slumber thus when the hand is raised to take thy young life from
                  thee? Will no protecting angel hovering near, warn thee of threatening danger, or
                  is this to be the end of all thy patient suffering, and has fate no rich reward in
                  store for one who has endured her buffetings so nobly? Alas, she still sleeps on,
                  and all unconscious, smiles at the delusions of her pleased fancy!</p>
               <p>But now the arm is raised to strike the deadly blow—it gathers its strength for
                  the action—the glittering point descends! A fearful shriek echoes through the
                  hushed dwelling. The sleeper starts from her dreams of peace and gazes around her
                  wildly.</p>
               <p>The sound was heard in the sick chamber, and the startled watchers looked on each
                  other in dismay. The child seemed to hear it too, for she moved uneasily, and
                  grasped her mother's hand with convulsive energy.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon sat still, pale and powerless, and motioning to her to remain quiet,
                  Louis arose, and following lowing the direction of the sound, was soon in Edith's
                  chamber. What was his surprise at the sight that greeted him! There stood the
                  Indian girl, holding Henriette in an iron grasp with one hand, while with the
                  other she raised her dagger in the air, pointed at his cousin's heart. His first
                  impulse was to rush forward and rescue Henriette from her hands.</p>
               <p>"Oh, save me! save me! She will murder me!" cried Henriette.</p>
               <p>"What means this scene?" he asked, first of Edith, who was incapable of answering
                  him, and then at his cousin, who began to speak rapidly and eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, cousin, I heard a noise, and thinking something was wrong, came in hither,
                  and to my great terror what should I see but this girl standing over Edith, who
                  was sleeping, with her dagger raised, ready to plunge it into her bosom. I sprang
                  forward, when she seized me, and would have murdered me if you had not come in at
                  that very moment!" and Henriette began to wring her hands and cry.</p>
               <p>"Liar!" was all Maretah deigned to say.</p>
               <p>Louis closed the door, to prevent the sounds from reaching his sister's chamber,
                  and, turning to Edith, desired her to explain.</p>
               <p>"I know nothing," she answered. "I was awakened by a shriek, and saw only what
                  thou also saw. But in justice to Maretah, I must say that I do not credit
                  Henriette's story!"</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6366-00000176"/>
               <p>Maretah answered this only by taking Edith's hand in hers, and pressing it to her
                  bosom, regarding her, the while, with looks of grateful pleasure.</p>
               <p>"And what has Maretah to say?" asked the young man. She looked for a signal from
                  Edith before replying, and then said:</p>
               <p>"Yon treacherous maiden stole in hither in the midnight silence. Why did she come.
                  Ask her! She thought Maretah slept; but the Indian never sleeps when danger lurks
                  near her sister's pillow! She listened for Maretah's breath, and it deceived her.
                  This" (raising the dagger) "was on my pillow. Had sleep bound me, only death could
                  have torn it from my hand! She seized it, and like the panther stealing on its
                  prey, she crept to my sister's bedside. Her hand was raised to strike, when, with
                  a spring, mine was upon her. Only for what the pale-face has told me, she would
                  now lie there in death! It was that held back my hand—and Maretah scorns a mean
                  revenge! She would not stain her hand with the blood of a girl—a coward!"</p>
               <p>It is not probable that Henriette would have permitted the girl to tell her story
                  without interruption if she had not been both surprised and alarmed to learn that
                  instead of being asleep as she supposed, Maretah had watched her motions. Beside
                  this, she had been so transported by her evil passions that her dark intention
                  never appeared to her in all its terror until she heard her movements thus
                  described by the Indian girl.</p>
               <p>"Can this indeed be possible?" exclaimed Louis, regarding her with horror and
                  aversion, and fixing his glance of scrutiny upon her countenance.</p>
               <p>"No doubt you will believe this artful story! Oh yes, you are ready to believe any
                  thing of me! But I will see if we are to have our lives endangered in this way by
                  savages—if wild Indians with daggers in their girdles, are to come into our houses
                  and threaten us thus. And if I am deserted by those who should protect me, I will
                  appeal to them who have power to avenge such injuries!"</p>
               <p>"I entreat you to let this matter rest now—remember Angeline!" pleaded Edith.</p>
               <p>"You are right! but it shall be looked to in the morning. Come Henriette!" he
                  said, pointing the way to her own chamber.</p>
               <p>"And will you leave her here with that girl again? Edith, you are a fool, or else
                  you set no value on your life!"</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to fear," answered Edith, quietly; while Louis led the guilty girl
                  away, and opening her door, only said, "Henriette, I know you. Beware!" Then
                  locking her in, and putting the key into his pocket, he returned to his sister's
                  bedside.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon was so wrapt in her own grief and anxiety, that it required very
                  little to satisfy the look<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6366-00000177"/> of inquiry
                  with which she met his eye, and soon all recollection of that startling sound
                  which had disturbed them was lost in maternal apprehension.</p>
               <p>For some time Louis heard his cousin moving about her chamber. Sometimes she paced
                  the floor, then for awhile was silent, after which he thought she drew some heavy
                  object across the room toward the door, and all was quiet.</p>
               <p>When the first light of morning came it did not bring the hope which they had
                  waited for so long. Angeline's few murmured words still betrayed a wandering mind,
                  and it was with anguish too deep for tears, that the sorrowing mother bent over
                  her and cried, "Oh, my daughter, my precious little one, must I indeed lose thee?
                  Must I resign thee so soon to Him who gave thee to our love!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <p>WHEN Henriette heard the key of her chamber turned upon her, and was left to her
                  reflections, she was struck for the first time with the magnitude of the crime,
                  from the commission of which an accident had saved her, and experienced a sense of
                  profound relief in thinking she was not quite a murderess.</p>
               <p>In fact, great as her crime was, it had not the sin of premeditation. It happened
                  that in passing Edith's door, on her way to her room, after visiting that of her
                  cousin, she caught sight of Maretah's dagger as it lay glittering in the moonlight
                  on her pillow. Then all the evil of Henriette's nature was aroused, and the
                  intention darted through the mind with the rapidity of light. She paused not to
                  consider the consequences of her violence, for she easily persuaded herself that
                  it would be no difficult matter to fix the deed upon the Indian girl, to whom the
                  dagger belonged, and in case of failure there was one resource always at her
                  command. Indeed she scarcely thought at all upon the subject, for she hated Edith
                  with a bitterness that almost deprived her of her reason, and her principal idea
                  was revenge.</p>
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6366-00000178"/>
               <p>"What would I have made myself?" and Henriette shuddered as the word "murderess"
                  answered her thought. "And how much better am I in their eyes even now? 'To-morrow
                  it shall be looked to!'—Tomorrow! But I will disappoint them of that!</p>
               <p>"Fool that I was to think it could succeed, and yet if I had been one moment
                  quicker! Curses on that lynx-eyed, cunning girl, even <emph>she</emph> scorned me,
                  and called me 'coward!'</p>
               <p>"There is not one in all this whole wide world who does not despise me; not one!
                  They all did before this happened; and now I shall be like another Cain, hated,
                  and contemned, and feared by every one.</p>
               <p>"This Quaker girl will have her revenge on me, too, for the dislike I have always
                  shown her, and now her time has come to triumph over me. She has told him all I
                  said to her, too; for did he not say he knew me? That glance of his; how
                     <emph>dare</emph> he look at me so! and 'To-morrow it shall be looked to;' it
                  has come to threats then, has it!</p>
               <p>"Who knows but to-morrow I shall be in that very place I taunted Edith for going
                  to—the jail, and may be in the very cell she occupied? And what will they do to
                  me?—hang me, possibly, and all the town will run to see the sight, and boys will
                  pelt me with mud and stones, and curse me, and call me, 'hunch-back,' as that
                  little wretch did the day I went to see the Quakers hung and so enjoyed the sight;
                  only I was so sorry it had not been that old man and his precious daughter,
                  instead of the others! I paid the boy for his compliment, too, with that long
                  needle which I ran into his arm; ha, ha, he'll know the hunch-back next time!"</p>
               <p>Such were Henriette's thoughts as her cousin heard her pacing her chamber floor,
                  with a dark purpose lurking in her heart. Perhaps, now that the time had come for
                  executing it, she shrunk from it with a fear she would not acknowledge. And so she
                  continued to walk and commune with herself, but not one prayer of repentance, not
                  one hope of heavenly or earthly pardon lent her its pitying strength! Had
                     <emph>she</emph> ever felt forgiveness, or buried in oblivion the remembrance
                  of even one unintentional injury? No, nor did it once occur to the vindictive
                  girl, that another might—that even a merciful God would receive and forgive the
                  penitent!</p>
               <p>"But why do I hesitate? This is only loss of time, and I know not how soon they
                  may come to take me away. It must be nearly morning; the time goes rapidly. It is
                  nothing to die, after all: only to bid good-by to vexation and misery. Better the
                  eternal sleep of death, than life, as I live! What am I now? despised and hated;
                  and when I am dead perhaps they will judge of me less harshly."</p>
               <p>Her resolution was now taken. She drew the heavy piece of furniture, before spoken
                  of, against the door. It required all her strength to move it. She then<pb
                     n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6366-00000179"/> placed the candle on a chair by her
                  bedside, took a small penknife in her hand and lay down, after which she bared her
                  arm and looked to see which vein she should open.</p>
               <p>"Fool that I am to tremble—it is nothing. Think of the disgrace that awaits thee;
                  think of her, beloved, happy, honored, and of thyself, despised, hated, miserable,
                  and then choose between such a life and death, which is the end of all things!
                  Pshaw, there is no choice!"</p>
               <p>Another moment and the ruddy stream started from her arm. She turned her head
                  away, for she felt a sickening faintness at the sight of blood, her own
                  life-stream flowing from her veins! For a little while she lay still, but fear,
                  which she mistook for the faintness of death, startled her as it seemed to fall
                  like a cold weight upon her heart.</p>
               <p>"Shall I indeed die? Is death really so near, and whither am I going? Can there
                  be, after all, another world beyond this, where spirits live and dwell? Is there
                  indeed a God who can forgive and pity? No; I do not believe it! There may be one
                  for those who are happy, but not for such as I am, else why has He left me thus,
                  and never shown the love to me that they say he feels toward all? What has He ever
                  done for me to convince me of His kindness?—Nothing. And now I suppose they would
                  say I should pray to Him! Why should I? I have lived without Him. He might have
                  made me happy, if He is the good father they tell of, instead of sending me into
                  the world an object of disgust and aversion! And now I can die without him. Die!
                  How different from Angeline! There they are, watching every breath she draws,
                  weeping and grieving over her, and here am I, left to die alone like a beggar!"
                  She started up in bed, and a death-like faintness now indeed came over her. The
                  candle flickering in its socket, showed her by its sudden starts of light, her
                  bed, together with her own garments, soaked with blood. She tried to scream, but
                  her voice failed her; she could not utter a sound. Then she listened, hoping some
                  one, even Edith, might be passing by, but all was fearfully silent. She heard only
                  a strange ringing in her ears, and felt the fluttering of her failing pulse. The
                  candle now sent up one last flickering beam, and she was left in darkness, and the
                  wretched girl could only think the word she had not voice to utter—"mercy!" and
                  sink back upon her bed insensible.</p>
               <p>At an early hour Edith came to take her place by Angeline. She was very pale, and
                  her aspect denoted extreme weariness. Mrs. Hermon, struck by her appearance, was
                  alarmed, because she feared she was ill, and kindly bade her go back to bed and
                  rest longer, as she did not seem to be much refreshed by sleep. They were almost
                  the first words that Mrs. Hermon addressed<pb n="358-359"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000180"/> to her in the old motherly tone, and brought the
                  tears into Edith's eyes, as she thanked her, but declared herself ready to resume
                  her post, and persuaded the almost heart-broken mother to retire. After she was
                  gone, she said, looking at Louis anxiously: "Do you not fear she may do herself
                  some violence?"</p>
               <p>"You are right. I should have thought of that!"</p>
               <p>He informed his mother of the event of the night as gently as he could. The shock
                  was great, but not as much so as it would have been, had not other grief occupied
                  her mind.</p>
               <p>"Alas! what can we do? and at this moment. Why must it have come now?"</p>
               <p>Louis gave her the key of Henriette's chamber, and desired her to see if all were
                  right there. She unlocked the door; but something from within opposed her
                  entrance. He now remembered the sounds he had heard during the night; and it was
                  with a feeling of fearful apprehension, that, after calling repeatedly upon his
                  cousin, and receiving no answer, he proceeded to apply the force of his strength
                  to effect an entrance into her chamber. He had only partially succeeded in pushing
                  through the narrow passage thus obtained, when he started back, with a look of
                  horror pictured upon his face.</p>
               <p>"What, what is it, Louis? oh, speak; what saw you?"</p>
               <p>"Do not come here, mother," he answered, motioning her away. "Do not, I beseech
                  you; nay, for once I must command; you must not, you shall not!" And Mrs. Hermon,
                  beginning to suspect the truth, allowed herself to be led away. She did not again
                  ask what he saw, but gazed into his face with an expression of bewildered alarm,
                  and suffered him to place her upon a seat.</p>
               <p>"Remain here a moment, dear mother, until I return."</p>
               <p>She sat perfectly quiet, with her hands clasped together, not attempting to move,
                  while he returned to ascertain if the vital spark had flown. To his great joy he
                  found that life still remained; and as the blood was yet slowly trickling from the
                  vein, he closed it, hastily winding his handkerchief around the arm, and hurried
                  back to tell his mother the result of his investigations.</p>
               <p>"Mother do not look so! Henriette has been rash indeed; but thank God it is not
                  too late to restore her! Nay, I will not accept your assistance. Send Maretah
                  hither; she is used to sights like this—and go you and calm yourself; all will be
                  well enough soon."</p>
               <p>It was not long before the restoratives they administered had their effect.
                  Henriette looked around bewildered; and seeing her cousin bending over her, and
                  another form retreating behind the curtain (for the Indian thought she might not
                  like to fix her eyes upon<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6366-00000181"/> her, on first
                  reviving), she inquired, in a faint voice, what it meant.</p>
               <p>Louis bade her remain quiet, in a tone at once kind and grave; but when she
                  attempted to move, and found herself powerless, her eye fell by chance upon the
                  bandage on her arm, and all at once the truth of her situaation flashed upon
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Why did you come in? what brought you here?" she said, almost angrily.</p>
               <p>"Thank God, I came in time, in time to prevent the fatal consequences of your
                  rashness!"</p>
               <p>"And I thank you not!" she retorted, turning her face the other way.</p>
               <p>"The day will come when you will! but it matters not now. I can not leave you
                  alone, Henriette, and I must go to Angeline."</p>
               <p>"Why can you not leave me alone? I would wish to be so," she said, in a somewhat
                  softened tone.</p>
               <p>"Simply because I will not! Do you wish therefore that I should send my mother to
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake, no! Who is that behind the curtain?"</p>
               <p>"It is Maretah, who assisted me in restoring you."</p>
               <p>The Indian girl now came forward and said:</p>
               <p>"Maretah will watch her if the maiden wills it."</p>
               <p>Henriette hesitated; but reflecting that she could not endure the eyes of either
                  her aunt or Edith upon her—and there was no one else who could be summoned moned;
                  and besides, there was something in the bold character of the forest girl that
                  excited her admiration—she said:</p>
               <p>"Let her stay."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <p>MEANWHILE Edith was left alone with her little charge, and while anxiously
                  watching her she was startled at seeing that a gradual change was coming over the
                  pallid face of the sleeping child. Her restless movements ceased, her breathing
                  became regular, while Edith's excitement increased in proportion as that of
                  Angeline appeared to diminish, until her own breath was almost suspended in the
                  intensity of her feelings. The dawning hope was, however, darkened by the cloud of
                  fear with which it came accompanied, that this might be the change that often
                  precedes that greater and most awful one, at the name of which we tremble. But as
                  she bent nearer and nearer, and saw with indescribable joy, that Angeline began to
                  look more and more like her own sweet self, the blue eyes opened, and gazed into
                  her own with silent wonder.</p>
               <p>There was no longer the wild gleam of fever in those now languid orbs, for soon a
                  smile of recognition parted her lips, and she whispered in a voice so faint and
                  low as to be scarcely audible, and with the surprise of one conscious for the
                  first time of her presence, "Dear Edith!" then, as if exhausted by so great an
                  effort, once more fell into a calm and quiet slumber.</p>
               <p>When Louis returned with noiseless caution to that room where the blessing of a
                  merciful Father had fallen, it was to find the Quaker's daughter kneeling by his
                  sister's bed, with tears of silent joy streaming from eyes lifted in gratitude to
                  Heaven.</p>
               <p>At a sign from him she stole away to bear the joyful tidings to the almost
                  despairing mother. She found Mrs. Hermon lying exhausted upon her bed. Bursting
                  into tears, she hastened to her side, and taking one of her passive hands in
                  her's, exclaimed, "Thank God, He is indeed merciful!"</p>
               <p>"Thank God, indeed," she answered, calmly, "Henriette's sinful purpose of
                  self-destruction is defeated, and I am truly grateful, my child, that His hand
                  interposed to save you from her evil passion!"</p>
               <p>Edith was, as yet, ignorant of Henriette's attempt upon her own miserable life,
                  and only imperfectly understood Mrs. Hermon's meaning.</p>
               <p>"Alas! has she been so rash, so bold? But it is not of her I come to speak. I have
                  hastened to bring thee other and more blessed tidings!"</p>
               <p>"God's will be done! since he has thus seen fit to visit me!"</p>
               <p>Edith saw it was necessary to use caution in imparting her glad message. She
                  continued—</p>
               <p>"Nay, He is merciful in this also!"</p>
               <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6366-00000183"/>
               <p>"Yes, yes. I know it, I feel it, and oh, I trust in Him for strength to bear up
                  and endure."</p>
               <p>"What do I say to mislead thee thus? The child of thy love is not taken from thee,
                  from her earthly home!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edith, speak, I conjure you! What is your meaning? I thought you came to tell
                  me she was gone! Dare I dream that it is otherwise?"</p>
               <p>"I trust it may be. At least thou mayest hope that she will yet be spared to
                  thee!"</p>
               <p>"Do not bid me hope too far; it is a fearful thing to deceive one's self thus.
                  Beware, maiden, how you speak of hope!"</p>
               <p>"But thou hast a warrant for it now. There is a promise from above written on the
                  sweet child's face."</p>
               <p>The mother's agitation was so great that for a long time Edith did not succeed in
                  calming her. She had prepared herself to bear the loss of her child, but not her
                  restoration; for that was a subject upon which she had almost ceased to dwell. She
                  now wept and laughed by turns, and made Edith again and again describe the change
                  as she saw it taking place, and clasped her in her arms, warmly pouring out her
                  gratitude for the love and devotion she had shown her little one.</p>
               <p>"Name it not, for it is less than nothing! Thy kindness and that of thy son to me,
                  and to him who has gone to his rest, have been too great almost for me to bear.
                  Never may I think to repay it, but He will, and if fervent prayers can invoke a
                  blessing, surely one must rest on you now and forever!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
               <p>HENRIETTE lay upon her couch weak and languid, the life she had so nearly thrown
                  away, or rather made forever wretched, feebly fluttering within her restless
                  bosom. It was the first time she ever remembered feeling ill, and it made her more
                  a child than she would have believed any thing could do.</p>
               <p>There was only one thought that prevented her regretting the fortunate issue of
                  the attempt against her own life—which was, that she remembered the agony of mind
                  attending what she fancied her last moments, too vividly for it to have yet lost
                  its influence; indeed the impression was destined to be fortunate and lasting.</p>
               <p>Yet her evil nature, though weakened, was by no means conquered, and her
                  bitterness toward Edith increased rather than diminished, from the consciousness
                  of being in her power. How she would use that power, Henriette little doubted, for
                  judging all hearts by her own, she believed it impossible to forgive. She
                  therefore busily devised means for eluding the just punishment of her intended
                  crime, and thought<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6366-00000184"/> at last that she had
                  hit upon a plan. But for the fear of failure she would now have been tolerably at
                  ease, amused, and with her imagination excited as it was by the romance of
                  Maretah's character. The Indian girl well knew how to charm her with recitals of
                  her past experience, and it was Henriette's delight to listen to her wild and
                  quaintly told legends.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Maretah could the more readily forgive the characteristic violence of the
                  other, because it was not altogether foreign to her own nature. Instinctively
                  comprehending the secret of Henriette's hatred to her adopted sister, and
                  accustomed to a mode of summary revenge, it did not seem so culpable to her as it
                  must have appeared to another. Then too, a conscious superiority led Maretah to
                  regard her with pity rather than anger, for to her, Henriette was no more than a
                  weak and wayward child. And so she sat beside her day by day amusing her so well
                  as scarcely to betray that she was watching every movement, and prepared to defeat
                  any further attempt at her former violence.</p>
               <p>One day, shortly after the occurrences we have mentioned, there came a gentle tap
                  on Henriette's door. It was answered by Maretah, who in obedience to a sign from
                  Edith, remained outside (though not so far as to lose sight of her charge), while
                  the latter entered.</p>
               <p>"How fares it with thee, Henriette?" she asked kindly; but Henriette, turning
                  herself away, refused to acknowledge her presence. "She has come to triumph over
                  me, as well she may, though it shall not be for long!" thought the vindictive
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"Forgive this intrusion. I came in without asking permission because I feared thou
                  wouldst deny me, and I desire to ask a favor at thy hand."</p>
               <p>Still no answer, except in thought. "A favor! that is something new for any one to
                  ask of me. They all know too well that I am not fond of granting them. No doubt
                  she made a mistake, and means that she has come to give me the opportunity of
                  asking one of her, but she is mistaken there also!"</p>
               <p>"Henriette, I see thou art displeased with my visit, but still I must persist in
                  annoying thee so far as to request that for both our sakes thou wilt preserve
                  silence on the subject of yesternight's occurrences. For my own part, be assured
                  that I shall speak of them to no one, and further than that, I shall endeavor to
                  banish even the recollection of them from my mind. For Maretah's secrecy also I
                  can answer. Thy aunt and cousin may no doubt be relied on—and it only remains with
                  thee to bury their remembrance in oblivion."</p>
               <p>"You can not be sincere!" was Henriette's involuntary exclamation, as she turned
                  about and looked Edith in the face for the first time.</p>
               <p>"I most certainly am, and that for my own sake as well as thine!"</p>
               <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6366-00000185"/>
               <p>"For <emph>your</emph> sake? what harm could it do <emph>you</emph> to speak of
                  it? but I see now." And the suspicious creature once more turned away and
                  continued in thought—"another trick to entrap my cousin and purchase favor of the
                  family!"</p>
               <p>"What dost thou see Henriette?" asked Edith, as she marked the cold wary look
                  returning; but again she received no reply.</p>
               <p>"I would press this on thy attention, because, as thou knowest, the magistrates of
                  this goodly place are so prompt in the performance of what they regard their duty,
                  that if a breath of it should reach their ears, they might feel impelled to make
                  inquiries as painful to myself as to thee. This is what I came to tell thee, and
                  will only add that I sincerely rejoice to see thee in a fair way of recovery."</p>
               <p>"Well," thought Henriette, after she was gone, "there is truth in what she says,
                  if one might rely upon her promise; and I believe one may! However, I shall get
                  out of the way, in case she changes her mind; for either she is a fool, or else
                  fancies she has something to gain by such a course. If <emph>I</emph> had
                     <emph>her</emph> in my power thus, how differently I should act, and what
                  delight it would be to triumph over her!"</p>
               <p>But after this visit, instead of being more comfortable in her mind, because
                  relieved of the fear of prosecution, Henriette was less so than before. She turned
                  and tossed uneasily upon her bed, and cared little for Maretah's entertainments—in
                  fact, was a burden to herself, and really began to think she might be happier if
                  she had more of the disposition which <emph>seemed</emph> to actuate the Quaker's
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>On the following day Edith came again to her door, and asked permission to come
                  in. Henriette hesitated, wondering what she could have to say now, and finally
                  decided to admit her, just to gratify her curiosity. Thus she continued to repeat
                  her visits for several successive days, until once when it happened that the
                  accustomed hour passed by without bringing her, her old enemy grew restless and
                  impatient, and marveled why she did not come. "Not that she really wanted to see
                  her, or in the least enjoyed her society; oh, no! but having so few amusements
                  now, she missed even the trifling one that Edith's conversation afforded her!"</p>

               <p>"And so you really intend to go to England!"</p>
               <p>"I never have had any other thought. Alice persuaded me to stay until after her
                  marriage, or we should have gone some time ago."</p>
               <p>"You are a strange creature, Edith; I wish I really knew how to understand
                  you!"</p>
               <p>Edith laughed. "Am I such a mystery? Nay, Henriette, I might retort that same
                  remark against thee. But indeed thou art making a riddle of me when I am none at
                  all; for just as I appear, I am; and 'he who runs may read.'"</p>
               <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6366-00000186"/>
               <p>"Then you think me a strange creature, do you? Come now, let us agree each to tell
                  the other her opinion of her! It will be amusing; and I quite fancy the idea!"</p>
               <p>"I will accede to it; but come thou first, and let me hear what an enormity I look
                  like in thine eyes!"</p>
               <p>"And you will promise not to be angry?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, and exact the same pledge of thyself."</p>
               <p>"Agreed! To tell you truly, Edith, I am not quite decided about your character.
                  There are two opinions in my mind; and sometimes I hold one, sometimes the
                  other.</p>
               <p>"The first is, that you are what people call a Christian—(don't think that a
                  compliment, however, for I never once fancied such); that you have no very strong
                  passions to influence your conduct; and therefore it is an easy matter for you to
                  guide it by the rule and measure that <emph>people again call</emph>—goodness. It
                  costs you nothing, and you deserve no credit for it. That is the first—now for the
                  other character.</p>
               <p>"You are altogether a deception; you appear to be what I have described, while you
                  are nothing of the kind; but your powers of dissimulation are so perfect as to
                  defy detection by the most watchful eye. Do you remember one night when I
                  succeeded in making you angry? Well, since that time I have considered you worthy
                  of being my enemy; for then I thought I discerned a flash of your real character.
                  I was not certain before that you had any; and I tell you candidly that I rather
                  incline now, to place you under the second order. Now I have been frank with you;
                  come, let me see myself at full length in your mirror!"</p>
               <p>"Thou hast not given me a very flattering view of myself, it is true; but it shall
                  not influence me in my sketch of thee.</p>
               <p>"I think thou started in life with a wrong idea, and hast ever since been
                  governing thy conduct thereby. That wrong idea is a depreciation of thyself."</p>
               <p>"Are you crazed? but I forgot I must not interrupt you; so go on, but mind you are
                  candid if you would not rouse my wrath!"</p>
               <p>"I repeat it—a depreciation of thyself. It has led thee to dislike and suspect
                  every one and to take their indifference to thee as a matter of course; it
                  engenders jealousy. 'Nobody loves <emph>me.</emph>' 'Nobody cares for
                     <emph>me.</emph>' 'What claims have <emph>I</emph> on others?' Such is thy
                  continual self-communion. I look on it as the parent of thy other faults, but must
                  say that the children far exceed their ancestor. Shall I go on?"</p>
               <p>"By all means! I am interested, and begin to think you are sincere. Now for the
                  unlucky progeny."</p>
               <p>"This idea engenders malice. Thou hast choked the growth of kindly feelings—torn
                  them from thy heart as thou shouldst have torn the evil, which thou hast
                  industriously cultivated. Thou hast hidden every good impulse, and displayed every
                  wrong one, thus<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6366-00000187"/> making it thy study to
                  appear worse than thou art. This leads thee to doubt every one, to question every
                  motive that appeared pure in another, until even the very source of goodness and
                  purity seems polluted to thy vision. What wonder when thou deniest the evidence of
                  good in thyself that thou shouldst question it elsewhere?</p>
               <p>"Henriette thou art making thy whole life a falsehood—with both paths before thee,
                  ever leaving the straight one and pursuing the labyrinthine maze! Yet, strange to
                  say, thou art all the while deceiving thyself with the idea that thou art sincere,
                  simply because professing no good; thou art giving no ground for good opinion,
                  forgetting that falsehood exists wherever the conduct is deceptive, as well as
                  where the growth of nature is checked and distorted by its presence."</p>
               <p>"Have you finished?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I have been candid enough to expect the fulfillment of thy promise."</p>
               <p>"O! I am not in the least angry, on the contrary, although according to your
                  picture, I am worse than I fancied, I like myself better than ever before; but let
                  me see, what is it? The first fault was humility—was it not?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all. Humility is something vastly different. Self-depreciation
                     <emph>may</emph> be converted into it, to be sure, but it has not in thy case
                  led in that direction."</p>
               <p>"Well then, malicious; you said I was malicious, at any rate?"</p>
               <p>"In terms more plain than polite—yes."</p>
               <p>"Away with politeness! If you get to that, I <emph>shall</emph> be angry.
                  Come—'malice'—'suspicion'—but stop; these are the children, I forget the respected
                  parent. We'll start anew," (counting on her fingers.) "Self-depreciation, malice,
                  suspicion, jealousy—four. The other surprises me a little, I must reflect upon it
                  at my leisure; but pray, how do you know that I pride myself upon sincerity? These
                  can not be all my faults—and yet they are enough at a time. But after you have
                  given me such a character, what better can you expect of me?"</p>
               <p>"Every thing. There is not one of these faults that could not be turned the other
                  way and made a virtue. With all characters the case would not be so hopeful,
                  though with thine, the resolution once formed, success is almost certain."</p>
               <p>"What is there in <emph>my</emph> character, especially, to make it so?"</p>
               <p>"Force, strength, energy. Didst thou ever bend thy mind to any purpose and fail
                  therein from weakness, merely?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I am aware of. But you have told me so many strange things about myself
                  to-day, that I am scarcely confident of any thing, I <emph>think,</emph> however,
                  that there is something within me—be it good or evil—that perseveres toward
                  accomplishing an end, and impels me to persist, sometimes after all chance of
                  success is over."</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6366-00000188"/>
               <p>"That is it, exactly; and an excellent trait, if properly directed: though, like
                  every other good one, capable of being wrongly applied."</p>
               <p>"You spoke of turning my particular faults into virtues. Come now, just for the
                  humor of it, tell me how it could be done so easily."</p>
               <p>"To begin with the first—malice. I would drive it unceremoniously out the door,
                  and good-will would soon occupy the vacant place, uninvited. Secondly—suspicion.
                  Believe the best of every one; question no motive that appears sincere until the
                  proof of its falsity is before thy eyes. This will soon give thee confidence,
                  first in little things, then in greater, until a firm belief in the great
                  principle of truth is established, then make that a guide of the conduct, and
                  falsehood can not possibly have a foothold in the character."</p>
               <p>"Very good; but it seems to me you have omitted the most difficult of
                  all—humility."</p>
               <p>"Thou art right; it is not easy to be humble. Let me see! Instead of feeling,
                  'What claims have <emph>I</emph> on the love and sympathy of my kind,' rather
                  think 'I am indeed poor and dependent, unworthy what I desire to obtain, and yet
                  my nature demands it: I am so constituted that I can not be happy without it. What
                  has made me so? The hand of Him who framed me and all creatures from the same
                  dust, who planted in our hearts these everlasting longings—tokens of a better life
                  to come. Would he have made me thirsty without giving me the means of satisfying
                  the want? No, it is inconsistent with His divine character. With this necessity in
                  myself, he has also given me the power to minister to others, and so long as I
                  withhold their just portion which is in my hands, how can I demand mine own which
                  is in theirs? Knowing mine own need, I also know how great is that of my brother.
                  I will begin by giving—sowing my mite in the hearts of others and reaping in
                  return a store of benefits. By giving and receiving, by mutual dependence, we
                  learn to love."</p>
               <p>Henriette made no answer to this, but seemed lost in reflection, and Edith,
                  secretly rejoicing at so favorable a result of their conversation, thought it best
                  to say no more now, and therefore left her.</p>
               <p>"If I could only be sure of her intention to go to England, I might do it!" said
                  Henriette, upon finding herself once more alone.</p>
               <p>Angeline was improving rapidly. Alice was to be married the week following,
                  immediately after which Edith expected to bid adieu to the shores where so much
                  had occurred that must live forever in her memory. Alice, impatient of her long
                  absence, yet hopeful of the result of her second sojourn in Mrs. Hermon's family,
                  now claimed her presence and assistance. Again and again, Mrs. Hermon
                  affectionately urged her to remain with them longer, or at least to
                     <emph>defer</emph> her projected journey; but firmly and gently Edith adhered
                  to her purpose, and persisted in making preparations for her<pb n="376-377"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000189"/> departure. Once more she visited Henriette, to bid
                  her farewell.</p>
               <p>"To-day! You are not really going to leave us to-day?—but you will be back often,
                  and I—that is, Angeline—will see you again."</p>
               <p>"I think not. Our ship will sail next week, and I shall be closely occupied with
                  Alice's affairs and my own until the last moment."</p>
               <p>"Is there a vessel sails for England next week?" asked Henriette, with an
                  appearance of unusual interest.</p>
               <p>"There is; and my kind friend, Mr. Harding, has secured our passages therein, and
                  fortunately found a friend of his own, whose kindness we may tax occasionally
                  during the voyage."</p>
               <p>"Then your passage is taken! Edith, do you know I never believed you really meant
                  to go?"</p>
               <p>Edith smiled, though sadly, to be sure, and Henriette, closely watching her
                  countenance, continued—</p>
               <p>"Could <emph>no one</emph> persuade you to remain?"</p>
               <p>Edith met her gaze with a calm, truth-telling face.</p>
               <p>"No, Henriette; not one."</p>
               <p>"And are you going all that way just to take care of an unreasonable old woman,
                  who, for any thing you know, may only take delight in making you miserable, when
                  there are so many who want you here, where you could be happy?"</p>
               <p>"I am going to my aunt, who, I trust, is not so unreasonable reasonable as to
                  disregard my comfort entirely, though, even if I knew she were, I should feel just
                  as much obliged to go?"</p>
               <p>"The more fool you would be for it! So would not I. Have you no other reason? or,
                  perhaps, you really want to go?"</p>
               <p>"I have reasons both ways; though, to speak candidly, I do not want to go."</p>
               <p>"And suppose your aunt were to die, what then?"</p>
               <p>"Alas, I know not! I should look to Heaven to raise me up another friend."</p>
               <p>"Heaven would be very apt to disappoint you; but I mean, what if your aunt were
                  dead already?"</p>
               <p>"God forbid! Henriette, thou hast a fruitful imagination. It is enough to act in
                  the present—leaving contingencies alone."</p>
               <p>"Edith—but no, I won't say it. The other day you said you should try to forget
                  what had happened between us. I did not believe you. I thought you had some secret
                  motive for what you did. Now tell me—for it has puzzled me greatly—why you have
                  taken such pains to conciliate me?"</p>
               <p>"Because I wanted to make thee my friend."</p>
               <p>"What in the world could you have to gain by my friendship?"</p>
               <p>"A great deal. The satisfaction of having conquered an enemy is enough. If I could
                  feel it were so with thee, it would gratify me greatly."</p>
               <pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6366-00000190"/>
               <p>"I can not see why, for my life. Is this what you would call a triumph?"</p>
               <p>"It is—and it would be a most happy one to subdue thy dislike to me."</p>
               <p>"But even if you did, <emph>you</emph> could never like <emph>me</emph> in
                  return."</p>
               <p>"I could, and do, Henriette, and one great regret I feel in going away is
                  occasioned by this very thing, for I believe if I were to remain here we should
                  soon become firm friends."</p>
               <p>"Friends! I never had one in my life," she answered, with emotion. "No one before
                  ever desired <emph>my</emph> friendship."</p>
               <p>"There—the self-depreciation again! However, thou canst never say that again, for
                  I am a proof to the contrary. What wouldst thou say to a correspondence after I am
                  gone?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I should like it of all things," she answered. quickly; and added, "but you
                  do not yet know me thoroughly. When you do, you will retract what you have
                  said."</p>
               <p>"Not a word. At any rate, expect to hear from me after I am landed in my new home.
                  And now, farewell to thee, for I must begone."</p>
               <p>"Edith, I do not yet believe you will go to England—not that you don't expect
                  to—but I have a reason. Now," she continued, offering her hand rather awkwardly,
                  "you have done more to subdue me than I thought any one could, and if it should
                  chance that we never meet again, you may at least hear from me. There, go quickly,
                  before my evil nature returns."</p>
               <p>Edith pressed her hand, and left her with joy in her heart, such as the angels
                  feel over the repenting sinner.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <p>THAT evening Mrs. Hermon and her son sat engaged in earnest conversation. It was
                  evident they intended it should be private, but there was a little bird sitting on
                  the bough of a tree that bent down close by the open window, and it chanced that
                  he played eavesdropper, which you know has been the privilege of little birds from
                  time immemorial. This, however, was one whom Edith had been in the habit of
                  throwing crumbs to all the winter long, and therefore he was interested in her
                  affairs, and followed her from house to house to see what she was going to do. We
                  wish we could give him credit for a purely unselfish motive, but we can not. The
                  truth was he had a rising family, and not wishing to take them out of town in the
                  winter, on account of the Indian boy's arrows, he was calculating upon having them
                  fed with crumbs by the same fair hand that had supplied his own wants. And so he,
                  too, was interested in doing all in his power to prevent Edith going to
                  England.</p>
               <p>The tiny feathered spy informed me that on this occasion the Quaker's daughter was
                  the subject of their conversation. He did not hear the commencement, but lighted
                  on the tree just in time to hear Mrs. Hermon say:</p>
               <p>"I oppose your wishes no longer. Be happy, my dear Louis, as you deserve to be,
                  and God speed your wooing!"</p>
               <p>And then he said there followed thanks and embraces, and he would not be sworn
                  that there were no tears shed by the mother.</p>
               <p>"And have you no suspicion where these letters came from?"</p>
               <p>"Not the least in the world. At first, I thought of Mr. Mildman; but the second
                  one came long after he was gone. I wonder now how they could have prejudiced me
                  so. Dear Edith! She is indeed a treasure; and how happy dear Angeline will be to
                  have her for a sister!"</p>
               <p>Louis smiled, as if he might be thinking how happy another person he knew of would
                  be too, though he said nothing about it. He turned the letters over and over, and
                  presently remarked: "And you can not even guess the author?"</p>
               <p>"Guess? no, how should I? No one seemed to know so much as how they got here. I
                  have not the most distant idea; have you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, mother; I could have told you at first that it was Henriette's doings."</p>
               <p>"Henriette! You make me more ashamed of the<pb n="382-383"
                     xml:id="VAC6366-00000192"/> affair than ever. But why should she? what could be
                  her motive?"</p>
               <p>"The same that would have induced her to take Edith's life," said Louis, with a
                  shudder. "She is a strange creature, and keeps very close of late; no wonder!"</p>
               <p>"There has certainly come a great change over her since that time. This afternoon
                  I surprised her in tears. I never remember seeing her weep since she grew up,
                  before."</p>
               <p>Louis was now too full of hopes of happiness to cast many thoughts upon his
                  singular cousin. They were wandering into another and more pleasant channel. He
                  longed to fly to Edith to tell her all, and pour out to her the feelings he had so
                  long held in restraint. And how would she receive him? Should he be able to
                  persuade her to remain and make them all happy? We shall see.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mr. Harding seemed the happiest of the happy. What made him so Alice could not
                  possibly divine; and when she teased him to tell her, he shook his head and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"No, no. I can keep a secret; cunning as thou art, Alice, thou shalt not wheedle
                  this out of me." She then tried her best to guess, but failed; and finally told
                  him she did not consider him very polite to behave so, when her dear Edith was on
                  the point of leaving them. Upon this Mr. Harding rubbed his hands together, with
                  an air of intense enjoyment, and walked up and down, looking at her with a very
                  comical expression of countenance, while, for her part, she was ready to cry with
                  vexation. As soon as he saw how she felt, he was sorry, and seemed as if he could
                  not contain the secret another moment. "However, I <emph>must</emph> not!" he
                  said, and thereupon fell to teasing Alice about her wedding, which was to come off
                  on the morrow, until she was glad to run away, and take refuge in her friend's
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>And there she saw Edith sitting among a pile of things such as ladies going to
                  Europe now-a-days know little about. And Maretah, busied with packing, was
                  bustling hither and thither. Yes; inconsistent as it is with the Indian character,
                  Maretah was bustling, for she was fast becoming a civilized woman, and was packing
                  a trunk. In her savage state she had been accustomed to leap into a canoe, when
                  she wanted to take a journey, and paddle away with no baggage at all, unless it
                  might be a buffalo-robe or a bear-skin. But now the case was different. She was
                  going across the mighty waters in a great canoe with wings; and buffalo-robes and
                  bear-skins were fashionable only in America.</p>
               <p>Alice looked at her friend, and noticed that every day she seemed to grow a shade
                  more pale, though she still preserved a calm and cheerful exterior, and was
                  thoughtful of every body's enjoyment but her own.</p>
               <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6366-00000193"/>
               <p>Just now there came a summons for Edith to appear below, as a friend desired to
                  speak with her. Now, as we have seen, Alice had her full share of curiosity and
                  never missed an opportunity of gratifying it, when she thought she could do so
                  harmlessly. So she ran and peeped (we know it is very uncommon in these times for
                  ladies to do so), but Alice peeped over the stairway; and what did she see? She
                  saw what sent a thrill of delight through her heart;—<emph>why</emph> it should,
                  was strange; for it was only Doctor Louis Hermon who walked into her own little
                  parlor.</p>
               <p>The aforesaid little bird had been sitting on a branch near Edith's window,
                  watching the packing operations with a drooping crest. He was expecting this
                  visit, however; and when he heard there was a call, and saw that Edith ran down
                  stairs, he quietly hopped down the tree, and took a convenient
                     <unclear>post</unclear> of observation close by the parlor lattice.</p>
               <p>"Forgive my intrusion, Edith. I come on an errand of some importance to myself, at
                  least. It may, and may not surprise yon; but I came hither to persuade you to give
                  up all thoughts of this long, sad journey, and to remain here where so many love
                  you, and would sorely grieve to lose you."</p>
               <p>Was it a gleam of joy that for a moment sparkled over her face, or was it only a
                  stray beam of light that played upon it through the open lattice? Whichever it
                  was, it was succeeded by a look so sad and grave, as to send a sudden fear, like a
                  pang, across her lover's heart.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, it may not be! My father desired me to go; my duty to my aunt demands
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I did not lose sight of that, Edith. There are two plans I have to propose to you
                  in reference to it. One is to write to your aunt, persuading her to come
                  hither—(you say she has no ties of kindred there to bind her). Were you to be
                  deprived of her protection there you would be alone among strangers, while here
                  you would not want friends and most devoted ones. The other plan is, if you still
                  consider it binding upon you to go, that you do so, and bring her here. Certainly
                  she would be willing to do what is best for your happiness. But in this latter
                  case, Edith, I would ask to accompany you with the most dear right of calling
                  myself your protector!"</p>
               <p>For a moment the young girl bowed her head, and her lover saw that a rosy flush
                  o'erspread her face from chin to forehead. Then she was deadly pale, and her voice
                  trembled as she answered,</p>
               <p>"Spare me, oh, spare me this! Unkind, ungrateful as I must appear, I can not, I
                  must not hear it!"</p>
               <p>"Is it indeed so? I cherished a hope that my affection was not altogether
                  unreturned; but it was too much for me to dream of—and now, oh, Edith my
                  punishment is great: can you forgive my presumption?"</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6366-00000194"/>
               <p>"Say not so, it is I who am unworthy. Alas! why must I inflict such pain, and on
                     <emph>thee?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Something unusual moves you, Edith! What is it? Or have I no right to intrude
                  upon your confidence? Still I am not satisfied to leave you thus. 'Tis true I have
                  no claim; but is it too much to ask why you thus discard me?"</p>
               <p>"Spare me this discussion," cried Edith; "it can not end otherwise, and I have
                  nothing to tell thee further, at least nothing that I ought—that I
                     <emph>can</emph> tell!"</p>
               <p>Louis started impatiently from his seat and paced the room. "Edith, I have
                  encountered mysteries in others, but did not look for it from you. You have always
                  appeared the very soul of truth and candor; and now when my happiness is concerned
                  (and I can not believe it a matter of indifference to you, because your kindness
                  of heart is too great for that), you meet me thus! 'You ought not to tell,' 'you
                  can not tell.' Is there nothing due to me then in explanation of your conduct? But
                  you shall at least say that you do not love me. I will be satisfied thus far
                  before I leave you! You are silent; what am I to think from this? There is
                  something in your manner that almost—pardon me, but I almost dare to think, to
                  hope—how shall I say it?" He took his seat beside her, and lowered his voice to a
                  tone of subduing tenderness. "Oh, Edith, <emph>is</emph> my love so unwelcome to
                     you—<emph>is</emph> it entirely unreturned?"</p>
               <p>She hid her face, and a conscious blush crimsoned neck, hands and bosom. She did
                  not answer him, she could not.</p>
               <p>"You do not disclaim it," he cried, with joy; "may I then—dare I, believe that it
                  is so?"</p>
               <p>"Believe nothing—think nothing—except that this is all in vain!"</p>
               <p>"I will not! because—yes—you do, I feel now that you do love me. What shall part
                  us since it is so? You were destined for me on that day when I took you from a
                  watery grave, and now I claim you as my own. I will not resign the right I have to
                  your hand! Tell me then dear girl, what is this imaginary obstacle to our mutual
                  happiness. Remember you have now no right to withhold the knowledge of it from me.
                  Can you think to do so, when perhaps a single word might secure both your
                  happiness and my own?"</p>
               <p>"It would not, indeed it would not. Oh, if thou dost indeed love me, cease to urge
                  me thus! If thou didst but know, thou wouldst feel as I do. It is my only course,
                  and I owe it to thee, to myself, to be firm!"</p>
               <p>"Edith, let me ask if this is in compliance with your father's wish, for I have
                  heard that this people refuse to sanction marriage engagements with those beyond
                  their own pale?"</p>
               <p>"My father never alluded to the subject. I do not believe the thought ever
                  occurred to him; and<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6366-00000195"/> even if it had, he
                  would not in such a matter have restrained me. Oh, no; he was too good, too kind,
                  thus to exact obedience!"</p>
               <p>"And Henriette, has she any concern in the matter?"</p>
               <p>"None; she could not influence me here."</p>
               <p>"Is it then because you deem me less prompt in the expression of my feelings than
                  you considered I should be? Ah, you know not what it cost me, but it was no
                  selfish fear restrained me!"</p>
               <p>"I knew, and so far from resenting it, I admired and respected thy motives. Oh no,
                  believe me, I would not lightly disregard aught so dear to me" (and here her voice
                  became tremulous, and she avoided the earnest glances of his eyes) "as thy
                  happiness, or cast from me so rich a treasure as thy affection, were I not
                  actuated by a motive, which, if thou canst not read, thou wilt at least do me the
                  justice to respect." She arose from her seat, and extended her hand to bid him
                  farewell.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edith, will you, can you, do this thing? You are my own—and can I thus resign
                  you?"</p>
               <p>Here the little bird peeping under the curtain, saw that Edith looked so much like
                  fainting, that out of pure humanity Louis was obliged to support her with his arm.
                  For a moment she permitted her head to incline—only to <emph>incline</emph> toward
                  his shoulder, then tearing herself away from his embrace, she disappeared from the
                  room, and the young man was left alone in despair. The little bird assured me the
                  scene was so touching, that he was obliged to use the tip of his wing to brush
                  away a tear, and he determined to fly all about the neighborhood and find out if
                  possible what this mighty secret was that kept two such loving hearts asunder,
                  that he might whisper it in Louis's ear. Accordingly that night he chose his perch
                  as near the window as he could get, thinking perhaps Edith would whisper it in her
                  dreams, and did not put his head under his wing fearing he should lose the sound.
                  In consequence of this unaccustomed and unsafe position, when he fell into a doze,
                  he nodded, which disturbed his equilibrium, and he came very near falling into the
                  jaws of a ferocious-looking cat that lurked under the wall watching him, and he
                  saw by the moonlight that her mouth watered and her whiskers bristled when she
                  thought he was about to fall.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon impatiently awaited her son's return, nothing doubting that success
                  had crowned his expedition, and hastened to meet him with a sympathetic smile.</p>
               <p>"And what says our dear Edith to my noble boy?" She saw the moment after that her
                  joy had been ill-timed, and repented her hasty salutation.</p>
               <p>He concealed nothing from her, but told her all, assuring her that he believed
                  Edith loved him, but<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6366-00000196"/> that she was
                  restrained by some powerful motive, of either real or imaginary duty. She listened
                  to the account of his discomfiture as most mothers would, scarcely believing her
                  senses upon hearing that any one could resist her son's attractions, or be so
                  blind as to think of declining such honor and happiness as must await the woman of
                  his choice.</p>
               <p>"I now see how unjust I have been to this maiden, in suspecting her of designs to
                  entrap you. But I will see her; I will go myself and try to discover this mystery.
                  I will take those miserable letters with me, show them to her, and explain what
                  may have seemed strange in my conduct. Woman's tact may aid me; and rely upon it,
                  I will know this formidable secret. I have been in the way of your happiness, my
                  dear son; and now I will do every thing in my power to secure it if possible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harding persevered in keeping his secret; but his exuberance of spirits was
                  all gone, and he looked as sad and grave as Alice could desire; for she had told
                  him that the matter, from which she had all along hoped so much, was ended in
                  disappointment. Edith had refused the offered hand of the young physician.</p>
               <p>"As long as I live," cried Alice, "I will never have a secret again, or listen to
                  one from another person. I detest the very word! And to think of Edith persevering
                  in a mystery! When I heard her coming up stairs after his visit, I ran to embrace
                  her, and to rejoice with her in her happiness; but, to my great surprise, she
                  appeared to be quite overcome with grief and distress. All I could learn was, that
                  I must never mention the subject to her again; that she could not accept the
                  happiness offered her, and never should; and begged me to leave her until she
                  should be calm. So it is all over now!" And Alice ended her story with a burst of
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, my darling; sorry indeed; but it may not be so hopeless after all. Go
                  thou, and when Edith is composed, send her down to me. I have a letter for her,
                  which may contain somewhat to surprise you all with."</p>
               <p>When Edith came into Mr. Harding's study, he handed her the letter spoken of.</p>
               <p>"Prepare thyself for sad news from thy aunt, my child. So much of the contents I
                  know, though the seal was not broken by me, as thou wilt learn hereafter.</p>
               <p>It was a letter from England, commenced by her aunt, and finished by another hand.
                  The first part was addressed to her father and herself, briefly informing them
                  that, feeling her end was nigh at hand, she desired to tell her niece how much
                  pain it gave her to be unable to offer her a home, and protection under a roof
                  that should soon no longer be her own dwelling-place. She felt that ere this could
                  reach them, she should be called to inhabit a mansion beyond the earth, and<pb
                     n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6366-00000197"/> prayed that a merciful God would
                  provide her dear Edith with friends and protection. She then bade them farewell,
                  with the blessing of a dying woman on her sister's child.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the letter was by another, informing them of her decease, and the
                  particulars connected therewith; and also alluding to certain matters of business,
                  to which Edith gave, at that time, but little attention.</p>
               <p>The letter was dated several months previously, and must have reached Boston some
                  time before it came to Edith's hands. Mr. Harding told her he was not now at
                  liberty to explain how it reached him, but would do so soon. After leaving her
                  awhile to her grief, he entreated her to give herself no uneasiness with regard to
                  the future; but to consider that her home as long as she desired to remain with
                  them; or, he added, with a smile, until she might be prepared to accept a happier
                  one. He had already arranged the matter of her passage in the Isabel; and it gave
                  him, as it would Alice, no small degree of pleasure, to feel that she would now be
                  a permanent member of their family.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>IT was the evening of Alice's bridal, and a small number of guests had assembled
                  at her father's house on the occasion. It was her desire that it should be as
                  private as possible, both because the former unhappy affair had been so widely
                  talked of, and on account of her friend. Three sad months had hardly passed since
                  Edith laid her father in his grave, and the recent saddening news from England
                  cast another cloud over the sky of the orphan.</p>
               <p>How different was the blooming bride of this evening from her who once before
                  stood at the marriage altar, transfixed into an icy statue! Did her cold hand now
                  refuse to ratify the holy promise? Oh, no; it rested warm and trembling in that of
                  him who had ever been her chosen.</p>
               <p>And by her side stood as fair a bridesmaid as ever graced a similar occasion. In
                  her robe of simple white—truly emblematic of her purity of mind—very pale, but
                  ever calm and cheerful, sympathizing in a happiness she might never hope to enjoy;
                  she kept her place by the gay blushing bride, with modest unpretending
                  dignity.</p>
               <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6366-00000198"/>
               <p>Her lover was there too, with a new hope springing in his heart; for Mr. Harding
                  lost no time in informing him of the occurrence that had changed Edith's plans;
                  and instead of now gazing upon her for the last time, as he anticipated, he
                  enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing that she would continue near, and ventured to
                  trust that time might remove the hidden obstacle that lay in the way of their
                  happiness. Indeed he was not certain that it was not removed already, and waited
                  for an opportunity to whisper a question in her ear.</p>
               <p>"Edith, I have heard to-day what gives me inexpressible joy. You will not go;
                  thank God we shall not lose you!"</p>
               <p>"I can not go now, indeed; and yet I know not that it is for the best to
                  remain."</p>
               <p>"I have hoped that this would influence your opinion of yesterday. Will you not
                  tell me that I hope not vainly?"</p>
               <p>"I feared this. My decision must remain unchanged. Do not, oh do not force me to
                  repeat it!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
               <p>THE ship that was to have borne our heroine over the mighty waters was speeding
                  along with a fair wind across the ocean billow. Edith sat at her open window
                  watching the white sails as they were marked against the horizon, when there came
                  a messenger from Mrs. Hermon. The messenger proved to be no other than Louis
                  himself, who informed Edith that his mother desired to see her on business of some
                  importance, and added a request that she would bring with her a certain letter,
                  found one morning upon her toilet. There was something in this last request that
                  made Edith's heart flutter strangely, and it was not with her usual calm exterior
                  that she placed her hand within the young physician's arm, and accepted his escort
                  to Mrs. Hermon's dwelling.</p>
               <p>"My mother sent for you, Edith, rather than come herself to you, because, her
                  business being of a private nature, she thought you would thus be less liable to
                  interruption. Probably you have not heard that Henriette left us yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"Henriette left you! and without telling you whither she was going?"</p>
               <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6366-00000199"/>
               <p>"Oh, no. She left a letter informing us of her intentions. She is in that vessel
                  which, you observe, is fast disappearing in the shadows of evening—the ship that
                  was to have borne you away from our sight forever. I can not say we greatly regret
                  the change of passengers, however."</p>
               <p>"You do indeed surprise me! Has she then friends in England, or what is her object
                  in going there?"</p>
               <p>"To enter a convent. She tells us that she could not remain here and be happy,
                  that if she had remained longer the good resolutions she had recently made would
                  have given way, and that her only safety consisted in going. She says that but for
                  you, she would never have felt the desire she experiences to atone for the past,
                  and that she can only do so now by the most austere discipline, and rigid
                  self-denial. Poor girl! she was always strange and wayward, and her bodily
                  infirmity should make us the more indulgent to her mental deformity."</p>
               <p>Conversation of this character, and chiefly relating to Henriette, was all that
                  passed between Edith and her lover during their walk. As for Louis, he seemed
                  content to wait for further developments before urging his own matters upon her
                  attention. They had now reached their destination, and Edith received Mrs.
                  Hermon's affectionate greeting with a hopeful degree of embarrassment.</p>
               <p>"You received a letter from England recently, I am informed.—Nay, my son, if Edith
                  has no objection, I beg you will remain!"</p>
               <p>"I did. It was written at my aunt's request, and seemed to have been delayed in
                  the delivery."</p>
               <p>"It should have reached you some time ago. Do you know the cause of its
                  detention?"</p>
               <p>"I do not."</p>
               <p>"I can tell you, my dear. Henriette has had possession of it until within a few
                  days, when she gave it to Mr. Harding, with instructions not to give it to you
                  until a certain time should elapse, and not to inform you how it came to him until
                  after she was gone. She says that one day she was walking near your late dwelling,
                  when she met a messenger with the letter in his hand. He was seeking your father,
                  and Henriette bade him give the letter to her, as she was going immediately to
                  your house, and would herself undertake to place it directly in his hand. She kept
                  it from you, because she had reasons of her own for wishing you to go away, and
                  feared its reception would defeat your purpose. And now, Edith, I will ask you to
                  let me see another letter you have in your possession."</p>
               <p>She drew forth the other letter spoken of, and presented it to Mrs. Hermon, with
                  visible agitation.</p>
               <p>"And do you take these, my child," said Mrs. Hermon, handing her the two anonymous
                  communications, "read them, and if you have seen any thing of coldness or
                     distrust<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6366-00000200"/> trust manifested in my
                  treatment of you, attribute it to motherly affection, which is sometimes alarmed
                  too easily, and let your kindness prompt you to forgive me."</p>
               <p>Edith retired to a table in another part of the room, where Louis considerately
                  placed a light for her, and sat down to read the letters as requested, although
                  the characters danced so upon the paper, that after she was done she had no very
                  distinct idea of what she had been reading.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Hermon and Louis were perusing that which Edith had placed in her
                  hand at her request, and since it seems to be the property of all in the room, we
                  will peep over the good lady's shoulder, and gratify our laudable curiosity to
                  know its contents.</p>

                           <p>"To you who have come so strangely into my once happy home, a mother
                              desires to express a mother's feelings. I never thought to see you
                              under my roof again, but circumstances have compelled me to request
                              your presence.</p>
                           <p>"And now I warn, I entreat you to respect the sanctuary of our home.
                              Your misfortunes I pity, your rectitude I honor, and I rely upon you
                              to be guided by the principle that ever seems to actuate your conduct.
                              Do not rob me of my best earthly treasure, the comfort and support of
                              my declining years!</p>
                           <p>"I have a reason for this which I am not called upon to tell you; it
                              is one that will remain ever unchanged changed. Never think you can be
                              more to him than you are now; dearer it is true you may be, but nearer
                              you can not come. In a short time the ocean will roll between you; but
                              even should you remain here there is a gulf divides you, wider by far.
                              Should he proffer you his affection, accept it not! a mother's
                              blessing can never hallow your union.</p>
                           <p>"I need not ask you to conceal this, or all knowledge of it from my
                              son: yet keep it for your own strength, it may help you. If a weak
                              moment seem likely to overcome you, read these, the outpourings of a
                              mother's heart, and it may aid you to perform your duty.</p>
                           <p>"And now, my child, may God bless you and give you friends who will
                              kindly cherish you, is the prayer of one who must soon be to you a

               <p>When they had finished reading it, Louis said: "Mother, it almost deceives me now.
                  It is perfect!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my son, to think of that girl's baseness! It is indeed well she is gone. And
                  now," she added with a smile of pleasure, "I think we have discovered Edith's
                  secret at last!"</p>
               <p>She took the letter in her hand and approached Edith.</p>
               <p>"My child, did you think this came from me?"</p>
               <p>"I did not doubt it."</p>
               <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6366-00000201"/>
               <p>"No wonder, for it was well-contrived. When and how did you receive it?"</p>
               <p>"It lay upon my toilet on the morning after I came at your request to
                  Angeline."</p>
               <p>"Do not wrong me, my dear, by thinking for another moment that it came from me. Do
                  you guess the author of those letters?"</p>
               <p>"No;" she was incapable just then of guessing any thing.</p>
               <p>"My child, it was Henriette!"</p>
               <p>She started from her seat in surprise, "Henriette!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and she was the author of <emph>this</emph> one also."</p>
               <p>There was something more in Edith's face now than surprise, there was
                  pleasure.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hermon passed her arm affectionately around her and whispered a question in
                  her ear. (My faithful little bird was listening, and he informs me that these were
                  her precise words.)</p>
               <p>"Does not this explain the mystery you would not unravel for my son?"</p>
               <p>(The bird says he did not hear a single word in reply, but he saw that Edith hid
                  her eyes on Mrs. Hermon's shoulder, and that at a look from his mother, Louis came
                  and stood very near them, that she took Edith's hand in her own, and said; "Have I
                  your consent, my dear?" but still the little bird could not hear that Edith made
                  any answer, though certainly tainly her hand did not seem to offer any resistance;
                  whereupon Mrs. Hermon continued:</p>
               <p>"You once told me, my son, that you would not seek to make this treasure, which
                  you counted the dearest gift that earth could bestow, your own, until your
                  mother's hand should place it in yours. I do so now, and pray God to bless my
                  children with the happiness they deserve!"</p>
               <p>My friend the Oriole declares that after witnessing the scene thus far he did not
                  consider it polite or honorable to play the spy any longer; so you see that even
                  birds have some sense of propriety in eavesdropping. Therefore, convinced that all
                  was right, he hopped up to the top of the tree in which all his family were
                  sleeping, and although it was night, he was in such a state of ecstasy that he
                  commenced singing with all his might, and the other birds, thinking daylight was
                  come, put out their heads and began to chirp and twitter, when seeing their
                  mistake, they called to him to know what was the matter, and an old robin who had
                  a nest of very young ones in the neighborhood, said he was a fool, and scolded him
                  for disturbing the children; while his wife, alarmed at such unaccountable
                  behavior, ordered him immediately to bed, and told him she was ashamed to see him
                  going on so like a crazy unpuritanical nightingale.</p>
               <p>As to the particulars of the wedding, and Angeline's pride and delight at being
                  permitted to stand as bridesmaid<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6366-00000202"/> maid
                  to her in whom she was now to find something even dearer than a friend, we do not
                  consider it important to describe them in detail. It may be well, however, to
                  mention that the Governor himself was among the guests, and that he and Mr.
                  Harding together considered that some credit was owing to them for their
                  penetration with regard to the superiority of the Quaker's daughter; and that he
                  playfully threatened the bride after some such fashion as this, putting on a
                  portentous frown:</p>
               <p>"Ah, we have found thee out at last, my obstinate little Quaker; now I see who
                  those friends of thine were, and look to it that we do not summon ye all to appear
                  before the council to-morrow and answer for these doings!"</p>
               <p>And further, on another occasion he was heard to say to little Charity: "That was
                  a brave maiden, my girl, and if thou dost equal her in truth and courage, right
                  proud will thy father be to call thee daughter!"</p>
               <p>It was remarked by Angeline on that happy morning that the tree nearest the house
                  was literally covered with feathered songsters, and that they seemed to be
                  celebrating a jubilee. She noticed one in particular on the very topmost branch,
                  which bent and waved with his weight; she described him as a bird of the gayest
                  plumage, no doubt an oriole, and he seemed to be the leader of the choir, the
                  governor of the birds, as it might be. No fiddler in the ecstasies of his musical
                  enthusiasm ever cut more capers than did this peculiar bird. Angeline threw out of
                  the window a handful of crumbs of the wedding-cake, and a number of the birds
                  hopped down and partook of the entertainment. The gay fellow appeared determined
                  that all should have a taste, from the oldest to the youngest, and busied himself
                  in flying up and down, waiting on such as, either from extreme youth or age, were
                  unable to help themselves; and when the fair bride came to the casement to look at
                  them, this same oriole was particularly ecstatic, and flew around her head three
                  times, as if he was inclosing her in a charmed circle. Year after year these
                  orioles built their nests in the tree, and grew so tame that they would sit upon
                  the window-sills and sing.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding Edith's marriage, Maretah continued to consider her her own
                  peculiar charge, until by and by, when she used to sit upon the nursery floor with
                  a group of brown-eyed, thoughtful-looking little ones gathered close around her,
                  listening eagerly to the stories of her forest life, and hearing her chant her
                  wild wood songs and legends.</p>
               <p>Occasionally they heard of Henriette in her distant seclusion, where she was
                  considered a model of a devoted Christian. She inflicted upon herself such marvels
                  of austere discipline, and bore herself with such marked decision of conduct, that
                  in time she became Abbess of the monastery in which she at first took<pb
                     n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6366-00000203"/> refuge, and Edith learned, through one
                  who had visited her retreat, that she was earnestly engaged in a project for
                  converting Quakers to Catholicism.</p>
               <p>There is one circumstance we almost forgot to mention. One day, shortly after the
                  marriage of our heroine, it happened that Mrs. Hermon casually remarked to her
                  that she had in her drawer a miniature of a very dear friend of her early youth,
                  to whom she was bound by ties of no ordinary school-girl affection, and that she
                  had been many times perplexed on looking at her, to remember what association it
                  was that connected her with her past life. She then mentioned the sketch in the
                  possession of Angeline, and sent the little girl to bring both that and the
                  picture from her bureau. As soon as she displayed the miniature, Edith uttered an
                  exclamation of delighted surprise, accompanied by a burst of tears.</p>
               <p>"It is my own dear mother!" and taking the counterpart from her bosom, she opened
                  it to the astonished eyes of Mrs. Hermon.</p>
               <p>"Henriette knew it! I remember now she made some allusion of the kind before she
                  went away."</p>
               <p>How Mrs. Hermon regretted that she had not obeyed the first impulse of her heart,
                  in taking the Quaker's daughter to her bosom! "And now, my dear child, doubly dear
                  as Margaret's daughter, it only remains for me to make the future atone for it

               <p>OUR story of the "Quaker's Daughter" is well-nigh ended. After patiently enduring
                  her many trials she was rewarded with a happiness so richly merited. It must not,
                  however, be supposed that her future was an uncheckered scene of ease and
                  enjoyment; for the violent and intolerant spirit of the time, though quenched in
                  her particular case, still lived and held its sway. Her kind heart never ceased to
                  warm toward her father's sect, whose religious opinions and straightforward
                  conscientiousness, she learned in her days of adversity to regard with the
                  reverence that was their due, and when she heard of their sufferings and sorrows,
                  her tender spirit grieved for, and longed to relieve them, and many an oppressed
                  and downcast heart was cheered and encouraged by her charitable ministrations.
                  True to her father's teachings, no fear of man ever turned her from the path of
                  duty. She trod the onward way, secure in the principles by which she was guided,
                  and continued to win and retain the respect of all who knew her; while, seeing her
                     example,<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6366-00000204"/> many took courage and began
                  to walk fearlessly in the plain path before them. Her husband and Mr. Harding
                  stood foremost among those who obtained from the king his merciful interposition
                  in behalf of this oppressed and much slandered, though peculiar people, and when
                  the prison doors were thrown open and they went forth once more in freedom, many a
                  blessing fell upon the home that sheltered her and was made glad and happy by her
                  presence.</p>
               <p>The world is aware that the early history of the Quakers in New England fills a
                  page in her records which the descendants of our Puritan ancestors would gladly
                  seal forever from the eyes of men. The time of these occurrences is yet too recent
                  for justice to either party to be awarded. The consciousness of a cruel
                  intolerance on the one hand, and the rememberance of wrong on the other, are too
                  fresh in the minds of their descendants, and years must pass away before either
                  can regard the other with impartiality. But our historians and others should
                  remember that the blot is only made deeper through attempts to excuse those deeds
                  of cruelty by false representations of their victims, and it becomes the duty of
                  every faithful representative of those times, to depict their characters with
                  fairness, and to do justice to the motives that influenced their conduct.</p>
               <p>We trust the time is not far distant when the spirit that still characterizes New
                  England men, especially her clergy, will give place to a more enlightened feeling
                  of Christian brotherhood. Let it be remembered that time was when the Quakers
                  stood alone against abuses that are now cried down by the voice of the majority,
                  and if their peculiarities are fast disappearing from our sight, their principles
                  remain.</p>
               <p>The good grain is winnowed and gathered into our garners, while the useless chaff
                  is scattered by the winds of Heaven.</p>
