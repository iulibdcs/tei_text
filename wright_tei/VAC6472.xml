               <pb n="0-5 (TitlePage) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000001"/> t-riig ivy of (te porch ar'a nroid the plain gilt firame. was wined a wrea h of fresh spring flow- ers, with the one word ** Welcore!"just'beneath. At sight of this, the crowd, who halted just out- side the gate, cheered loudly. But when the door opened, and the Mt'y Queen stood alone within the porch, beneath the picture, they cheered more loudly still. Well might they call 1Rose Martin the "Pride of the Downes". She was only the child of a day laborer, it is true; bat many a nobleman's daughter would have given her eyes--and ears,' too-to Dossess such a face ant lorin. She was very tall and very slender; and her figure, in its bending grace, resembled the willows that droop tlhir green branches over the still surface of some quiet inland lake. Iler hands and feet were exquisitely small; her arms beautifully roundl d, ond as white as snow ; while her bust, hcif vailed, half dllden by the transparent ker- chief she wore above her velvet bodice, mlight have served a painter or sculptor for a model of the beautiful Psyche. Iler complexion was of that clear yet delicate lhue one sees so often in these northern isles; fiir as a lilv, with a f tint touch' like the tintof a rose-leafon either check, and a deeper crimson on' the small ha:lf-parted lips, that revealed, when they smiled, teeth as small and white as fine eed-pearls. 'The out- line of her faEe was of the most delicate oval; the corners of her mouth drooped slightly ; so did the nrchnig wyebrovfs, the better to harmnon- ize with the lrtige, melahnchly dark blue eyes. The golden hair fell down upon her shoulders in a mass of glittoring curls, and she wore a wreath similar to that with which she had doco- rated the portrait of her Queen Between tlose pale spring flowers and her own delicate, pa- thetic beauty, there was a strange and signifi- cant resemblanlce. which strqck the learts of the rudest spectaltors there with a feeling al- most akin to pity and awe. For a rionie. t shle stood alone, till the loud shouts of welconme died away. Then a hand- some young man of twenty-two, wearing a dress of Lincoln green, and' a bow and quiver at his side, came up the path and too! her by the hand, It was Iugh Denunet, the young blacksmith, and the owner of "White Surrey", her acknowl-  edged lover and chosell escort for tne day. With all his heart in I is eyes, he looked at her, she smilied ftintly upon hm. and let him lead her down to the gate. White Surrey neighed  his welcome; she mounted; and the procession  moved away toward the wide common whion  gave the village its peculiar name. ClHAPTIER II. AT THE; PIt3SaUNCE. While " the people-'c thus celebrating the  Coronation of the fair May Qucen, the "a ristoc-  racy" of Downe looked on at the pageant with  balf patronizing, half contemptuous smiles. ,       ,              .   There were ealger faces, it is true, at every door and window, as the gay procession passed through the town, and some of the ladies actually waved their embroidered handkerohiefs in-token of their gracious approval of the pro- ceedings, Later in the day, the same ladies, es- corted by their husbands, fathers, or brothers, would appear upon the common to watch the dancing round the May pole; but that would be the extent of their participation in the festivi- ties. They would drink the health of thl Queen and the new-born Prince at dinnethat day; but the revels going on around them weie too vul- gar for them to share, except as distant specta- tors; because the gardeners, and blacksmiths, and farm-l;lborers of the village took an active part therein. As the procession turned down the broad road that led straight from the village out upon the common, or "Down", the May Queen look- ed up, with an expression of eager interest and expectation, at a square, old-fashioned, cream- colored house, with porch and portic6, and green Venetian blinds, that stood in its own grounds at the right-hand side of the graveled footpath. It was one cf those sturdy, comforta- hble, reipectable-looking places, that suggest the idea of wealth, and ease, and snugness, the mo- ment the eye rests upon themu. Standing a little way Tack from the road, beneath the shadow of its immediate elms; with a flower-garden to the righlt, and a grassy lann and paddock on the left; while far behind it lay the open common and tCle smiling Surrey hills- it seemed a home wlhere the most restless spirit might be content to fold its wings, secure of peace and happiness, not for a time, but for ever.  But the May Queen was too young and too happy to care much for theboutward aspect of ar house. It is only when we are old and gray, and scarred with nmany wounJls;"hat we begin to study the appliances sfde-comforttwith which the world is so replete, provided we-have thewhere- with to purclase them. In our young days it is the inhabit:aus that make the house, not the hoqse that makes the inhabitants, by its pleas- urea and its ease. So Rose Martin, gazing up at the cream-colored walls and swaying trees of the Pleasaunce, was thinking much more of some one who dwelt there than of the place it- self. -  The windows of thiouse were all open. Up in the attics, the servant-girls belonging to the es- tablishment were nodding and smiling to their friends in the procession. From the drawing. room, three handsome ladies, whose ages rang- ed from twenty to twenty-five, looked out and waved their handkerchiefs, and bowed gracious- ly to White Surrey's gentle rider. Yet he looked disappointed as she returned their salu- tations. Thle face she had hoped to soe was not there. Farther on, however, by t!hp postern gate tha    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6472-00000002"/> led into the grounds, she recognized the object of her search, and her face brightened visibly. It was not, a young gentli man, as night have been supposed, from the glad smile and quick blush-it was simply a young lady,'wlho stood with the gate half open, and leaned out to take a better look, as the well known faces and formus passed by. The rustics knew her well; and the young men made awkward bows, and the girls dropped shy courtesies, as tley p:ssed. She acknowledged their greetings with a graceful bend of the head; but her eyes were fixed upon the May Queen, who now rode in the-rear, with Hugh Dennett in close attendance at her bridle rein. White Surrey neighed as he reached the postern-eate; and the lady, stepping forward, patted his arch- ing neck, as shle looked up into his rider's face. Never was there a greater contrast between two of the sime bright age. The lady of the Pleasaunce was quite as tall as the fair May Queen, and her figure had the same slight and willowy build. Her hands and feet were also small and delicately made; but there all resem- blance between the two ceased. One had blue eyes, and golden hair, and perfect features, and a-complexion like blended roses and lilies; the other had a round, girlish face, where every feature seemed out of proportion to an artistic eye. The forehead was very high and broad; the eyebrows were slight and irregularly arelied; the nose was decidedly retroussee, the mouth large, and, even in repose, marred by a slight- ly sarcastic exprcssion; and the lower part of the face was too square to gi e promise of much beauty of outline when the bloom of youth had gone. To contract, in a measure, these defects, the lady had abundant braids of soft brown hair; dark-gray eyes that changed their ex- pression with her every changing mood; white teeth, and a good-tempered smile that displayed them often enough in the course of the day. But, with her indifferent features and indifferent complexion, she was anything but i beauty; and she knew it very well. She was by no means contented with this knowledge. She adored beauty in every shape and form; and to feel that she herself was posi- tively and undeniably ugly, was, at times, the bitterest of mortifications. In alter. years, ihen beauty would have been more valuable than pearls or precious stones to her, sie feltits want more keenly still. But even at this early age, she gazed into the lovely face of the May Queen with a jealous, envious, aching at her heart that she could not or, rather, would not have put into words. Rose Martin was quite unconscious of the feeling her beauty Frovoked. That plain face was fairer than any other in the world to her. Marian Moyell, the orphan cousin and despised prot6gee of the ladies of the Pleasaunce, was  still many degrees in life above the village belle. K   It seemed a species of presumption in Rose to Ipity or to love her; and yet she did both. Every Sunday she looked toward the Pleasuance pew, and was rewarded by finding those dark- gray eyes fixed steadily upon her face; each lime she passed the Pleasuance gates, she gazed at the house, and wondered where M]iss Marian was, and what she was doing; and now, on the day of her simple triumph, its glory would have been tarnished,its happiness quite dimmed and overshadowed, if Marian had not been there to see. Wlry this should be, neither slre nor the lady of the Pleasuance could very well say. "And so," said Marian, speaking in A low, soft tone, "you are Queen of the May, once  more. You are Queen every year-arp you not?"  "Yes," said Rose, blushing and smiling at the thought c f all that her admission implied "Tey will go en crowning you, I suppose, till you are old and ugly, if such a thing can ever be! Well, it is a fine thing to be young and happy, and beautiful, and beloved, as you are! To see every eye grow brighter for your coming; to hear every voice take a lower and gentler tone for your ear; to know that no one can look at or listen to you without longing to look and listen again; what a happy life it must be to live!" "I am very happy," said Rose, looking down into the serious uplifted face, with a doubting, puzzled expression. "All the better," answered Marian, with a smile. ' And so, fair May Queen, good-bye; but wear this for the sake of one of your sub- jects, who is very loyal to your beauty, though she may not follow in your train." Sie placed a small morocco case in the young - girl's hand, open'ed the little postern gate, and was gone. When Rose recovered from her astonishment, she opened the case and found a small brooch, made in the shape of a forget-me-not, with a twisted gold stem, and blue enameled leaves. "Ilow kind of Miss Marian! How generous I How good! She is a lady, every inch of her I Shle's not too proud to remember that it is May Day, and that we have a beautiful Queen!" Such were some of the exclamations that re- sounded on every side, as the pretty gift was  displayed. Rose said nothing; -but there was a tear in her eye when Hugh Bennett, assuming tie privilege of his position, fastened the orna- ment upon the front of the velvet bodice which she wore. The procession went gayly on toward the tents, where drums were beating, and flags were flying to welcome the young Queen to her floral throne. While she assumed it, triumph- ant in her youthful loveliness, 4and blushing ab the praises which met her on every Bide, what did iMarian Moryell do?   The postern-gate adlitted her into the pad- dock. Crossing it by a side path, and passing the offices, she ascended a flight of worm-eaten, dangerous-looking, wooden steps, that led from the court-yard, up into an old store-room, long since given over to solitude and decay by the owners of the mansion. It was a large loft, full of boxes, barrels, and the forgotten lumber of many years. There was no communication between it and the house, except by those rick- ety steps, and the long passages, or the offices, and no one ever cared to come near the place except Marian ; and she, for this very reason, often sought refuge there from the many annoy- ances heaped upon her by her cousins. Snub- bed, neglected, and 'despised though she might be within those stately walls, she had a place of refuge in this old, deserted loft, which no one ever dreamed of invading-whose very ex- istence .was unsuspected by her tormentors. And here, in reading, in writing, in rehearsing aloud many a scene from her favorite plays she had spent hours so happy, that she looked back upon the green old place, throughout her after life, with yearnings of the deepest and tenderest regret. With her own hands she had cleared away the lumber from the centre of the room, and arranged ii in a most orderly fashion around the walls. The one window of the loft looked out over the green paddock and the distant hills; and beside this window stood a small round table, and a low easy-chair, betraying, the student's favorite haunt. On one side of tile recess thus formed were some roughly- painted shelves, filled with books that had evi-' dentiy seen very hard service; on the other, hung a picture in a tarnished gilt frame-the portrait of a young man of twenty-two, with a face so beautiful that it seemed a shame to hide even the senseless canvas there. Between this picture and the living face of Rose Martin a strange resemblance existed, There was the same glorious complexion-the same bright golden hair-the features were alike, and so were the eyes in color and in form; though the bold, laughing glance of the portrait was the exact opposite of the May Queen's timid look. Before this picture Marian paused, with a look in which admiration and scorn were strangely blended. "( Always the same," she said, aloud. "Noth- ing but sickness, old age, or death, can take away charms like those. Oh, why was not I born beautiful, that I might win every heart and eye, as that man -must have done throughout his life-as Rose Martin is doing at this very moment, upon her throne?" Why, indeed? Except that, if all were so beautiful, the whole world would be in a flame, and that great pivot of " business" on which it moves would be at an utter and final stand-still,   Marian turned away with a heavy sigh. A faded robe of brocaded silk hung over the back of the easy-chair. She threw off her hat and scarf, and donned the once splendid garb, whose pale flowers looked paler still thus displayed in the bright glare of the sunshine. Searching in an old chest of camphor-wood, which held many of her treasures, Marian found a gilt diadem and a tinseled sceptre. She put the crown upon her brow, she took the sceptre in her hand, and folding the brocaded robe around her, began to walk up and down the loft with stately steps. She had left the world of reality behind her. She had gone out into the fairyland of romance, where, for the time, she was as beautiful and as graceful as the young May Queen herself. Ab- surd and ridiculous enough the fancy was, I know; but when a plain young girl can enjoy in a reverie the happiness of a petted belle really known, who can blame her if, for a mo- ment, she encourages the dream? Alas, for poor Marian! Her lovely visions were scared away by the most unlocked for, the most cruel of interruptions. Just as she saw herself, in imagination, the cynosure and delight of every eye, she heard an unmistak- able titter at the door, and a high, shrill voice exclaimed: "Capital! capital! Oi, girls, (do come here, and look at the second May Queen! She beats Rose Martin quite out of the field-does she not?" , Crimson with rage and shame, Marian turned round, and saw her three cousins standing in tlhe doorway. The titter ended in a loud, in- sulting laugh, as she tore off her robes and crown, and flung them, with the sceptre, pas- sionately upon the ground. -CHAPTER m. DREAM-LAND. "The night is in her hair, And giveth shade to shade; And the pale moonlight On her forehead white Like a spirit's hand is laid! Her lips part with a smile, Instead of speaking done;- I ween she thinketh of a voice Albeit uttering none!" -E. B. BaROWxmN Certainly, it was a most embarrassing position or poor Marian. No one likes to appear ridic- ulous in the eyes of others, and she was far more sensitive to the ill-natured raillery of her cousins than they ever dreamed. It was a species of martyrdom to bear their stinging jokes and keen sarcasms without flying into a rage, and de- lighting them by showing how deeply they- pained and wounded her.  h They entered the old loft with many jests and loud laughter-three young and handsome girls, who ought to have had more kindly consideration for their lonely young cousin, had they paused    <pb n="8" xml:id="VAC6472-00000003"/> to contrast her lot in life with theirs. They had lost their parents, it is true, but they had In- herited the Pleasaunce, and with it fine fortunes and a fine place in the world's regard. They had their stately and luxurious home, their well- trained servants, their carriages and saddle- horsed, their beautiful dress.- and magniticent jewels; and last, but not least, their famliar young lady friends and their devoted partners at balls and parties, who only wanted one word or look of encouragement to become their part- ners tr lift On 'he other hand, Maran was a poor little dependant--an orlhan, the secret of wiose birth was alluded to with a signficant re- serve.-a-young girl, without beauty, or grace, or accomiiislhm, nts, whose present was not too blisetul, and whose future promised a veiy!doubt- ful happin ss, at the most. She had neither money, friends, nor lovers. Shle had but one solace-her hour of romantic dreaminglin that lonely room-ad now t'ey had come to take even that poor consolation from her. She sto6d  looking at them, with the bitterest hatred in her  heart, as they flitted round the loft, examining I its old lumber, with bursts of joyous laughter.  A pretty place to stay in, upou my word!' said Miss Moyell at last     ' She was a tall, dark, brilliant beauty, whose I slightest glance looked sarcasm-whlose lightest  word spoke dislike to the lonely orphan who a had been left by the strict charge of her dying r father to her care. As she spoke, her younger  sisters, Julia and Caroline, who were twins, wth d brown eyes, brown hair, and rosy cheeks, came s and leaned over the back of her chair The s eyes of the three turned upon the unfortunate u Marian, with the same expression of covert mirth ca under which she had so often writhed before.  a "  A pretty place, upon my word i" repeted n Miss Moyell, slowly. "  Pray, what possesses be you to choose this dirty loft for your favorite retreat, when the drawing-room  is as free to th you as it is to us?" "I choose this place because I like it, Nora,"  was the giil's reply. "Indeed! Well, you may unlike it as soon ti( as you can. I shall have all this lumber stowed a away, and the place will be shut up," said Miss w M-yell, haughtily.             dis Marian made a gesture of despair.    j  if '"It is like you," she said(, bitterly. " You are sh cruel and unjust in everything to me; you are no never halpier than when' you are making me miserable  "I How can you say such a thing?" cried Miss thi Lucy. "   Because it is the truth, and you know it as an well as I," said Marian, passionately. " You all thi hate me-every one of you.  You and Caroline me are quite as bad as Nora. You never were kind or affectionate to m e in your lives, and of late wa you make a  mock and a jest of everything I say h -or do,"   ad  a"Beeauee .yon say and do such very ridicu. n- lous things," suggested Caroline. es  "'For instance," added Miss Moyell, "you ey dress yourself up in an old brocaded dressing- II- gown, and strut over the floor, with a crown on e- your head and a sceptre in your hand, after a ut fashion that would justify any one who cared ar less for your welfare than I do, il' sending you rs to H1anwell or Colney Hatch. Do you know rd what other people would say if they saw such t- pranks? Why, that you were mad! And I a don't think they would be very far wrong, of either." Marian sighed deeply. As she listened to this description of her appearance, the sweet dream that had enthralled her for the moment vanished, ard she saw herself in a new light-a poor absurd fool, who was only fit to make sport for those who were wiser and better suited to the every day world than she. "I suppose you are right, Nora," she said, kicking aside the robe, and sceptre, and crown. "I daresay I am mad, if the truth were known; and the best thing you can do is, to buy a cap and bells for me at once!" "How odd you are! I wish you would not make such queer speeches, people stare so! But I am glad I have made some-impression on you at last. I shall shut lup this old owl's nest; , and then, if you wrill only stay in Sthe drawing- room --and-wafk-1ot at proper times and seasons wilti our maid, or the footman, behind you, and do crochet work, and draw, and practice your songs-in a word, if you will behave as a re- spectable young lady ought to do you will find nothing to complain of in your home. Of course, you cannot expect us to, feel for you ex- actly as we do for each-other, because you are not a sister-you are only a cousin; lad don't be hurt, but you must know that the mystery about your birth ndakes some difference in one's thoughts of you." "C Can I help that?" asked Marian, her whole face turning crimson. "'No; no one said you could. i only men- tioned i, because, now that we are upon ;he subject, I may as well name everything. I want to make you understand that we do not dislike you personally, as you seem to think. If you could be more like other people, we should get on very well together-should we not, girls "  The twins assented. "It is your oddities that we object to, and that we laugh at. Now, look at the ease fairly, Marian. Tf you came into the drawingsrom, and found me masquerading in .uch a dress as that, what would you think?  That I was as mad as a March hare. You could not help it." Perhaps not," said Marian,- feeling that it was in vain to defend herself or the visions that had led her astray. "Well, then, why should you be so angry at    <pb n="Illustration-9" xml:id="VAC6472-00000004"/> our laghng at you? If you could only see yourself im1 one of these strange moods, Ma- rian!" "Well, let it pass, Nora! Say that I am dull, and stupid, and odd, and mild, if you like! But don't shut up this old loft! My haplpiest hours are spent here!" Tile twins looked at each other. "Such a dirty, dusty, dingy place,' Lucy!" ' My de:ir Caroline, you know that there is no accounting for tastes." . Marian did not heed them; She was looking almost in an agony of entreaty at Miss Moyell. That young lady held in her hands a power and a privilege which was alf the world to her cou- sin. She could shut up the loft, and no one could gainsay her will in so doing, if she chose to exercise it. Marian, proud as she was, would almost have gone down upon her knees, to pre- vent such a catastrophe. But, happily, no?ur- ther abasement was needed. "The loft slall remain as it is, since you d.- sire it so much," said Miss Moyell, at last, with the air of one who was conferring the greatest of favors. "But only on certain conditions- remember that." "Oh, I will do anything, so that I may some- times see this dear old room!" replied Marian, eagerly. "You are certainly mad; but this is neither here nor there. So you may keep the room, provided you only come to it when we do not want you in the drawing-room, or elsewhere." "Very well, Nora." "But we shall want you oftener than ever, now. We are going to have a houseful of guests.

"We will not trouble you with our )presence any longer. Are you going to the C'umiuon this afternoon?" "No." "What? Not to see the real, Queen Y" asked Caroline, with a malicious smile." "No ' "Why should she go to see a real Queen, when she can transform' herself into an ideal one, by the aid of a little tinsel, gold foil, and a' few yards of soiled brocade?" asked Miss Mo- yell, scornfully.  "Why, indeed?" added Lucy. And then, with a chorus of ringing laughter, they swept gracefully away. Marian, gathered up the despised robes, and hid them from her sight in the camphor-wood chest. Her heart was sore: she felt wounded, pained, and humiliated to the last degree. She knew well that no kindly feeling toward her- no wish to make her happy-had prompted that interview. The young ladies of the Pleas- aunce did not choose to have it said that their orphan cousin was treated unkindly by them ; and so, before their guests arrived, the role which she was to play was prepared for her. Well, she would play it, and be thankful that it was no worse! She locked the chest, and, go- ing to the door, looked out for an instant into the sunlit court-yard. Her face cleared and brightened suddenly. "Thank Heaven!" she enclaimed. "there is one place where neither they nor any other in- habitant of this house or village dare intrude. And I will go there at once. While the sun is shining. and the little birds are singing, I will be brave enough to go to Downe Reserve!"  CHAPTER IV. DOWNE RESERVE.

Silence, and peace, and rest were around the young girl, as she went on her lonely way. From the distant common, the shouts of tihe merry-makers came softened to the ear. The air was calm and mild ; the yellow sunlight fell upon the trees, and shrubs, and flowers; and the sky above was as blue and as mild as a baby's eye. The blessed influence of the hour and the    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6472-00000005"/> place could not be lost upon a heart liice Ma- rian's. Unconsciously even to herself, a better mood came over her ; her brow cleared, her eye brightened, and she drew a long, deep breath of exquisite enjoyment, as she gazed around. After all, the world was very beautilul and very peaceful; it was not,wortl her while to be an- gly, or hurt, or sad, beneath so sweet a sky and so bright a sun as that.  Musing thus, she turned into a wide, green lane, shadowed by old trees at its entrance, and leading out abruptly to the brow of a steep hill, from whence a view of the fertile and smiling country could be had for miles around, Marian paused there, as she always did, to gaze and admire. The valley immediately beneath was a mass of luxuriant and neglected verdure. It had once been a beautiful park, and the old stone mansion at its furthest extremity had been the seat of a stately hospitality-tLe home of sweet domestic joys. Now, all was changed. The house was in ruins-the grounds neglected and deserted-the estate itself laid out in fields and farms that stretched away to the right and the left, to the north and south, as far as the eye could reach. These fields, lying in brown fur- rows, and dotted here and there with modest homesteads, and groujps of barns, contrasted strangely with the gloomy waste from which they took their name. They were the " home farms" of Downe Reserve - pleasant, prosper- ous, and happy dwelling-places enough. But )Downe Reserve itself was a place to be spoken of in whispers -to be avoided by every one - to be passed at nightfall with quick footsteps and bated breath, as one might pass a lonely churchyard, where strange sights had been seen, and strange sounds heard, by many a belated traveler. Sights and sounds enough had been seen and heard at Downe Reserve, if one might credit the tales that were rife among the village people. It was scarcely to be wondered at, for the place had borne an evil name for many a year.. The hamlet of Downe (so called from the wide com- mons or downs which stretched away on every ' side) had sprung into existence in the time of c-Henry the Eighth. Tile bluff monarch had hunted many a time in'the adjacent forests; and condescending to accept the hospitality of a sub- ject, when weary of the chase, had reposed at a little hunting-lodge, just beyond the com- mons, the property of Sir Francis Beaufort, lord of the malnor, ntd (I had almost said) lord of the people as well. Tile house which had been honored by a mon- arch's visit was, In due course of time, enlarged and embellished till it became a stately man- sion, fit for the seat of the noble family to whom it belonged. In after years, Queen Bess was welcomed there by another Sir Francis Beau- fort; and the royal lady, pleased with the mag- nifioence of her entertainment, and struck by   the seclusion and quiet of the place, suggested to her handsome host, as they p]ee I the moon- light terrace together, that, as he had rescued the place from the waste lands of the common on one side, and from the increasing hamlets on the other, it should be called "The Lodge" no longer, but rather "Downe Reserve". To hear was to obey, when such lips pronounced a wish or a command; and the estate was re-christened at once by its quaint and novel name. Year after year passed away. The gallant cavalier who paced thatiterrace, hat in hand, beside his queen, was dead and gone -the Queen herself was but dust -and Downe Re- serve entertained no more guests of royal blood within its hospitable halls, There was feasting and gayety enough there, however, and ladies far fairer than Queen Bess walked up and down the terrace, with more than one handsome cav- alier in attendance. Hearts were lost and hands were won within those leafy bowers. There were bridals in the old church, christeniigs inithe great hall, coffins carried down the long avenue to the family vault-the same drama, in aword, of life, of love, and of death, that is 'played, day after day, in the highest, as in the lowest, homes of the land. But through all these changes, one thing unchanged was noticed. Many a bride came to Downe Reserve; yet from each marriage sprung only a son and heir. There was always a Sir Francis Beaufort to succeed his father- hut never a son or daughter more. And an old village tradition, which every Beaufort, as well as every cotter's child, knew by heart, ran thus: "When Downe Reserve shall lack its heir, Shame and remorse will linger tlele! With flower on tomb, and moss on stone, Many a year will have come and gone! Then the dark clouds will clear away, And a fairer hand will take up the sway! Fair hand! steel glove! not long they reign! Clouds and storms will gather again! *   *   *   *   *    * Then comes the fairest! Who would not serve? All hail to the Ladye of Dawne Reserve! It was a mysterious prophey ; but it con- cerned none of the Beauforts for many a gener- ation, so they could afford to jest. and make merry with its grim predictions. It was a pe- culiar 'subject of mirth to the Sir Francis Beaufort who lived at Downe Reserve during the reign of George the Fourth. Tall, fair, blue-eyed, and golden-haired, like all'his race, he possessed so much of the traditional beauty of the house, that he was known at the Court by the nick-name of "Handsome Sir Frank", and petted and made 'much of by those fair dames, some of whom, if we may credit histori- cal traditions, were not very much better than they should have been. Handsome Sir Frank was also gay Sir Frank-gambling, drinking, betting Sir Frank; and if all thie tales were true, the life of his lady could not have been a very -.9   happy one. Poor thing I she was neither beau- tiful, wise, witty, nor agreeable. She was only rich, and for her money the dissipated baronet had married her! She staid quietly at Downe Reserve while Sir Francis was amusing himself in London - a pale faced sad-looking lady, whose whole existence seemed wrapt up in that of her son and heir-a boy of about six years of age. Never was there a child more carefully watch- ed and tended; never a child that better repaid such excessive care. He was as beautiful as a dream, and as pure as an angel-fit rather for heaven than for earth, his poor mother used to think, as she watched over him with her trem- bling love. And to heaven he went For lean- ing over the lake within the grounds ,one day, to watch the sailing of his little boat, he sud- denly lost his balance and fell in. His agoniz- ed mother sprang to the spot-her screams soon brought assistance; but it was too late When they laid him upon the bank, with his little ship in his hand, he was dead. Lady Beaufort was borne senseless to the house. She never recov- ered from that stupor; and the next day mother and child were lying in state together, and Sir Francis, summoned from his revels in London, was weeping ajd wailing at their feet. The first part of the prophecy was thus ful- filled. Downe Reserve at last "lacked its heir"; and the simple villagers were all on the qui vive, to know what dire catastrophe was to follow. They had not long to wait. The place of Lady Beaufort was soon filled by a tall, stately woman of thirty, who bore her title, and occupied her rooms-but who was not to be visited! The country magnates gave this de- cision with looks of shocked propriety speak- ing of her not as Lady Beaufort but as "that creature". And so Downe Reserve had, for the first time, a mystery within its walls. Four years passed away. "Lady Beaufort" never ventured beyond her own wide domain, and her existence was almost forgotten. Sud- denly the village was startled by a most unex- pected and mysterious event. A stranger ar- rived late one evening at the "Beaufort Arms". He was a dark, handsome man, apparently about forty years of age, very silent and reserved, perhaps a little haughty in his manner. He alighted from his horse, desired that it might be eared for, asked the way to Downe Reserve, and set off for that place on foot. He never return- ed. And when the landlord, after the lapse of - three days, went, with some fear and trembling, to ask his pleasure concerning his horse, and the portmanteau left with it, he found the Hall shut up, and master, mistress, and servants gone. Not a living thing was to be seen upon the Dremises. The next week, the family solicitor cam down, and made arrangements for selling the estate, ia farms, Sir Francis, he said, was about tt   I take up his residence abroad. iHereupon, the landlord began to tell ls tale. The solicitor heard him through, turned a little pale, took snuff, and mused a little while. "Lady Beatfort's brother, no doubt," he said, at last, "He went abroad witl them. They are all eccentric-and you may as well keep the horse, landlord, but give the portmlanteau to me, and I will send it to him, and mention the animal at the same time " The untouched portmanteau was given up, and the lawyer went back to town. In a few weeks he wrote to say that the'landlord might keep the horse for hls tiouble; and that the former owner was with his sister in Italy. The estate was, parceled out into farms-tenants were speedily found-and the house was left alone, to go to rack and ruin as it might.  Over all these strange doings the villagers wondered and pondered with puzzled heads By and by came a fresh report from the desert- ed house.  "Downe Reserve" was haunted! Crjes and moans were heard there at nightfall, -gights were seen in the windows, and at mid- nit a woman' sometimes stood at the great hall-do r, wringing her hands and beckoning to Y the passers-by. Of course, on seeing 'her, they took to their heels as fist as po-sible. No one was found courageous enough to face the ghost, and solve the mystery of its appearance, and by degrees the place. was shunned by young and old alike. In all the village no one would have been found brave enough to go there alone, even by daylight, except Marian Moyell. And I doubt if her courage would have stood the test of the lone midnight hour, and the weep- ing woman at the door. She was not thinking of the ghost as she Bqtood looking down upon the quiet valley that pleasant May morning.  A verse of an old hymn was in her mind. By and by she sang it in a low, sweet voice, that suited the quaint air better than a more powerful one would have done: "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living green- So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between." "'o rolling flood here, however, unless the lake where that poor little child was drowned, may stand Win its place," she said, an instant after. "But how fair and calm it is! I will go down and d:inl; at the Wishing Well." She went down the steep hill. At its foot, rose the park-wall of Downe Reserve. From that wall a stone arch projected-sheltering and covering a small spring that filled a rocky basin beneath, and then trickled away in a silver rivulet to the lake within the grounds. Above the arch was carved, in quaint old letters, the legend: "Wishe, ladye, before thatte ye dlrinke: Itt shalle be yours. the thynge thatte ye thinke." A broken rusty chain dangled from the wall,    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6472-00000006"/> but the cup it had once supported was gone. Marman paused a moment, and wished her wish "If that portrait in my study would but come to life, attl hlove me!" She took some water in the hollow of O e, hand and drank three times. Then flinging the last drops in the air, she left the well, and walk ed round to the great gates of Dowu'e Reserve. CHAPTER   V.

"Wlnat is it, lady fair?" lie asked, putting down the cup of water winch lie Ilha just brongri fI'oru an old well behind the house. "Have I scared x ou to deathl by my abrupt appearance, or turiIed you into stone?" Thie picture!"' said Marian, in a low voice, without removing lher eyes frorn his face. "What piceture?" The one I had the auJac- ity to skel ch half air hour ago?" "No, the picture in the istudy," sire said, in the same low tone, turning half away friom hiim as she spoke. "And about which you wished?" he said, with a quick bright smile. "Yes." "What of it?" "You are like--oh, so like!" The young artist sprang forward, aad took her by the hand, with a profound obeisance. "You wished a wish about that picture fair ladv. What if it hIas been granted?" His light laugh and mocking tone dispelled the strange fancy that had been lingering an instant ini Marian's ririntd. "No," she said quietly, "you are not the picture, you are only very like it. It is strange." "Is the picture handsome?" "The m,st beauti:'ul thng I ever Paw in the whole world," shle answered earnestly. The young man co,lored like a girl-lauglhed, and shook back his beautiful golden hair-. The complimc:nt was not undeserved, for he really was like the portrait. He was tall and slender, with a natural ease and grace of manner that suggested patrician birth and gentle breeding to the most careless observer. His forehead was dazzlingly white and fair, and shaded by golden curls as soft and fine as floss silk. lHis eyes were large and blue, laughing and spark- ling in their liquid light, with his every passing thoughte. His clieet were tinted with a deli- cate peach-like bloom, his mouth was small and beautifully formed, his teeth like pearls, and I his chin rounded and dimpled like that of the d G.,d of Love himself. Tte dark blue shooting- ti jacket and straw hat which  lie wore gave no  clue to his uank or circumstances; b itu the blue silk handkerchief knotted under his   tcollar was fastened with an orientasl iearl ojh ig great size aund ,urity, and a dini lron of the first rie water blazed upon  his sRall white hand.

The young artist worked with a will. and laid down his pencil, at last, with an air of satiefsi- tion. "Really, it looks very well," he said, and held up tihe book for Marian's inspection. She looked at it with a .Iy smile.. All the    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6472-00000007"/> accessories to the scone were portrayed faithful- ly enough-the green lane, the overhanging trees, and the arched stone well, with its broken chain. But whence came the grace and beauty in the form and face of the girl who paused to drink? Was it possible other eyes saw her like this,? while her own descried nothing but ugli- ness, and awkwardness, and other defects equal- ly un pleasing. "Well, do you like it?" asked the artist, looking a little disappointed at her long silence. "Very muncl, indeed. It is wonderfully well done. But I think you have idealized the fi- ure a little." "No," he said, with perfect 'seriousness, as lie gave some last touches to the sketch; "I am thoroughly honest; I never flatter, either with my pencil or my lips. I have drawn you as you are." "But I am so ugly; and that picture is al- most good-looking!" blurted out. poor Marian, turning scarlet the next instant at the speech. She had thought aloud without meaning it, and was ready to run away and hide herself, when i those beautiful blue ees turned upon her with a glance of grave surprise.

Beautiful people f sometimes s,-emi possessed with the most kindly feelings toward others not so fortunate as them t selves ; an I Lle artist understood the hopeless is timid speech, almost better than Marian, if such L a thing were possible.

But I sluppose that does not content you. n You would rather have been a pink and white doll, I dare say?" "That I should!" said Marian, so frankly that he burst out laugling. "Yes; it is all w1 very well for you to laughl,' she went on, wit afi sigh. "Nothing calr take from you, or from Rose Martin your blue eyes, your golden hair, and your delicate complexions-nothing except sickness or death.

"A true beggar's wallet-a bag like old Edie Ochiltree's," he said, opening it, and displaying some very tempting-looking sandwches, the, half of a cold fowl, a knife and fork, a drinking-' cup, 'and a wicker-cased bottle. "Here is no plate, my dear lady, but at least we need not eat with our fingers, thanks to the knife and fork. What shall 1 have the pleasure of help- ing you to?" "I will take a sandwich." "And a fragment of chicken, I hope. There, now, you look comfortable." "And romantic," said Marian, slyly, as she eat her sandwich'. "Oil, even an artist cares little for romance, when his dinner is in question. Th'ere is some fine old sherry; will you have a glass?" "I should prefer water." "You have only to command, and I obey." He took the drinking-cup, and brought it back in an instant, filled to the brim. "Pray, have you a storehouse behind these old ruins?" asked Marian, laughing. ",Each time I have seen you disappear around the cor- ner, you have returned with your hainds full." "There is a well at the bIack, and I hid my provisions there out of sight, so that they might not make me phngery before the proler' time. I little thought theni that I should have so fair a guest at the banquet. Let mne give you a little more chicken."   He made a plate of a sandwich, carved a slice from the breast of the fowl, and ofifered it with playful gallantry upon bended knee. "If my cousin Leonora were to see you now!" said Marian. "Leonora-what a .pretty name!  Who is she?" "Miss Moyell, of the Pleasaunce." The artist ruse to his feet with a look of gen- uine surprise. "Indeed! Aind may I ask your name 2" "I am Marialn Moyell." "Of the Peasaunce also?"  "Yes." "Thanks! I suppose I ought to return con- fidence for confidence. My name is Francis-- Francis Beaufort." Marian started. "Why, that is the family. name of the owners of Downe Reserve!" "Yes." "'And the old legend-have you ever heard it?" "Often. But I am not the missing heir; I wish I was. 1 am only a distant relation of the old Beauforts-a descendant of one of the fami- lies into winch they married ; so that unless I am lucky enoiiglihto find the fair lady spoken of in the last part of thie legend-and luckier still in inducing hier to love. me-I shall never, reign at Downe Reserve '" "There are two ladies spoken of in the le- gend,"-said Marian, musing ly. "1 know. Ami to choose between them? Then I will takethel last, because, if I remem- ber rightly, she is to be the fairest." Marian ceased to smile. f"Always the same," she said, bitterly. "A fair face before everything else. It is the way with the world, and with you." "Good gracions! how sensitive you are, if even my light jesting about a lady who may be born centuries aftl er I am in my grave, can pain you! How foolish-of you, Marian!" "It is foolish. I know; and yet the mere thought malkes me sad," she said, looking up into his face, wi Ii eyes that told far more tlian she knew. Men are made up in equal parts of vanity and self-conceit, and the artist was not proof against tthe unconscious flattery of her words and glance. "You need not make yourself uneasy," he said, in a toie that brought the warm blood to her cheeks. "You have a prior claim to my regard, by reason of the words you spoke an hour or two ago, pit the Wishing Well." Marian did ,not answer. All her life long her dream had been of one true heart to love her. Was that dreamn aloutto be made real? Would this bright and beautiful creature ever be hers, to have and to hold at her own will and pleasure, till death came to part them? She sat pondering over her new-born wishes   'and hopes, while her companion, having finish- ied his meal, threw away the fragments upon the grass, and placed his satchel beside ihis sketch- book. Having tinus disposed of all encum. brances, he turned to her with a look of boyish fun in his sparkling eves. "Maid Marian, I have such an idea!" "What is it?" "Were you ever inside this old house?" "Oh, no!" "Then you shall be to-day; that is, if you choose." "What do you mean?" "I am sure thalt, some of these bolts and bars must be as weak as t willow twig. I will try them, at all events. If we can get in through a window-"          g     s  "The house is as empty, and dark, and silent as a tomb," said Mariain, looking half-frighten- ed and half-pleased at the proposal. "We shall be able to fill it, I think, and could make noise enough to scare away a hundred ghosts. if they were there. For the rest, I have some wax tapers in my pocket; they will give'- light enough for our purpose, and we, shall have the satisfaction of knowing that we have done what no one else in Downe has dared to do. Will you come?" Marian hesitated a moment: a dim notion/if the impropriety of the proceeding shocked ker, while its romance was the strongest of tempta- tions. If Francis Beaufort had been older in appearance or in manner, she might have re- fused; blut he was such a boy-so free from ev- ery thought of wrong or harm-so intent upon the thing, merely as an adventure, that she felt angry with herself for looking upon it in any other light. Add to this, that the fire'fond fancy of the girl was working at her heart, mak- ing everything lie did or saiu seem right in her eyes, and it will be understood that it was not long before her consent was given to"the esca- pade. "What a capital girl you are not a bit of nonsense or affectstion about you!" said Francis, joyfully. "Come along, and" we will soon find our way into the old shell." They sought in vitin for an entrane in front: every door and window was still securely closed. But at the back, the shutters of a small win4ow were hanging so loosely, that tw-a or three vig- orous, united pulls brought them down in a hundred pieces on their heads. "Are you hurt, Marian Ir" asked the artist, anxiously, when the first shock of the accident was over. "No," she answered, stoutly, wiping the dust and dirt from her face. "  All right, then ; it will be much easier than I thought. Can you climb?" "Like a cat." "Bravo!  You ought to have been a boy,    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6472-00000008"/> and we would have Lrone to sea together, some finu day. Let mie-go first " He climbed up the rough stones, and shooer the rotten frainle of alt-*inddw, till it fell inward with a crash. Then leaping lightly in, he held out his hand to Marian, who had begun the as- cent alone. "What a lark!  Take care how you step! Now, in Nou come; and don't tread on the broken class." Therp was a short pause-a sharp scratch, that made Marian start in the darkness, though she knew very well what it was; then the wav- ering flamue of a match, kindled into the steadier flame "f a simall wax taper, and they were safe within the walls of the haunted house.

The peculiar situation in which the young ar- itst and his companion found themselves, would have proved a more difficult and embarrassing one had either felt nervous or afraid. Marian's heart beat a little quicker, and the blue eves of Francis glanced sharply on every side. Neither of them thought for a moment of retreating. 4 Ihe window through which they had forced an entrance admitted them only into a dark and narrow passage, with an oaken door at the far- i their end. The fastenings of this door resisted t their united strength for a long time. At last, with a desperate tug, the iron latch gave way, ( the door fell back with a .heavy clang, and a 1 r.,sh of .cold. damp air came full in their faces, I and extinguished the taper which Francis car- t ried. '"Adventure Nq. 1," said Marian, quietly. c "IHave vou any matches?"          c "Plenty.  What, a trump you are, Marian! D Any other girl would hav e screamed the i'oof of il the house off," le said, lighting the taper again I and looking at her with a glance of unmistakable 1( admiration.        \ A   lovely color suffused her cheeks. ' It was n o  sweet to be praised by him, that if a whole a regimenrt of ghosts had laid hands upon her then so and there, she would scarcely have uttered a it cry. Thus, even among the rooms of that de- tl serted home, the flower of young love was bloom. ing, and the gardener knew it not.      i 6t   ae  The taper lit, they looked aromnil. Tley stood in the great banquetinig-hail. where King t Harry and Queen Bess had feasted in their time. IThe tapestry that hung upon the walls was tat- id tered and faded, and the family portraits rangel s- on high, were covered with spiders' welhs, and damp green mould, so that not a single face OI could be seen. A few gilded chairs were ranged ie at the lower end of the board, and a silver flag- oe1,- black with -age, was lying on the floor The i, lips that touclied it last had been mouldering h in the grave for manyta year. "-  ** Let us go," said 'Francis, with a slighIt shud. r der. "I hate your banqueting-halls, where the 'e guests are only shadows or ghosts. What s great, melancholy, dreaiy place it is! I do niol wonder that my namesake found it unenjura. ble." "I wonder' why he went so suddenly away,' said Marian, lingering in the hi:l. "How can I tell? Come, let us go up the stairs." They were many in number, very broad and wide, but so close together that it was quite an exertion to ascend tein. "It puts me in mind of my cntrance into tile great Pyramid," said Francis, ,musing half-way up. "O O Marian I how I should like to takq you up there! Only two hadies ventured in, and 1 think they were glad enough to get out again. Imagine yourself ia a dusty, dark, nar- row ctone passage on a broiling day, with two Bedouins pulling you by .tho arms; two more pushing you from behind, two more holding wretched little candles ,not half so large as this, anid a body-guard of a baker's doze i shouting in your ear, 'Wallah! Wallah! Backsheesh very good! English backsheesh very good!' or some such horrible doggerel, till you feel as if you were going mad. Imagine yourself now pushed down 'a slippery step; then dragged up an inclined plane, by steps cut in the rock; thi n aqueezed sideways through perilous p ssa- ges, where you hear, or fancy you hear, the dripping of water two or thiree hundred feet b'o- low you; then bent double, and puiahed, and hauled, and screamed at for about five minutes, till you emerge dusty, heated, torn, perspiring, deafened, and bewildered, in a great square chamber, where something like a stone wine- cooler is standing-the chamber of the Pyra- mid! By George, it makes me hot to think of it even now; and of those rascally Bedouins, Hamet and Abdallah, who stuck to me like leeches, for more backsheesh, till the sheikh of the village took compassion on me and same to my aid. Yet, after all, it was worth the trouble and the vexation to see that wide desert, those solemn Pyramids, the Bedouin tents, the graz- ing camels and buffaloes; the beautiful Nile, a tlhe blue Egyptian sky! '  Marian, leaning against the oaken balustrad gazed eagerly in his face as he spok. Her vivid".   fancy pictured the scene as lie described it; it wis almost like being on the spot in person, to hear him talk. A sigh brolke from her lips, and recalled him from the reverie into woich lie hiad unconsciously fallen. He could not help smil- ing as he looked at her rapt face, and tien glanced around the place where they stood. "We did not come here to talk of Egypt, I think," he saidl dryly. "Oh, tell me more! All my life long I have had a dream of the East-the land of the Arab- ian Night-!" "Yes, I read them again in Cairo and Alex- andria, and only had to look out of my window to see all the p)eople in the book, walking up and down the streets. But never mind them to-day. I will tell you more of Egypt another time ; but now we must look farther into the  m steries of Downe Reserve." As he spoke, a tofi, sigh soun-led audibly enough beside him. lie looklied at Marian, and saw that she had heard it too. "Tae wied," she said. And again tho sigh was repeated, but louder than before. Some sudden impulse made them gasp each other firmly by the lh;nd. "vA e will go on?" said Francis, iiiterrogativo- ly, and Marian answered very practically, by ascending another step. At the top 6f the stairs were the saloons and the withdrawing rooms-unt,uclied, as to their costly decorations, save by the hand of Time. But that had been busy einough. Tne polished wax floors were dull and black; i the great mir- rors were cracked, and dimn with dust; the gilt oornices were tarnished ; the bright colors of the velvet chairs and sofas had laded to a dull brown hue ; and thte toy French clocks, that were scatteried up'and down the room in great profusion. hiad all stopped at one hour, exactly aupon the stroke of twelve. This arrested Marian's attention. "I have heard," she said, "that if twenty French clocks were wound up together, set at the same hour, and left standing side by side, they would all get wrong again within thirty minutes. Now, here are one, two, three-eight blocks in all, and every one points to the same hour." "So did the great clock on the stairs," re- plied Francis. "I noticed as I passed, that it was upon the stroke of twelve." It was a simple remark, and yet Marian turn- ed pale, and lie felt a cold thrill run through his veins at seeintg-it. Why had those clocks all stopped to an instant? They left the grand saloons, and went up the next flight of stairs. Here they found the sleep- ing-rooms of the liouse opening out of a long gallery, and all furnished alikie, with hangings of dark green, moreen; that now looked black, as if the undertakers had been there. The doors all stood wide open, so that they could see   I them faintly by the taper's light as they passed. But the last door, at the end of the gallery, weaa closed. "We will go in here," said Francis. Again that quivering sigh sounded plainly in their ears, as they lifted the latch. Marian grew nervous, half expecting to see some hor- rible thing within. - But they only found themselves in a lady's boudoir, furnished with 'softly-cushioned chairs and sofias, and tables covered with delicate knick- nacks, such as women love to see. There were smll volumes bound in silk and gold ; there were crystal bottles with jeweled stoppers ; there were fans of carved ivory, boxes of sandal- wood, caskets of pearl and ebony, and a thou- sand other trifles that would serve to while away an idle hoer. The room had but one window; amid within the recess formed by the velvet cur- tains, stood a low chair iind a simall (able of ebony and gold. Beside the chair, and upon a silken ousion, lay a lute, a manuscript song, and a bouquet of dead, dry flowers. This, then, had been the boudoir of the last Lady Beaufort, and these were tie objects upon which her eyes had rested for many and many a day. Marian looked round with great inter- est. She took up one of the books; it was a volume of poems ; and upon the title-page was written: "Hermann to M. RItember the days of old, and be true, for they shall surely come to us again." She showed it to Francis. "Put it down," he said, abruptly, "Don't meddle with an) thing' here. I begin to feel very nervous, and to wish we had not come." "But why " "Did you nut IhI ar i:a; ,igh upon the stairs?" "Yes." "It came again outside this door." "I heard it." "It has been sounding in my ears ever since I came in here, and be hanged to mit! In five minutes more, I give you lair warning, that I shall take to my heels, and own that I am thor- oughly frightened.' IMarian laughed nervously. "Ugh! don't laugh here. How do you know who mayv be lsteniiiing to you?' I should just like to know the history of this room. There is something wrongii in It-I am sure of that. The whole houge is dismal and dreary enough ; but since I crossed -that threshold, I have felt my very blood grow cold. What can it be?" "How can I say?" said Marian, rather cross- ly, lest she also should have to oun that she began to 'feel afraid. "Don't talk about such tlings. Now we are here, we may as well see all that is to be seen." "Very well, if you insist upon it, so let it be. But before we leave tiiis room for the next one, just tell me if you see anything peculiar about.    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6472-00000009"/> "It is a pretty room." "That is not all ; it is in remarkably gooa preservation, do you not see? Down stairs all is ruin and desolation, dirt and discomfort; but here everything is brighter, cleaner. The color. have scarcely faded." "What can you mean?" said Marian, turning pale. "I'll be shot if I don't think that room is oc- cupied every day by the lady who sighed upon the stairs." At this speech, and the ideas it conjured up, Marian would certainly have fled, but that she fancied her companion was working on her fears. in oider to laugh at her afterward for givillg way to them. So, in the place of going back to the door of the ante room, sihe turned to tlha which led into the next apartment.' "'I am not going to leave one corner unvisit- ed;" she said, quietly, turning the handle as she spoke. Francis followed her into the room, bearing the light. It was a large and hahdsome chamber, fi..ed up with every appDlalce for ease and comfort. The walls were stained a pale rose-color; the hangings of lhe bed, and the curtains at the windows, were of the same delicate he.   n '"All is fresh here, too, you see," said Francis  significantly, as lie gazed around.     r "Be quiet-there is no damp here," was IMarian's sole reply  She approached the bed ; the silken coverlid  was gathered up in a heap, and the pillows were thrown down at the foot, while a chair near the bedsi le was overturned, and a writing-desk, ink- stand, and taper lay on the floor beside it. "Here the blow was struck!" said Francis, el in a tragic tone, as lie stood behind her.  Marian started violently. "What is that upoln the counterpane-upon the pillow?" ehe asked. "Iron-rust-mould-dust!" said Francis, leaning over witl the light to examine it. sa The next instant lie, too, started back, and caught her by the hand. "' O Marian, it is blood!" Marian turned while. He caught her in his arms. "  O my poor child, don't give way Let us get out of this terrible place, and then you will be better directly."  Half-leading, half-carrying her, he turned tow- wa ard the door;, but in his confusion he opened wri one which led into a small bath-room, the last apartment of the suite. It was empty, except ia for a great iron chest that stood in the middle, of the floor. Empty, did I say? As Marian iro looked in, she saw distinctly the figure of a pale, beautiful woman - itting upon tiha, clhest-a wom- tle an dresse, il, laek witih hr dark hair fallini in heavy mabses upon her shoulders, wriinging   o I er hands and weeping, as she looked toward the oou 'door. all  An instant, and the vision faded.- Nothing but was there-but the silenG room and the great iron or. chlest. ; Marian uttered a gasping sigh, and fainted. ing  Half-frantic with fear and horror, the young man caught her up in his arms, seized the burn- oc- ing taper, and hurried throu gh the other rooms, aon and down the stairs. As he gained the passage !eading from the hall, the fresh air struck upon i), her face, and ghe revived sufficiently to descend, he  vith his aid, from the broken window. In a 's. moment more they stood together upon the i g green turf of the lawn, safe ant sound, with the ck blue sky and the bright sun above them once aL agaiun. it-       CHAPTER VIII.

"How can you say so? I  saw her as plainly as I now see you!" "But, Marian-" "I tell you I did!" "What was she like?" "Tall and pale, with davrk eyes and hair. She was looking toward the door, and weeping and wringing her hands." Thle yong man looked incredulous and Mar- iau looked angry. r   I was not dreaming. She sat on the great iron chllest."

You were greatly excited, and your faint- ing-fit may have had something to do with it." ' low so, when it was the sight of the woman that miade me faint?" Francis shook his head with a faint smile. "I see you don't believe me. Never mind. I was once as incredulous upon the subject of ghosts as you are now.," "And you are converted?" "Perfectly." "You believe the place to be haunted?" "I do." "And that the woman stands at the door at midnight?" , "I can only say that I should be very sorry to come here at midnight in order t convince myself of that fact." ' I give you up. I thought you had a strong- er head"  'rSeeing is believing, all the world over" "Well, at all events, I am very sorry that I persuaded you into so mad a freak. Will you ever forgive me for frightening yoo?" "There is nothing to forgive. There is my hand upon it. And now I must go home.". "Not yet; it is not late." "It must be nearly two: it will be three be- fore I reach the Pleasaunce. There is no help for it; I must go." She held out her hand as she spoke To say the truth, she was anxious to go home from that evil spot, even though in leaving it she left him belind. But lie held her hand closely, and looked in her face with a saucy smile, as lie said: ' You are sure you have forgiven me?" "Yes." 'Then I shall see you again." "When?" "Never mind; leave that to me." "Do you live in Downe?" "Nay, that is my secret. I will tell you no more than this: thlat when, where, and how you least expect it, you will see ide again." "Very well."  "How coolly you say that? Have you any heart?" "A very large one." "And is there no corner in it-I anre not how small-thiat will welcome me again?" "I shall be glad to see you," she replied, evasively. "Truly glad?" "Yes." "Then good-bye, and don't dream of the ghost of Downe Reserve to'night; dream, rather, oi {ne."

"Nor hands nor cheeks keep separate, When soul is joined to soul!" she sang aloud as she entered the lattice-gate of the Pleaisaunce, and found herself face to face wltth herl cousin Leonora.

She would have entoyed the horrified start her cousin would hltve been sure to give at the men- tion of that fatal name.

It strikes me you are always doing that ' Walking and reading, or repeating -sentimental trash! What was that you were singing just now?" One of Elizabeth Barrett's poems." "Humph! if you would burn half yourbooks, and throw the other half into the river, it would be the best thing for you to do." "I happqn to have been born with a taste for reading and a passion for music," said Marian, quietly. "It is my misfortune, not my fault; and you ought not to blame me for it." Miss Moyell turned red. She had no ear for music, and could hardly manage to get through three consecutive pages of any author without falling asleep in her chair. She knew thatMar- i ian was clever, while, she was hopelessly dull, and hate,l her accordingly. But when the girl ventured to taunt her th the face witl the disa- t greeable fact, her rage knew no bounds.

Thanks to tihe 'exertion of Marian, and the servants placed,at k r disposal, tire Pleasaunce was in order Iy noon on the following day, and ready  to receive its expected Inmates. The state apartments were beautiful a with draperies, rose-colored silk, and soft white muslin curtains. Lord Mountchayne's bIed room, smelt like a flow. er-garden fanned by thil sweet south-wind, fi'om the bouquets of spring blossoms upon the table and mantelpiece;  and the smaller domicile of tire lady's-maid was so 'neat, and clean, arid ldeasant, that it would have been hard, even for a tmember of that scornfuu I elass of Ihe world's peopjle, to have found fiult with' its accommo. dlaions. Maraian gave a last glance at the rooms- saw thit tihe preparations for tire early dinner, which was to refresh the tra'veliers after their journey firom town, were all iar traintook . ee at tile drawing-rooms, and added one or two sugges. tive touches to certain folds and -draperies tlhat greatly improved  their appearance---and then   made the best of her way to the dear old loft, where site was sure of an hour or two of undis- turbed solitude. 1ier cousins were safe in. their own rooms, discussing the finery to be worn that evening, and directly after luncheon she knew that, they would begin to dress. So, tak- ing some thin sandwiches, a couple of sminall jam tarts, and a glass of milk, upon a tray, she shut herself up in her owl's nest, to read and eat her humble meal in peace. This had been to her, ever since she could remember, the happiest hour in the whole twen- ty-four. Ensconced comfortably in her easy- chae with her plate and glass upon the table, and an interesting novel in her hand, she had been wont to lose herself in the author's pages, and forget the outer world, and the many disa- greeable things it sometimes had in store for her. But on this day the favorite volume seemed to have lost its charms. She read idly and in- attentively, and when her meal was finished, she pushed away glass, plate, and book together, with a heavy sigh. What ailed her? How was it that she could no longer live in the fortunes of her heroine, rather than her own? She leaned back in her chair, and clasped her hands behind her head. The first glance at the portrait opposite answer- ed her question plainly enough. The-noontide meal only recalled that other, shared with much mirth and laughter, upon the steps' of the haunt- ed house; and' where was the use of hanging over the printed page .of the novelist, while her own heart was writing a novel, far more sweet, and strange, anrid interesting? "Love", says a witty French writer-" love begins with the first sigh, and ends with the first kiss!" This may be true of the later loves of one's life, which become rather fancies of the senses than affections of the heart. But in the first awakening of a true. pure nature, all things are true and pure.. When that new:light dawns upon us, how different we become, even in our own eyes! How it ennobles and dignifies the most trivial circumstances! How impossible it seems ever to commit a mean action, ever to do an unworthy deed! Alas: "The light that never was on sea or shore, The consecration, and the poet's dream", fades away all too soon, and we do unworthy deeds, without one blush of shame r But not until that light has gone! How many phases that timid, trembling pas- sion has! There is the first meeting, and tire first glapce, fvom which you go away, to dream of a pair of haunting eyes, or to contrive an- other interview with their owner. There is the first walk, when you discover that you both love woods, and lanes, and fields, far better than the busy streets; the first song,-when your voices blend so harmoniously together, 6hat it seems a   shame even to think of separating them; tile first sigh-mutual-and quickly followed, on either side, by the first blush ; the first note, which you write and re-write some thirty times, lest it should seem too warm, or too cold, or too-heaven knows what Hthe first hesitating pressure of the hand ; the first kiss, light but burning upon that hand ; the first lingering, bewildering, half-frightened whirl of ecstasy, when, bj some mischievous accident or other, not only hands, but lips are meetinii; tire first "Hlove-you," and' its low reply; the first proud thrill of wonder and delight at finding yourself engaged-bound, hand and foot, by a promise to one who loves you tenderly, and is loved in return, in a way which no words in the English language have the slightest power to express! Then come the long, long walks and talks; and the ridiculous little letters sent every other hour of the day, and ringing the changes upon that'eternal word, love, love, love! Then the quarrels, the despairing farewells, and happy reconciliations; perhaps, like that of David Copperfield and his pretty Dora, ",in a back kitchen!"Then comes a parting in good earn- est at last, brought about by circumstances, rather than yourselves, and therefore inevitable. Then come kisses, tears, and pIrayers-vows with out end-, and sighs without number-and the hall-door shuts, and the romance is over. Ten years later, the lady wakes' up some fine morning to find herself the Queen of Fashion, and tire wife of a millionaire old enough to be her grandfather; and the gentleman is a rising doctor, merchant, or lawyer, with a wife and four children, and a snug little sum in the Thrn per Cents., for the benefit of the bairns. So goes the world! For Marian, tire delicious trouble, the tor- ment of that first love had begun. She was just entering into that state of sweet bewilder- ment which no language and no pen can ever justly describe. While we are young and poet- ical, we call it " finding heaven and earth filled only with 3ne beloved object"--when we grow old and prosiic, we describe it in a more forci- ble, if more homely way, by saying that we "* don't know whether we are on our heads or on our heels". As for Marian, she had taken che disease in its most dangerous form, and scarcely knew if such important things as head or' heels belonged to her. She knew she had a heart-- and that was quite enough! What folly it all is, to be sure, when one comes to look back upon it with a calml heart, and sober eyes, and a wrinkle or two, or a few gray hairs! Regular features, a pink and white, skin, smiling lips, curling hair, and bonny wells of eyes-that is all that is needed to set the heart of man or woman in a blaze, ard turn a whole life topsy-turvy to its end! If every 3ne was born ugly, or if every handsome boy or girl could be forced by law to have a sharp attack    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6472-00000011"/> of small, pox- say in the fourteenth year of their lives-what a sensible, orderly place this world would be I At present, we are all mad, till age brings us sanity, and takes away the capacity for enjoyment. My lord professes to worship Intellect in public; and lies prostrate atBeauty's slipper in private; and myglady looks with eves of reverence at Demosthenes in " the House", but lays her lily-white hand in that of Adonis of the Guards!  Ibtellect! Genius! Talent! Place them side by sid, in the height and glory of their power, and then let Beauty enter the lists, and where are they? It is useless to deny the truth of the old French song. It is indeed "Love that makes the world go round!"And the mo- ther of L6ve is Beauty! Marian, worshiper of loveliness though she was, had heretofore confined that worship to her own sex. The young gentlemen belonging to the county families of Downe might have come and gone forever without attracting her attention, while their pretty sisters absorbed it. She was in that diffident stage of girlhood which pre- cludes any save ideal thoughts of the opposite sex. The lover of her dreams (of course she had one) was formed partly after the dreary type of Sir Charles Grandison (that prince of prigs and bores, whose history she was never weary of reading), and partly upon the model of the knights ot old, who sighed some thirty years in secret before they thought themselves worthy even to ask permission to kiss the tie of their lady-love's '"sandaled shoon". That was the wooing to which she looked forward. - With a soul of fire-a heart uncultured, impetuous, and impulsive, and hasty to a degree-she fan- cied she could be satisfied and won by devoirs paid as slowly as these! It was only another proof of the tremendous mistakes a young, undis- ciplined heart may make in its estimate of itself. This future idol wase to be brave, and strong, and merciful, and meek. Above all, he was to be a genius, the soaring of whose mighty intel- lect she was to watch from her own obscurity- whose labors she was to lighten-whose faith she was to brighten, etc., etc., ad infinitum. There was never to be such a wonder known on earth as her " coming man". He was to be poor and unknown at first; then the nation was to get into some horrible plight or other, and give him the chance of rising to eminence, for which he had so long panted in secret. Wilh one bound dow taken she did not say), he was to spring to the pinnacle of power, grasp the helm of state, and ibring the good ship to the right- about again. All wrongs were to be set right- all evils redressed ; the poor were to be made comfortable-the rich were to be made benevo- lent; in short, the millennium was to come about several hundred years before its time, through the exertions of'this fearless lover of hl'rs,owhose name many a future generation would unite to bless.   Of his age, his looks, his bearing, she never had a thought. He was to be all intellects-all soul; but in her meditations, she dealt with the beautiful essence of the perfect being-she had no fancies to waste upon its dull earthly cover- ing. And now she had gone and fallen head over. ears in love with some one hundred and fifty pounds of solid flesh and blood-with a pair of pink cheeks and rosy lips-with a wealth of golden curls-with two flashing, laughing blue eyes-with a tall and graceful figure, a bewil&amp;- ering smile, and a musical voice. There was no use in denying it, even to herself. The handsome young artist might have all the genius and goodness of his ideal predecessor, but she could only trust that it might be so, and own, with a warm blush, that it was not intellect, but mere outward beauty of form and coloring that had scattered all her philosophy to the winds, and left her unable to read, to work, to think, with any kind of composure, till she had looked upon that face and form again. It seemed to her almost wrong-almost in- delicate that it should be so. She had never had any scruples about looking at the beautiful picture in her study. She had often gtaed at it with the purest pleasure for an hour, at a time; nay, she had pressed her lips to that smiling mouth and invoked blessings on those laughing eyes a score of times. But to have the pilture, animated and breathing, walling, talking, and laughing al her side, was quite a different thing. She might invoke blessings upon the eyes still, and perhaps with 'greater warmth than ever. As to the lips! she blushed furiously as she glanced at them, and rising, began to walk hast- ily up and down the room. "Marian!" called a high voice in the court- yard. She went to the door of the loft,'and looked down.  Miss Moyell stood there, elegantly dressed, and looking very handsome. "You tiresome thing!" she exclaimed; " why, you are not dressed, and they will be here very soon, and then dinner must be served directly. I thought hoi it would be, and came to'look for you." "I will come at once," said -Marian, shutting the door, and running d9wn the stairs. "Ev- erything is ready for them, Leonora." "What a color you have got, clild, and how your eyes sparkle! If you always looked like that, you would be quite handsome," 'e Yon are beautiful enough for us all, Leono- ra," replied the girl, delighted with the first compliment she had ever received from her cousin. "Do you think so?" "Indeed I do; and I hope Lord Mount- chayne may think so, too." "Silly thing! Go and dress, or you will be late."   Marian darted away to her own room. She locked the dour, and then looked in the glass. 'Yes, Leonora was right; there was color in her cheeks, and her eyes beamed, and she was not quite a-fright, after all. She was' so happy at the thought, that she scarcely knew what she was about. Singing before the glass, she ar- ranged her luxuriant hair most carefully, and then- donned the blue dress, which was lying ready on the bed.  It fell in soft. clinging, graceful folds around her tall figure, and placing a knot of May-flowers on her breast, and another in her hair, she went down to the drawing- room. "Bless me, Mariun, how nice you look!" said one of the twins, glancing up faom her crotchet- work L The other one turned round. It was Caro- line, and she smiled. Is it for the peer?" she asked. "Is what?" replied Marian. "This2" and she touched tuhe blue dress; "and these?" designating the flowers which the young girl wore. "Is it likely?' ".How can I say?" "Your good sense ought to prevent you from ' making such a remlark." ' Good sense }I never had any in my life. I was born without any."  Marian's face expressed such entire acquies cence in this speech that her cousin burst ost  laughing. "Never mind. Why did you put that thing  on?" "Leonora gave it me."' "I hate a blue dress." "Do you?" "Intolerably." Marian looked out of the wi do and yawned. "You don't ask me whyl?'" "It is a mere matter of taste, I suppose." "Not at all." "What then?" "I fell in love once." She made the announcement so seriously, that her sister dropped her crochet work and stared at her with the greatest surprise. "My dear Caroline, what are you saying?" "Simply that I fell in love once. Where is the harm?" "You never told me that before." "Very 'likely. I was ashamed of.-it at the time, I think, and kept it quite to myself. Now the wound is healed, and the scar cured ; and as I happen to lie in a talking humor,I intend giving you two novices the benefit of my expe- rience. Of course you are novices. You have never been in love, have you, Lucy?" "What a question!"  And the young lady looked intensely shocked. "Nor you, fair coz?' Marian would have given the world not to     blush, but in spite of herself the blood fiew to her cheek and brow, and her eyes dropped be- fore the saucy glance Caroline gave her. "Ha! I see you are a fellow sufferer. So much the better! Now listen to what scattered all my dream of felicity. Nothing more or less than a blue dress 1" "How can- you talk such nonsense?" said Marian, half indignantly. "' It is a fact. I won't tell you who the gen- tleman was, because he is married now, and I should never bear the last of it if you knew his name. But I was very fond of him-quite ro- mantic, in fact; and I think he was very well disposed toward me, when a horrible girl-an' old school-friend of mine-stepped in between us, and bore off the prize. She was a fair blonde, with golden hair. I persuaded her to dress like me, in pink, for a long time. She was innocent enough to do so, till her married sister came to stay at the same house, and saw through my little artifice at once. That even- ing my friend appeared in blue, and my admir- er deserted me instantly. I lost my companion and my lover together through a trumpery blue dress. Can you wonder I have hated the sight of one ever since?" Marian smiled. "At least, mine can do you no harm," re- marked. "I am not sure of that!" "Why not?" "I believe the color is fatal to me." "Granted. But there is no lover in the case this time.' "No--that is, not just yet." "Do you ex pect one, then?" "I expect Lord Mountchayne." "Oh!"' said Marian, gravely. And Lucy be- gan to l]igh. "Marian quite thinks you are in earnest, Car- oline." "So I am, my dear." "You don't mean to say that you really in- tend to captivate Lord Mountchayne?" "If I can; and if Marian's wretched blue. dress does not stand in the way." ' But I thought Leonora-" "Leonora, indeed! Why he is a mere child ; beside her! It is you that talk nonsense now,. Lucy t" "Hush! hush! Here she comes!" In fact, Miss Moyell was already in the room, and had heard both speeches. There was an awkward silence. Then she said, stiffly: "You are very complimentary this evening, Caro-- line!" "Bah Hwe will not pull caps over him, No- ra!" said her sister, briskly. "Of course, we shall all make a dead set at him-that is under- stoodfrom the first. Lady Revere understands it, too-or she would never domesticate him amongst us, as she is about to do. So we start .    <pb n="24 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000012"/> fair, and the best one must win him, that is all. He must have some voice in the matter, you know-not much-yet still-'.' "What is he like?" asked Marian, looking up with some interest. "Are you going to enter the lists, too?" queried Miss Moyell, with a scornful curl of the lip. "Perhaps so." "Oh, what fun!" said Lucy, clapping her hands. "The poor young man will find him- self inevitably married before he has been here a week. I really think he ough't to be forewarn- ed!" "Forewarned is forearmed, Lucy. And ac- cording to Madam Rumor, he is cased in triple steel already. Lady Revere would gladly see him less invulnerable, I fancy." "Is he a woman-hater, then?" asked Marian. "He is not old enough for that. But he al- ways has his head in a book-and writes poe- try, and gazes at the stars, and seems to forget entirely that women are the fairest and best part of the whole creation. He is not a ladies' man, in one word." "I hate ladies' men!" remarked Miss Moyell. "Tastes differ, my dear sister, I confess. I like them-they are such fools!" "A se#sible reason, certainly, for your pref- erence,' said Ma6an, laughing. ' Is Lord Mountdtayne handsome?          , "Who is curious now, I wonder? My dear creature, he is so beautiful that the women stand in rows and rave about him!" Marian's eyes kindled. "And in return for all their worship he calls  them painted dolls!" said Lucy, demurely. "Ail, poor fellow! he can't help being sar- *castic-it is his nature. But, Marian, the best  of the whole story is that this paragon vows that lie will never fall in love, and that he would f far rather lhe hung than married, any day! t What is to be done with such a savage?" "How can I say?"            1 "Don't bother yourselves to decide," said Miss Moyell, quietly. "You will see him down in the dust, like his fellows, at a lady's feet, be-  fore many months go by."  "At yours or mine?" asked Caroline, archly. t, At that instant a servant opened the door. fl "If you please, Miss Marian, Rose Martin is e here, and wishes to speak to you."     fi "Oh, ask her in!" said the twins together. tl "It will pass the time away."       w And as Miss Moycll made no objection to the proposal, Marian went out into the hall, and tl led her young visitor into the presence of the c ladies.  CHAITER XI. THE SHADOW OP AZRAEL'S WING. The May Queen looked pale and ill, and t greatly troubled. She dropped a humble court. hml out.    - esy at the door, and stood waiting to be ad- u dressed, it is true, but her marnUer wis absorl ul and anxious, nnd she did not even look at the p magnificent furniture of the room, or the ele- gant dresses of the ladies before her. Marian's face, also, wore a puzzled lo,k, as if, in the brief e interval of her absence, she had heard something which had perplexed her greatly. "Well, Rose," said Miss Moyell, looking at r her with a glance 6f condescending admiration; - 'you seem  fatigued and a little indisposed. a Were the honors of the throne too much for you yesterday? Has the crown left a headache be- hind it? If so, you are lucky in being able to lay it aside at your own good pleasure. Many a e queen, I daresay, would be very glad to be like e you in that respect." Rose tried to smile, as in duty bound, when the great lady condescended to jest with her. But the effort was a painful and a vain one. Her lip quivered, and she suddenly burst into tears. "Bless me! what is the matter?" ejaculated Miss Moyell, sitting upright. "What ails you, my girl? why do you cry?" "It-it is my father t" sobbed Rose. "Your father-what ails him?" "He was not very well yesterday; and last night, after I got home, he was taken very bad. I don't rightly know what ails him, but the , Doctor was there just now, and he says he can't live through another day." "Poor girl! What can we do for him?-or for you? Anything that the Doctor recom- mends for him shall be sent to the cottage at once." "You are very kind, Miss, but I am afraid he will never want anything again. His cough has been very bad all through the, winter; and last night, when he tried to speak, the blood flew out of his mouth, and he fainted in my  arms, before I knew that anything ailed him. He looks so white to-day, and he can't speak loud." Her voice faltered, and she began to weep bitterly again.. The sisters exchanged glances. Qld John Martin had long been pronounced consumptive; but no one had supposed the end to be so near. And to die in May-in the very flush and beauty of the openingyear! It seem- ed hard, indeed, to those who were young, and full of life, and health, and of hope as to what that year might possibly bring them on its wings. While the twins consoled poor Rose with gen- tle words of kindness, and even with little caresses, and entreaties not to weep, Marian turned to her cousin, Leonora, and said, in a low voice: "Do you know why she came 9" "She is a favorite of yours-a sort of pro- teg6e-is she not?" "That is not the reason."    <pb n="-25" xml:id="VAC6472-00000013"/> "' What, then?" Her father sent for me."  John Martin sent for you?" "So she says"     .         1 "How very strange!" "Is it not? I never spoke to him in my life, t that I know of. What can he want to see me i \ for?"                   i "Oh my dear, it is some mistake, depend  upon it. He must have mentioned some one else, Rose "  "Yes, Miss." "Are you quite sure that it was Miss Marian you were sent for?" "Quite sure, Miss. My father said he could not die without seeing her." "But he scarcely Knows her by sight." "I thought not, Miss." "He must be wandering in his mind." "The Doctor did not think so, Miss." "Did he tell you to come, as well as your father?" "Yes, lM's. "Then tere must be something in it. But how very odd!" "' Father couldn't speak to say what he want- ed, Miss; but the Doctor saw that he was un- easy, and asked what ailed him. He made signs for a pencil and a piece of paper, ahd wrote 'Miss Marian'. And the Doctor told me to bring her as soon as I could."  "Well, Marian, get your things on," said Miss Movell, looking greatly interested. "It is not far to the cottage, and if you go at once, you may be able to get back before Lady Re- vere comes." Marian left the room, and returned in five mninutes, wearing her hat and shawl, and having her blue dress carefully gathered up around her waist. Rose, somewhat' comforted by the kind- ness of the young ladies, bade them a grateful good-bye, and they set off together down the avenue, while the sisters watched them from the window. a How much those girls are alike in figure, and height, and walk!" observed Miss Moyell, as they disappeared through the gate. "So they are," replied Caroline; "though it never struck me before. And there is some- thing in Marian's face, too, when you come to think of it." "Now, don't be absurd, Caroline. You can't compare poor Marian's round, childish face to that lovely creature's. "No; I don't mean that. Features, and complexion, and expression:, are all different and yet there is something-an indefinable something that makes that rebelnble each other, after all." "An indefinable something, indeed!" said Miss Moyell, laughing. "But what on earth can that old man want to see Marian for, when be is /lying?"   "Peirhaps lie is a miser, and is going to make her his heir," suggested Lucy. Caroline laughed, and said that it was very likely. "The only thing I can think of is, that mys- tery about her parents," said Miss Moyell, mus- ingly. The twins looked up, in hopes of hear- ing the story, which as yet had only been sug- gested to them. "Though how he should know anything about it or them, I cannot possibly conceive," she went on after a slight pause. "And do you kno  all about that mystery, Leonora?" asked Caroline. "Humph! Young ladies should not ask questions about matters they ought not to un- derstand," was the reply. And then she went off into a study of the brownest kind, which neither of them ventured to interrupt. CHAPTER XI. UNEXPLAINED MYSTERIES. "Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched With a woful agony, Which forced me to begin my tale, And then it left me free! "Since then, at an uncertain hour, That agony returns; And till my ghostly tale is told,  This heart within me burns!" -COLERIDGE. Meanwhile Rose and her companion hurried I on through the fragrant green lanes together. Neither spoke on the way. Their thoughts ,went on before them  to the darkened room - where John Martin was lying, waiting for them and for death at one and the same time. Rose e sobbed now and then at the thought of her cer- tain loss, and. the memory of many a little act r of disobedience and unkindness that came back  - to make those last hours more. painful in their 1 passing. Marian's mind was busy with specula- e tions that were most heathenish in their nature. e She looked upon the desire of the dying man for her presence merely as a fancy which she 3, could gratify. She did not waste any time s in wondering, as Leonora was doing, what strange mysteries he might have to unfold to it h*. But she did think about his present, and !- future condition in a way that would have ,o shocked Rose infinitely, could she have guessed what was passilng in her companion's mind. It 't was well that 4he was unable to do so. o  As they turned down the little green walk that led to the cottage, Hugh Dennett came forward Ld tQ meet them. "Is my father worse?" asked Rose, turning e very pale. r,  "I think not, dear; but he was so uneasy that I came out to watch far you. I am so glad you id have come, Miss Marian," he added, turning to th her, and taking off his cap with rustic courtesy. en "Something seems to weigh heavy upon his mind, and it concerns you."    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6472-00000014"/> For the first time Marian thought of the se- cret of her birth. Could this old man have anything to reveal concerning her dead mother -her long-lost father? What else could make him so anxious for her presence. Sle hurried through the little garden and into the neat par- lor of the cottage. ' Go, tell him I am here," she said. Rose obeyad, and returned in a few minutes with a slip of paper- in hand. The word '-Alone" was written on it in trembling charac- ters "I am to be in the next room, with Hugh," said Rose, in explanation. "But you are to go in quite by yourself." With a beating heart, Marian ascended the stairs and entered the sick-room. The blinds were down, and the bed was in a dark corner, so that, as sle glanced at the figure lying there, she fancied it must be a corpse-so white and still it looked, She waited at the door nervous- ly. John Martin seemed to have gained new strength at the sight of her. He could not speak aloud, or raise himself in bed, but his sharp, clear wiisper fell distinctly on her ear. "Are you Mai'ian Moyell?" "I am."        "Come nearer." She went up to the side of the bed. "Draw up the blind." She obeyed without a word. He looked Qa- gerly in her face. I cannot see you. Take off the hat and shawl," he whispered. She did so.  "And turn to the light. There; tha will do. It is the same face over again - feature for fea- ture. Will you sit down here?" He pointed to a chair beside the bed.' Mariap dropped into it, feeling nervous and awkward to a degree ; and he lay a long while in silence, with his eyes fixed steadily on her face. "Did you ever go to Downe Reserve?" The sudden, sharp whisper, and the ideas it conjured up, frightened her so that she bounded in her chair. Whlt could have put that place,  of all others, into the sick man's head? "Did you ever go to Downe Reserve?" he repeated, so earnestly that she was forced to an- swer. "Yes; very often." Did you ever. enter the house?" "Once." "What did you see there?" "Dust and dirt."  "Nothing more?" ' What more is there to see?" "Nothing more?" "What do you mean?"           t 'Answer my question. Downo Reserve is I said to be haunted."            r I know it is."             t   i, E 3 EIltV A. - Do you believe the report?" e  "Yes."               l r  "Then you saw something. Tell me what it was" "A mere fancy. I imagined I saw a tall, pale -woman there-" "In a little room!" he broke in, excitedly. "She sat upon a great iron chest, and wrung her hands and wept? ' "Yes; but how did you know that?" He groaned and shuldered. "She has been with me many a day and night. I could see her now, if 1 chose'to shut my eyes. But 1 won't! I'll keep my promise to her, and then, perhaps, she will let me rest in peace!" "Your promise to her? Do you know what you are saying?" asked Marian, who began to feel alarmed at his will looks and wilder words. "Too well I too well! But listen to me, for my time is short. Are you happy in your present home?" "No!" "Are they kind to you? Tell me truly." "Not very." "Would you like to go away?" ' I have no place to go to." "And Rose," he said, suddenly. "There is Rose!" "What of her?" "You must see that justice is done to her!" "Decidedly his mind is wandering," thought Marian, glancing uneasily at the door. "I think I had better call her." "Will you promise?" he asked. "Promise what?" "To see that Rose has her rights. I can't die and leave her unprotected, you know." 'Of course not." "She has been a goodgirl to me. Never fa- ther had a better daughter than Rose." "I am sure of that." "And so young and beautiful"' "Yes," said Marian, sighing. "Then you promise?" "'I9 Oh yes!" she answered, thinking to paciltyiim by assenting to every proposal he made. "You will not see her hurt or wronged in any way, however great the temptation may be to do so?' "I will not" "Then God bless you both, and make you as happy as you deserve 'to be!, She is not to marry Hugh Dennett--rernember that, Lady Marian!" He closed his eyes, and eeemed sinking into a doze. Marian watched him for a few minutes, and then stealing softly to the door, called Rose and her lover. As they entered, however, the old man started up in bed, and looked wildly around the room, y   "Where is she? where is she?" he whispered  sharply. , Has she gone? 1 have not told her  yet!" "If you mean Miss Marian, she is here, fa- L( ther," said Rose, beading over him with a lov- q lug kiss. 'Good girl!" he said, looking up ini her face wl with a grateful glance. "God will reward you lo for it all when 1 am gone! Lady Marian!" e Marian came nearer. He took her hand and put it in that of his daughter.      m "Remember your promise," he said, feebly. ai I will."                P' "The papers are in London. The lawyer's e son has them."  Rose looked bewildered.  "And his name-his name is"-he began to ei cough violently-- don't forget--Philip Vere!" a They were the last words he ever spoke on q earth. He sank back exhausted upon the piliows tl when the paroxysm of pain was over, and held h out his hand to Marian with a feeble smile. I She took it in both hers, uttered a kind good- i  bye, and left the room. Hugh Dennett, attend- I  ed her till she reached the gates of the Pleas- Id aunce again.  Hier cousins greeted her gladly for once in s their lives. Lord and Lady Revere had not ar-;  rivec, and the young ladies were on tae qui vive, t to know the result of Marian's interview with i  the dying man.  "I cannot tell you much," she said. "I E hardly know what he did want, or if he was in  his right senses or not. He talked about some papers in London, and told me not to forget'l Philip Vere."               . "Good gracious!" exclaimed Lucy; and i Marian, looking up, saw the three ladies change countenance so strangely that she stopped short  Miss Moyell had turned very pale. "'IIhw dare you mention that name in this house?" she said, haughtily As she spoke, the sound of wheels upon the graveled drive sent every one into the hall, to welcome the coming party. Marian stood be- hind her cousins, and looked shyly at the Earl and Countess as they entered. They did not appear very formidalle. But when Lord Mount- chayne came after them, gay and smiling, the new-found color left her cheeks, and after one startled glance, she turned and fled away to her own room. For Lord Mountchayne was no other than the young artist who had tempted her into tlhat mad exploring expedition, the day before, at Downe Reserve. CHAPTER XII. PUZZLING QUESTIONS. Here was "a situation"! Marian's first im- pulse, as I have already said, was to run away as fast as nossible. But when the door of the room was safely bolted behind her, she began to feel sorry that she had yielded to that impulse. J   What must Lord and Lady Revere have thought of her? What reason could her cousins have given for her su ideu flight? How, angry Leonora would be, and. what a lecture on eti- quette she would have to receive when she made her appearance below again!  And all the while perhaps Lord Mountchayne would be looking on with his blue eyes, and enjoying her embarrassment and confusion. Oh, it was not to be borne! Come what might, she could not face Lord Mountchayne again till she had grown quite calm and com- posed. And the only way to escape him was to leave the house. It wan a bold step to take, and one well cal- culated to draw down upon her head the sover- eign displeasure of her cousin Leonora. But she did not care to stop to calculate its conse- quences just then. She stole softly down from the chamber, with her hat and shawl in her hand, and peeped in at the open kitchen-door. The cook, with a face like a full moon, was bend- ing over her pots and pans; the two housemaids were mysteriously busy in one corner with the dinner-service; the man-service was giving a last polish to the plate; and the housekeeper istood by the window, satisfying herself by one final glance around the .place that all was right before she Tetired to don her black silk dress i and her best lace cap in honor of the occasion. She uttered a little sigh of satisfaction as she saw Marian standing on the threshold of the door. "All going on right, Mrs. Pryor?" said Marl- an, going up to her with a smile. She had been petted and indulged by the kind-hearted woman i ever since she could run alone, and she had for her an odd sort of attachment, such as a moth- erless child often displays toward the woman !who rears it. "All right, I am glad to say, my dear Mati- i an," she replied, ,smoothing down her apron e with 'a radiant face. "Though I say it, that o ought not to, I will trouble my Lord's French c- cook to give him a better dinner than he will l have at the Pleasaunce this evening." it "I am glad to hear it. And the dessert?" "Is a perfect picture, Miss Marian." e  "And the table?" e  "Just as you left it a couple of hours ago, r my dear." 'o 'Then you dont want me any more just now?" d  "Bless you, no, :ny chld! Run away, and y look beautiful in the drawing-room when the young lord comes down. That is all you have to do at present." Marian laughed. "Little use in that, I fear, Mrs. Pryor. Have a- you seen my cousins?" y  "'Yes; and beautiful they look, if that is ie what you mean. But there is not one among in them so pretty as my own Miss Marian." ie. " O Mrs. Pryor, where do you expeot to go    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6472-00000015"/> to if you tell such dreadful fibs? Whr, you ,night as well compare me to the greatest beau- ty that ever lived, and have done with it!" "Well, Rose Martin, is the greatest beauty I ever saw in my life; and do you know, Miss Marian, that you have a look of her in your face now and then?" "Ah, poor Rose! she is in great trouble!" "I saw iher to-day, Miss Marian, and cook told me that she said her father was very ill." "Dying! and the trangest thing of all was, that he sent for me." "What for?" asked the housekeeper, looking up suddenly, with a curious expression on her good-humored facq. "Poor man! I don't think he knew himself" "But lie surely said something to vou when you got there?" Yes, of all things in the world, lie asked me if I had ever been at Downe Reserve!" The 'housekeeper uttered an exclamation of surprise. "Go on-go on '" she said, breathlessly. Why, Ihow eager and excited you look!" said Marian, gazing at her curiously. "' Do you knowany thing about that place? Did you ever go there?" "Hush, child!  Never mind me.  Don't speak so loud, and go on with your story." "I have none to tell," replied Marian, think- ing it best, for many reasons, to keep back the tale of the apparition, and its strong corrobora- tion by old Martin's wandering remaiks. "I think the poor old man must have been out of i his mind, fur after that began to talk about Rose." "His daughter?"             i "Yes." "Well, what did he say her?" He made me promise solemnly that I would a never wrong her, and he called me ' Lady Mar  ian' all the while. Do you know, I think he mistook me for some one else-perhaps for one of the Beauforts. Am I at all like the last Lady Beaufort, Mrs. Pryor?" "You-I-good gracious me! how should I r know .' stammered the housekeeper, looking throughly frightened at the question, much to a Marian's surprise. "What put that into your head, child?"  *"Why, he might have seen Lady Beaufort, you know."  "Who-old Martin?"           c "Yes. He was born and brought up on the estate." Well, what of that?" "He is as old as Methuselah, almost. He w might have known Lady Beaufort; and I may ri have reminded him of her in some unlaccounta- do ble way in his ,lyi,g moments. Was not her name Marian, lb the way?"        th "Who ,Loll you that?"         in "Idon't know. I tlhidnk T must have dreamed ag '\   'ou it. But I have an odd impression that it was hL- her name!" "I believe it was," said the housekeeper slow- Y I ly. "But, my dear, did old Martin mention no iss other name to you?" ce  "  Only one." "And that?" "Was Philip Voere." ok  "O Lord!" said Mrs. Pryor, clasping her hands and turning pale is, Marian's curiosity was roused to the highest pitch. ig  "Who is Philip Vere?" she asked. er "hOh, gracipous how should I know, you silly child a" '"  "Then why did you stairt and exclaim itn that in way when I mentioned him?  You do know him, Mrs. Pryor, and my cousins know him too. ie When I told them what old Martin said, they look at me as you did just uow. And Leonora )f asked how I dared to mention that name in this house. Come,'what is the mystery about Philip Vere, my dear old friend?" "   Mystery!" said the housekeeper, pettishly. u "What nonsense you 'd, talk, child! That r comes of reading so many novels. If a body happens to be -nervous and easily startled, and 't you see them look a little out of sorts, you run off with the notion directly that there s some- - thing wonderful behind it all." "e "Mrs. Pryor, you may as well tell me first as last," said Mario'n, quietly. Because you have [ made me curious about this Philip Vere, and I fmean to know all about him before I rest." "Bles the child!" said Mr. Pryor, looking round nervously; "ie there any need of shout- ing that name out so loud that Miss Moyell can bear you!" "  There it is again! My cousin Leonora has something to do with it. A romance in her life! I'll wager my old hat against your best bennet! Now, my dearsoul, open your budget!' 1 can't. I must go and dress." "Let mego with you." "  No. You'll worry my life out, and there is reall nothing to tell." SVery well," said Marian, putting on her hat and shawl; "  I'll go where I can find out." "  Where is that, prav?" "To John Martin's."' "And dinner on the table?" "Impossible to eat, my dear creature, till my curiosity is satisfied." "y Oh my goodness! What will' Miss Moyell say?" "Tell her I have a raging headache, and was obliged to take a walk in order to get rid of it," 'said Marian, marching toward the door. "I t is wrong, very wrong, to go and disturb that poor old man, when he is positively dy- ing." said Mrs. Pryor, oe-rcely knowig, in her agitation, what she was talking about.   "It was his own wish ; he'wanted to tell me more. If he is too ill to 'talk, I will not force myself upon him ; but so Iluucli has been suid, that I am determined not to'rest till I under- 'stand it all." "Just like her father - just for all the world like her father!" muttered the housekeeper, looking the picture of dismay. "Headstrong and willful'! And now it will allcome out ages ' before the proper time -and a pretty kettle of fish it will be!" Marian listened eagerly. "What do you know about my father?" she asked. "Lord, have mercy! Who has been talking of him?" "Why, you, to be sure. I heard you just now saying that I 'was like liim." "What ears!" muttered the old lady, looking a little scared.' "My dear, I cannot stay talking any longer. Dinner is nearly ready, andI must dress. Go you, like a good child, and take off your things, and after dinner, maybe, I'll tell you all you want to know." "No maybes for me, thank you!" said Ma- rian. '"I am going to see'John Martin." With that she danced away down through the garden, and out at the little wicket-gate. The housekeeper looked after her with a kind of impatient groan. ' What a set-out it will be if he kniws every- thing, and tells it to her! And Philip Yere, too! Deary me! My poor old head will go cracked soon, between them all, to a dead cer- tainty!" She hurried off to her room, muttering and murmuring to herself ail the way. But she had an ally at the cottage, upon whose powerful as- sistance she had never counted. When YMariai, her cheeks flaming, and her eyes burning with impatience, burst out into the little green lane that led to Rose Martin's home, she stopped short in her eager run, and looked doubtfully up at the house. No one was in sight; and the front door beneath the rustic porch (that usually stood wide open, as if to bid the wajSfrer welcome) was closed. Strange how much of desolation and dreariness was ex- pressed by that one simple circumstance I The perfect stillness of the place'struck to her heart with a kind of prophetic chilli She  walked slowly up the garden path. As she i neared the house, a hand at the upper window  drew down the bliLd softly. The next moment,  Rose, her lovely face stained and disfigured with  tears, opened the door. "Your fither?" said Marian, timidly. "He is dead!" The two girls stood looking at each other an  instant. Then, moved by some strange impulse  which she could neither understand nor resist,  Marian opened her arms, and Rose fell weeping e on her breast.               1   CHAP'TER XlII. THE COUUSE OF TRUE LOVE. "Hang up my harp again, I have no voice for boug. Not song, but wail, And mourners pale, -   NNot bards to love belong! 'rt   O failing liumau love! O light by darkness known! Oh, false, the while thou treadlet earth! Oh, deaf, beneath the stone!" -E. B. BROWNING. "You know he said you were to be kind t( me," were the first words that Rose spokl when she had in a Ineasure redovered her composure. "And so I will be, dear," replied Marian, smoothing the golden curls back from her cheek with a loving touch. "But how sudden this must have been t When I left you this after- noon I thought he was better." "And so did I for a time; but hle soon grew worse. 'He never spoke again after you went." "So that, in fact, his last words were to me?"' "Yes." Bot h were silent for a time. Then Rose said: ' Would you like to see him?" "If I may." They went' up-stairs together. Hugh Den- nett was keeping watch beside the corpse. At their entrance he rose, and laid down the little pocket Bible wltch he had been reading. Scarcely an hour had passed since they stood beside the bed of the old man, and no hand had disturbed him tram the easy attitude in which he lay at the last moment. His head rested upon his hand, and the thin white curling hair tell over his brow and cheek, and upon the pil- low. Rose bent down, burst into tears, and brushed it away with a caressing touch. A placid smile lingered round the lips, the sunken eyes were closed with a look of rest and peace; and the worn face seemed younger, fairer, and brighter than it had done for many a year. There he lay-a poorcunlettered peasant, yet wiser than any whom he had left in the busy world behind him-since he had lifted the vail which still hung thickly before, their eyes. Where was he now?   What was he doing? While the senseless clay that had once been his prison-house lay still and quiet on its humble bed, free for ever from tie cares and pain that had. so often racked it-where was the escaped soul? How did it look upon the wondrous change from death to life, from fe ters to liberty, from pain and sorrow, it may be to bliss-and love eternal? Marian stood looking upon the placid dead face, with awe and wonder. That the last, hour had been a peaceful one, that lin- gering smile was evidence., Going out from this weary world with that happy look on his face, was it possible that the being with whom she had so lately conversed-whose lhad she hadr  so lately held-was lost in misery, for ever? Her own heart revolted from the thought. John    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6472-00000016"/> Miartiin hal been a good and a harmless man all tii dIays of 118s hile. Pool', anid humble, and ignor ant though he was, lie hail be,.n faithful to the light vouclisafed him, and she felt sure that his rewa;d had not been withllrld. The tears rose to her eyes at the thouglht f his happy lot. From ignorance and darkness, to life, and light, and j',y ; from poverty and pain, to the bliss of heaven, the lriendship of angels, and the smile of God! "Peace be with him! Peace is with him!" she said softly ; and sinking on one knee, she kissedcis hardened hand, as reverently as if it had bwn that of a dead'monarch. In her eyes he was more than a monarch then! He wore a crown-he carried a' sceptre before which those of eartihly kings were as golden toys---as broken reeds! "O Miss Marian!" sobbed Rose, as she saw the act of homage paid, not to the dead man upon earth, but to the saint in heaven--"Oh, my poor father! do you think he is happy now?". "No human eye can look beyond the grave!" said Marian, solemnly.. "But I wish 1 was as sure of getting to heaven myself, some day, as I am that your father is there now!" "Amen i" said Hugh Dennett, in a low voice. There was a knock at the door. The' watch- ers had come to lay out the corpse, and Rose and her companions went bblow. A yellow canary hanging in the window stopped in his preparations fr going to, bed, and as his young mistress eatered, gave a chirrup, cocked 'his head on one side, and burst into a flood of song. "Oh, don't, Dicky! How can you sing so at such a time?' said Rose, reproachfully ; and she covered'the cage with a silk handkerchief, hushing the melody in an instant "Poor little wretch!" said Marian, with a smile: "let him sing to-morrow, Rose, like a good girl. Don't teacht that happy bunch of feathers that there is such a thing as sorrow in the world he inhabits, or that it can touch him even in the remotest way." "He shall sing all day to-morrow, if he likes. To-night, my heart is too sad." She glanced at Hugh as she spoke, and he turned crimson. "May I speak to Miss Marian, Rose?" he asked. - She assented. "Rose fancies, Miss Maian, from some things her father said a little while ago, that lie did not wish her to marry me. She knows how I love her"-his voice trembled as he spoke; "and she is unhappy at having to give me pain. I think, perhaps, you may be able to set matters rigrt between us. Her father was poor, as you well know. There will be nothing left for her-positively nothing; and she is too young, too delicate, and too beautiful to go out to service. Some harm would certainly comn   I to her, and I should never forgive myself for I having allowed it. If she would only marry me, she should never have to soil her hands with work again. I have a good trade, and a nice little cottage to take ILcr to. I would work day and night for her, and be pleased and proud to I do it, too. She should never regret the day that made her my wife-never!" 1"I believe that!'" said Marian. But she looked ill at ease as she listened to him. "I believe that you would be very kind to her." "Then pray speak a good word for me to her; and I will bless you all my life lonag!" 'CNay, Hugh ; I hardly think you need any good word of mine. I am sure that Rose is very fond of you. All the village kilows that well." "Yes," said Rose, looking up, and speaking with the mo3t perfect frankness; "I am very fond of Hugh." "Humph! I doubt it!" thought Marian, as she marked the calm, sad face that did not change, and. the quiet, even tone in which she spoke. "No blush, no sigh, no softening of the voice I She says it much as she might say it of her bird ; and yet, poor fool! lie does not - see it.!" No, Hugh was in raptures at 'hearing this confession. "You see, Miss Marian," he said, with a de- lighted face, " she owns, before you, that'she loves me. And yet she will not marry me." "How can I go against my poor father's last wishes?" said Rose, with the tears standing in her eves. "But I thought your father knew and ap- proved of this attachment, Rose?" "He did know of it, and lie always liked Hugh-he liked him to the last. But when he was taken ill he seemed to change. That very May Day evening when we got home from the common, he said to me, 'Rose, you must never marry Hugh. Hie can never be more to you than a brother: remember that.' He said, that, perhaps, he had been to blame in encouraging his visits, but that he thought it was only a boy- and-girl fancy, that would die away of itself. And then he was taken so ill, and I never had a chance to speak to him a bout it a gain." "Well?" said Marian, seeing the eyes of Hugh fixed upon her with unmistakable earnest- ness. "He sent for you. He could not die without seeing you." "Well?" "What did he say to you?" Rose looked fri'ightened as soon as the ques- tion had left her lips, for Marian's face darkened over instantly. '"Pray forgive me," she added, earnestly; I do not wish to pry into anything which con- cerns you alone. But poor Hugh is so unhap- py, and he thought that my father might possi- bly have mentioned this to you."   "He did!" "And what did he say?" Marian hesittted. It seemed to hier that she held the future of those two lives in her hand at that instant. And so she did! Nay, more -her own happiness hung trembling in the balance with theirs; and she knew it not! Could she have looked forward, if but for a few months, I fear that her answer would have been very different. As it was, she pitied the young man who stood before hier, waiting to hear his doom, and was half tempted to suppress t'he truth, if only for his sake. "Oh, tell me what he said?" pleaded Rose. "I do not like to do so. Still, if you insist-" "Well, yes; I do insist, if you will pardon me for saying so, Miss Marian." "'I cannot tell if your father knew perfectly what he was saying, or not. I incline to think that he was wandering, from some communica-' tion which he made to me. But he'told me distinctly that you were not to marry Hugh Dennett-though he did n6t give any' reason why." There was a-dead silence. Rose turned pale; but after a moment's pause, she walked up to the young man, who stood looking on the ground as if he was turned to stone. "You hear, dear Hugh," she said, with a lit- tle sob. "I cannot go against my father's dy- ing words, and so good-bye!" Slie put her arms around his neck-kissed him-and then, turning'away, hid herface in her hands. The young man still continued to look at her as if he was stupefied. "Good-bye!" he said at last. "Sle says good-bye! And to me! Rose-Rose, you neveri loved me!" Before she could answer him, he flung open the door, and darted up the garden-path like a madman. Rose gazed after him till he was out of sight; then, wiping her eyes, she said ; I "Poor fellow! It is very hard for us both, but it cannot be helped!" and began to make preparations for the tea which she knew must soon be offered to the watchers up-stairs. Mariari, nervous and worn out with the excite- ment of the day, had much ado to keep herself from a violent burst, of laughter as she witness- ed this little scene and its unromantic ending. She escaped fi'omi the cottage as soon as possi- ble, leaving Ro-e slightly consoled by the hos- pitable cares with which she was forcet, to oc- cupy herself. Once safe in the green lanes, site yielded to the horrible impulsewhich had seized upon her, and laughed till she' cried. The dead man in the cottage-chamber; the banished lover -flying, perliaps, to thedale-house to drown hIis sorrow; ,the lonely orphan, busy  with her household cares-each thought of them seemed only to bring back some ludicrous image in its train, and though she was shocked at, and dis-1 gusted with herself, she still laughed on.   r At last the paroxysm  passed. She little dreamed-she who had always ridiculed the doctrine of "nerves"-how narrowly she had. I escaped a fit of strong hysterics, or from what pain and suffering, inll the shape of intense heil- ache, and utter exhaustion, and prostration, both mental and physical, that apparently in- sane and unseemly fit of merriment had saved her. CHAPTER XIV. A TALE OF OS1HR DAYS. "The lady did not heed That the far stars did fail;, Still calm her smile, Albeit the while Nay, but she is not pale! "I have a more than friend Across the mountains dim; No other voice is soft to me, Unless it nanmeth him! Marg'iet-Mcirg'ret!" -E. B. BaowNINa. Dinner had long been over when Marian reach- ed the Pleasaunce. She felt a little faint; and going round by way of the kitchen. secured a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter for her supper. Any refreshment more solid in its nature would have been wasted upon her. Her heart was too full; she could not eat. Mrs. Pryor was not visible; neither was she in the housekeeper's room; but. when Marian reached her own chamiiber she found her there, awaiting her coming. - Tae lhurry and agitation which she had betrayed before were entirely gone. She sat by the open window, looking down into the flower garden with a face that was quite calm, and very grave. When Marian e-,; tered, s'ie greeted4her with a smile, and took no notice of her exclamation of surprise and de- light. "Foolish child I where have you been?" she said, kindly. "Mi-s Moyell is so angry; and you have had no dinner. You will be ill if you go on in this way." "That would be a great misfortune, indeed.!" said Marian, sitting down beside her, and leaning her head upon the back of the easy-chair. "Who, in this great house, would miss me if I were ill, or even if I were dead?" Mrs. Pryor looked hurt and grieved. "I should;" site answered, softly; and Mari- an's eves brighltened. "Yes, I think you would. And you would shed one tear, just one, over my grave-would you not, Mrs. Pryor?" "My dear, why do you talk in that dismal way?" "Don't let them bury me in the vault of the Moyells," she went on, in the same dreary tone. "I should never rest there. I should haunt you all till you put me in the sunshine and under the green turf, where, like poor Keats, I could feel the daisies growing over me."    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6472-00000017"/> Mrs. Pryor looked at Iher rather anxiously. I Hl,.ir hIands were hot, her cliecklis were flushed, and her eyes shone altmost too brightly for one "perfect health. "Do you feel ill?" she asked. "Not a bit. There is a strangesort of light- ness-a kind of exaltation aboiut me, which 1 cannot conmprehend. 1 feel as ethereal as a piece of thistle-dowun, and I tuinik one good, strong puff of wind would blow me quite away and out of your sight. forever." The housekeeper rose from her seat, left the room, and returned in a few minutes with a wine-glass half full of some coloiless liquid in her hand. "Drink this, my dear," she said. "W hat is it?" :"Only a little dose of Valerian. You have had too much excitement lately. Your nerves are quite unstrung; but this will do you a deal of good.' "Nerves! I have no such things about me; I leave timin to my cousmIs," said MarianL, laugh- ing. "Ilowever, f will take the potion for your sake. And if it is poison, so much the worse fur you." She drained the glass, and leaned her, head back again, with a weary sigh. "You can't think how tired I am, Mrs. Pry- ort" "No doubt, my dear.  Yo'i ought to take more. care of yourself. You are not ,strong enough to bea'r so much excitement, and one way or another it will be the dearth of you." ; But. if excitement comes, it must be borne; onq cannot ihelp that." "' You trouble y-ourself needlessly, my dear, at times. Now,. this afternoon, Iuok how you rao away in a rage, because [ would not stop, when dinner was just ready, to tell you a lot of old. world stories." ' I was not in a rage." "In a pet, then, which was next door to it. However, it was partly my fault, so we will say no more about it. And now tell me, my dear, did vou see John Martin again?" "Yes." "Did he tell you anything?" "He could not; he was dead." A look of satisfaction certainly shone in Mrs. Pryor's eyes. She was not rejoicing on account of the old man's death ; she was only glad that Marian had lost the chance of hearing what, for certain reasons, she did not wish her to hear just then. "Poor man!" she sanil, composing her fea- tures into a dlecent gravity befitting the occa- sion. "And whiat will that pretty Rose do, for I suppose he has left nothing?" "Absolutely nothing." "With a ftac like hers; it would be madness to think of going out to service. But there is Hugh Deanett. I had forgotten him.  What a   I lucky thing for her that so res pectable and steady a young main is ready to offer her a home when- ever she chooses to accept ii.!" "But Rose will not marry him now, Mrs. Pry- or.' "Not marry him?   Why, she must be mad-" "Her father forbale it on his death-bed. And he told me distinctly that she was not to marry Hugh Dennett. I witnessed their part- ing, not half an hour ago. The poor fellow takes it sadly to heart; but I fancy Rose is not half so much grieved as he. I fear, in spite of her beauty, she has little feeling!" Mrs. Pryor did not answer. She seemed lost in a reverie. "Not marry Hugh Dennett?" she said, at last. "There can be but one reason for such a change; and yet it scarcely seeims possible-" ' She looked up, and seeing Mayrian's eyes fixed intently upon her, she broke off abruptly. "Is it not strange, Mrs. Pryor?" 'Very strange-very strange indeed, my dear! It seems to me that ever3 thing is getting to be strnnge in this world. I have lived almost too long ip it. One duty more to perform, one promise to keep, and then I shall be quite ready to go.'* "Now, it is you who are talking of graves, and who need a dose of valerian to cure you of the horrors," said Marian, smiling. '.' Yes, my dear. Are 3ou going down into 'te drawing-room this evening?" "I think so. Is Leonora very angry '" "I am afraid she is." "Well, there's one comfort, she will not dare to lecture me before the company. Besides, I want to ask her a question about Philip Vere." Mrs. Pryor held up her hands with a look of horror. "Miss Marian, don't you ask her that!" "I told you before I set out for the .cottage that I meant to get at the bottom of the mys- tery. You know I am as obstinate as a mule, when I set my heart upon anything. Well, I lihve set my heart upon knowing who Philip Vere is ; and if there is no other way of doing so, my cousin Leonora must be asked." She rose as she spoke, and legnn to smooth her hair and adjust her dress before the looking- glass. The old houeekeeper watched her with an uneasy look. She knew well that she was quite capable of fulfilling the threat; and when shie saw her move toward-the door. she held out her hand and said, coaxingly, "Miss Marian, come bar k to me, and I'll answer your questions. But don't on,any account go to Miss Moyell with them.". Marian returnedi careless and smiling, feeling that she had gained the victory at last. "Well, begin," she said, as she took her seat "Who and what is Phllip Vere?" "He is a London gentleman."   "That is not definite enough." "ie is a lawyer, Miss Marian' Young (or old?"  "About thirty, I should say." "A :most delightful age. Is he gooa-look- ing?" "Ladies (g nerally think so, I believe." "Dark or fi ir?" "Dark--with beautiful features, and large eyes, bright and soft like a deer's--and a smile like a flash of sunshine on a rainy day." "Why, you are growing quite poetical. I de- clare! Pray tell nme more about this delightful creature who can set you raving. You ought to be aslanmed of yourself, Mrs. Pryor, to lose your heart so readily." "Ah, child! I should never lose my heart to him, if there was never another man in the world! I don't, like him!" "Why not?" "Because he is a bad man!" "But what has he done?" The color rose in the old lady's cheeks, and her black eyes sparkled. "Done? he has compromised the honor of a noble old house; he has made a lady the laughing-stock of all his low London acquaint- ances; he has behaved in a why that makes me long to horsewhip him myself, old as I am, every time I think ot it!" "Oh, tell me all about it!" cried Marian, eagerly. "Then promise solemnly never to breathe a word to any human being, for it is a secret here in Downe Reserve." "I promise." ' Your cousin, Leonora, when she was first left alone - the mistress ot this handsome estate -did many a foolish thing.  She was but a child. She was not fit to have the power over herself and others that my poor dear master left in her hands. No wonder her head was turned, poor thing! She went to London for the season, and there she was quitE'a belle. Hler fine fortune and tier handsome face brought many a lover to her feet-yet she seemed to care for no one. At last she met Philip Vere!" "And fell in love with him?" said Marian, looking greatly interested. "No one ever knew; at least she refused him along with the rest. "Then she did not care for him?" "Perhaps not, then. But he would not take no for an answer. Hie followed her about, and flattered, besieged her, till at last she accepted him!" "My cousin engaged?" "Poor thing, it did not last long! The prep- arations for the wedding were hurried on. All was ready; and tihe day came. She went to church, Miss Marian--positively to church- and He was unot there!" "But where was he, then?"   "On the Continent, traveling with a party of friends. A letter reached her that very day, saying that, as she had rejected him once, ho took the liberty of rejecting her in his turn. And so the wedding ended. Did you ever hear of anything so shameful?" "But what did she do?" ,' ":Nothing.. The matter was hushed up as soon as possible, and she has lived here ever- since." ' But I would have followed him all over the worldl, and killed hiim!" said Marian, flushing crimson and clasping her hands. Mrs. Pryor did not answer, except to say that it certainly was a great shame. Marian linger- ed for a minute or two in\ silence, and then an- nounced her intention of going into the draw- ing-room. Her cousin Nora was suddenly in- vested with a new and strange ,interest in her eyes, and she felt as manch curiosity to look at her as if she had been a stranger, whose story she had thus heard for thfirst time. rlut Mrs. Pryor held her fast. "You'll never breathe a word of it to her when she makes you angry?" -"I? How can you dream of such a thing? Certainly not! I would not allude to it before ] her for the world!" "Good night, then, dear!" And the worthy lady left the room, blessing her stars that she had escaped another explana- tion, which she was by no means desirous of making. She had drawn Philip Vere as a sort of " red herring" across Marian's path, and the ruse had answered well.  She was already careering away on a different scent, leaving the secret in which she was most deeply interested quite undisturbed behind her. CHAPTER XV. DEAD HOPES AND WITHEAED FLOWERS. "The heart doth recognize thee, Alone-alone! The heart doth smell thee sweet- Doth view thee fair-doth judge thee most complete, Perceiving all those changes that disguise thee . "Yes, and'the heart doth owe thee More love, dead rose, than to any roses bold Which Julia wears at dances, smiiling cold! Lie still upon this heart, Which breaks below thee!" -E. B. BROWNING. The party in the drawing-room was a most cozy and home-like one. Although the days were full of sunshine the -evenings were still chilly, and the bright fire that burned upon the 1 hearth was very acceptable. A crimson-velvet 1 sofa was drawn up at a little distance from it, and in the light and heat basked Lady Revere, in'a violet satin dress, and i head-dress of black - lace interspersed with clusters of morning vio- 1 lets. She had a small screen in her hand, and o spoke now and then to Caroline, who was her - .companion, but she was more than half asleep all the while. At the card-table sat Lucy and Lord Revere, playing a game of chess. The    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6472-00000018"/> old Earl seemed delighted with his pretty, sparkling partner, although her tongue moved much faster than her fingers, and her blunders with knights and pawns were something quite beyond belief. At the piano sat Miss Moyell. 4She had been singing, but now she was touch- ing the keys slightly with the soft pedal down, and listening with a smile to Lord Mountchayne, who was leaning over her chair and talking in a low voice. Certainly she did not look like a love-lorn lady grieving for the loss of her rec- reant knight. Philip Vere was, apparently, forgotten-at least for a time. Marian stole softly across the rooeh, and stood beside Caro- line. That young lady, making a virtue of necessity, presaented her to the peeress, wlho bowed formally, and then blinked two or three times at her like a sleepy owl. Lucy, having finished her game of chess, beckon'ed to her. "Lord Revere is tired of me and my pranks," she said, archly; ", and he thinks you will play a game better than I." "Hum-ha! Delighted, if the young lady will do me the honor," said the courteous old gentleman, rising and making a profound bow. "But you do very well, Miss Lucy-very well, indeed!" "Then T will sit 'beside you and watch your game, and help you to beat my cousin," she said, perching herself like a bird, on the chair at his right hand. Marian sat down. Her fingers moved me- chanically, and she saw the room and its occu-. pants as if in a dream. The warm and per: famed atmosphere-the elegant furniture-tlhe beautiful dresses-the subdued voices-the air of gentle, refined enjoyment that characterized the scene, made her feel peculiarly out of place. Sitting in a drawing-room, and playing chess with a belted Earl, she felt entirely out of her element. In her old loft, among the dust, the lumber, and the tarnished books, she would have been quite at home. "Decidedly I ought not to be here," she thought, to herself, as the game went on. "' It is all very well for Nora, and Lucy, and Caro- line: they like it-they breathe their native air in such places. I do not. The only thing I am fit for is to marry a day-laborer, who earns twelve shillings a week. 1 could keep his cot- t tage clean, and make and mend his clothes, and I cook his bit of di ner of a Sunday very well. c But I have no business to be sitting here, dress 0 ed in a blue grenadine, and playing chess -with this very respectable old nobleman, who never ate off anything more vulgar than silver or t china in his life! Dear me I how stiff and awk- ward I feel! and how white his hands are!"  i, Her eyes wandered from the snowy ruffles, and the flashing diamond ring, to the two who d still lingered beside the piano, apparently obliv- ious of her presence.         I "How handsome Leonora looks, and how  e   'happy! W'ho would think, to see her now, d that Philip Vere had used her so shamefully! s Has she forgotten has she fiirgiven him? If I he had been in her place, 1 could never have held  up my head, or looked in the face of any human i- being again!"  At that moment Lord Mountchayne laughed , aloud. What a laugh it was!-so joyous, clear, a and sweet, like a peal of silver bells! Even a Lucy looked up with a smile of pleasure as she - heard it. But the old Earl puckered up his eyebrows and forehead into a tremendous frown. e  "Tuit-tut I What a noise that boy makes!" he said, testily. "One can harldly get leave to f think, while he is in the room." ' )  "Miss Moyell, I protest against my father's harsh judgment!" said the yonng man, who seemed to have wonderifully quick ears. "Come with me and convince himn of' his error; assure him that his only son is a pattern and a model, in every respect, for the risiigeneration ; and that no human being, all things considered, could make less noise in the world than your humble servant." They approached, the table together as he spoke. His eyes lit up as lie saw Marian. iHe smiled saucily, but said nothing. "You ask too much of me, my lord," replied Miss Moycll, turniig away, with a laugh. "You must make your peace as you best can. I can- not give such a wholesale recommendation to one of whom I know so little. I shall go and ask Lady Revere if I am not in the right in re- fusing it." "Deserted by my ally in my sorest need," said Lord Mountclinyne, turning to Lucy as if Ofo sympathy. "Fair lady, will you follow her examnple?" "Not I," said Lucy, frankly. "Sit down herec beside me, my lord, and no one shall find fault with you." "Here, take my seat," said the Earl, rising. I am going to ask Miss Moyell to give me a song." Loid Mountchayne accepted the offer with alacrity. Being thus brought face to face with Marian, Lucy was obliged to I resent him. 'Marian bit her lips as she met liis roguish eyes. He seemed to delight in the enimbarrassing posi- tion-in which she was placed, lie looked a handsome embodiment of nmiechief as he pro- ceeded to talk about that peculiarly English subject-the weather. "We must always begin with that remark, you know," he said, gravely. "When I had the honor of making my first bow to you, Miss Lucy, I said at the same moment that it was a heavenly day." "Yes, my lord; and I answered that yester- dav was finer." "So you did. And the rem',rk showed your discriminating powers of muind; fur yesterday was finer."   He laid a peculiar emphasis on the words. Marian did not look up or join in the conver- sation, but played with the chessmen before her. l "A day to- put one In mind of Paradise," he went on. i' And I spent it in an Eden - only it t was a ruined one; and a remarkably large ser- t pent had been there before me." "And Eve?" said Lucy, archly. tOh, she had gone ages and ages ago. Were. you out yesterday?" "Yes " "May I ask where?"  ",I went to the common, to see the May Queen." "And wits she so very beautiful?" "Rose Martin? Oh yes; she is the love- liest creature you ever saw in all your life!" ' And yet they say that one pretty woman will never acknowledge that another is possess- ed of good looks 1" said Lord Mountchayne, in a very audible aside. Lucy laughed, and blushed at the implied compliment to herself. "There would be'no use in denving Rose Martin's beauty ; it is visible to every beholder. And you would have been much better employ- ed yesterday in looking at her than in wander- ing about your iuiuned Eden, wherever it may ce," "Do you think so?" ' Yes. You say you are an'artist. Now you might have sketched our Queen-crown, scep- tre, and all." "'Oil, I found employment for my pencil in my Eden. I had an Egeria to sketch-a ruined fountain, and a grotto into the bargain!" Lucy looked rather puzzled. Marian turn- ed crimson, but still kept her eyes upon her chessmen. "I will show you the picture some day. You will at least recognize the place, if the nymph is unknown." "Is it near here?" "Within half a mile of your gates." "An Eden ; and I never knew it!" "An Eden with a very bad name, I am sorry to say. You would never venture to go there; you would be frightened out of y our wits at the - mere thought of such a thing " Lucy give a little start and shudder. 1"You can't mean that dreadful Downe Re- serve?" "You have guessed it!" "Why, there is a ghost there!" "I know it." "' The ghost of a woman!" "' Exactly. It must have been her that I sketched yesterday. Shle was standing beside a ruined, well." "Ugh! The Wishing Well. I would not drink the water there for all the world!" "She seemed to have no such scruples. She drank, and she wished a wish."   "Did you hear her speak?" "Distinctly." (And what was her wish?" Perhaps I will tell you some day. I really think, myself, that it may eome true. Stranger things have happened before now." Again Marian blushed deeply. Lucy went across the room to tell her sister of Lord Mount- chayne's adventure. The moment had come for which he had watched and waited all day long. He leaned over the table, and took a chessman from Mar- ian's trembling hand. "Why did you run away?" he asked, in a low voice.  You told me when we parted, that you would be glad to see me again." "And so I was," said Marian, shyly. "But--" "But what?" ".Why did you tell me your name was Fran- cis'Be.:ufort?" "Because it is Francis Beaufort Maurice- Lord Mountehayne, of Castle Maurice, at your service. Now, are you satisfied?" "Hardly. You might have told me then who you really were, and that you were coming ,here." "I could not resist the desire to surprise you. You are not offended with me."' "No." ", And you will not forget thlat we two are to be the best of friends always, whatever may hap- pen?" She did not answer. ," When are you going to Downe Reserve again?" he asked. "I cannpt say. Perhaps never." "Nonsense!  I want to make some more sketches there. I will get the young ladies to have a picnic at the Wishing. Well." "I doubt if you can." "Wait and see." There was a little pause. Then he said: ," When will you show me that picture in the study?" Marian twisted the head off an unfortunate bishop as she heard the question. -He leaned over the table, and took it from her hand, while  at the same time he gave that hand a warm pressure. * "Because, you know, the wish is to be fulfill- ed. A little bird told mhe so after you had left me at Downe Reserve the other day." He dropped her hand, and sauntered away to the group beside the fireplace. They greeted him with a hundred questions about the haunt- ed house and its ghostly occupant. i  "I saw no ghost," he answered, quietly; "but i if there is one, we will hunt it out very soon. Because I am going to ask a favor of Miss Moy- t ell, which, sooner or later, I know that she will grant. I am going to ask her to make a picnic  party within the grounds of Downe Reserve." A chorus of horrified exclamations greeted the    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6472-00000019"/> rash proposal, under cover of which Marian stole noiselessly from the room. Her head ached- her heaur ached, too, though she knew not why -and she longed to be alone. She weht to her chamber, and having bathed her temples in cold water, sat down beside the open window, and looked out. The moon was up, and the flower-garden beneath, and the thick grove of trees beyond, were bathed in a flood of silvery light. So calm, so peaceful itseemed! Marian lean- ed her aching iead upon her hand, and musedl upon tie many strange and unexpectel events  of the last two days. By and by everything  grew dreamy and indistiict--her head sank down on the window-sill, and she slept. soundly and: quietly as a little child. She awoke with a start two hours later. The  house was still, and the night-air blew in so cld  an chill upon her that she shivered from head to foot. "I shall have an influenza to-morrow, which will be exceedingly romantic," she said to her- self; and, rising, she was about to close the win- dow, when she caught a glimpse of some onie walking in the flower-garden beneath. A wom- an, who passed rapidly up and down, wringing her hands, and weeping ab she went. Marian remembered the apparition at Downe Reserve, and her heart beat so fist for an in- i stant that she thought shi must faht. But a second cautious glance showed her that this ias I ho ghost It was something stranger still-her Cousin Leonora!              1 She could not help watching her movements i from behind the curtains. But what was her c 'surprise at seeing Miss Moyell take something c from her breast, weep over it, kiss it passion- ately, and then dig up a little patch of garden- mold, and bury it out of sightJ The moon shone full upon the spot, and Marian saw plain- t ly that it was a faded rose which Leonora was n hiding so carefully from every eye.  A moment after, the hall-door shut, and cau- I tious steps came up the stairs. Her cousin's sl dooi was softly opened, closed again, and lock- t ed; then all was still. But it was almost morning before Marian could a forget that strange scene, or cease to think of him with whom she felt aure it was in some way  bonnected- the absent and faithless Philip 0 Vere.                   s CHAPTER XVI.  A ROMANCE OF THE DERBY-DAY.     m The arrival of Lord and Lady Revere and their son and heir caused, as might have been expect- v ed, the greatest sensation in the neighborhood. si Carriages were driving up the green lanes by scores on the afternoon of the following day; ni and before forty eight hours had elapsed, every- se body in the county worth visiting had left their, v cards at tue lodge-gate, or, in some particular j pi   le cases, had driven up to the house-door, and ex- - clhanged a few civil words with the great lady y ani ler pretty hostess. Certainly Miss Moyell had played her cards d very well It was a great trouble and expense e to eitertain the Priory fimily for so long a time; but she thought herself most amply repaid by kthe entree into the best society which their pres- fence gave to her and to her sisters. No one could ever venture to fling the little mishap with -:Philip Vere in her face again, after she had re- d ceived, not only the Earl and( Countess, but all the proudest families for miles around, as her welcome and honored guests. I  If, however, she had entertained any hopes of winning the heart and hand of the Priory's h eir while he sojourned within her gates, those hopes were speedily dashed to the ground. In the first place, he was courteous(and attentive to her, but nothing more. Jn the second, the Countess herself, on the very evening after her arrival, sought a private interview with Leono- ra in her own apartment, and gave her to un- derstand that if she could possibly make room for another titled guest, she should feel greatly obliged by her doing so. Seeing her look of alarm, her ladyship hastened to explain. "It' is only my niece--my poor sister's. child, Lady Theodosia Monmouth.  I dare say you may lhave heard of her." '  No," said Miss Moyell, " she was not out, I think, when I was in Lon ion." '.To be sure not! How stupid I am getting! Well, my dear, she is the quietest, plainest lady in the world, and she would give her ears to come and stop in the same house with Mount. chayne!" Miss Moyell blushed slightly. "Amn to understand, thenl-" "Iy dear, it has been talked of ever since they were babies! But young men are so queer nowadays. Mountchlayne cannot make up his mind to marly; and lie says lie does not like ool Tlheodosia; lie declarees she is an affected, stuck-up little thing. Now, I hope, if I get them together, in a quiet country-house like this, that she will be more herself, and that he will take a fancy to her-don't you see? ' Yes, "I 'se' said Mss Movell, feeling inward- ly that shewas an3thing  but obliged to the Countess for selecting the Pleasaunce as the scene of her experiment. "If I could but induce him to setle down " sighed her ladvship. "I wish they would only marry from  lere--how delightful it would be!" Very, said Miss Moyell; but her assent was very faint, and the Countess gave her a keen, sidelong glance. ' You see, mydear, it would be a conve. nience to us, while the Priory is all at sixes and sevens. I   tell you so canllidly, and I think it is very kind of you to tnke us all in, wlile, as one paly  say, we have not a roof over our heads.   3ut, on the other hand, I think our presence here will be a benefit to you. You know how stupid most English people are about anything like that sort of business of yours with Philip Vere?", "Yes, I know," said Leonora, turning crim- son. "To my cost-to my bitter cost l" "It was very shocking, and very humliating, it must be owned," snid the Countess, hastening to heal the wound she had made. "But now that we are with you, I am sure all old stories will quickly die away. and if Mountchayne and Theodosia would only marry from this house, who is there in the county that would refuse to visit the Pleasaunce then?" "Your ladyship is quite right. And I will use my best efforts to bring about the result we both desire. Shall I write to Lady Theodosia?" "A little note of invitation, if you please, and I will inclose it in my letter to-day." The note was written, and the invitation ac- cepted in person by Lady Theodosia, who came down from town the very next day, not thinking it necessary to stand upon any great ceremony with a lady who lacked a title. Lord and Lady Revere greeted her affectionately; but Lord Mountchayne's face, when he heard of her arriv- al, was good to see. "That affected little minx here! What on earth can she want at Zhe Pleasaunce?" he mut- tered, when Lady Revere brought him the joy- ful tidings. "You!" her ladyship might hane answered, with strict regard to truth. But she was too wise for that, and her pathetic exclamation, "Do you want to break my heart, Francis?" induced her son to go to the house and greet his cousin much more graciously than he had intended to do. He was annoyed and vexed at her coming, it is true, but he consoled himself with the thought, that for every evil there is a good; and made up his mind also as to the di- rection in which he should look for his counter- balancing comfort. Meanwhile, another event took  place in Downe, which excited the villagers as much as the arrival of Lord Mountchayne had excited the young ladiesi in the matrimonial market among the more-aristocratic circles of the place. This event was, the encampment of a tribe of gipsies upon some waste lands that bordered the common, nearly a mile beyond the walls of Downe Reserve. Never before had the 'ark-skinned gentry honored Downe with a visit. They had often encamped in or near the neighboring villages, and all the servant-girls had trudged off with their sweethearts to visit them and have their fortunes told. But to have them close at hand, ready to be consulted, morning, noon, and night, as the case might be, was a piece of good luck quite unexpected, yet, at the same time, thoroughly appreciated. The whole village was   in a ferment, and young and old, maids, wives, and widows talked and thought of nothing but the queer-/ooking tents and their vagrant occu- pants. The servants at the Pleagaunce wer' bitten with the mania as well as the rest, and great was the wrath of Mrs. Pryor at the dread. ful blunders they made in the progress of the day's work, while their hearts and thoughts were far away. Marian, hearing her scolding vehemently one morning as she passed the kitchen door, stopped to inquire the ca use, and thereby heard of the wonderful people, and the place where they were encamped. In her heart she registered a vow to visit them before their sojourn was over, though at the same moment she agreed with Mrs. Pryor in her severe repre- hension of Phoebe, the under-housemaid, who had broken six china plates and a porcelain cake-basket, while she was dreaming of the handsome young nobleman allotted to her by the spae-wife-and whom she had just began'to think might possibly be Lord Mountchayne himself. The days wore on; and Marian, engrossed in a new and strange delight, forgot all about the gipsies and their camp. Shle fancied that she could tell her own fortune far better then any spae-wife of them all. There was a presence haunting her by day and by night, there was a step that often kept pace beneath the Pleasaunce trees with her own ; there was a voice that made the sweetest music on earth in her ear; there was a hand whose lightest touch set the blood leaping like liquid fire through her veins; there were "twa blue een" that played the mischief with her dreams of the ileal; there was, in fact, a blind and bewildered fool, whose name was Marian Moyell. It made her smile with a strange wonder at herself in aftei years to think where and how that first fond fancy led her. To study his face, to listen for his step and voice by day, to pace up and down the garden-terrace by night, and watch the window where his light burned like a star, and where, I suppose, he was tran- quilly snoring, without a thought or dream of her-these were her dearest, her sweetest de- lights. She was his slave, h:s blind and infatu- ated worshiper! If he had held up his finger and beckoned her from the end of the earth, she would have flown to do his bidding If he had called to her from the depths of Vesuvius, she would have plunged down the crater to find, seek, and join him! If he had beaten her, she would have crouched meekly beneath his blows; if he had spurned her from him, she would lhave crawled humbly back and made herself his footstool. All things she would have borne from him, save one; and that was-ilnfidelity! *When a woman loves in this way, neitifer in- kindness, nor scorn, nor desertion, nor cruelty can shake her allegiance. Only a favored and triumphant rival can do thlat. So hog as a    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6472-00000020"/> hope remains, she :will cling to it; so long as she can believe that, in spite of all, some linger- ing tenderness is given to her, she will take comfort and support from the knowledge. But once convince her that no regard is left-once let her see that another is preferred before her -and though she m:iy still be faithful to the memory of the past-though she may still cherish tenderly her vanished dream-her ab. ject, unquestioning, idolatrous worship is dead, and will never revive again! Considering the depth, tie earnestness, and the intensity of this kind of love, it seens a blessing indeed to reflect that it never comes twice in a lifetime. Hun- dreds of women go down to their graves in liap- py   rance of its nature. Thousands feel it -outTve t-and make the best of life for ever after. But their hearts are a heap of ashes, and the flowers that may chance to grow there are but pale and puny blossoms compared with the beauty of the rich red roses of the summer- time. While Marian was taking-her firstelessons in the science of self-knowledge, whicl ifn the future could give a store of bitter experience for her guidance; and while the villageegils, by- two and threes, were runnihg to the gipsy-c*amp to learn the truth or falsehood of their respec- tive swains, there dwelt within that camp itself a young and beautiful girl, who would gladly have sought, at the hands of her own people, some insight into the coming years, had they really been able to give it. She was Ate. daugh- ter of one of the principal women of the tribe; and having lost her parents at an early age, she was, in every sense of the word, the child of the whole encampment, Petted and indulged by all from her earliestinfancy, she had grown up a beautiful, free, and careless creature, to whom the very name of sorrow was unknown. lhe lightest tasks, the pleasantest duties, were hssigned to Cara by her protectors; and had any bne ventured to breathe a word of insult in her  Ear, a hundred stout arms would have been  lifted in her defence upon the instant. So care-  ful were they of her, that when the tribe moved  from place to place, she was hidden from every e roving eye in the covered van; and when they i visited the races and other public resorts, she I was left at home under the guardianship of the  old woman who had received her from her dy-  ing motler's arms.             f But this restraint suited the girl so little that a she grew thin, and pale, and fretful; and seemed 1 to pine away day after day, till sle was but the I shadow of her former self. To bring back her gayety and good l.-oks, her adopted parents re- v laxed the strictness of their rule -a little, and a permitted lh r to accompany them now and then s when they went abroad on their expeditions of a combined pleasure and profit. At last, at her n earnest andil often-repe:atcd request, they took f l-:;-'to ;,l;l s the rce  thethe famous Derby o   s Day. Alas! it was not only thonsands of poundn - that were lost and won upon the course that afternoon! There went with the golden sover' t eigns a human heart, a human life, and perhaps -but who shall solve that problem?-a human soul? Standing among the carrrrges, and lis. tening to her companion as site told fortunes Iright and left, with the glibbest of tongues, poor Cura met her fate. It came to her in the shape of a handsome dark gentleman of thirty. who leaned over the box of his barouche, and paid her some unmeaning compliment on the beauty of her eyes: They were light words, and lightly spoken, and she had heard a hun. dred such that day with a careless nod and smile. But something in the speaker's voice and face attracted her, and she stood at a little distance, after he had turned away, watching him as he talked to the ladies in the carriage; or joked with his friends upon the box. At last the great race of the day was run, Every eye except Cara's was upon the course. She thought nothing of the horses, except as they concerned the stranger. There was awild cheer, as the signal-number of tihe winner flashed out. The color flew back into the pale face she was watching. "I have won two thousand pounds!" lie cried out; turning to his friends. A chorus of con- gratulations greeted his success. As he listened to them, his eyes fell by chance upon the gipsy. girl, whose facewas radiant-whose eyes were hixed upon him with a look he knew only too well how to interpret. "Two birds with one stone," lie muttered, with a curious smile; and, making an excuse to his friends, he dropped quietly down among the crowd, and was soon standing by Cara's side. He did not speak, but thrust a card into her hand, and was gone. It contained only a name and address, but that was quite enough for Cara. "At ten, A. M., to-morrow," was pencil. ed beneath the address. Sh1e was at the place appointed by half-past nine the next mornirng It was a lonely little inn, on the high road to London. The stranger met her there, persuad- ed her to elope with him, and, in order to re- move her scruples, went through a form of mar- riage, where a college-friend of his officiated as clergyman. He established himself with his "bride" in a pretty cottage, about six miles from London, where she passed'thiree months in a dream  of happiness, scarcely thinking of the home, the friends, and relatives she had left behind. At the end of that time, the young husband was suddenly summoned to the Continent, to attend to some business-transactions, which in- volved the loss or gain of large sums of money and the wife was left alone. le never returned nor did any letter come to tell of his success or' failure. 'Bewild ered and unhapopy, Csara waited on il her suburban cottage for six months Illore.   Then she returned to her people, and told her I tale. She was received with open arms; but ag the young men of her tribe, unknown to her, y( kept a watchful and incessant look-out for the t stranger who had evidently deceived and desert- ed her. It was all in vain, however; and when they came to Downe Reserve, more than two  years had elapsed since his strange disappear- ance.  This peculiar event, which had saddened and darkened her whole life, could not so easily be forgotten by the girl as by her associates. She never heard the stranger mentioned--the name of "Richard Verton", by which she had known tl him, was unspoken, save in the depths of her Si own heart. Yet, still she remembered him- still sihe yearned after him-still she was ready  to forgive him-if he would but return to her  once mhore I She wandered from the encampment one  pleasant evening, and walked up the lane toward Downe Reserve, thinking of her brief wedded a life, and of the face she should see no more. The sound of horse's feet startled her. A gen- tleman was riding leisurely down the lane, tow-i ard the camp. Seeing her, he paused, as if to t ask a question. She looked at himu through her tears, with a wild unbelief in hergreat happi- ness. It was her husband! "O Heaven! am I dreaming?-am I mad?' she cried. "Richard I Is it you? After all these weary, weary years '" "It is really me!" said the rider, looking oved at her tearful joy. "And I have come back to make you happy, and to tell you all! I have been tracing your tribb in every direc- tion, and at last I found they were here. So I came at once-hoping to gain tidings of you- but never dreamilg that your sweet free would be the first to welcome me, my forest-beauty!" "O Richard, I should like to die now!" she sobbed; and, bending down her head, she kiss- ed the foot that rested in the stirrup. It was the only way in which she could express and relieve the pain of love and submission that was thrilling at her heart. I "Nay," said the gentleman, bending down and drawing her closer to his side ; " that is not the welcome you should give me, my pretty one! Kiss my lips-not my footl Why, you are handsomer than ever, you dark-eyed little witch!" She smiled and blushed. "And you never ask me why I have stayed away so long!" "How can I, when I see that you are still faithful-thlat your heart is still my own?" she said, simply. He made an odd grimace. "Of course. But it is my duty to explain. I went to Frnnce-and then my business took me to Australr . There I fell ill, and then I lost my properly, rand was too far to comle back,   I would not write til! I had made n fortuine again ; and I have Ilrade'it, and I am faithful as you see, and have cofne back to ask you to siarn it wiLth e, Cara!" "Olh, my love-my love!" "Will they take me in at the tents, do you think?" lie asked, after a slight pause. Gladly. They will welcome you with heart and hand!" "Well, let us go." "And, Richard!" "Yes, my beauty." "Would you mind-do you mind going through our own ceremony here? It would satisfy and please them so!" "Oi, I'll go through any ceremony you like -so it gives me an undisputed right to your pretty self,"' he replied, with a smile. "Then come!   Oh, I fear my heart will  break with joy!" She took his horse's bridle-rein in her hand, and like the old ballad- "Lord Johi he rode, Burd Helen ran," . if not " the livelang simmer-day", at least till they reached the first tents of ahe gipsy-camp CHAPTER XVII. "THE DtYS WHEN WE WENT 'GIPSYING." "Bt they felt not the sweetness that smiled from the 1    lea, And they knew not the way of the wind through the tree; And they saw not the sea, when they looked at the e    sea! !"The wood-dove tapped, note of the storm, the shy wren Twittered fearful, and low hung the mist o'er the fen, But all that they thought of was three little men! d"The wind rose, the clouds gathered, mass upon mass; d The sun drew his long lines of light from the grass- Alas! for the three little women, alas!" he                -ALICE CAREY. s-  Lord Mountchayne, like every other petted is and indulged young nobleman, was full of whims- id and caprices, which he followed to the end witht is all the eager gayety of a boy. The picnic to- Downe Reserve was,one of these' fancies, and' id having once got it intaohis head, he gave no' ie one any rest or pence till they had entered into, e! his plan. Mrs. Pryor held up her hands in boror' ,re at first hearing of the proposed excursion, and: le said that it was a rash tempting of Providence; but for all that, at the request of his lordship,. she made loaf after loaf of ,delicate cake, ed and roasted chickens, and prepared tongues,. with her own hands; giving as a reasn af ter- till ward, to 'Marian, that " really, my Lor I was so- he handsome, there was no refusing him an ;thirng." Marian assented to this docrine with all er' heart; so did Lady Theodosit, and Mi s Caro- in. line, and Miss IMoyell. So, apparently, did alL ok the young ladies of the neic lihoring ia uilies; I for one and all nccepted their invitations, and- ck. assembled at the Pleusaunce on tie morn ng ap- i,    <pb n="40 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000021"/> pointed, with just enough of nervous flutter and timidity in their manner to make it quite evi- dent that it was only to oblige Lord Mount. chayne that they ventured to go to such a dread ful place. For the sake of his lordship, or rather for the sake of the coronet and fortune he would eventually have it in his power to be- stow, the fair creatures would have encountered all the ghosts in Christendom; and no one knew it better than he. Among the whole party there were but two exceptions to this general rule. One was Lucy Moyell, who did not care two pins for him, thought him'a spoiled cox- comb, and told him so frankly to his face; and the other was poor Marian, who loved him with her whole heart and soul, regardless of his rank and future wealth, and only conscious that he was more bright, and beautiful, and perfect, than any created being; and that from his high position he had deigned to stoop and cast a glance of sincere regard upon her-unworthy of his notice, still more of his friendship, though she might be. Poor Marian! She was not happy from the, moment when the guests began to arrive, and Lord Mount- chayne went out to receive them. .She watched the scene with a dismay that would have been ludicrous if it had not been so genuine. In the first place, she had selected from her not too extensive wardrobe a dress which she thought most suitable for the occasion. It was a pale pink gingham, trimmed lavishly with white braid; substantial enough to resist intru- sive briars and brambles, yet sufficiently pretty, as she inhocently imagined, to attract the only  eyes she'cared to please. She wore a pair of strong, solid kid boots, a black silk scarf, and a plain straw gipsy hat, with a green ribbon twist-  ed round the crown. Lady Theodosia, between whom anrd Marian i there was constant and almost open war, looked E up as she came down into the hall, and said c something to her cousin, with a sneering smile. ( He turned and looked. Oh,' that glance of sur- i prise!. She almost sank beneath it, though he E did not speak. And then turning to Lady The- e odosia and Miss Moyell, she saw that they were f arrayed like the lilies of the field; that is to say, they wore gossamer floating robes, that n were miracles of lightness and beauty-the G daintiest of boots, the freshest of gloves, and d hats, and parasols, calculated to make the cows h they met, ruminate with placid wonder, or take ai their heels in pure dismay:        i Nor were they alone in their elegance. As u carriage after carriage drove up, and one young e( lady after another ascended the steps, each .is- at 'played the same airy and graceful attire. Nor p was this the worst of it. On them Lord Mount- li chayne bent no disapproving glance. He met at them  with an air of courteous devotion, that it wrung the poor girl's heart with jealous pain. ai He had never bowed his beautiful head so be- at lt   nd fore her-never talled to her with that smile, vi- that voice-never Hetlt in that respectful way to it- hear what she was saying. What did it all d- mean, except that he could not like her, as he or could like those beautiful creatures-that her pe place was in the kitchen rather than in the nall, e- and that she wished she was dead? ed  She reached this climax of tier misery just as w the carriages ranged themselves in a line before by the door. Lord Mountchayne was busy hand- al fig the young ladies to their places, and did -e not look toward lier. She would gladly have x- stayed at home, but Lucy, who sometimes took d it into her head to be rather fond of her, pull- h ed her along to the family-chaise, and drove off, k having first the felicity of seeing Lord Mount- e chayne seating himself beside Lady Theodosia, t, and opposite two of the prettiest girls the coun- i ty could boast; a  It was better when they reached the grounds y of Downe Reserve, because dinner is the first consideration with every one who attends a pic- nic party. n  Marian knew nhore about the unpacking of baskets and the arrangement of the table than I any one else and even Lady Theodosia was subject to her orders, and obliged to behave civilly to her for more than half an hour. Feel- ing herself of use, she brightened up wonder- efully,' and consoled herself during dinner by thinking that Lord Mountchayne was, after all, really obliged to pay attention to his guests, and that he meant no more in so doing than the gallant Guardsmen, who had been invited to fill up the ranks of gentlemen, meant by the ten- der things they were saying to their respective partners under the cover' of shai'ing with them their cold chicken and champagne. The meal was finished at last-the disheb and fragments cleared away; and as no one de- sired to explore the house, or venture very far out of sight of the main party, they got up a dance upon the lawn, with the help of an oblig- ing young gentleman, who had brought a clari- net in his pocket, anal whlo blew away at waltz- es and polkas, till he grew quite black in thy face.  Here, again, Marian began to shffer the toJ- ments of jealousy. A young Cornet of the Guards, who, had taken a fancy to Lady Theo- dosia, only to be dreadfully snubbed 'by that haughty damsel for his presumption, came and asked her to dance; but she was too shy to ex- hibit her i-ustic airs and graces before so many unmerciful judges, and though she really-waltz- ed very well, she preferred to sit upon the grass and watch Lord Mountchayne as he' whirled his pretty partners round and round in that de- lightful dance. How pretty they were dressed, and how much he seemed to admire them! Was it possib;e that helcould clasp a slender waist. and look down into a lovely blushing face, and and hold a warm and trembling hand-and still    <pb n="0-41" xml:id="VAC6472-00000022"/> remember herl-pooi, ugly-, awkwnrd, friendless creature that she was. Nol , no: a thousand times, no!-her aching heart cried out. And if she had but seen him first as she saw him then, what hours and days, and years of anguish might have been spared der! To the pleasant, quiet inmate of a simple country-house she had given her love-her idolatry-herself; but to this bright star of fashion, this petted darling of societLy she would never have dreamed of lifting her eyes! However, the mischief w:is done. She had Been and loved; and now she must suffer. There was no use in entering the lists against rivtals like these; since, it by chance she van- ished one, a thousand fairer than she would start utp instantly in her place. She must ac- cept her destiny, which evidently was, to love "ithout being loved again, and to lose a heart before it had ever been fairly won or thorough- ly possessed. It was by no means a pleasant luture to look forward to with eyes so young and bright as hers. Yet she sat musing over ir, while the dancers whirled by, till the groups brokejup suddenly, and the young ladies came hurrying over to the trees where she was sit- ting. i I do believe it is going to rain hard. Ifelt a great drop on my face just now," said Lady Theodosia, with a lainguid lisp; and looking up at the :sky, Marian saw that it was overcast, and that black clouds were rolling up in heavy masses from the west.  , CHAPTER   XVIII. THE PROPHECY. "ast home ran the robin, fast home flew the wren The black snake led all his black sons to the fen, That lay 'twixt the three little women and men. "The sky was all over one horrible frown! The rain from the hill-tops in torrents dashed down, The three little short-sighted women to drown. "Oh, their folly in trusting to see things alone, Through the eyes of their three little men-not their Own!"         -ALIOR CAREY. In ten minutes more, their fate was decided. The sky grew darker and heavier; the wind moaned ominously through the trees; and, after one or two preparatory sprinkles, the rain came down in heavy slanting lines, that promis- ed no cessation for minutes-perhaps for hours. It was one of those deceitful April showers that sometimes fail t, make an appearance in their own proper month, and then take it upon them-  selves to render the sunshine of May an uncer- tain and-transitory thing. Alas,: for the delieate muslin dresses-the  transparent gauze bonnets--the hats of lace and  rice-straw that had been prepared to captivate the wandering eyes of Lord Mountchayne! That downright, searching, pitiless shower, had no respect for rank or beauty, and in a very e short time the gala dresses presented a most c /   s pitiable spectacle. Lord Mountclayne could I scarcely keep from smililg ILs he surveyed the f forlorn-looking damsels who stood in a line b eneith a group of old trees, looking first at i the clouded heavens, and then at their own ,ruined finery, with faces of the most lugubrious I ,despair. It was Marian's hour of triumph The pink gingham dress and the plain straw hat had suf- f fered a woful eclipse in the earlier part of the day, but now they looked like the robes of a queen in comparison with the equipments of her draggled and disconsolate neighbors.- Perhaps it was the consciousness of this fact that made her so perfectly at her ease. More than one gentleman turned with a sigh of relief from the fretful lady at his side, to her round, cheerful, energetic lace, that was just then bright with a tholught of relief for them all. "We shall catch our deaths, if we stand here," she remarked, and a chorus of assenting voices welcomed the axiom. "' Then let us look for a place of shelter." "Agreed," said Lord Mountchayne, laughing. "But where Is it to be?" "The village is too far away." "Oh, quite!" said Lady "heodosia, with a little scream of horror. "Besides, we can never exhibit ourselves in this plight. I remember getting caught in a shower worse than this, in Egypt; antd, I assure you, as we rode into Cairo, dripping and miserable, on our donkoys, every Ara1r we met seemed delighted at our misfortunes." "' How shocking! But then what can you ex- pect of Arabs?" murmured the young ladies around her. "I don't see what the Arabs have to do with -the matter," said Marian, brusquely. "I sup- pose the people of Downe have heard of such a thing as one's getting wet in a shower; and if they should happen to laugh (for we are a very shabby-looking set, I confess), why, they are only ' the canaille', and your ladyship need not mind them." Lord Mountchayne smiled covertly behind his handkerchief. But Lady Theodosia shrug- ged her shoulders, and stared at Marian as if she had been some novel and curious production of nature submitted for the first time for her in- spection. "My dear!" she said, in a very audible tone of voice, as she turned to Miss Moyell, " what very extraordinary notions your cousin seems to have!" "Oh, don't mind her," said Leonora, looking carving-knives and daggers at Marian for her rudeness. "Is she quite proper, do you think?" Marain hearing tilis, laughed aloud; "Well, my Lord," she said, " how is it to be settled? Are we to stay and take our wetting, or seek a refuge at once "'I    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6472-00000023"/> "Oh, the refuge, by all means i Why 3an't we all go into the old house together?" The ladies uttered little shrieks, and protest- ed that they were ready to faint at the mere thought of such a thing. Lady Theodosia was especially velhement, and declared ;hat she would rather catch a hundred colds than'ven- ture inside that dreadful place, which, she was quite sure, was as full of ghosts, from top to bottom, as it could hold. It took a great deal of coaxing and soothing to recover her from the effect of so horrible a proposal. Lord Mount- chavne administered this soothing as in duty boutnd, looking obliquely at Marina from be- neath his long eyelashes' as he did so. When the commotion had subsided, thatf young lady also put her veto on the plan for invading the solitude of Downe Reserve. "' I have not the slightest doubt that there is' at least one ghost there," she taid, seriously. "(And I should be very sorry to be-the means of alarming so delicate a person as Theodosia unnecessarily. But there is a place near at hand quite free from ghosts, and tenanted by living beings, who will be only too happy to assist us. We can warm ourselves by their fires, and share their evening meal into the bar- gain, if we like. I allude to the gipsy encamp- ment, which lies about a quarter of a mile ,beyond the Wishing Well." "Real gipsies I Oh, how delightful! Let us go at once!" cried a cho'ru? of damsels. "And after we are warm and dry, perhaps we can get our fortunes told." Lady Theodosia's pale -eyes kindled, and she looked up fondly in the face of her cousin. "What do you think of it, Francis?" "The best plan imaginable. You are wet to the skin, and I shall have a lecture a mile long to-night from my lady-mother if you come to harm. You had better go, and we'll have some supper out of 'the gipsies' kettle. What fun it will be ", "If you approve of it I will certainly go, Francis. But mind you, keep close to my side when we reach tlh encampment. I shall be frightened to death of those rude men if you are away" Lord Mountchayne bit his lip. "My dear Theodosia, I will not leave you. But you need have no fear while so large a-party are around you." "I shall fear nothing by your side. Francis," was the sentimental reply ; and leaning fondly on his arm, she allowed him to lead her in the direction of the encampment. The other gentlemen followed, with their fail partners. Marian came at last, attended by Cornet Sautney, who was as sulky as a bear be- cause Lady Theodosia had taken her cousin'i arm instead of his. Some unspoken sympathy surely made him draw near Marian, since she. too, was brooding over the sarame subject, thougl   with slightly different thoughts. She was wish. ing that she was rich and ioble like Lady Theo- dosia, so that Lord Mountchayne might pay his attentions openly where she felt persuaded his heart was already interested. She was not only envious, but a little angry. She was too proud to bear with patience even r seeming slight; and the mere' fact that the young nobleman had ventuied, now and then, 'to seek her presence uninvited, to whisper words of friendship-nay, of positive tenderness -in her ear, gave her, in her own mind, a claim upon him, which he had no right, even in pub- lic, to ignore or set aside. All the day long she had been chafing secretly at her position. With her plain dress, her awkward embarrass- ment, and her ignorance of all the common topics of the day, it seemed to her that she was looked upon by the gay party more as a privil- eged upper servant than as a guest at the pic- nic, who had been invited, and, what was more, "nplored, to come by its founder. While the I cloth was being laid, and the dinner was in course of preparation, she had been a very active and important personage. Under her direction Lady Theodosia had maide a salad, and Lord Mountchayne had dressed a lobstelr i while her cousins, and the gay Guardsmen, had 6on- tinually called her to assist them in the disposal of certain dishes, and knives and forks, that were, inclined to take up more room than was allot- ted to them. This suited her very well. But when the dinner was eaten, and th6 clothes and dishes were packed safely in their baskets, her import- ance ceased with her usefulness, and no one seemed to give a thought to her. Her cousins were rude, the others cold, Lady Theodosia im- pertinent, and Lord Mountchayne neglectful, as well as the other gentlemen. This waits the last drop in the full cup. And now, after having come to their rescue in the hour of need, hav- ing suggested the measure which no one else had the sense to propose, they were all quietly trudging off across the fields to avail theiiselves of it-while she was left behind with tha, idiotic iyoung soldier, whose only recommendatioi in her eyes was, that he was apparently suffering pangs, on his own account, much like those which wrung her own breast. r  Certainly it was with no very amiable feel. ings that she thus reviewed the situation, and ' reflected that a heavy purse, an ancient mansion, rand a golden coronet made all the difference e between her and the young patrician who lean- ed with such insulting security upon the arm of r the man whom she had chosen for herself from all the world, and who had given her every rea- - son to think that he approved of and confirmed s her choice. With a heart thus swelling with anger under her real and her fancied injuries, she entered the h gipsy encampment, whose swarthy inmates, to'   the number of twenty or thirty, cirme crowding eagerly around the party. Lord Mountchayne constituted himself spokesman ; and, through his exertions, they were provided with seats around a blazing fire, that soon dried the satu- rated garments of the ladies, and restored the cheerfulness of the gentlemen. A great cal- dron, like that of the witchles of Macheth, smoked and bubbled over the blaze, and sent farth a most appetizing smell. The old crone who at- tended as the presiding genius of the scene, nodded a delightful assent to Lord Mount- cihayne'e proposal that they should share its contents with the people of the tents. ; "But, Francis, it may be dogs and cats, for aught you know," said Lady Theodosia. The old'woman heard her, and grinned sig- nificantly, as she glanced toward the well-stock- ed:preserves of a gentleman's seat not far away. It was no other than the Priory, and the young nobleman laughed as he caught her eye. "We shall sup at my father's expense, Theo- dosia," he said, good-humoredly, "And you need not fear a stew made of kittens and puppy dogs. The rabbits that breed in the Priory, woods are most unexceptionable in point of size and flavor." "How delightful this is!" said Lucy My- ell, as she warmed her hands before the genial blaze. "I wish I had been born in a tent. I would rather be a gipsy than anything else on earth." - Lady Theodosia looked shocked. "It must be such fun," persisted the lively girl; "No bother with houses then ; no fuss with servants; no being tied down for ever to a stupid little village, because your estate hap- pens to lie there. Nothing to do, when you tire of your quarters, but to take your house on your back, like a snail. and be off to ' fresh fields and pastures new'. It would suit you, Marian, even better than it would me." Marian, who sat a little apart from the rest, ceased patting the head of a dog, who had come to make her acquaintance, and looked up with a smile. "Yes ; I should like to be a gipsy." "The very thing you are fit for, I should say," remarked Lady Theodosia, staring her in the face with her most helpless air. "Thank you; I am glad to find that your ladyship thinks me fit for anything,"'replied Marian, returning her gracious look with in- terest. "How those two do fight with each other, to be sure!" drawled Captain Morton to Miss Moyell, in an undertone. She smiled. "Can't you guess why?" "No " "When Women fight it is generally for some- thing." 'I dare say,"   "And the something generally happens to be * a gentleman!" "Ha, ha! You do us too much honor, But who' is the happy man in this particular case?" "I leave it to your penetration to decide." "Egad! I never had any," said the gallant Captain, unconsciously telling the truth, Then raising himself on his elbow, to take a survey of the whole party, he spied Lord Mountchayne bending his handsome head down to his cousin's ear, while Marian's dark eye watched him with a glance not to be mistaken, "The deuce!" he said, sinking back with a ludicious look of wonder. "Is it him?" "It is." "Your'little cousin flies high--I'll be shot if she don't!" "She will come down all the sooner," said Leonora, with bitter emphasis. "But a plain little thing like that-! Oh, I beg your pardon---" "You need not, My cousin and I waste no love on each other!" "Then, perhaps, you will excuse me for sav- ing that she is very foolish to dream of tahking Mountchayne away from Lady Theodosia. Why, all the world knows that they were selected for each other in their cradles. And, though, t,e- tween you and me, I believe Mounitchayne hates the sight of her-Lady Revere has decreed it, and the thing must be," "So I have heard." Captain Morton eyed Marian a few minutes in silence. "It is almost a pity!" he remnarked, at last. "She is not pretty, but she seemns a ldnd, sensi- ble, bright little thing, I should say she had brains!" "People are generally furnished with them, I believe," said Miss Mo% ell, dryly. "Yes ; but I mean she looks as if she had a little more than the usual allowance. She looks like a clever girl. Don't you see?" "I dare say she does to you!" "And, between ourselves, Mountehayne has not a second idea beyond his painting. You might as well give her a hint to that effect," "I? What for?" "Why, she is your cousin, you know ; and it would be only kind to save her' from making an idiot of herself about a man who can nevetr marry her, and who would not suit her even if he could," "If you are so deeply interested in Marian'8 welfare, you had better tell her so yourself," replied Miss Moyell, looking huffed, and mov- ing her seat to thie other side 'of the fire. "I've put my foot into it, now!" said the Cap- tain to himself, as he pulled ruefully at his tawnv moustaches. " it is very strange how wild it always makes a woman if you say the least word in praise of another. And as I can't af' ford to lose my chance of pocketing the rents    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6472-00000024"/> of the Pleasaunce, Miss Marian must 'gang her ain gate' for me. I can't befriend her at the expense of my own purse and pocket. I wish I could give her a quiet little hint, though, all the same." There was no need. Marian had overheard every word of the brief conversation, and sat digesting her newly-acquired inflormed as best she might, The scorntul way in which Leo- nora had spoken of her, and the pity expressed by the C:aptain, which, from its very nature, was, half-inbulting, in spite of its kindness, faded into insignificance before the startling fact of Lord Mounlcltayne's tacit engagement to his cousin. A thing whh was so well known to all the world except herself, must have beefiin contemplation for years. It was a family-ar- rangement, in fact, of which he had beer per- fectly conscious when he first met her at Downe Reserve , he had known-as he talked to her on that day-as he greeted her in her own home-as lie walked with her beneath the shade oftthe Pleasauuce trees-as he sat beside her in the dusty loft-that Lady Theodosia, and not Marian Moyell, was to be his bride! 0 fool that she had been to take his smiling looks, his tender words, for more than they could mean! He was the young prince upon his own domain; and she was the young beg- gar-girl, who crossed his path, beguiled his at- tention for an instant, and then was cast aside and forgotten; and the princess came with pomp and pageant, the ringing of bells and the glad shouts of the people, to claim him for her own! She was humbled to the very dust at the thought. She looked no more at him or Lady Theodosia, but sat with her head bent down,  and her hand resting upon the neck of the i poor, faithful cur, who seemed to understand and respect her grief, and only sought to show his sympathy by crouching close to her side with a mute caress. Lost in that sad reverie, she scarcely knew how time passed by, and had almost forgotten the party round her, when she was startled by a step, and a voice, that said softly in her ear: "IThe supper is ready-are you not coJn- ing?" "No, my Lord," she replied, without looking up. "What is the matter?" "Nothing." "Are you cold?" "No." 'Ill?" "No."  "Unhappy?"  "No," she answered; but something rose in her throat, and almost choked her as she spoke. "I wish you would come and eat supper," he said, pleadingly.   "I cannot eat," "But come, if only to please me." "Don't ask me." "You don't care to please me, then P? ' I ought not to care." "Ah!" he said, eagerly, "I thought as much. Some one has been telling you a quantity of rubbish about Lady Theodosia." "I have heard that you. are to marry her," said Marian, steadily. 'My dear child, that- is my mother's plan, not mine. I can't bear her, with her confound- ed airs and graces. If any man had dared to say the things she has said to you to-day, I would have punched his head for him in five- minutes." Marian smiled sadly.. "My Lord, I am quite able to fight my own battles," ' That you are. You gave her shot and shell, together two or three times. 1 can't think what makes her hate you so." "Because I hate her, it may be." "Poor little Marian! If I had my own way, no one should dare to be rude to you again, Do you believe that?" "I must not." "You must, I tell you. What is Lady Theo- dosia to you? Why, you have more brains in this little brown head than her whole family ever had-the whole of them lurped together, from the crusaders down to this present day." "She is looking at you; you must go." "I won't till you say you will be happy again." I'll try." "Where is your dear tie hand? Put it out under your cloak. What a mouse's paw it is, to be sure! There now, don't fret any more. 'It will all' come right in the end, see if it don't." He gave the ' mouse's paw" a squeeze that made it tingle again; and then went back to Lady Theodosia, who was just looking round for him with a brow as black as night. Marian rose, and wandered beyond the encampment, attended by her four-footed friend. The rain had ceased, and the sun was just setting. Overhead, the sky was clear and blue, but in the west a bed of dark-looking clouds formed the couch on which the descending monarch was to rest. There was a wild, fresh sweetness in the air-a perfume of broom flow- ers, of lilac blossoms, of apple, pear, and cherry blooms, all mixed with the odor of the upturned earth, and the smell of the privet and sweet- brier, still wet with drops of rain. In the fields the lark was still singing; in the woods the deep notes of the cuckoo could be distinctly heard; and the twittering of swallows, and the cawing of home-flying rooks, formed the constant cho- rus to the universal song. Marian leaned upon a stile, and looked and   listened with a heart that, in spite of some ling- ering doubts and fears, sat lightly on its throne. Earth was fair again-the world was once more a happy place wherein- to dwell-because that musical voice hanl breathed a dozen words of undecided import in her ear. Yes, as he said it would all come right in the end ; and she would wait, and have patience and hope; and above all, faith in his truth and honor! "Dreams! dreams! We are all dreaming from our cradle to our graves!" said some one at her elbow. She started and turned round. There stood a gipsy woman, of unusual size and stature, with a bright kerchief on her head wlich fastened beneath the chin, and partly covered her olive cheeks. Her features were large, but beautifully formed; her eyes, bright and bold, with a cold smile lingering in their depths; her teeth, white as snow; and her hand and foot, models in their shape, if not for their size. Her voice was peculiarly deep, but not unpleasiug; and her whole appearance was so striking that Marian gazed at her without speaking lor several minutes. "'Dreanms are the greatest rubbish in the world, young ltdy," he said at last. "Come down- to the camp iffive minutes' time, and I'll tell you wlat yours are worth?"  "Who and what are you?" asked Marian. "Rosina the Gipoy, at your service," she re- t plied, with an awkward courtesy; "'and I'm i going down yonder to the gentlefolks to tell  their fortunles." She leaped the stile, and went toward the u camp by a side-path that led to the back of the a tents. Marian followed more slowly. When site reached the party, the gipsy had already n commenced her predictions. They were of the usual stamp, beginning b with a dark and a fair man, and a handsome present, and ending with a fine marriage, a large fortune, seven or eight beautiful children, health, happiness, and troops of loving friends. Much laughing, and blushing, and jesting en- sued upon her revelations. But when Miss Moyell came forward, the gipsv sat silent for an instant, and then looked searchingly into the young lady's face. "And so you have come to have your for- tune told, my pretty lady?" she said. Miss Moyell started at hearing her voice, and turned white. Bending forward, she looked at the gipsy earnestly. Tile dark, bright eyes never flinched before her gaze. "HFow absurd of me!" she muttered, as she turned away. "But I will not have my for- tune told ; 1 know all about it already mself." The gipsy laughed aloud, and turned to Lady TheodosiaC d "A piece of gold, my lady, for so white a hand as yours," she said; and the young peer- ess, with a smile of gratified vanity, put a sov-   ereign into her extended palm. Rosina bent down and said something to her, too low for the others, to hear. The haughlty lady drew herself up, and colored excessively. "You ought to be put into the stocks for your impertinence," as she marched away to join her friend Leonora. Again the gipsy laughed. "Now, my Lord," she said, "I'll not tell your fortune, because it will make te rest too one envious. As for you, my wise lady, come hither." Marian approached, and held out her hand. "Crosses in plenty, and a few joys," said the gipsy, peering into it. "And two crowns-the one a coronet, and the other a laurel wreath. A heart unsatisfied, a life wasted, and at last the repose of the tomb, before the tomb has opened for you! How does that prophecy match with er your bright dreams in the sunset, my petty or one?" ut  Before Marian could answer, the gipsy was as gone. The pic-nie party grouped themselves at around the fire once more. The fortune-telling had not been a success. Three out of their ie number weie looking very solemn in conse- e quence thereof. And there was a fourth also, "of whom they took no notice, whose heart was heavy as a human heart o uld be. The sun was sinking raPidly.  No time was e- to be lost in regaining the Pleasaunce; and re- warding their dark-skinned hosts most liberal- 1 ly for the trouble they had given, they ret out on their return. Lady Theodosia still leaned e upon her cousin's arm, but both were moody e and silent. i    While Marian fairly deserted the party, and made her way back 'alone, by by-roads, and green lanes, and meadow-paths,eknown only to herself.

Two or three years ago, a man comimitted sui- cide in London! That, you will say, is no very novel or inter- esting piece of news, since every week some un- fortunate wretch in this great city giows tire4    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6472-00000025"/> of the ills lie knows not how to conquer, and I nc with his own rash hand oplens the door into the lo fathomless abyss, which hle hopes may contain st some better and hap} ier land and life for him. " I know it, dear reader, as well as you. But in the man of whom I write was pronounced in- sc sane by the jury. who sat in judgment over the ca poor dead body, without the slightest conception a of the thinking soul and sensitive nature it had y inclosed. They said he was mad. Perhaps you Bt said the same tiin, as you read the tale before dc your study-fire. Perhaps you will say it again, er as I recall the circumstances of the case to your ai minds. It made so deep an impression on my ol own, that I shall never forget it to my'dying m day.                    al It was a steady, respectable, quiet, and, for  aught we know, God-fearing man that did the t deed. A householder, a shopkeeper, and, if I a remember rightly, a husband and a father. The evidence stated that he was a well-made and 1 good-looking, though not handsome man. But  the mental eyes with which he regarded his own  personality had received so curious a twist, that  he imagined himself to be the most repulsive e and ungainly of objects--" a ridiculous guy", v as the reporters ,hrased it. Now, call to your Y mind what associatiolns we all have with those 1 three words, "a ridiculous guy". When that i byword nas in every street-Arab's mouth, who  did not shi ink from its application? Nobody i was safe. If you hadred hair, if you wore spac- tacles, if you were blessed with freckles, if you  squinted, if you limped, it' your coat was too long or too short, your bonnet too large or too small, if you wore a hat with feathers or with- out, if you appeared in steel hoops, or in the most moderate of skirts-it did not matter. Unless you were quite perfect, that cry would ring in your ears. The most solemn army-swell,' tle tnost dainty lady of Belgravia, might hear it any day. It was not pleasant. I think every one must have been glad when it died away. For my part, I honestly confess that it terrified me more than an Indian war whoop could have done. Shut up alone in a forest hut, with half a dozen yelling savages round the door, a good rifle in my hand, and a Colt's revolver nt niy side, I tlhink I might make a shift to defend myself, if only from sheer desperation, while bars, and bolts, and casings held, and the pow- der was dry. But if I should walk down Fleet street, some fine, sunshiny morning, and lear myself saluted by that horrible phrase, I believe tlhat I should take to my heels in terror and dismay, though the weapons were but words, and the assailant a little dirty boy, whom I could half annililate with a single blow of fan or par- asol. Some persons, I know, affect'to laugh at this peculiar weakness, and to say that it never ought to exist. But 1 believe it does exist in every heart, only that very few are honest enough to   acknowledge it. No one likes to appear ridicu- lous in the eyes of other people. Now, if a street-Arab politely informns you tlihatL ou are a "guy" or a " cure"-say, close to Temple Bar- in the presence of a stream of passengers, a few score of omnibuses, and some tellnty or thirty cabs, you instantly see a smile.-in some cases a grin-pass over the countenances thlat turn your way. So long as he does not give them some stwh inforniation (it is ten chances to one it he does not within the next moment), they rather enjoy your shame and confusion; anid their amusement impresses you with so deep a sense of humiliation, that you go on your way in a most subdued frame of mind, thinking that, after all, the boy was right-that you are a "guy", and that the best thing you can do is, to hide your diminished head at home as soon as possible, and keep it there. Now, the poor man who died was continually looking at himself in this unfavorable light, Our vanity may get a hard knock now and then, but his was forever crushed. into the very dust! Some woman had admired and loved him well enough to become his wife; his children, we ,will suppose, thought their father the best, wisest, and handsomest of men; he must have had a mother in whose eyes he was always per- fection-and yet he killed himself because he could not bear the burden of what he considered an imperfect existence no longer! He was mad! Yes, we are all mad about one i thing or another! It was simply diseased van- , itv that made him wreeched! Perhaps so; but 3 what a disease to suffer from I What pangs lie - must have borne before lie made up his mind e to that rash final act! The newspapers stated r. that he faneied every customer who came into d his shop was smiling at his ugliness-that every I,' little boy in the neighborhood was pointing at ,r him as he walked the streets! And so, not dar- y ing to wea' a silver vail, like Mokanna, or an  iron mask, like the unhappy prisoner of the d Bastile, he went of his own accord into a world we where 11 things are beautiful, and where, I sin- ,lf cerelv hope, his anguish was understood and d pitied, and his impatience and despair forgiven. Marian resembled this unfortunate man in her id humble opinion of her own personal advantages, le in lhei grief at her want of beauty, in her sensi- v- tiveness to slight and ridicule, and her extreme et quickness in resenting insults-in nine eases out ar of ten before they had been given. With an ve ideal of almost impossible beauty in her mind, nrd she tortured herself forever with the thought Is, that she could never attain to it. She craved lId that beauty for her own delight as well as for ir- that of others. It would have been happiness beyond words if she could have looked in the his glass, and seen reflected there a form and face ,hlt on which she cared to gaze. As it was, she sry stood before the nirror't, see that her hair was to smooth, her collar straight, her brooch and rib-   bon accurately llaced, and then turned away with an impatient groan : "Oh, why-why am I so ugly?" She could never learn to philosophize upon this one point. 'She could not say: "Well, after all, ily eyes do to see with, and my mouth relishes a delicate dish quite as well as if it were small and rosy." She would alnmost have been content never to open that mouth for a mutton-chop again if it had taken the form of Cupid's bow; and if saying "l primer and prism" would have done the business, I think she would have sat rooted in her chair, and pronounced the magical words for the remainder of her days. I seem to be speaking strongly, but she felt more strongly still. The desire for beauty, which had always been her ruling passion, her chief torment, became a positive mania after she met Lord Mountchayne. He almost made her fairest dream of the ideal real; and what was she to him in return? A plain, awkward little country-girl, with an indifferent complexion, two great gray eyes, a wide mouth, and a snub- nose! She had overcome her feelings of dejec- tion at this thought, in a great measure; she had grown used to him; she had learned to be- lieve that, in spite of her want of loveliness, she had pleased and satisfied him; in one word, she dreamed tlat he loved her, and she knew that Love was blind i But, like most very sensitive people, she ; judged tlose around her more by small things than by great ones. The least breath of air, the mere approach of the human hand; will make the sensitive plant shrink back within itself; so,  with a peculiarly refined nature, a trifle that I would pass unnoticed by another, may shake to  their foundations its dearest and sweetest of  human ties. i A look it was that first touched Marian to the a heart, and made her cloud-built castles fade I i slowly into unsubstantial air. That one look of 1 surprise and disappointment with which L6rd r Mountchayne had regarded her humble dress oi the d othed ofhe picnic party! After ,hat instant e of pain and humiliation, no words, no prayers,  no tears of his, had he been inclined to offer  1 them, could have made her again believe that she was in the slightest degree pleasing to his eyes. As in the early part of the day, so at its close, f that one look was followed by others quite as a hard to bear-looks not at her, but at the fiair h girls who graced the feast, and shared the merry s dance upon the lawn.  Lingering looks that h dwelt admiringly (nay, even fondly, as she some- tl times thought) upon the peach-like cheeks, the a ruby lips, the rounded forms, of those with n whom lie waltzed. Marian was young, and shy and innocent. A girl's first admiration, like a tia girl's first love, has nothing impure about it. in No stir and tumult of the passions or senses he /:   ay - come to sully the brightness of that maiden- dream.  Consequently, she was at a loss, now and then, to understand the expression of the on young nobleman's fice as lie regarded the bud- ding beauties who half reclined ih his arms, and id smiled through their blushes at the close em. ell brace permitted by the giddy whirl, and sanc- tioned by fashion, custom-everything the world er holds dear.. But this much she dimly under- if stood, that if ever, by any wild stretch of in- if possibility, she should become his wife, loving ie him as she did, and he should glance at a d stranger-at any woman except herself-in that Is manner, she should die of shame and grief at his feet.' It  The next instant, she smiled scornfully at her- r, self, and at the pure instinct of dawning woman- r hood that prompted the thought. It was mad- e ness, indeed, to think that he would ever stoop r to raise her to his own high estate; but if, by s any chance, lie did so, how long could she hope e to hold him true?  Her jealous memory re- , called the truth that, though he had often sought - her out in her chosen retreats-thoulgh he liked -to tallk with or read to her-though lie often e pictured a useful and famous future for himself, - which, he more than hinted, was to be her work e and her reward-yet he had never, by any chance, sat and studied her face as he was study- t ing the faces of these comparative strangers; he listened to, but he did not look at her! It was a mortifying but salutary reflection. If the single young lady-fiiend haL no power to capti- vate or charm him,'what could the wife do  Would the face and form'that pleased him so little in the one instance, derive new graces and ; beauty from the glittering coronet, and the splen- , did robes of a peeress? Or, as when they walk- ed together now, would his ear be given to her, and his eyes to every female figure that passed; a pretty milkmaid, a farmer's' daughter, a lady in her own carriage, or a country belle in hat and riding-habit, going across-country at the rate of fourteen miles an hour. Her own good sense answered the question so effectually, that if, after that picnic party, Lord Mountchayne had laid his heart, his hand, and his coronet at her feet, he would have been re- jected. She suffered horribly, for she still loved. But the awakening had come  and not for the wealth of the Indies would she have accepted a future which must be forever clouded by doubt, and jealousy, and despair. She would think of him no more! In time, perhaps, she might find some good, kind. quiet heart tlhat would value her for herself rather than for her outward form- that would be faithful to her in thought, word, and deed forever; and with so mucoh of happi. ness, she felt she could be content. It was a very wise and praiseworthy resolu- tion. But, unfortunaeely, the power to put it into practice at once did not rest entirely with her. The her    urchin, named Love, hav.    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6472-00000026"/> ing once effected an entrance into any human t heart, is by no means in a hurry to leave his a comfortable quarters.            I So Marian fouid to her cost. She tried hon- t estly to forget; but what had passed would not t be forgotten. All day long that face was before- . her eyes-that voice sounding in her ear. It I did not mend matters that many a real torment was added to those of the imagination. Lord t Mountchayne was still in the house. She could I not help meeting him at lunch and dinner, how- t ever successfully she might avoid him for the I rest of the day ; and the changes in her expres- sive face, when he was near, would have be- tfrayed her secret to the most indifferent specta- o tors.  Lady Theodosii, being by no means blind to anything which threatened the safety of her future coronet, was not long in finding it out. She rallied Lord Mountchayne upon it, and he retorted suokily. She told Miss Moyell, and Marian soon found that her every look and movement was being watched. Lastly, Lady Theodosia enlightened the Earl and the Count- ess, thereby causing the wig of the one and the false curls of the other to quiver with anger and horror. If she had had her own way, she  would have informed every menial on the I establishment, down to the stable-boy, in order that Marian might be more severely punished for her unheard of presumption. But the good sense of Leonora prevented this. Much as she hated Marian, she remembered that she was a Moyell, and that the disgrace heaped upon her would, after all, recoil again upon the family name. So she prevailed upon the young peor- esss to hear reason, and to summon Lord Mount- chayne to a sort of domestic "'Star Chamber", where his crime and its consequences might be duly set in order before him, and where mea- sures might be taken to bring him to his sensBs, if he had any left. To this measure Lady Theodosia consented. Lord Mountchayne obeyed his mother's sum- mons iitdh a sort of shamefaced alacrity, that of itself sealed poor Marian's doom, before q word had been uttered on either side. To tell the truth, he had begun to weary of her. While she was free, she had been daring, original, and piquant; and the oddity of her manners and her conversation had interested him, in spite of her want of beauty. But now that she was caught and tamed-now that her wings were folded, and her haughty spirit subdued-she had lost her power over him. 'lie stood in a measure committed to her by the course he had pursued, and he was ready to do anything in order to get out of the scrape as cleverly and honorably as might be. Hle had said that she was very dear to. him, it is true-had said it a hundred times or more. But what of that? lie had not asked her to marry him, thank good- ness! As for putting the.,e hones coronet upon   the head of a woman 'so odd and so ugly, he shuddered at the thought! Lady Theodosia was not beautiful-but she was polished to the last degree, and rich as a City lheiress in,o the bargain. She had fashion, consequence, wealth, and a noble name to give!  Poor Marian had nothing but herself-and her love! Marian, in her garden-seat, waited the result of that important interview wi Ih a beating heart. More than a week had passed ,since the day of the pic-nio party, and in all that time Lord Mountchayne and she had se-irculy exchanged a dozen words. She had seen and understood his embarrassment-the whispered sneers and the crael looks of the women-the hesitating cold- ness of the stately Earl. Sace knew well tliat her fate was being decided by that solemn con- clave; she knew, too, what it must be-what it ought to be. Yet, when she saw Lord Mountchayne coming toward her from the house, she lacked the cour- age to stay and hear him. It was cruel-it was merciless-she could not bear it! She started up, and ran to her only place of refuge-the deserted loft! He followed her there. Pale, and breathless, she flung herself into the easy-chair, and turning upon him, ask- I ed, brusquely, what he wanted. -- He stood looking at her with an amused smile. ' "And so," he said, in the softest of voices; "so you are very angry with me I' Marian colored vividly. She was jealous, vexed, irritated, pained, and hurt, at one and the same moment, and he could find nothing better to do than to stand there and laugh at her. "Whether I am angry or not, caamatter very little to you, my lord," she saiadturning to leave the loft. But he placed himself between h.4and the door instantly. "Why can't it?" he asked, with a roguish look. f  "I can give you only one reason-my old reason as a child-because-" "A most lucid, satisfactory one, certainly." "All you will get," she answeored, mildly, in Iher turn. Some lingering trace of feeling still remained f his heart. }  He seized her hand. 3 You impertinent, fascinating, bewildering 3 little thing-what do you mean by your con- \ duct?-what have you meant by it ever since 1 that confounded pic-nic party?" I  "Release my hand, my lord, and I will tell 1 you," she said, sternly. "Oh, very well 1" HHe dropped it sulkily. e  "It means that you and I are no more to each - otherl in future than strangers." a  "Am I permitted to ask why?"   "ecause it, is 'best and right--mos-t proper, and most satisfactory to me, as it ought to be to you." "The devil it is!" 'Marian looked at him, and turned away with a quiet air of dignity "I beg your pardon-don't go-I didn't mean to swear, and 1 would not offend you fur the world," he said, hurriedly. "But my mother has been at me all the morning ; and, to tell the truth, my temper is none of the sweetest just at this present moment." "Did Lady Revere speak to you about me?" asked Marian, looking at him steadily "That she did-with a vengeance   It was Lady Theodosia who set her on." "I am much obligedt to her ladyship." "And your cousin Leonora-" "Did she say anything?" "You may well ask. I wih you could have heard the hash of scandal"I'had served up through my mother's lips from her!" Marian's face grew dark. "Scandal--about me!" "Well, not exactly that. But about your par- 'C ts--" "Oh, stop!" she said, with a burning blush; "you need not tell me. 1 know all that she caL. Say." "How bitter she is against you!" "Is she? Not more bi ttr than I am against her! I ,I hate Leonora-I have always hated her since I was a child!" "So shesaid. But let th it pass. I want to talk to you very seriously, Marian." "Go on," she said, setting her lips firmly to- gether. "My mother says some one ought to do so. Now, if she is right, I prefer to undertake the task myself. I know what women are to each other, and the taste I had of their tongues this morning made me anxious to spare you from such a-dose." He stopped short, and seemed scarcely to know what to say next. Marian sat -watching him quietly. Her instinct told h'er what was coming, but she could not utter a word to help 'him out of his dilemma. While her own heart was undergoing a slow torture, why should she give herself the trouble to spare him one, little stinging pang? She rejoiced that he coild ;eel it, and for her. "You won't be angry, Marian?" be began. "I?  Oil no!  What should make me angry?" she answered, with a serene smile. "What I have to say, it may be." "Ofit with it. Let us hear what it is." "My mother thinks that I have been wrong," he went on, with a vivid blush. "I have sought you out far oftener than any one else in the house. I have walked and talked with you; I have sat here for hours by your side, reading the books we love so well.'?   " on't!" slhe stid, with an impatient stn mp of the foot. "I know all you have said and done far better than any one else. There is no need to go back over every hour since we first met. Go on with your lesson!" ' "My task, you had better call it, Marian; for it is one-the hardest and most painful task I ever had to perform in my whole life!" "Yes," she answered, but her lip curled and her eye lashed as she spoke. "The fact is, the intercourse which has been so pleasant, and which I thought so secret, has been discovered. My father, my mother, Lady Theodosia, Miss Moyell, all know that we have nmet privately-that we have met here." "Well?" "I will not repeat their vile insinuations to you-for they were vile!" "You need not; I can understand them. Go on!" "I have no right to compromise you in any way!" "Certainly not!" "In cases like this there is generally one way open by which a man may atone to a lady for his impudence. That way is not open to me, Marian." "I don't quite understand." "He may marry her!" "' Yes." "And I cannot marry you!" She blushed, and hung her head. "You know why, Marian!" "Can I help my birth?"       a. "It is not that alone!" She looked up at him; she would not spare him one drop of the cup of humiliation that' was at his lips.        ' "I am not free to marry!" he said, in a low voice "I ought to have owned it when you asked me the other day." "Indeed!" was her cold reply. "I have wooed and won no lady openly for my bride?" "Not openly-no!" said Marian; and the samrcastic speech made him wince as if she had struck hini. "Never, in any way, till I met you," he said, earinestly. "I have been called too cold-too indifferent. -It was partly because I felt myself bound all the while. If I have said anything- nay, I know that I have said many things that might have led you to think otherwise-forget and forgive it, will you, Marian?" "Give me your reason for saying this to me!" she demanded. "i must marry Lady Theodosia!" exclaimed Lord Mountchayne. "Are-you engaged to her?" "Tacitly-if not in actual words" - "Since when?" "Since my birth." "And you knew this when you first met me'?" r    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6472-00000027"/> "Yes," he said, turning crimson, as he spoke; "thut ou will forgive me?" "Caln you doubt it?" "And Le myv friend still?" "Your best and dearest, of coerse!" "WTlat a noble creature yod are!" he ex- claimed, rapturously. -"I tell you candidly that I detest my cousin. But 1 am poor, and Go is my father; and I am in debt, and she has a fortu/ne. You see it now?" -"Yes." said Marian, quietly. "And how much does she pay for you?' "What?" "What is the price at which you are to be sold?" asked Marian. "You are laughing at me!" "On thie contrary. I admire your good sense. A peer of thie realm out to fetch a good price. And, after all, it is better than to mort- gage the Priory, or pawn the family-plate, or my lady's diamonds. Don't you agree with ille?" "Do you think T will stay here, Madam. to be sneered at by you?" ejaculated Lord Mount- cliayne, furiously. "Go or stay, as you like ; 'tis a matter of the most pertect indiffereilce to me!" she answer- ed; and began to hum an opera tune. A moment's reflection showed Lord Mount- chayne that he was making himself lidiculous, and that any display of rage or mortification on his part would only serve to delight Mar in, and comlpensate to her, in a measure, for the humiliation she herself had undergone. So, with a great effort, he controlled his temper, and said, with a sad smile : "You are right; and you have the privilegs of laughing at me-rif you will." "I feel much more like crying for you, my Lord," she said, with a serious air. "I believ- ed you to be the noblest creature on earth ; and, oh, ' Lucifer-star of the morning!' how art thou fallen!" He fLung his head for an instant before her. It showed some native nobleness of mind, after all, that he could feel her scornful rebuke so keenly. "What am I to do!" he said, 'hesitatingly. ' I am over head and ears in debt-and my mother almost begs me on her knees to marry Lady Theodosia. I am sure if-" "' If' is a coward's word," said Marian, quiet- ly. "You do'well to use it." The indignant color rushed to the face of Lord Mountchayne. "You call me a coward?" "I do." "Well-you are a woman, and 1 must bear it," he eried. "For my own sake and for yours, 1 wish I was a man!" she saidl, almost savagely. "I -wish I were a man, and you had treated a young -..ister of mine as you have treated me! For in   that case, my Lord, only one of us two would ever go out of this place alive i" "Good heavens, Marian!" lie cried, starting back, half frightened at her white face and an- gry dashing eyes. Oh, you thought I did not feel, because I did not faint or shed tears! Rrst easy, for you have stung me to the heart! I loved you with rmy whole soul; and though I despise you now, I love you still! I shall never loxe any human being-never have faith in anything that lives Ion earth-again!  This is your work-your amusement: I hope you like it! Now go and marry Lady Theod,'sia as soon as soon as you }please. BuL remember this: the feeling that still lives at my heart bodes no good to you and yours  It would be better if' a hundred women hbaed you, than that Marian Moyell should curse you with her love!" As she, spoke, she caught his hand in both hers, gave it one' last, wild, debpairing kiss, and rushed from the place before lie h hd time to utter a single word in his own defence. CHAPTER   XX. GETTING   OVER  IT. "Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star! Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far, That show'at the darkness thou canst not dispel, iHow like art thou to joy remember'd well! So gleams the past, the light of other days, Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays: A night beam sorrow watcheth to behold, Distinct, but distant-clear-but oh, how cold!" --BYRoN. And so all was over! The dream had been dreamed -the play was at an end-and Marian i had only to become sensible again as soon as possible. It was not an easy task. It-is never an easy task for any one to perforim. When madness ihas made itself into a secret and familiar habit, one hates to grow sane! And before you can 'find yourself clothed and in your right mind, there are certain things to go through which cannot possibly be escaped. Marian experienced them all. Day after day i she counted her pangs-night after night she shed her tears! 'Her idol had been dashed down from its high place, and proved to be but a false god, after all! But what of that? She saw Lord Mountehayne as he really was, at last -a handsome, idle coxcomb, who had nothing better to do, and so' won her heart by way uC pastime, simply that the hours of his visit might not hang heavy on his hands. But the heart was no less won. And she kept the vigils, which only souls like her can keep- she wept-she groveled upon the rough floor of her retreat. She gnashed her teeth, and beat :her breast, and prayed to die! Any one look- ing in upon her by chance, during such a -par- oxysm of useless grief and rage, would have been justified in sending for a strait waist- coat and keeper, as the remedies best suited to   her disease. Later on in life she, herself, learned to laugh at the memory of all this wasted enrgy and fire. But she was a better and a happier woman when she crouched upon that dusty floor, and sobbed out her agony to the unheeding summer morn, than when she sat comfortably over her writing-desk, and analyzed thie tortuous workings of her nature during that period of storm and shipwreck, in order that her world of readers might laugh with her at what she saw. Different natures come out so differentlyfrom the fiery furnace of this one universal trial: Some are purified and chastened only by the flames; some are made hard and reckless for a time, but gp back to their own better selves once more, when the paroxysm has passed by; others--unhappily for themselves, and for all with whom they have afterward to deal-can never forget; und, in consequence of this ina- bility, they grow into cold, callous mockers of everything that is good and true, and sometimes work such mischief on earth, that it would have been better for them and for their victims if they had never been born. Marian belonged to this latter class. The wrong that been done her was remembered light- ly enough by Lord Mountchayne. What was it, after all? He had said a few kind words, made a few tender speeches, to a lonely girl, which she had chosen to tklie in serious earnest; and here she was making a greaf piece of work about it, and bidding him fanrewell in a mock- tragedy speech, that would have been better suited to the boards of a transpontine theatre than that dusty, little room. This was thie grieat mistake he made. Marian was not like the other women. Blind, helpless, and despairing, she bowed to tie decree of fate, and submitted to the sorrow which she could not avert. But with no meek resignation-- no gentle thought that it was but a part of the earthly discipline which was to fit' her in time for her heavenly home. She felt crushed, hu- miliated, and lowered, even in her own eyes. She was a fool, an idiot, and only fit to be laughed at by the man who had betrayed her forhaving been simple enough to listen to and believe him Ncver mind! In future she would be wiser--in future she wculd trust and believe in no one! No more tender human kindness or sympathy for or from hcr I Her hand, like Ishinael'e, should be against every man, since one 'man's hand had been against her! Love, faith, and hope died out for ever from her heart; and cold, and cruel, and self-contained, she turned her face to the battle-field of life once more! Well might she say, with the poet, whose words were so often on her lips: "'Within my breast there is no light, Save the cold light of stai s! I give the first watch of the night To the red plauet, LIars!"   'since, in future, MAars, and not Vdnus, was to be her guiding star I There was, however, one consolation in her misery, and that to a woman so proud, w:as a great one. She endured it all alone. There was no prying eye to mark her desperation ; no soft, insinuating voice to whisper some word of apparent consolation, which should stab her more deeply than the sharp stroke of a dagger's point! The lovely daughters of Fashion, un- dergoing the same trial, have it made doubly bitter by the life they lead. They are "in so- ciety", and society does not recognize such vul- gar things as broken hearts and disappointed affections. So the poor wretches live to hide their sufferings as best they may, and go through their daily, exercise on the treadmill, riding, walking, driving, eating, and dancing at the ap- pointed hours, under the stony glare of a hun- dred curious eyes-the eyes of people to whom their agony would be subject for a clever bon mot or a sprightly anecdote, and nothing more. Thib suffeiing was spared Marian. Miss Moy- ell and Lady Theodosia, having gained their point, were kind enough to molest her no more; and she might shut herself up to cry till her eyes were as red as ferrets, if she liked-no one noticed, no one wondered-in fine, no one cared I CHAPTER -XXI. "The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed Denotes how soft that chinr which bears his touch: Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest, Bid man be valiant ere he merit such : Her glance how wildly beautiful! how much Hath Pioebus wooed in vain to spoil ier cheek, Which glows yet smoother from hisi amu'roos clutch! Who round the North for paler dames would beek? How poor their forms appear! how lannguid, wan, and weak!"           -Br aos. The summer days passed slowly by. It makes no difference whether, in our mad impatience, we long to compress years into months-or whether, in our happiness, we desire to turn days into years-the course of God's great cre- ation marches on, regardless of our petty joys and woes. The nmighty Mother Earth has much regard for her children ; 'if they d"g for a for- tune, or plant a viole, t root, or Hollow out a- grave within her bosom, it is all the same to her. In her first agony, Marian was for having the whole world stand still, that it might see her grief She grew wiser in a few days, and ao- knowleged that trees and flowers might grow, and sum', and moon, and stars might shine, though she, wretched woman that she was, lay crushed and sorrowing the while. And so May gave place to June, and June to July, and she was calm again. Tihe Priory was finished, the Pleasaunce guests were gone, and Miss Moyell and her sis- ters were invited in their turn to become the    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6472-00000028"/> visitors of their noble friends. Marian was quite alone at the Pleasaunce, the nominal mis- tress of the house and owner of the grounds. She liked her solitude well. It was delicious, after all the pain, the hurry, the bustle, and tu- mult of the last few weeks, to feel that she was responsible to no one for her actions, or looks, or thoughts. She might get up, and go to bied, and have her meals as she liked ; she might re- sume her long walks unattended by a -solemn ,footman; she might linger for hiours in the mossy' old garden-upon the 'wide common- within the silent woods. Mrs. Pryor alone crossed her palh, and she was always tender and kind. But if she knew through what a sea of trouble tie young girl had p:assed, she made no sign. She was watchful for her comfort-con. siderate and thoughtful in every action of the day-and that was-all. For the first time in her life, Marian was thor- oughly idle. All the superabundant life and energy which gonerally kept her busy from morning till nighlt was gone. She did not fall ill-she was not particularly weakl; but she said herself that she was most undeniably lazy, and that it was almost a pain to stir. All she wished to do was, to lounge about in the sunshine, sometimes with a novel in her hand, and doze and dream the hours away. The first sharp cting of sorrow was over: she felt a pleasant torpor creeping over her, and was con- tent. The world beyond the Pleasaunco gates seemed cold and harsh; she had not the slight- est desire to penetrate its myvstories. And life --what was that but a weary, never-ending bat- tle? And men and women-what were they but a set of beings as selfish and idle as her- self, with whom she wished to have nothing more to do? If she could but go on-living alone, with Mrs. Pryor ready to give her some- thing to eat if sho asked for it-with the old loft for a retreat, and a pleasant book for a com- panion, and no tastes, no ties, no duties, how beautiful it would be I The dream of the mild- eyed, melancholy lotos eaters was fast becom- ing hers. "Hateful is the dark blue sky, Vaulted o'er the dark blue sea, Death ii the end of life; ah, why Sihould life all labor be?' Let us alone!" "Let what is broken, so remain; The gods are hard to reconcile, 'Tis hard to bettle order once again, There is coufusion worse than death, Trouble on trouble, pain on pain, Long labor unto uged breath. Sore ta-ks4, tc hearts wot u out by many wars, And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot stars." She sat in the Pleas:uiiece garden one after- noon, on the very seat where she ha I once awaited Lord Mouiitchayno and her doom. A book was in, her hand, Lut she was not reauing. Her eyes had wandered far away to the distant horizon, and bhe was lost in a reverie, when an   approaching footstep made her stnAf, an. I l ok up. A young and beautiful woman, witlh lite brown face and flashing dark eyes of a gip-'!, stood before her. But thoutgh the girl's face told tales of the race from which she sprung, her dress was like that of a lady. She wore a dark-blue silk trimmed with many flowers, a silver-gray mantle, and a bonnet, gloves, and parasol of the same delicate hue. ihe looked browner-than ever, from the contrast with these delicate colors, and yet in some strange way they suited .her. Marian sat gazing at her in silent wonder. Who could she be, and what could she want with her? "I think you have made some mistake," she said, kindly. "Do you know what this place is --whose is it?" "The Pleasaunce, is it not?" replied the visitor, in a sweet, full voice. "Yes." "Owned by Miss Moyell?P" "Yes."' "Arid you are Miss Mariafi?" "I am." "I thought I was right. I thought I could not be mistaken, thoughi I have never seen you before," replied the strange visitor. "Did you wish to speak to me?" interrogated Miss Marian. "I was sent for you," said the girl,'quietly. "By whom?" asked Marian, looking at her with surprise. "I am not to tell." ' But you cannot expect me to go with you!" exclaimed Miss Marian. "Yes, you were to come." "What nonsense, my good girl  Why do you make such a profound mystery about noth- ing! Are you a gipsy?" The girl hesitated. "Hyes-I belong to the camp down there," and she pointed in the direction of Downe Re- serve. "Is it any one there who has sent for me?" eagerly asked Marian. "Yes." "Any one who is ill?" "No. It is some one 'who has something very important to tell you. The gipsy woman who told yuur fortune when your party took refuger in our camp. So much I may tell you." "Am I to go with you? ' "If you please." "And wheie?" "Near the camp-to Downe Reserve, in fact," said the girl, confidently. Marian thought for a momient. She was bold and adventurous enough to like the expedition for its own sake, and perhaps she was to hear something which would amply repay her for' any tiouble she might take. As for any harm that could be intended, she never gave that a   thought. She knew that she had no enemies- she was too poor and inisignifica,t for that. So she rose from bcer seat, put on' her hat, and told the messenger that she would accompany her. With a slight bow of acknowledgment, the gipsy led the way toward the haunted house. When they arrived at the green lane, above the Wishing Well, she stopped short and whistled three times. A whistle behind the trees an- swered her, and in another moment the tall, peculiar-looking gipsy who had told the for- tunes, appeared, and greeted them both with a careless nod. "You can go home, Clara," she said, turning to the girl, and waving her hand. But Clara lingered, and looked distrustfully at Marian. . "Shall you be long away from the camp?" she asked. Tile gipsy woman stamped her foot and fown- ed slightly. "Why do you plague me with questions which I cannot answer?" she said, angrily. "Go, and I will come as soon as possible!" With a low sigh, and another strange glance at Marian, the girl went slowly away. The gipsy woman waited till she was quite out of sight. "Little fool!" she muttered ; and then, turn- ing to Miss Marian, she looked at her sharply from head to foot. "Have you forgotten what I said to you some weeks ago?" ehe asked, abruptly. "No," replied Marian. "Did you believe in the truth of my predic- tion?" '"Perhaps not then; but I do now." "Ha, ha!" laughed the gipsy woman. "Is, it coming true?" 'i That is my business, not yours l" "To be sure, my dainty lady!" ' Why did you send for me to-day?" "Ah, why, indeed!" said the woman, with a strange glance. "Were you afraid to come?" Marian shook her head. "You have a bold spirit I Good I you will need it before you get through the world, I can i safely pyomise you!" "Well, never mind that I Tell me what you want of me?"  "Not your watch and chain, not your purse, not your car-rings, but your ears!" "'What do ,you mean?" "I want to ask you some questions first, and i to tell you a story afterward."      I "As a reward? Well, go on; and if Ichoose  to answer your questions, I will-if not, I shalli be silent," said Marian.          I "Well, then', to begin with-are you hap- py,' "  "  Do I look otherwise?" "Yes; your face is paler and thinner than'-j   - I when I saw you last; and your eyes tell a sto ry o of a hard battle fought, and a great victory ] won." "You are telling fortunes again." "On the contrary. It is you who are telling mine now." Marian looked puzzled. "Who and what are you?" she asked. "No I gipsy-I am sure of that." "now so?" "Your language-your voice-your manner, assure me of it." - "Well, what then?" !"I should very much like to lift the vail," exclaimed Marian. "You haill presently, never fear. But now to go on with my catcheism. Are you as happy now as you were three months ago?" "No P' "Because, like all of Eve's daughters, yo- could not rest easy till you had tasted of the fruit of the tree of knowledge." I "Exactly. And a precious bitter fruit it proved! My teeth are all on edge still!" "Never mind, better luck next time; and a man who knows his own mind more fully than you could expect that pink,and white Lord I Mountchayne to do!" said thegipsy. Marian started and turned crimson. "What do you know of him?" "Everything! lie is a scented puppy, not fit to tie up your shoestrings I I could almost wonder at your folly, only I know that women are quite as much the slaves of their eves as men, if they were honest enough to say so! And he is handsome-even I can see that! You might seek many days before you could find a more perfect form or more beautiful face!" "Too true!" said Marian, with a sigh. The gipsy laughed. " Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain!" she said ; "at least, we are taught so in infancy; and it is only when we get into our teens that we discover our mistake. Beauty vain, icdeed! Give me, like Archimedes, a support for the lever, and with it I would not only move, but overturn the world, and all the people in it!" Again Marian sighed.   / "I Isuppose you would like to be beautiful!" said the gipsy. "Yes." "Well, you are not, and you never will be; but you are clever, and, if you like, you can do almost as much in the world with your talents, as you could with a pretty face I Mind, I say almost-for when the pretty face comes along, it is ten chances to one if you and your clever- ness don't go to the wait." "Is that all you have to say?" asked Marian. "Not quite. It will be well worth your while to atop and listen; and by and by I have such    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6472-00000029"/> a pret(y sight to show you-a pair of turtle- doves just fledged, and just discovered by me." "Bll! I1 don't care lfr turtle-doves!" "You will admire tlese, 1 think. And now tell me how Lord Mountchayne is amusing him- self during these long, bright sumuer days!" "I neither know nor care." "You do not visit the Priory?!' "No. I!" "Yet your cousins are there!" "That may be!" "You know that he is to be married?" "Well!" "Very soon- too!" W hat do I care?" "Lady Theodosia is in town, and the lawyers are as busy as bees with the settlements." "I can't lcelp it!" "Settlements ,which will be all in vain, I fear." Marian forget herself, and looked up with eager interest. "What do you mean?" . "Did you ever hear the old song- "' Sigh no more, ladies-sigh no more, Men were-deceivers ever; One foot on sea, and one ou shore, To one thing constant never?" "Of course." "You ought to go singing it to Lady Theo- dosia, and give her a hint of what is going on. Poor thing!" "But lhat is going on?" "Give me your hand. You won't? Then follow- me over this wall; and I will soon show you I 1 am going to take you to the nest of the turtle-doves I was describing just now." Without iny hesitation, Marian followed her over the wall, and down the hill, beneath a line of poplar trees. By and by she halted, parted the branches, and said, simply, ' Look there!" Marian obeyed. Beneath them lay Downe Reserve, and beside the Wishing Well stood two figures, hand in hand. Ono was Lord Mountchlayne; the other -ah! it needed not the deep mourning dress and her golden curls to betray the young May Queen to Mrrian's jealous eyes. "Rose Martin!" she exclaimed. "Oh, I never dreamed of this!" "Nor of this!" said the gipsy touching her on the arm. She turned. It was no longer a woman ; it was a tall and handsome man, of about thirty years of age, who stood beside her. "You were right in your guess you see," he said, with a slight smile. "I am no gipsy, but I am Philip Vere!"   CHAPTER XXII. ON THE CA RDS. "DIncan Gray cam' here to woo, Ha, iha, the wooing o't I One blithe yule-night when we were fol, Ha, ha, the wdoing o't, Maggie coost her head fu' lieigh, Look'd askaut and unco skeigh, Gart poor Duncan stand abeigh; Ha, ha, the wooing 't!

Duncan sigil'd bait hut and in, Grat his een bajbleer't and blin', Spak -'lowluo o'er a linn ; /    -*t tau, the wooing o't!" -BunNs. The silence that ensued upon this startling discovery and communication was broken by Philip Vere, as he rolled his gipsy's dress into a neat bundle, laughing the while at Marian's unmistakable dismay. "You look at me as if I was own cousin to the gorilla," lie lemarked. "Now, I know that I am a very liandsome man; but still, all things considered, I don't see why you should stare o!" "It is enough to make any one stare," replied Marian, dryly. "Ha, ha! do you Wnan to say that you never guessed my identity till I threw these rags off?" "how should I?" "It was as good, nay, it was far better than any play, to see you all that night at the camp! In the first place, there were you, looking over the stile in the most romantic of attitudes, dreaming of the handsome idiot yonder, who is jist now so agreeably employed in making fierce love to Miss Rose Martin." Marian moved impatiently as he spoke- glanced once more at the offending pair, and turned away. "You don't care to stay longer. 'You have not a heart so unselfish that you can enjoy the sight of a primitive aud innocent attachment (oh, no I how innocent it is-quite in the bread- and-butter style) like that!" "Don't torture and laugh at me any longer," she exclaimed fiercely. "If you lha e anything to say-say it, and let me go!" "Oh, I have plenty to say to you, all in my own good tiln. Do you think I should have taken the trouble to masquerade about in these confounded petticoats so long, if Ihad no object in view at the end of the farce?" "Well, what is the object?"' "Patience, my de, rl Patience is a very good root indeed, and you should learn to cul- tivate it. Patience and perseverance! they are the two great watchwords of success. Only wait long enough, and work hard enough, and you will always gain your end-whether it be bore a hole through the earth, or to revenge   yourself on a rival-say, like that pretty lady I at the well."  "I am neither patient nor persevering," said Marian, coloring high beneath. his searching glance. "And the lady at the well is no rival of mine, as you seem to think; for I have no claim, not the slightest, on that gentleman. Now will you come away '" "With the greatest pleasure," he said cour- teously. "I only live to oblige the ladies, Miss Marian, and your word is law. I have to carry these rags back to the camp, and the lanes that way are green and quiet: do you mind walking with me there?" "No." She turned as she spoke, and ascended the hill so swiftly, that he could hardly keep pace with her rapid steps. And yet the physical ex- ertion could not do away with the mental pang. She saw each instant before her, the tableau at the Wishing Well; and however far away her steps might stray, her heart and soul remained behind. "You walk fast, but black Care follows," said Mr. Vere, when they reached the lanes. "Are you sorry that you went? The old proverb says, you know, that 'what the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve for'. What do you think of that doctrine?" "I would ratlicr see and suffer," said Marian, pausing beneath a great elm tree, "than to remain in that ignorance which I do not con- sider bliss. And now, as I don't care-to visit the camp to-day, will you tell me what you want with me?" "What 1 want with you? Why, I want a number of things." "Well, name them." "Marian Moyell, to begin with." Marian stared, and he gave a delighted shuckle. "You don't understand me! No more did sny of the gay party who, like half-drowned rats, sought shelter over yonder some weeks ago. IIow comical they all did look, to be sure l You were the most respectable to the outward eye, of the whole lot just then." "Pray, is that nil oun have to say?" "I think I puzzled them all pretty nicely," he went on, without heeding ellr. "I gave that affected little Lady Theodosia a dose for her vanity which she will not forget in a hurry; and as for Miss Moyell-O Lord, now! just to think of ]iss Moyell!" , He laulghed tiil tie tears ran down his cheeks; and Mariau remembered her cousin's agitation and refusal to listen to him. 4'Do you think she recognized you?" she asked. "No; she was like you: 6he did not think of hers truly being disguised like an old woman, for the sake of giving her dear little nerves a start! It was the voice that puzzled her; and   I I knew by her look th at she had not forgotten it. Do you know that woman loved me once as well as she was capable of loving anytling?" "I know she did," said Marian, dreamily, thinking of the strange scene which she hIid witnessed in the Pleasaunce garden that very spring. "Know it! Why, all London knew it!" re- plied Mr. Vere, with a smile.  "She was haughty enough at first, but, by George! I brought her down into the dust to pay for it! I think I can see her now as she looked when we parted for the last time. It made amends for all I had suffered at first, to see her crying over a rose I had held five minutes in my hand, and kissing it when she dared not kiss me, because I was behaving so like a brute to her! Confound her and her roses, too! It did me a little good to see that; but I have not done with her yet! No, my Lady Leonora, I'll serve you another trick yet before I die, or my name is not Philip Vere!" He looked so wicked, so malicious, so unutter- ably cruel as lie spoke, that Marian felt some sentiment of pity stirring at her heart for her cousin Leonora. "Can't you let the poor thing alone?" she asked. "'1 am sure she has suffered enough to satisfy even you." ": Has she?" he said, setting his teeth with a vicious smile. "' That is the slight mistake you make, my dear. She has not felt one tittle of what I wish her to feel-of what she shall feel, if I have my way. By Heaven! when i think of all she cost me, I wonder sometimes that I. don't kill her outright!" "It was years ago," said Marian. "Why can't you forget and forgive it now?" "Ah, you know little of me if you ask me- that question! When a person injures me, l never forget! Take care you don't make me- your enemy, my lady! You had better have a. wild wolf on your track!" Marian's lip curled. "I do not fear you, nor am I very likely to' make an enemy of you, since after to-day we shall never meetnagain!" "Indeed!" be answered, with an amiable, smile. "Who told you that?" L  "Why should we meet?" r  "True! Why should anyone meet? Be- * cause, my dear--because we are fated to be \ more to each other, for good or for evil, than. you dream of at this present moment!" "Oh!" said Marian, shrugging her shoulders, u "you are a fatalist, it seems." ' I am! What else, may I asls can any man e or woman of sense be, in a world so topsy-tur- vy as this?" ,f  "Your doctrine, I should say, would make it I a still more perplexing place to live in." a   Not at all-quite the contrary. If I get up d in the morning with a settled purpose of 7doing,    <pb n="56 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000030"/> one thing, and every event and circumstance of the day goes directly against the accomplish- ment of that purpose, so that at nightfall it is not accomplished, I naturally feel irritated and annoyed, and blame myself and every one around me for the failure. If I begin my life in the same way, with a purpose and an end set steadily in view, and make a mess of it, the same sensation hangs round me for ever, and hunts me fairly into my grave. I am misera- ble, uneasy, restless, and dissatisfied all my life, feeling sure that if I had done this, that, or the other thing, all might have been well. And so, till death comes, and seems to me as great a mistake than all the rest. Can you conceive of the torment of such an existence?" "Easily," said Marian, with a deep sigh; "sinice I am living it myself." "I wish you joy of it," said Mr. Vere, with a slight grinlace. "But you will grow wiser, let us hope. .I was once like you-I had the high- est hopes, the brightest dreams, the purest aims; and look at me now. A broken-down, degraded, miserable wretch-a gambler, a drunkard, a libertine, and a cheat! You look surprised at my frankness. Perhaps I should not be so candid with every one. But there is the truth for you, Marian. The life that was so rich in promise has only ended here. I don't weep, or wail, or sigh over it. Why not? Be- cause what cannot be helped, must be endured. I have tried to be good, and you see the result. Sc( I philosophize over the pitiable spectacle I present to the eyes of God and men; shrug my shoulders over my own frailty and that of my neighbors, and let it go." , The half-careless earnestness of his manner had a strange effect upon Marian. She herself, ,conscious of many an imperfection, mourning -over many a fall, was struggling blindlly over a rough and thorny path toward a light thht seemed to shine hopefully and cheeringly far, far away. Now, here was a wayworn and weary traveler, whose steps had faltered on the self- -same road, and who looked back to smile at her folly, and to tell her that the light was but an ignis fatuus, leading to nothing-shining from i no serene height of peace and happiness where i she could rest, and be at war noemore. Yet i something in her heart whispered that he must c be in the wrong. She said, thoughtfully:  "  You say you have tried to be good. Iow i hard did you try, and how long?"  Mr. Vere gave a low whistle.       r "Well, that is good! Just about the last i speech on earth that I should have expected to I hear from your lips. pon't go to mistaking your vocatioan, my dear. You were made to be t preached to, it may be, but never to preach I  How hard and how long did I try?

You will remind me of my two watch- le words, patience and perseverance, now. I Fe thought of them myself many a time, but some- et Now they did not seem applicable. I had an e odd sort of feeling that piety was not to bo d worked for, like some earthly good or gain; L- and that prayer should be a' spontaneous out- , burst from the full heart, rather than a pains- r taling utterance of the lips. But why am I i talking to you like this? One would think we t we:e in a chapel, giving our religious experi- e ences for each other's benefit." "Oh, go on!" said Marian, earnestly. "1 I too ; have often felt and thought these things, and I want to know what you did?" "I went to the deuce, my dear!" was his cheerful reply. "It was not in me to be a saint, and I could not effect it. "I'm bad enough, I know; but I'll be shot if I could ever be a hypocrite in things like that. Besides, if all is true, where is the use of such deceit? It may blind a poor worm or two here below, but it is of no avail up there!"-and he glanced, with a Ihalf-reverent look, toward the placid sky. "No!" said Marian, sighing. "And so you turned a fatalist?" "Say rather I was turned into one, for I had nothing to do with the, change, it came of itself. They preached to me, and prayed with, and at me enough, Heaven knows, but it made no i-n- pression on my mind. I was iv:capable oF un- derstanding them. Could I hell that? I felt blind in a world that was full of light to others -deaf in a land that was musical with song. Was I at fault? Do you punish the 'blind, the deaf, tne dumb when they fail to see, to hear, or to speak to us? Wlly, then, punish me for my imperfect being, which refused to obey to the utmost the laws of a perfect creation? Are you listening?" 't Yes." "This was my reasoning. It has not shaped my life, but it has reconciled me to it. I make great mistakes, commit great crimes; I am nothing that I ought, and everything which I ought not to be. I am bound in the konlds of the flesh, and I cannot get free. And this wasted, good-for-nothing, wicked, and wretched tie would be a curse to rid myself of, if I did not believe that when death comes I shall see its meaning; and, what is more, be glad to understand it to its deepest dptlhs." He ceased to speak, and stood looking up at the calm sky with an expression that was full ,f peace. There was no doubt of his sincerity. The mocking sarcasm of his manner had entire- ly disappeared; 'and he had spoken as men only speak when, in some unguarded moment, they allow the eyes of others to peneta ate the secrets    <pb n="0-57" xml:id="VAC6472-00000031"/> nf their inner lives. Philip Vere bad never 3poken so to any human being before. It was a relief to throw off the mask which he always wore-to show one person .that beneath his light-hearted, careless gayety, a. deep and thoughtful nature still remained. But, alas! that he should have selected Marian Moyell for his confidant. She drank in his words eagerly; she river forgot them for many a year. But if he had held a cup of poison to her lips, and forced her to drink it to the dregs, he could not have done her half so great an injury as he had done by tlit wild and rambling talk. It had been better for him, in the words of Holy Writ, "that a millstone had been hanged round his neck, and that he had been drowned in the depths of the sea", rather than by his own bit- ter experience he should have troubled, and for the time destroyed, the faint vestige of faith that still remained withii her heart. He belonged, unconsciously, to that class which even the saints are commanded to fear-those who can kill the soull And the amount of mischief which he had compressed into that sunny sum- mer's afternoon cannot be put into words. He did not think of this. If any one had pointed, out to him the consequences which might ensue from that confidential talk; if he had been told, that in one short half-hour he had planted seeds of infidelity and distrust in Marian's heart-seeds of whose bitter fruit she must pluck and-eat for many a weary year-he would have laughed at the idea. He saw that she was grave and pre-occupied i but he fancied that she was rather grieving for his perversity than feeling strengthened and encouraged in her own. "Well," he said, with a light laugh, "I have been to confession, and I really think I feel the better for it. It is hard to go through the world with such a weight upon your heart, never daring to speak what you think, or to be what you really are I I feel as if the sunlight and freshi air had shone into all the dark holes and corners of my mind once more. But surely you need not look so grave, my pretty saint, though I shall prove myself, in your eyes, a thorough villain. Shall I tell you why I have said all this to you?" "Yes." "It is because your future, is linked and twined with mine, that it would be folly in me to appear better to you than I really am. You will know me thoroughly one day, Marian; you will see me at my best and at my worst; and so I am only making a virtue of necessity by all this candor beforehand." "' Before what?" she asked. "I don't at all un- derstand what you mean by someof your speech ae, Mr. Vere." "Don't you?" "Explain them, if you please." "With the greatest pleasure. I tell you   - everything, because you are bound to me by the closest ties. You are to be my wife!" I?" "You 'need not look so-aghnast at the idea." "You are exceedingly impertinent." "Perhaps so.  Nevertheless I speak the truth, as you will see soon." "Are you mad?" "' Cracked upon some points, perhanps, like every one else in the world. But, just at present, I am speaking the words of truth and soberneen alone." "Well, certainly," she said, with a slight smile, 'o you are as original a person as ever I met in my life." "Thank you. You could not have paid me a greater compliment, though you may not know it. Original people don't grow on every bush, my dear, as you will see for yourselfwhen you have lived a little longer in the world. Every one, now-a-days, is stamped in the com- mon-place mint of fashion, and to be ' odd' is fatal. Nevertheless, I can add-and with all due deference be it spoken-so are you."  Marian was listening with an expression of quiet amusement on her face, as if to see how far his absurdity would carry him. "You wish to hear the rest, I suppose?" he remarked. * Is ,here anything more?" "  Oh, yes! It is only in a three-volume novel that the romance and' interest of people's lives end at the altar. The romance of yours and of mine is yet to come-after the ring is on your finger. Just at present we are having the reality; and a nice thing it is!" "And is it permitted me to ask when this wonderful wedding is to take place?" said Marian, demurely. "Well, I have not exactly made up my mind as to the time," he- said; " but I will let you' know long enough beforehand to admit of your getting your furbelows ready, if that is what you are thinking of!" "You are very kind." "Don't mention it. It is a weak way I have with me." "Very kind," she went on, a little hotly. "And the best way in which I can reward such kindness, I think, will be by boxing your ears soundly, Mr. Philip Vere!" "As you please," lie answered, bowing his head meekly before her. "Bahl You had better take care. I may be tempted too far. And now, if you have amused yourself sufficiently, I will go." "Stop a moment," he said, languidly. "I want. to talk to you about Lord Mountehayne." The red blood dyed Marian's face in an in- stant, and lie eyed her with a provoking smile. "He is still an interesting subject, I see, since you can blush so quickly at the mere sound of    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6472-00000032"/> his name, Did you care so very much for him, then?" "This impertinence is no. to be borne!" said Marian, stamping her foot. "Will you hold your tongue, Sir?" "Not ; I can't-I never could  I am as bad as n woman about that. I am happiest when I talk. And you need not get angry with. me; it does no good. In fact, I think it makes me still more impertinent. But do you know what that young man is about?' "Have you not just been kind enough to show me? He is making love to Rose Mar- tin." "How quickly you saw it! Your lip never trembles, and yet your heart bleeds and your brain is on fire at the mere thought!" "You give me crelit for much more feeling than I possess." "Not I I Pshaw! Don't I know all about it, you silly child? Have I not staked my all of life upon a look, a word, a smile? Have Hnot made an idiot of myself for the sake of a false woman, just as you are ready to do now for the sake of a fickle, empty-headed man? I have got over it, and so will you. But red-hot plowshares have an unpleasant knack of leav- ing their rark upon your feet if you walk over them, and you and I must both limp mentally, if not ph sically, through the follies of our youth. What would you give, now never to have seen yonder pink and white face?" Marian was silent, and her tormentor laughed aloud. "I thought as much! Lingering traces of the disease still remain, and you would rather suffer all you have suffered, and have yet to un- dergo, than lose the memory of your folly, and the dear delight of having once known him hind. Now, 1 am better off thlan you, I have got past that stage, and I wish Leonora Moyell had been at the bottom of the Red Sea before she came to spoil some of the best years of my life as she did I The world is full of Leonoras, every one cf them as good as the other, to my way of thinking; but where can I find five years to match those which I fooled away in thinking of and pining after her! Confound the gipsy! Be warned by me, my dear, and forget as soon as possible!" "So  shall," replied Marian, with a sigh. But I sometimes think that possibility will never come." "Nonsense! Six months after his marriage you will have forgotten all about him, because you will be married yourself." "There is one comfort," said Marian, medi- tatingly. " lie will be quite as unhappy as any one else can be." "If he marries Lady Theodosia?" "Yes." "He don't care much for her?" "Not a whit."   "It does not matter." "Wlhy not?" "Because he will not marry het." "What nonsense you talk I The ring is bought." "Ihe will not wear it.'" "The guests invited," "They will not come." "The bridemaids appointed." "They will not serve." "And the settlements made." "A fig for them all! I tell you he will not marry her." "Have you any reason for saying so?" "Most decidedly-yes." "Not a very good one, I should say." "I tlhink it good. He will not marry her, be. cause lie will not." Marian smiled bitterly. "My dear gipsy, I don't think much of your skill." "And yet I told your fortune well enough the other night," she said, musingly. "I don't know what you call well enough. You made a most dismal prediction about me." "Which will come true!" "Much you know about that!" "I don't say that I can read the stars foi every one. But I am gifted with the second sight, Marian, where you are concerned; and for any one who is connected with you, as Lord Mountchayne is, or has been." Marian mused a moment, with her eyes fixed upon his face. Something she saw there puz- zled her, but at last her brow cleared. "Do you know anything about me?" she asked eagerly. 'Much!" "And about my parents?" she added, with a timid glance. He nodded his head. "What is it? Why don't you tell me? How cruel of you to keep it to yourself!" "Fair and softly wins the day, my charmer. When the proper time comes, you shall hear all." "But when will that time come?"  "When you are my wife," he answered, with a low bow. She turned away with an angry exclamation. "I know you ate vexed wi h me, but I can- not give you the information you desire just at present. It is worth waiting for, believe mel In the meantime, try and think that I am anx- ious for your welfare-that I am constantly working in my own way for your good Will you?" She put up her lip by way of answer. "You make yourself look very ugly by doing that, my dear. It is only a pretty woman who can afford to make faces." "Good-bye!" she said, turning her back upon him.   "What a Tartar you are! What? You will "Yes; I have stayed here quite long enough. I don't understand you, Mr. Vere-I don't un- derstand why you are (tc use your own words) masquerading about the country in petticoats! I don't believe you know anything about me, or that you would tell me if you did; and I don't want to have anything to do with you in any way-there!"  Mr. Vere waited quietly till she had finished speaking. Then he took up his bundle again, and said, coolly: "All of which does hot prevent my knowing two thinrs. One is, that you will be my wife VI "Never!" Oh, yes, you will I And the other is, that Lord Mountchayne-" Marian was in full retreat; but he called after her, and the echoes took up the baleful cry over and over again: "Lord Mountchayne will marry Rose Martin, the sweet May Queen!" CIIAPTER XXIII. A FRIENDLY WARNING. "If lie came, If he came again- He my oldest friend- He my only friend- Oh, I would fly with bliss, ils dear mouth to kiss, Though wolfs blood it stained! And I would seize hold Of his hand, Though the fold Of a viper that band contained!" Marian's slumbers that night were not of the soundest description; and when the morning dawned, a course of action suggested itself to her which she tried hard to believe was the off- spring of kindness and charity, rather than of selfishness and jealousy. Rose Martin was young, and beautilul, and thougtless. She had no one to guide or restrain her; nnd she had been left by her dying father in Marian's care. It was as well, therefore, that she should go to the cottage, and enleavor, by some kind words of advice-of reproof, if need be-to prevent the shame and scandal that must necessarily fall upon her, in time, if Lord Mountchayne's visits did not cease. As soon as possible after breakfast she set out upon her errand. The sun shone'brightly, the flowers bloomed sweetly, the little birds sang loudly all along the way, but Marian heeded them not. There was a darkened sun, and a blighted flower, and a bird whose song'had died away within her own heart, and her thoughts were all of them. The doors and windows of Rose Martin's cot- tage stood wide open, and the house itself seemed full of sunshine. The canary was sing- ing loudly from his cage beneath the vine-cov- ered porchl, and a gray cat sat beneath him, 1,   blinking hetr ees ini thertilnshine, aiid apparent- ly considering whet her it wan worth her while to make an attempt to catch and eat him or not. The stones that paved the little garden-path were white as snow, and tiere was a wreath of old-fashioned blossoms in the round and heart- shaped plats, that filled the air with fragrance, and the drowsy hum of bees. Marian paused a moment on the threshold to look at the pretty picture. "No wonder he likes to come here," she mut- tered, with a slight frown, as shle stroked the cat and chirruped to the bird, and entered the little parlor in search of the mistress of the house. The room was vacant. Tle glittering fender and the speckless ornaments and pictures testi- fied to the careful hand that had been busy there. The carpet had been freshlly swept, the japanned tea-tray and caddy upon the side-table dusted, and in the window stood a great bouquet of garden flowers-a '"beau-pct" as the old country people still call it-that perfumed the whole room. Beside it lay a silver mounted riding-whip, and a gentleman's glove. Marian turned them over with the point of her parasol. The glove was of French make, and the head of the whip was engraved with a wolf at bay, the crest of the Reveres! "My Lord loses his head as well as Ilis heart, and leaves half hiT movable property behind him," she said, with a contemptuous smile. "Where can this girl be?" She passed through into the kitchen. It was as neat as the parlor, buft still no Rose was visi- ble. Marian ascended the stairs. The room where John Martin had died was evidently kept- as a spare chamber; but the opposite door was half open, and looking iS, she saw Rose, sitting at the toilet-table, arranging her hair. She was trying the effect of some ornament upon the golden curls. It was a spray of turquoise drops which she held-first this way, and then that- smiling the while at the lovely face that met her eyes at every turn. And as she studied that pleasing apparition, she began to sing in a soft, low voice: "You remember, Ellen, our hamlet's pride, How meekly she blessed her humble lot, When the stranger, William, had made her his bride, And love waa the light of their lowly cot '! She pressed the turquoise spray to her lips, and sat thinking for a minute or two; then, again, she began to carol; "'Now welcome, Ellen,' exclaimed the youth, 'This castle is mine, and these broad lands all!' She believed him craz'l, but he spoke the truth, And Ellen is Lady of Rosna lall!" "Lady of Rosna Hall " she murmured, hid- ing her blushing face in her hands. ,-"Ah, me! how like a fairy-tale it all seems I And how happy I am!"- "And how foolish!" said a low voice, besido her.    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6472-00000033"/> 'She started tvitfl a little scream of terror, and looked up into Marian's pale, grave face. She tried, to hide the turquoise spray, but it was too late., "You here, Miss Marian!" she said, confused- ly. "I did not hear you come in 1" "No1 I found no one below except the cat and canary-bird, and as I did not come to visit them, I searched the house foryou; and I found you at last hanging over a tritle like that" (she pointed to the little ornament), " and fancying yourself a new Lady of Burleigh, I have no doubt!  O my dear Rose, how can you be so silly 1" Rose did not answer. She put the despised ornament out of sight as quickly as possible, and began to arrange her hair. "I am sorry you should find me in such con- fusion, Miss Marian," she said, deprecatingly. "But I have been working hard all the morn- ing, and I did not think how late it was when I came up to make myself tidy. Will you come down into the parlor, and I will give you aglass of new milk after your walk." '"Thank you, I don't want any milk just yet. I want to talk to you. I came purposely to do so; and this room is better than the parlor, since no one can overhear or interrupt us here." "Yes, Miss Marian," said Rose, very dutiful- ly, looking fidgety and nervous all the while. Marian waited till her toilet was completed, and then said, kindly: "Do you know what I want to speak to you about, Rose?" "  About the little brooch, I suppose, Miss Marian." "Well, we will begin with that, if you like. Where did you get it?"' "It was given to me." "  By whom?" "By-by a friend," said the girl, with a pain- ful increase of color. "Hugh Dennet"  "Oh no!" she said, with a slight shudder; "poor Hughcould notafford to give me a hand-  some present like that."  "But there is one young gentleman in the i neighborhood who can afford to do so," said  Marian, severely. "And he lives at the Priory,  and his name is Lord Mountchayne."'    1 Rose hung her head. and blushed. "Don't be angry with me, Miss."     i "But I am angry-I can't help being angry, a when I see you so stupid. Do ou know that le is just going to be married, you little goose, p to a lady of lis own rank?" Rose was silent. "' Have youu never heard of this?" "Yes, Miss Marian, I knew that he was going to be married." "Wast Oh, the wind sets that way, does it? Since when has it been that he was going to be married, my poor child?" "   nd ' "Lord M,utcllayne will never marry Lads le Theodosia Monmolltl," said Rose, looking up, o and speaking with a quiet air of authority, that reminded Marian unpleasantly of Philip Vere's d- last words. "IHow long have you known Lord Mount. at chayne?" it  Rose hesitated to answer. "d '.Don't be afraid, child; I don't mean you or Le him any harm. But your i)oor father left you g in my care, and told me to be kind to you. o  oes not that dying charge of his give me a O right to ask these questions, Rose?" "Oh yes!" and the girl's blue eyes filled with d tears. d  ' Then answer them. When did youfirst meet him 9" -  *' About a month ago." r, "And where?" "At the Priory." I "How carme you there, pray?" e  "Lady Theodosia gave a grand party,-Miss 8 Marian; and among other things to amuse the gentlefolks, they had a lot of people dressed 1up,  and standing in frames, like pictures." "tableaux. Yes; I heard of them." n  Well, Miss, there was one called ' Rebecca and Rowena', that was taken from some great novel; and Lady Theodosia had no one fot Rowena, till the ousekeeper remembered me. So tley sent for me, gave me the most splendid dress I ever saw in my life, and made me stand there before all the company, while Rebecca looked straight in my face." "But who was Rcheoca?" "Lady Theodosia herself." I am sorry to say that Marian was gifted with a sixth sense, which often brings its possessor into the most grievous trouble: a sense of the ludicrous, which beset her at the most improper times, and in the most inappropriate places, making her laugh at dismal tragedies, and smile at funerals, and commit many other enormities of the most shockingdescription. Nov, though every word uttered by Rose was a death-blow to her own hopes, she could not refrain from a mischievous laugh at the thought of the Lady Theodosia innocently playing Rebecca to that lovely Rowena, while the real Ivanboe stood looking complacently on. "1 You smile, Miss Marian," said Rose, look. ing anxious. "Was there nnything wrong- anything ridiculous in my taking this part?" "Not at all. And I dare say you made the prettiest Rowena imaginable. What didLord Mountchayne say to it?" Rose turned her blushing face away. "He liked it," she murmured, almost inaudibly. "Indeed  And what happened afterwardl?" "I came home." "And then?" "The   next day his lordship called, and brought me this."   And she took out the torquoise brooch again. Marian glanced at it. "Hum I Very plr.'tty, and rather valuable. Well, my dear, has his lordship ever been to see you since P" "Oh, yes!" "Once?" "Oftenl,rl" "Twice?" \ "More than that?" "Three times?" "Miss Marian!" said the girl, in a sudden burst of confidence, ' lie comes every day!" There was a short silence. Marian shool her head, and looked very grave. At last she said: "Where do you see him, Rose ." "Here, in this cottage!" "Alone?" "-Oh, yes!" "And whlat does le do, all the time?" "He rcals to me while I sewl" said Rose, with a bright blush. "How loti, does lie stay?" "Sometimes ai hour-sometimes two." "Do you ever walk with him?" "We welt yesterday to the Wishing Well, Downe Reserve." *' Yes, I heard you were there." Rose started. "Why, we did not see you, Miss Marian!" "Nof I caught a glimpse of you by chance, and then kept out of the way. I need not say how surprised I was. I came as soon as possi- ble this evening to talk with you, my dear child. Where do you expect'this will end?" The beautiful blue eyes of the May Queen wandered toward the church spire that towered far away above the village trees. Marian saw and underst ood the glance. "I though; so I Do you believe he will mar- ry you?" ' I know lie will i" said the girl, courageous- ly. "If he has told you so, he is a greater vil- lain than I took him to be." "He is not a villain I You shall not call him so, Miss Marian!" "Bah  I could tell you things that would shake your faith in him, I think. Why, Rose, three monthls have not gone by since he was at my side all day long, as he is now at yours." "Miss Marian!" "It is true. When he was at the Plensaunce, he was continually with me. He said things which, if I lhad believed them, I could never have forgotten. His looks, his words, his deeds, all proclaimed that lie cared for me; and now, perhaps, lie scarcely remembers my name I  I tellyou this to warn you in time. I am poor and friendless, it is true; but, for all that, I was the member of an old family, and an inmate of the house where he was a guest, and these two things protected me in a measure from him.   'But you, Rose, are alone in the world-dwel- ling in a cottage by yourself, and receiving his constant visits in the most ilmprudent manner. It is not right-it is your duty to send him away. You are too young and too beautiful to have a friend like himl" Rose drew herself up with a haughty air, and scarcely waited for Marian to finisl speaking before she Iurst out in her own defelnce. "It is cruel and unkind of you to say this to me 1" she exclaimed. "You ought to know me better than to suppose for one instant that I could be led away-even if he should be base r enough to attempt it." : ' I don't know, Rose. We are only flesh and blood, after all; and the greatest saints have had their temptations, which they found it very difficult to surmount. You love this man dear- ly! I can see it in your face, and hear in your voice when you speak of him.- You love him with' all your heart and soul, as such men must always be loved. You have no will but his-- you shape your very thoughts by his direction. Now, if he has this influence over you, and chooses to make use of it for a lad purpose, how are you going to help yourself? If I were in your place, I should doubt the strength of my own self-control. lf I were you-if-I loved him as you do, and he looked at me with those wonderful blue eyes of his, and said, "Rose, come-'"  She stopped short.  "Go on!" said Rose, looking at her with a strange, eager glance. "If he said that, what would you do?" "I am very much afraid that I should go." "Then you, too, have loved him." The murder was out-the secret was reveal- ed. In her anxiety to serve and save her friend, Marian had spoken more fully than she had intended to do, and so had betrayed her- self. She shrank guiltily away from Rose's glance, at first. Then she smiled sadly, and said:  , "Well, if I grant it, what then? You will pay more heed to me, perhaps, if I own my weakness. I did love him once, Rose, but it is all over now." "Quite over?" Quite." "That is strange. I don't think I could ever forget him." "' You must remember that our positions are very different. He loves you, and tells you so. Now, he never said openly to me that he loved me in so many words, and my pride came to my aid, and helped me to conquer a passion as foolish as it was painful. Ynu have won him- I would gladly say, ' Wear him ;' ImutI cannot, because 1 don't believe in his good faith-be- cause I think that lie is trifling with you, and I know the fascination of his grace oald beauty so well myself, that I dread its effect on you."    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6472-00000034"/> "I understand," said Rose, hurriedly; "and I wish I could tell you." "Tell me wh?" The girl did not answer. She sat looking out of the open intldow, and playing with a little silk watch-guard whiclih she wore around her neck. With her dlelicate, spiritual beauty, and her deep mourn i Ig-dress, it seemed hard 'in- deed to blieZve lhat any one could wish to im- plant a needless pang within her gentle breast. "'Let hni that staitnleth take heed lest he fall,' " said Marinan, in a low voice. "Rose, you are but a woman, and other women quite as good and as beautiful as you have trusted too much before now. If such a thing should hap- pen, what would become of you? You would find no friends here; you would have no home but the wide world-no refuge but the city streets-no compDan/ions except the reckless and wicked women you would meet there. Is it worth while to lose so much for the sake of a handsome face and a few loving words? Come, my dear, be strong and brave, and tell this young man to leave you in peace." "What you fear will never happen to me," said Rose, wiithi a secure smile. "' Why not? Are you more or less than mortal, that you can give your whole heart to a man so far above you, and yet hope to escape th disgrace which must surely follow?" "ord 'Mountchayne is kind, and good, and noble. He will never wrong me." "You have more faith in him than I." "I hase all faith in him." "I wish you joy of it. Are you, indeed, so obstinate that you will not heed a-word I say . "Not so obstinate, my dear Miss Marian, but so hopeful!" said the girl, with a little willful smile that was very charming. "What' folly What do you think your friends and neighbors will say to all this?" "They do not know." "' But they must know in time. This cottage is very lonely and secluded ; but if Lord Mount- ehayne comes here every day, some one will be sure to see him, and then, only think of the scandal that must ensue." "He will take care of that," said Rose, with fond smile. "He will never allow my honor to be called into question." "Are you macd?" said Marian, rising impa- tiently from iher seat. 1 No," said Rse, with a loving look; "though, no doubt, I appear so to you. Oh, if you would only have a little patience with me, and a little faith in him, H" "My child, I know only too well how surh handsome ,young gentlemen take care of the reputation of pretty cottage-girls -like you I However, if my warnings and entreaties have no power to move 3 ou, I will say no more. Go your own way, Rose, in future. I shall not in- terfere with you again."   "Now you are angry!" said, Rose, tearfully. "Only sorry for you," replied Marlin, as she turned to leave the room. "'Ali, Rose, if the poor old man who died on yonder bed was here, what would lie say to you?" "HHe would not blame me ; lie would trust me and believe that, though sonic things look- ed strarnge and wrong there might be some- thing behiind that made them as s pure and bright as the light of the sun at noonday." M irian scarcely heard this speechr, as she de- scended the stairs, aiid paid nIto attentlion to its significance. They entered the little parlor to- gether, and she pointed to the whip and glove with a slight frown. "Do you expect him here to-day?" "Yes." "And you will persist in seeing him after all that I have said?" "I must!" said Rose; and again her hand played nervously with the chain she wore around her neck. "Then I will say good-bye-a long good- bye." "Why, Miss Marian?" "Because I shall come here no more." "Never again?" "Never again." "It' is hard of you, Miss Marian, after what my poor father said when he was dying." "I do not think, so. I would gladly have fulfilled his wish. I have tried h,nestly to do so; but by will not allow it, and so, farewell." "One moment!" said Rose, detaining her. "Is it possible that you think me guilty?" "I think that you will be!" said Marian, sig- nificantly, and then shrank from her as if she had received a blow. "O Francis, this is hard to bear'!" she mur- mured to herself; and Marian heard the words. "iHard!" she exclaimed. "You need not bear it unless you like! It is not too late to turn back I But if you will go on in the path you have chosen, and pay no heed to those who warn you that it is full of thorns, what can I say to you? Only this--that I make a distinc- tion between sinners, which is this : If you were really led away in some sudden moment of weakness, of which you repented bitterly, after- ward, I would not refuse to counsel and aid you. But here you are deliberately preparing for such a moment, by exposing yourself (day after day to temptation. In spite of entreaties and expostulations, you choose your lot, and will have no reason to complain of it. But I grieve for you all the same, and I am very sorry that we are to meet no more! Good-bve!" "Oil, stop,! I will tell you all I' cried Rose. But Marian only shook her heaJ, and went res- olutely on, while Rose sat down in the easy- chair, and wept bitterly. Marian walked up the green lane, indignant with Rose, with Lord Mouilchaylie, with her-   self, with everybody! As she turned into the high road, a black hoi'se passed her at a rapid trot. The rider lifted his hat as he dashed by. It was Lord Mouilchayne, and he was going inl -the direction of the cottage which she had just left. A sudden impulse which she could not resist made her turn back, and make her way through the hedge, and by a short side-path to a mea- dow which overlooked the quiet little home. Concealing herself beneath a friendly poplar tree, she waited patienitly for a glimpse of the lovers. They came, ere long, into the garden. The sweet face of Rose was no longer stained with tears. Lord Mountchayne's arm was round her waist, and she was looking up at him with a faint smile and talking eagerly. As they paced up and down the narrow walk Marian caught a sentence or two of their conversation. "But did you ever,love her, Francis?"Rose was asking. "Did you love her as much as you love me?" "You little goose," said Lord Mountchayne, with a merry laugh, " if you ask such absurd questions, you shall have those sweet lips stop- ped with kisses!" "No; but answer me!" she pleaded. "Did you ever reallv care for her?" "That ugly little thing!" "She is not ugly; she has a very nice face!" "You may think so; but I confess, in my eyes, she is just the plainest woman on earth I Compare her-face with this beautiful one that blushes like a rose beneath my gaze; and then ask me again, if you dare, whether I ever loved her'! Lov6 her, indeed! I can't help laughing at the idea, my charming Rose 1" They walked away, and Rose's reply was un- intelligible to the listener. But she had heard quite enough; and wounded, heart-sick, and despairing, she stole, unnoticed, away. CITAPTER XXIV. THE SHADOW OF A COMNG EVENT. "My soul is dark-oh, quickly string The harp 1 3 et can brook to hear; And let thy gentle fingers fling Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear. If in this heart a hope be dear, That sound shall charm it forth again: If in those eyes there lurk a tear, 'T'will flow, and cease to burn my brain. c"But bid the strain be wild and deep. Nor let thy notes of joy be first: I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep, Or else this lihavy heart will burst: For it hath been by sorrow nursed, And ached in sleepless silence loig; And now '1us doomed to know the worst, And break at once-or yield to song." -BYRON. It is not pleasant to be thought a fright, still less to be called one in the presence of a rival, by the man you love. Generally speaking, it is quite as well to keep your thoughts to your-   ' self when in the company of a plain woman-- especially if you haippen to belong to the oppo- site sex. It is all very well:to pet and praise a beauty-it is a delightful occupation, but not fraught with any very dahgerous consequences, either to the giver or receiver of the compli- ment. She expects it-it is her due-and she never dreams of feeling grateful to you for what you cannot help. But address one compliment to an ugly woman, aind let it be so moderate that she will not suspect you of laughing at her, and she is your slave and your debtor for life. Tell her that her eyes are finle, her teeth good, her smile bewitching, or her features ex-* pressive, and she will rate you far above any other man in her secret heart. But, at the same time, beware of those stupid mistakes which men so often make. Don't lpraise that one beauty at the expense of another which she does not possess. Don't pay your compliment in such a fashion thiat she will translate it thus: "My dear Madam, your eyes are good, but you have not another charm about you"; if you do, she will neither forgive nor forget it to her dy-. ing day. Most men lack tact in those matters, and so offend their gentle companions mortally. I once new a good tempered and moderately good-looking heiress who 4ismissed lover after lover for no other reason than that they were too candid; and in their eagerness to escape all suspicion of flattering, told her tiOe truth about herself. At last, one came who Was mostsui- able in every way. The offer was accepted, and all went merry as a marrid e'b'l, till one unlucky evening the happy loe; tok it into his head to utter a tirade against fair faces and lovely forms. "Beauty!" he exclaimed; "what is beauty after a man las outlived his teens? Who cares for a pretty face, when he finds a well cultivat- ed mind and a warm and loving heart in its place?" He paused for a reply, but got none. His lady-love looked as black as night, and the very next day contrived to pick a quarrel with him, through which the match was broken off, The next year she married her groom, and so ended 'her romeance and the hopes of her suitors. One can quite undersL and this. It is a wom- an's vocation to be beautiful, aid she does not like to hear that she has misseil it. Are you in love, my reader, with a lady who does not ex- actly resemble'tie Venus de Medicis? Take good care never to tell her so. If you do, and she wants a home or a position, she may marry, but she will always detest you. Praise her eyes, if she has but one; her teeth, though they may all be false; her lovely hair, though you knlow it is a wig; her beautiful color, though you pass the shop every day whe e she buys it. Don't find fiult with the cut of her gown, the color of her shawl, the shapo of hur bonnet, or the size of her hoop-and all will be well. If    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6472-00000035"/> you can only convince her that, in your eyes, she is perfect, she will try hard to remain so, and be so grateful to you in your blindness, that nothing. can ever shake the allegiance of her steadfast heart. After all, this vanity is a gentle failing, and we will deal gently with poor Marian, for pos- sessing it in a somewhat inordinate degree. It was not her fault-but it was her punishment; and when it got such a cruel wound from the careless words of Lord Mountchayne, she felt as, if she wislied the earth would open and hide her from his sight. Since she was unpleas- ant to his eyes, it was far better to die than to live! It was the opinion of one human being- one only, that is true-but tliatone represented the whole woilid to her just then! Crushed and despairing, she stole in at the Pleasaunce gate, and sought her never-failing refuge, the old loft, where he had once been glad to sit and read to her for hours at a time. She took down one of her favorite volumes, but the book had lost its charm. "That ugly little thing!" seemed printed on every page in let-- ters of fire ; and tiring of the ineffectual effort to read, she rose at last, took the book in her hand, and went into thie house. She met Mrs. Pryor in the hall. That worthy lady held an open letter in her hand, and looked the very picture of confusion. "Ah, my dear! you are the very person I wanted to see," she exclaimed, as her eyes fell upon Marian.' "Here is a letter from Miss Moyell, and she says that she is coming home next week." "Oh dear I then all my pleasure is at an end." "The worst of it is, that she is going to bring' a party with her " "Not the Priory people, I hope?" said Marian, hastily, forgetting that they would not be likely to pay a long visit again so soon. "Oh-no!  some people from London. She says there will be five besides herself and Miss Caroline and Lucy-two ladies and three gen- tlemen. That is" hat makes it so awkward. I don't know where Io I ut them all." "Come up-stairs, and we will soon settle that question." They went, and in the course of the next ten minutes all Mrs. P'yor's troubles disappeared, and she began to think it was a pleasant thing, after all, to have the house as full of guests as it could hold. "Besides, it makes it so much more lively for you, my dear," she added, as they came Jown again. ," I'm not likely to get the lion's share of the festivities, Mrs. Pryor. I'm but a poor depen- dant, and they all know it, and take good care to show, me that they do." "Humpli  As to that, perhaps if all was as it ought to be, you might hold your head as high as the proudest of them all."   "But notl-ing is as' it ought to be in this ,world, I think. Mrs. Pryor." "Well, child, let us hope the next world will make up for it." "And, at all events, ,it don't matter much." said Marian, more cheerfully. "I have my books, my garden, my old loft, and my walks through the green fields; and my cottage friends in the village, who are always glad to see my face, and I am well content with them." At the mention of hler cottage friends Mrs. Pryor's face suddenly wore an anxious look. "My dear, you had better not go much into the village just now," she observed. "'Why not?" "There is a great deal, of sickness among the people!" "Of what kind?" "There are several fevers about; and diph- theria is also prevalent," said Mrs. Pr. or, look- ing away, and speaking in a constrained tone of %oice. "Oh, then, I will not go! I have no desire to make the acquintance of either of those maladies!" "Quite right, my dear; and I would not talk to the people from the village (if you should meet them in your walks), if I were you. It is astonishing how easily these infectious disorders are caughtl" l"You have frightened me so thoroughly that I don't mean to stir beyond the gardin for a week," said Marian, with a' smile ; and Mrs. Pryor's brow cleared again. "You are going tlhero now, I think. Well, I won't detain you, especially as I myself have a great deal of work to do this afternoon." She trotted down the hall, her basket of keys jingling musically in her hands, and Marian went out and seated herself beneath her favorite lilac tree, close to some bee-hives, whose busy tenants knew her so ivell, and trusted her so thoroughly, that they allowed her to overlook them'at their work as long ani as closely As she liked. Their busy hum soothed and tranquil- ized her that afternoon, yet still slhe could not fix her mind upon her book. At Ilst she gave up the attempt in despair, and leatning back upon the rustic bench, claspcd her hands be- hind her head, and looked up through the green leaves into the clear blue slky. How still, how intensely hot the air was I Well might the pestilence rage at noonday in such an atmosphere as that! She liked the' intense heat herself-she basked in it as if she had been a salamander! But to the parched invalid, tossing and panting on a fevered couch, how tormenting it must be! What if Rose Martin should be lying on such a couch ere long? What if Lord Mountcliayne, Conscious of her danger, should refui-e to leave the cottage? What if Marian should be sum- moned by the sick girl's fancy, as her nearest   friend, to watch beside him there? What if Rose, pale and dying, should join their hands together, and bid her lover, with her last breath, be faithful to the heart that was unconsciously 'his own? As she thought that thought, the latch of the garden gate rattled, and looking up, she saw Philip Vere standing there, and re- garding her with an air of extreme benignity. She glanced up at the house, but saw no Mrs. Pryor looking wonderingly out. So she went down in a most ungracious mood to see what he wanted. "Your royal highness does not Ibok well please-," was his first observation. "May the most iTumble of your slaves venture to. inquire what has displeased you?" "The most humble of my slaves bad better tell me why he is here, of all places in the world?" was the sharp reply. Mr. Vere laughed. "I understand. You think me lacking in delicacy of feeling, because I set my foot upon the territory which I once hoped to call my own. But you will please to observe, that like the Peri at the portal of Eden, I only stand at the gate. I am sur I may add, with great truth, that like that lo spirit, I am utterly disconsolate." "If Mrs. Pryor should se you?', said Marian in a voice of alarm.   y "Do you mean the house eper?" "Yes"!" "Don't be frightened she is safe enough. She has gone to carrysme soup, and tracts, and fla-nel, to the poor people who are ill in the cottages on the common." "How do' you know that?" "Because I am not so entirely destitute of the bump of caution as you seem to think; and because I took precious good care to ascertain how many watch-dogs there were on the prem- ises, before I ventured here in search of you. I met the worthy soul myself, as I came this way, and remarkably hot and uncomfortable she looked. 'Of all tedious occupations, commend me to that of carrying hot soup and weak tracts to the poor, on a day like this!" "It is not much in your line, I should say,"  remarked Marian, dryly. '  "Oh, thank goodness, I have not come to 4 that as yet!, What I may take to whin I get I into my dotage, no one can say'" "Nothing worse, I hope! And now, at the 1 risk of seeming very rude, I must ask your 'errand here 2"  " You need not Be afraid to stop and talk five I minutes to a wretch like me!" he said, with a t slight impatience visible in his manner. "If I you knew the society to which I am condemned t all day long just now, you would not woieder that I seek, in mere desperation, half a dozen \ woyda with a civilized bein like' yoursel"    F  "Where are you staying?' "At the gipsy camp." '"'Living with the gipsies 2" "Living with them, eating with them, talking with them, and drinking with them. Bah I I'm sick of it; and I'm going to cut the whole con cern in a very little while." Marian's face was full of wonder. "Well, what does that preternaturally solenin look mean?" "I think it strange that a gentleman should choose such a life, and such companions." "So it is, So are many things strange in this world." "But why do you not leave them?" "Have I not told you that I am going to?" "Why did you ever come?" His face darkened. "Ah, why, indeed! Supposing I should say it was to see you?'" "That is very likely." "It is the truth. Now, I'll tell you candidly the whole state of the case. For'reasons of m' own, which I shall, tell you some day, I have kept an eye on you for years. I remembered that you were growing to be a woman, and that women have a bad habit of falling in love. Mar- riage naturally springs from love, it would not have suited me at all to see you marry any one else, since I have ah'eady selected you for my own wife." "You are very kind." "To myself? Perhaps so; perhaps I am .4 reality far kinder to you than you imagine. Well, as I was saying, I came down to look af- ter you."        I "Too late," she murmured, with a sigh. "In one sense of the word-not in another. thank my lucky star! I found you in love-but not married. The honor of putting the ring oni your little hand -is reserved for the humble invidual who now addresses you!" "' What ridiculous nonsense!" "Is it? Wait a little, and see! Butyou will understand that, coming to woo a bride out of this house, I could not make my intentions public. I could not put boldly up at the 'Revere Arms', and give out that I had come down to marry Miss Marian Moyell; nor could I have quarter- ed myself upon any of the good people whom I know in this neighborhood. They would, one and all, have wanted to know more about my business with you than I should have cared to tell them. So, on the whole, I thought it best to look up my old friends the gipsies, and throw myself upon their hospitality for a time, since they happened to pitch their tents' in the very place I wished to yisit; and really, in the sum- mer, it is not so bad a life, only one gets tired of it, as one gets tired of everything in time."    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6472-00000036"/> CHAPTER XXV. MARIA N'S REVENGE. "The hand that mingled in the meal At midnight drew the felon steel, And gave the heart's kind breast to feel Meed for his hospitality! The friendly hearth which warm'd that hand, At midnight armed it with a brand That bade destruction's flames expand Their red and fearful blazonry." -MASSACRE OF GLENOOE. Marian was lost in a brown study, and scarcely heard the end of his speech. She began to believe his story-began to believe that he had really come to Downe Reserve for the purpose of meeting her, since he had sought her out, and held himself certainly aloof from any one in the neighborhood. But what could he want of her? Above all, why had he got this ridiculous scheme of a marriage into his head. He was evidently quite in earnest about it. She had only to say the word, and she could be his wife, though he did not care three straws for her. Some ad vantage would evidently accrue to him, which he could only gain as her hus- band. What could that advantage be?  She was at an entire loss; but she remembered Mrs. Pryor's mysterious hints, and the communica- tion Rose Martin's father had tried J: vain to make to her when he was dying. Blth pointed to this one end: there was a mystery about her, and it concerned her worldly welfare and posi- tion-she was sure of that. Again, the old man had addressed her as "Lady Marian". She had scarcely noticed it at the time, but now the title came back with strange significance to her ear. "Lady Marian!"  If that was her rightful name, how could she be Marian Moyell? And if Marian Moyell was extinct, who would assume her place? A wild vision of future happiness rushed through her mind. She saw herself brilliant, attractive, noble, and rich, if not beautiful. She saw a throng of admirers pressing round, to whom her wit atoned for her lack of. love- liness; and foremost among the group stood Lord Mountchayne! Rose was forgotten; and the high and titled heiress reigned in his heart in her stead. "Did you ever read the old fable of the milk- maid?" asked Mr. Vere, quietly. "Do you re- member how that unlucky damsel, going from the pasture with her pail upon her head, thought to herself how many eggs she could buy with the innocent fluid, and how she could exchange those eggs for a 'grass-green gown and pink ribbons, wherewith to captivate Lubin at the country fair; and then, poor wretch, as she practiced some of her airs and graces which were to be played off upon him on that eventful day, she gave her head a toss, and down came mlll-pail and all, and there was an end of Lubin and the grass-green gown? You put me very much in mind of ier a moment ago."   "How so?" "You are measuring your milk before you have even made tie acquaintance of the cow, and counting the eggs many a day before they are laid; a wild idea'possessing you just at this moment that you can touch the pinnacle of your fortune without my help, and then bestow it upon whom you will. Dismiss that idea as soon as possible." "There is a forture, then?" said Marian, un- der her breath. "To be won-yes! And I keep its key I' cannot gain it without your help; but, then, neither can you without mine; so there we are equal." "You deal in mysteries. Why don't you tell me frankly what you have been hinting at ever since I first met you?" "Thank you! I .have lived a good many years in the world, and I am not so verdant as you think. You will know all about this inter- esting secret when you are my wife; and, till then, I beg leave, most respectfully, to observe that wild horses cannot tear it from me!" Marian turned away. "In that case, Mr. Vere, I may as well say ' good afternoon' at once. I left a very pleasant book on yonder garden-seat; and you will ex- cuse me if I say that I prefer the author's style of conversation to yours?" "Oh, don't go yet! I wanted to ask you something about Rose Martin.", "What?" "Have you seen her since I had the pleasure of tal'ling to you the other evening?" "Once." "'Was I not right about Lord Mountchayne!" "Perhaps so. How can I tell?" Mr. Vere laughed. "My dear Marian, allow me to tell you that you do not know your real friends when you see them." "And let me tell you, Sir, that your behavior to me is offensive in the extreme I What right have you to call me ' dear Marian', I should like to know? Don't do it again!" "Well, perhaps you are right!" he replied with an affable air, that made,her long to box his ears. I have not the privilege just at pre- sent; and therefore, great as the pleasure may be, I resign it, and call you' Miss Marian' again! Will that do?" She would not answer. "Angry, and with me! Now that is too ab- surd! In the first place, I am am not worthy getting angry with; and in the second, I nm the very best friend, the very staunchest sup- porter you ever had in your life, if you will but accept me as such! By serving you I shall be serving myself, and so you will be served well. You see, I make no propositions of disinterest- edness or generosity. I'm not generous, and I never go out of my way to do any one a service.   unless at the same time I can benefit Philip Vere, Esq. Now, then, having said so much, why don't you be candid with me?" "Because I don't choose to be!" "How can I help you, then?" "I don't want your help!" "It would be'far more powerful than you think. For instance, if you said frankly to me, ' My dear Philip, I hate that Rose Martin, and she is horribly in my way!' how do you know that I could not do you a good turn by getting her out of it?" '"But I don't hate her!" "If you don't now, you will before long. It is coming-it is close at hand!" "And she is not in my way!" "Did you ever read Mrs. Opie's books, my dear young lady? There is one on white fibs which I should recommend to your perusal, for you told one then! A white one! I'll be shot if I don't think it was very near brown 1" Marian smiled. "You are quite mistaken. She is not in my way, because I never occupied the position which she now holds." "And what position is that, I wonder?" said Mr. Vere, with a comical glance. "No very improper one, let us hope; so you need not turn your eyes up in that absurd man- ner at me!" "I only know one thing." "What is that?" "That whatever she may be now, she will be Lady Mountchayne before long." Marian was silent. "It is her beauty, you see, that has played  the mischief with him. Hle would not get another face like that to put under his coronet, -if he searched all through the ranks of the aris- tocracy. He knows that as well as any one else. It is strange, by the way, how infatuated handsome people are about beauty. I don't suppose he would trouble himself to look twice at an ugly woman, do you?"       d "  You bad-better go and ask him, if you are a so anxious about the matter!" she said, tartly. c "  Ah, you are a little sore on that point! If v you were only reasonable now, if you would only see that beauty is only skin deep--" '  Never meind that!" she cried, bitterly. y "Who looks beneath the skin? So that it be y fair and fresh, who cares for the heart that beatsT beneath? So that the eyes are bright, and th al lips red, and the teeth like pearls, what more is there to ask for?" '"Ah, now you begin to talk!" said Mr. Vere, leaning on the gate, and swinging it to and fro; now you begin to be honest! And I will be ki honest, too. That little cottager is very love. of ly, and you are plain. You will hate me for cc telling you that, I know, but it is the honest or truth. So far as looks go, you have not the slightest shadow of a chance with her; and, af   lip unfortunately, Lord Mountehayne is not very ih, intellectual, so that I cannot hold out any hopes of his appreciating the talents which you cer- tainly possess. He must be caught by the eye, if at all."  "That being the case, we need say no more )u about him," said Marian, turning away with an e, impatient sigh. id  "Nor about the pretty Rose?" w  "No." g  "The pretty Rose, I suppose, she will still remain to the end of her days. For, though old, she will never be ugly-she could not be if [t she tried! Unless, indeed-" He paused, as if struck with a sudden thought, and looked toward the village. y  "Unless what?" asked Marian. 's  "Unless disease spoils her good looks." r  "It can never do that. She would lie upon t a bed of death, and look as lovely as she does now." "Do you think so? I doubt it. She might be ill, itis true, and recover her beauty again;  i but there is one disease-yes, one-to which even Rose Martin might fall a prey, and from 1 which she might escape only to remain a dis- gusting object for the rest of her life." Struck by something in his manner and tone, Marian looked him keenly in the face, and ask- ed: "What do you mean?" "Have you never heard of such a disease 1"' "Many leave their mark." "But none leave such a mark as this. It is horrible to think of a face so fair, branded for ever by its hideous stigma." "To what do you refer?" "To the pestilence that is among us now." "The pestilence! Where?" "In Downe." "Is it cholera?" "No. It is smallpox." Marian turned pale. Of all diseases, she dreaded none like this. And to hear that it had actually taken up its quarters in her quiet country-home, sent a thrill of horror to her  very heart.  "Is there danger?"she asked faintly. "Of course. But the means of safety are in your own hands. Don't go near the village just yet, and get vaccinated as speedily as possible. Then, I hope, you will have no reason to feel alarm." "Is it at the camp?" No."  "Do you:fear it?" "Not at all. I am a terrible fatalist, you know, and firmly hold to, the military doctrine of '  every bullet has its billet'. When my turn comes, I shall go ; and whether it, is by one way or another, matters little." "a I wish I could feel that; but I confess I am afraid."    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6472-00000037"/> "I assure you you need not be. And it is always the cowards that run into the worst of danger. By the way, does Rose Martin know this?" "I think not." "She ought to be told. It would be a pity, as I said before, if she should lose all that beau- ty through this scourge." He looked fixedly at Marian as he spoke, and at the instant a thought entered her mind, at which she shuddered, and vet she could not drive away. If Rose should, indeed, be so un- fortunate, would Lord Mountchayne's love have stood such a terrible test? And if Rose was out of the way, was there not at least a chance that he might remember the pleasant hours spent in that sunny garden, and return to his old allegiance once more? For one giddy moment everything turned round before her eyes. The next, she hated herself for the thought. She hated Philip Vere for suggesting it to her, and then standing with that insulting smile upon his lips, to watch its effects upon her mind. "You are quite right," she said, coldly. "It would be a shame for her to be exposed to any danger, and I will take an early opportunity myself of putting her on her guard." "Do," he answered, with a low cough. "Lord Mountchayne will be so much obliged to you, and so would she." "Very well, then, that is settled. Have you anything more to say?" ,' Not just at present. I shall look you up, however, in a day or two, to see how the fair Rose has profited byyour warning. You do not object to that?" "I certainly do. I do not see why you should follow me about like this, and expose me to the unpleasant remarks that will surely be made, if these interviews are discovered." , Trust me for that! I will never compro- mise you. For the rest, you know, you are the light of my eyes and the desire of my heart, and I can't exist without seeing you once in a while." "My cousin returns to the Pleasaunce next week!" "I am perfectly willing." "What if she should see you here?" "What a joke that would be! Do you think she would faint, or go into a strong swooning fit of hysterics?" "Not she." "No. She never wastes powder and shot to no purpose. She is a practical young person, that lovely Leonora of mine; and if she had only behaved herself as such, and seen on which dide her bread was buttered, I should have been talking to you to-day from the other side of the 'gate, and you would have seen a very different man from the disappointed and good-for-nothing vagabond who now intrudes on you."   He lifted his hat with easy, well-bred grace, and sauntered up the road. Marian watched until he was out of sight, and then went back to her book with a puzzled expression on ler face. About half-an-hour after Mr. Vere had taken his departure, Marian, who had been wandering up and down the garden-paths like an uneasy spirit, saw Mrs. Pryor returning from the visit to the village. She hastened to the gate to ad- mit her. The good woman looked flushed and tired, and her face was so full of sadness, that the young girl was struck by it, and thought that something terrible must have happened. "What is it?" she asked, anxiously. "Have you heard any bad news?" "That I have. Bad news for you, for me, and for all of us," said Mrs. Pryor, shalking her head and sinking down upon the garden- seat, as if she was unable to stand. "And what is it?" "There is a terrible pestilence in the village, child. I meant to have kept it from you; but perhaps it is as well that you should be warned. What will become of the place I cannot say, and dare not think of." "And this pestilence?" "Is small-pox, in its worst and most virulent form. You may well shudder. If you saw the sights I have seen to-day, your very heart would be sick within you." "Do you mean to say you have actually been with the people who are ill?" "Yes; but don't be frightened. I don't think I can do you any harm; and I have had the disease in its mildest form, so I am quite safe. But, 0 Marian! to find, as I found to-day, a whole family lying ill, and to know that nearly every one of them must die! It is a hard sight, and yet I suppose that God knows best, or He would not send such a scourge upon us. One needs all their faith in a time like this." "Do you think the disease will spread much?" asked Marin. "Spread!-it is spreading now in every diree- rection. The people are terribly frightened, and the doctors are busy by night and by day. You have been vaccinated, my dear; but I asked Dr. Henry to call here to-night on his way home. An ouace of prevention is better than a pound of cure any day, and especially at a time like this." Marian gazed wistfully toward the village, that looked so peaceful and pleasant in the light of the setting sun. "Who would think, that disease and death were lurking there?" she said. ' O child! It is like many things in this world-fair enough outside, but full of all man- ner of evil within." "But how did the disease come?" "Who can tell? It is raging in London with even greater violence ; but a dozen 'peoplo are   not missed there as they will be here. I am so sorry for those poor Hydes." "Where do they live?" "In yonder cottage-the Moor Cottage', as it is called." g "Oh, I know. I can se'e thehouse bywalking a little way upthe road." "Yes; but for Heaven's sake don't go too near the place tillyou haveseen Dr. Henry. I would not go in myself to-day, for fear of giving you infection. Ionly put the things I had brought in at the window, and ran away; but after Dr. Henry has been here, I must go down and see if I can do anything for the poor creatures. I am sure I wish Miss Moyell were not coming home with so many visitors. In the first place, there is the danger to be considered; and in the second, who can attend properly to the wants of a party of gay young people, when so many human beings are dying on every side?" "I dont think Leonora will trouble herself much about that," remarked Marian. "Perhaps not.  Young people are very thoughtless till their owi. tarn comes. Besides, if all I hear is true, she has quite enough to take away her thoughts from the dead any dy- ing." "What do you mean P" "It is said she is going to be married." "Who to?" "I don't know the gentleman's name; but he is very rich, and a baronet." "Oh, then she will take him, depend upon it Is he coming with her?" "I suppose so!" "Then I shall have a look at him. I can scarcely fancy Leonora a bride-elect; but I sup- pose she will play the part well enough. 'I wonder if she  has quite forgotten Philip Vere." "O my  dear child, have I not begged you I never to mention his name here?"  "  But she is away now, so it can't hurt M her." "  I feel as if the very walls had ears, when that i man's name is in question "' "  Was he so terrible, then?" "A bad man-a very bad man!" said Mrs. e Pryor, as she turned to go into the house. i I sincerely trust you may never meet one like ( Lim '" Marian, left alone again, gazed out on the a dusty road, with a smile. "Dear old lady! I wonder what she would v say if she knew that her evil spirit in person had been hanging over this very gate, and talk-  ing to me half the afternoon t Her gray wig s would stand on end with horror!" She unfastened the gale, and strolled up the i road in the direction which Mr. Vere had taken. Tho Moor Cottage, which was at that moment fl the aboe bodof pestilence, and misery, and death, h stood full in front of her, butf more than a quai  sl   lo ter of a mile away. She gazed at its closed doors and windows, with a morbid sense of curi. osity. If I could do it without any danger to my- self," she thought, "how I should like to enter g that little home, and see how they are bearing that awful trial! What a place it must be! r Ugh I I could not live in such a house to save d my own life-much less theirs!" u  A step came up the road behind her. She t turned, and saw Rose Martin with a letter-bask-  et on her arm. I At first she frowned and turned away, as if a she did not choose to speak. But the girl stop- e ped just in front of her, with a face so anxious, a and yet so full of tenderness, that she had not e the heart to preserve that rigid silence. "Well, Rose, what is it?"she asked. I ram so glad to meet you, Miss Marian! I looked for you when I came by the Pleasaunce. f I wanted to speak to you so much." What about?" "About Lord Mountchayne." And her soft cheek grew crimson, and her eyes drooped and filled with tears. -   "What have you to say of him that I can hear 2" "If you would only have a little pity for me, and a little faith in him, I am sure that you would say there was no harm in our meetings." "Nonsense, Rose 1" "I am speaking the truth, Miss Marian. Oh, do trust me! I do not care what other people think or say of me; but I cannot bear to lose your friendship." "Well, I will think of it," said Marian, touched by her simple earnestness. "Where are you going with that basket?" "To see some of the poor people who are ill with fever. I have called at one or two cottages already, and left jelly, and fruit, and wine; and now I am going to the Moore Cottage to see the Hydes. Poor things I they are all down together, and they have only one old woman from the workhouse to wait upon them. It is very sad-is it not?" Marian did not answer. Her evil genius stood beside her, and her soul was trembling in the balance between a hideous sin and a gen- erous deed. A mocking whisper seemed to ring in her ear: "That ugly little thing 1" and '  the plainest woman I ever knew!" as she gazed on the pale but perfect face of the girl who stood beside her. "Good-bye, Miss Marian," said the gentle voice. "I am so much happiernow that have seen you." And her hand was taken in a timid, yet lov- ing clasp. She wrenched it passionately away. Rose flushed deeply, and sighed; then dropped a humble courtesy, and passed on. A terrible struggle was being waged in Marian's heart.    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6472-00000038"/> At one moment, pity urged her to speed after the poor young creature, and rescue her from her danger; the next, pride, and anger, and jealousy held her back, and whispered that she would take no harm. While she debated and argued with herself, Rose had crossed the colt- mon, and knocked at the cottage door. It opened; and Marian thought she heard a low laugh, like Philip Vere's, in the shrubbery be- hind her. "Come back! come back! Don't go there!" she shrieked, starting off at full speed. But it was too late. Rose had entered, and the door was shut: and with it every ray of hope was shut out from her guilty soul., She knew then, better than words could teach her, how a murderer must feel. CHAPTER XXVI. A PLEASANT EVENING PARTY. "Oh, snatch'd away in beauty's bloom, On thee shall press no ponderous tomb; But on thy turf shall roses rear Their leaves, the earliest of the year; And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom! And oft by yon blue gushing stream Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head, And feed deep thought with many a dream, And lingering, pouse, and lightly tread, Fond wretch! as if her step disturb'd the dead!" -BYBON. SomeAays passed by. Lady Theodosia had returned from town, blooming, and brilliant, and happy; and the appointed time for the 'marriage was close at hand. Miss Moyell did not visit the Pleasaunce on the day appointed, for there was a grand concert at the Priory, with Italian singers from town, whom she was anxious to hear. She had one or two other reasons for remaining also, which were these. In the first place, among the guests whom she had invited to the Pleasaunce, and who were to return with her to the Priory to witness the marriage, was one whom  constant and lover-like attention had made some impres- sion upon her ambitious heart. He was old enough to be her grandfather, and ugly and disagreeable in the bargain, it is true; but he was a rich baronet; and, if she married him, she would walk in silk attire, and be "mv lady", and that was a sufficient bait. Lucy, being young and simple, regarded him wilh horror; Caroline was wiser in her day and gen- eration, and strongly urged her sister to accept him, should she have an opportunity of doing so. "What if his teeth are yellow?" that saga- cious young person asked. "H is as rich as a Jew, and can be twirled round your finger, if you care to take the pains to manage him. Marry him, by all means, dear Leonora, and then ask us down to your place in Sussex, and we shall all be as happy as the day is long." Leonora fully intended to follow this advice; and, in the meantime, she encouraged her anti-   quated lover with the sweetest of smiles and looks, and wondered, drearily in her heart the while, what Philip, Vere would say when lie heard of it all. She little thought how near he was to her, or --h1ow great an influence he was silently exerting over the destinies of some of the people around her. That something was wrong, she saw; and she had womanly curiosity enough to try and find out what it was. The bride-elect looked merry enough, but the bridegroom seemed wo- fully out of-tune, and stalked about the house with a face as dark and moody as if he had just committed a murder, and was at a loss how to dispose of the body. In addition to this, he was absent sometimes for half a day; and, on one occasion, he was in town from Wednesday till the following Monday, without giving the slightest explanation of his movements when he returned. Lord Revere looked worried, and Lady Revere sad: and in the manner of both toward their wayward son was visible a kind of anxious, deprecatory tenderness that puzzled the attentive watcher exceedingly. They seem- ed to take such thought for Mountchayne; they averted so carefully from his path everything that might, by any chance, cause an explosion of any kind, that their very anxiety persuaded Miss Moyell that the explosion would take place at any moment. Then, again, Lady Theodosia, though on the most easy terms with all the rest of the party, seemed constrained and stiff whenever her affi- anced lover approacled her. If he entered the room suddenly, her eyes sought his face anx- iously, as if she dreaded to hear bad tidings. Ii he sat apart from the gay groups in the evening, with a look of weariness and dissatis- faction upon his face, her own reflected it in a strange degree; and if by chance they were forced into a tte.- tate, it proved anything but a pleasant one, to judge from the look of chn- grin and relief with vhich each escaped from it. Leonora remembered her own stormy wooing, and the days of doubt, and indecision, and anx- iety that preceded that terrible one when she found herself deceived, and deserted, and dis- graced by the man she loved. Could it be that Lady Thaeodosia, who was as proud as Lucifer before his fall, was about to ufidergo a similar trial? She hugged herself at the thought, and watched on. Lady Theodosia haaa never in- curred her special animosity-they were too much alike for that; but still the misfortunes of our friends are very dear to us, and especial- ly if they 'in any way resemble our own. Ii Lady Theodosia were left alone at the altar, as Leonora Moyell had been, the unpleasantness of the thing would be quite taken away. It is not exactly comfortable to stand in the pillory to be pelted with rotten eggs; but if a coroucl- ed head is ducking beside yours, to escape the unsavory greeting, it puts quite a different face   upon the matter-that is in the easily-dazzled eyes of * a true Briton." There really seemed some ground for Leono- ra's suspicions. She felt half inclined at one time to seek Lady Theodosia's confidence, and give her a hint or two; but that young person encouraged po such stretch of the prerogatives of friendship. She looked fidgety, and ner- vous, and preoccupied, but still she would make no confident, unless it was her French maid. And so the time went on; and Leonora could only wait and watch for that denouement which she was persuaded must come ere long. Tableaux were one of the favorite amuse- ments of the guests at the Priory, and Lady Theodosia generally took a very active part in them. One evening, after an unusually dull day, she proposed that the great hall should be lit, and that they should all dress and adjourn there to rehearse a grand historic picture, which they werd to represent before a select audience of the neighboring gentry during the coming week. Leonora, who was to represent Joan of Are, and the Maid of Saragossa, and several other intrepid damsels of other days, besides giving the dying scene of Queen Bess upon crimson-velvet cushions artistically arranged, was delighted with the proposal. and hurried away at once to her own room to prepare her wardrobe. Coming back soon afterward throuigh a long, dim corridor, on her way to the hall, she was startled by seeing two figures clasped in each other's arms at the extremity of the pas- sage. "One of the housemaids keeping an appoint- ment with John, the footman," she thought, and drew back into the obscurity, till the inter- view should end. "At eleven, precisely," the man's voice said; and his companion answered: "I will not fail-you. But, for Heaven's sake, be cautious,'and don't let any one suspect us." ; Trust me for that, my darling!' was the re- ply- Then there was the unmistakable sound of a kiss, and the parties separated. The female glided past Leonora with a noiseless step; and she almost uttered a cry of surprise, when she  caught a glnpse of her face. Itwas Lady The- odosia Monmouth! Who was' her companion? Leonora bent eagerly forward to see. It was not Lord Mountchayne; it was an older and a  taller nan. But it was too dark for her to see i his face. She only noticed, as he passed down t the stairs, that he limped slightly with one foot. i Now, no one at the Priory was a cripple except I Lord Revere, and lie only when he had an ob- v stinate fit of the gout. But certainly he could not be holding clandestine interviews, and kiss- s ing Lady Theodosia, in the back passage of his 1 own house. With her head full of this strange incident,   I' Miss Moyell went down to the great hall. Many of the actors, a l,] all of the spectators. - ere there. Presently Lady Tlheodosia ap- peared, smiling and unruffled, and the amuse- ment of the evening commenced. i  Divers were the blunders Miss Moyell made in her own parts. Joan of Are looked at the floor when she should have been gazing at the sky. The Maid of Saragossa forgot that she held a lighted match, and bliste ed all her fingers with it; and Queen Bess, who should have been writhing in anguish on her clslhions,'sat bolt upright, with her eyes fixed on the hall-clock, which pointed to the five minutes before eleven. "What ails you?" cried several of the actors, as the curtain fell. ",You look as if you were asleep and dreaming." t "And I am, I think; or, rather, I ought to be," said Miss Moyell, as Lady Theodosia en- tered, wearing the scarf and snood of-a Scotch lassie. "Oh, what a shame!" she cried, glancing round the group. "You are all in costume for the wedding of Henry the Eighth, and I have got myself up at vast trouble and expense, tor the bride of young Lochinvar, and where is he?" "It is quite a mistake," said several of the gentlemen. "We thought this picture came next. But Mountchayne has on a Scotch dress. I saw him just now; he was Rob Roy, or some- thing of that sort, in the gathering of the clans." "It was not Mountchayne who played Rob Roy. It was Signor Florenti," said a lady. "Ah! who called me?  I have the great honor to present myself," said a low voice; and a tall handsome Italian, wearing a Scotch dress,. came from the back of the stage. He limped. slightly as he walked. A dozen voices explained to him what was. required. He smiled and bowed affably, tookl his place, and the curtain rose. When it fell, Lady Theodosia complained of thirst. Let me get you a glass of lemonade," said- Lochinvar. She bowed, and he led her away- toward the rcfreshment room, whil6 the last. group took their place upon the stage. Leonora saw it all, and guessed the sequel. Laughing inwardly at the terrible' confusion which must soon ensue, she was outwardly as grave as a judge; and after going through her part, she joined LadyRevere in thessmall draw- ing-room that opened from the hall, and began to give her an account of-the party which she intended to give at the Pleasaunce, whncu the bride and bridegroom had returned from their wedding-tour. "It is really very kind of you, my dear," said her ladyship, waking up into sumetlnm  like interest; " and between you and me, I isw-\ tWe wedding were all over." "Yes; all this noise and confusion must tirae    <pb n="72 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000039"/> you sadly." "Oh, it is not that. I should not mind the confusion, if-" Leonora awaited the coming confidence most discreetly. "If they cared more for each other, my dear I I may as well own the truth. I am not pleased with either of them. Francis is so absent and so moody." "Is there any reason for it?" "Ah! that is the very question I wished to ask you." "6Me?" "Yes; that dreadful cousin of yours 1" "Marian?" "Do you really think he cared for her?" "Impossible!" "He gave her up willingly enough; but then one never knows what a man really thinks or feels. I sometimes fear that he visits her still." "Oh, impossible!" said Miss Moyell, again. "Why so?" "Because Mrs. Pryor is there." "Well?" "If anything of that kind was going on she would lose no time in informing me." "You are quite sure of that?" "Quite." "Then, my dear, if he don't visit the Plea- saunce, where does he go?" "How can I say? But hush! Here he is!" Lord Mountchayne, at this moment, entered the room, with Sir Antony Rossiter, Leonora's ancient admirer, leaning on his arm. "You are responsible for this intrusion, my dear Miss Moyell," he said,; courteously. "Sir Antony could not rest till he had inquired after Queen Elizabeth." "Sir Antony is too good, for-I know I acted horribly!". said Miss Moyell, making room for him beside her, with a smile. '* The truth is, I was thinking of something else all the while." "Of me, I hope?" said Sir Antouy, gallantly. "These tableaux are really very pretty things." "The best we ever had was that of Rebecca and Rowena," said Miss Moyell, anxious to bring the conversation round to Lady Theodosia. She was rewarded for her ruse by seeing Lord Mount- chayne start and color. "Oh, poor Rose Martin!" said Lady Revere, languidly. "She made a very pretty Rowena; but her day for that is over now 1" "What do you mean by that?" said her son, looking up so eagerly that a new light flashed upon Leonora's black eyes at once. Here, per- haps, was the key to his absence and coldness. How stupid she had been not to think of it be- fore! Lady Revere looked startled. "Mean, Francis?. Why, have you not heard the news?" "No. What'news   Tell me, quick!"   "The small-pox is raging in the village." "I know it." "And Rose Martin has taken it." "O my God!" The young man sank into a chair, and clasp- ed his hands over his face. His mother sat look. ing at him with consternation. Sir Antony stared. Miss Moyell was the only one who re- tained her presence of mind, and she went and shut the door. Lady Revere thanked her with a look, and then turned to her son again. "Is she very ill?" he murmured. "Very ill, indeed. The doctor thinks she cannot survive." "And I am here, taking part in these cursed tomfooleries, while poor Rose lies on her death- bed!" he cried, starting up. "Poor Rose!" said Lady Revere, rising also. "What is she to you, Francis?" He laughed wildly. "You may well ask that!" "Answer me!" "She is everything to me!" "This to your mother?" "Why not?" "That wretched girl-" "Stop " he cried. "You don't know what you are saying!" "Alas, I know too well 1" "No one shall say a word against her in my hearing!" "How can you prevent them from doing so." "By telling the truth 1 She is my wife, moth- er-my legal wife!" Lady Revere screamed, and sank back upon the sofa. Miss Moyell hastened to her side. "Bear up!" she said. "Don't let any one else hear this." "You are a true friend, my dear! O you un- happy boy, how can you stand there, and say such a thing to me?"   A "It is the truth!" persisted Mountchayne. "I was married in London by a clergyman of the Church of England, and I can show you the certificate this instant, if you like. Whatever Rose's birth may have been. she is Lady Mount- chayne now, as much as you are Lady Re- vere!" "Oh, where is Lord Revere? Why don't lie come to me?" cried her ladyship, helplessly. "What shall we do? What will people say? And O Lady Theodosia I how can I ever look her in the face again?" There came a great knocking at the door. Leonora ran to open it, and admitted Lord Re- vere, whose face was purple with anger and mor- tification. "A pretty business this is to happen in my house l" he exclaimed. "We shall be the laughing-stock of the country; and it is all your fault, Sir-entirely your fault. She says so." ' Who says so?" asked Lord Mountohayne, looking bewildered.      <pb n="-73" xml:id="VAC6472-00000040"/> "Lady Theodosia. Pray, have you seen her to-night?" ' Yes-no-I don't know!   I believe I am going mad!" answered the young man, distract- edly pressing his hands upon his forehead. "It is about time, Sir, after disgracing your- self and me so publicly, By heavens! if you were any other man than my own son, I'd call you out before morning!" "But what have I done to make you so an- gry?" ' Done? Everything   Read that letter, Sir, and feel ashamed of yourself, if you can 1" Lord Mountohayne took the epistle from his father's hand. As he glanced over its contents, ,he bit his lips, and smiled. In spite of all the confusion and distress of the moment, he could not help laughing at the contents. The indignant father snatched it away, and thrust it into his wife's hand, "He has the impertinence to stand and grin over it, graceless puppy that he is!" he shout- ed.  "Read that, Madam, and see if you find it as amusing as lie does!" It was a letter from Lady Theodosia,and ran thus: "DEA UNCLE:-As Lord Mountchayne not only hates me, but takes every opportunity of telling me so, by his words in private and his actions in public, I think it best to stop where I am, before the farce ends with a tragedy; and so I have gone away with one who loves me truly, and you will hear no more from me till I have the right to sign myself "Your affectionate niece, "THEODOSIA FLOBENTI." "The Italian!" gasped Lady Revere in a faint voice. "He played Lochinvar with her just now,-and they have made a real elopement of it Oh, what will the world say?" And the fatal letter dropped from her hand, and she went into a fit of hysterics, which speedily brought every one in the hall around her. CHAPTER XXVII. THE RUBICON. "For he through sin's long labyrinth had run, Nor made atonement where he did amiss; Had sighed to many, though he loved but one, And that loved one, alas! could ne'er be his. Ah! happy she to 'scape from him whose kiss Had been pollution unto aught so chaste ; Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste, Nor calm domestic'peace had ever deigned to taste." -BYRON. All was confusion at the Priory. Lady Re- vere was ill; Lord Revere had stormed himself into a frightful fit of the gout, on hearing of his son's marriage; the guests had departed, and the whole country was wondering, talking, and laughing over the strange event. Miss Moyell made her appearance unexpedt- edly at the Pleasaunce, with her guests. It was not in human nature to refrain from discussing the mighty scandal; and Marian, though she   staid but a few minutes in the drawing-room after their arrival, beard quite enough to terrify her. She sought out the good housekeeper, who was busy in the kitchen. "Mrs. Pryor," she said nervously, "have you heard this extraordinary tale they are all so full of?"  "About my Lord and Rose Martin? Yes." "And do you believe it?" "Not I? It's a great deal too romantic. Those sort of things only happen in books; you never bear of them in real life. Depend upon it, he was only joking with the people when he told them so?"  "Would he dare do that?"  "One never knows what such flighty creatures as young men may take it into their head to do. It is a great shame, though. And there is that' poor thing dying I What she wanted to go into that cottage for, I cannot imagine? Any one might have told her how dangerous it was. Poor thing! she will never be May Queen again. I am going to see her after dinner. Will you go?" "I? Not for the world!" said Marian, shrinking back with a look of horror. "Oh, I forgot; you are afraid of the disease, Well, poor thing, she will never know who comes to see her now; but still I want to know that she is comfortable and well cared for. How sad it seems!" The good soul wiped her eyes, and Marian slunk away. Taking her hat, she went out through the garden-gate, and, skirting the vil- lage, went in the direction of the gipsy camp. She was doing what she had never dreamed any earthly power could tempt her to do-she was seeking, of her own accord, an interview with Philip Vere. For more than an hour she waited in vain. At last she spied him coming leisurely up the lane with a cigar in his mouth. He was alone; and when he saw her he lifted his hat with a mocking smile that sent the hot blood to her cheek. "At last I I have watched and waited for you each evening lately, and in vain. But I knew that you would come, and I was very patient." "How did you know that?" she asked, haughtily. "By putting. two and two together, my dear. If people get themselves of their own accord. into a deuce of a scrape, they generally grasp eagerly-at the first hand that offers to extricate them from it. In this case the hand happens to be mine." "I am in no scrape, that I am aware of," said Marian, indifferently. Mr. Vere elevated his eyebrows. "  No I You must have a conscience made out of gutta-pereha, then. 'Perhaps I have." "And are you satisfied with your work?"    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6472-00000041"/> "W\ith what work?" "You are over modest, my dear. T refer to a little interview which took place between you and Rose Martin some time ago." "You saw that?" she said, with a look of quiet desperation. "I did; I see everything that you do, my angel. If ever you are tried for man-or rath- er for womanslaughter, my evidence would be invaluable to you. I don't know that I'should stick at a little perjury, even, to serve you." "I don't think you would." "But here, in this lonely place, I may be permitted to say that it was a most masterly thought." "Suggested by you." He looked at her with an air of innocent sur- prise. "You must be dreaming. How could I sug- gest it? If you had told me what you were going to do, I could have informed you of the uselessness of sudh a proceeding, since I knew well that they were married!" "You knew it?" "Certainly I did." "It is as I thought," she said, bitterly. "You tempted me to commit this crime; and now that it is committed, you taunt me with the very thing that would have saved me, had I known it in time." "Bah! you have been reading novels!" said Mr. Vere, with a slight smile. "There is al- ways somebody or something that might have prevented something else in those three-volume absurdities. But as for this case, did I tell you to send the poor girl into the pest-house?" Marian shuddered. "Have you heard how she is?" "Can't live!" he said, coolly flecking the ash from his cigar. ",And I have killed her!" "The state of the ease, my fair friend!" "How can you talk of it like that?" she said, in an agony of despair. "Oh! if I might but go back to that dreadful day, I would gladly expose myself to the danger, so that she might be alive and well again." "That is just it! We are always repenting of our misdeeds when it is too late!' "You laugh at me! You would not-you could not, if you only knew what a hell my life has been since I let her go into that cot. tage!"  Mr. Vere blew a curl of smoke gracefully from his lips. "Take things easy," he suggested. "You'll tear yourself to tatters, and turn into an old woman before your time, if you go on like that." "Oh, how heartless you are!" He laughed. ' Are you just finding that out?" "But what am I to do? I can't stay here; I shall go mad if I do!'   His eyes lit, but still he smoked on tran- quilly. "s Lord Mountehayne with   her?" sh asked. "Not he! Do you think he would risk his beauty there? He talkes the physician's ad- vice, and avoids all danger, under pretence of nursing his mother, who has never got over Lady Theodosia's flight. Aplucky youngwom- an that! I laughed till I cried when I heard of it!" Marian did not answer. She stood looking upon the ground with a hopeless, despairing glance. He threw away his cigar, and spoke in a different tone directly. "'Now, my dear, let us understand each other. Lady Theodosia has run away-Lord Mountehavne is married-his wife is dying- you have killed her-the whole neighborhood is in an uproar, and there is the devil to pay, generally. I am going to town to-night. A fast horse, harnessed to a light trap, waits for about a mile away. If you like to go with me, and escape all this mess, you have only to say the word, and I will take you with the greatest pleasure. You need not be afraid to go. I shall not run away with you for love, but for interest. And as the sooner you are Mrs. Vere, the sooner I begin to benefit by your sweet presence; why, the ring shall be on your finger by ten o'clock to-morrow morning by the latest, and then all your troubles about this cursed place will be at an end! There is my offer- you are only to give me your answer. A plain yes or no is all I ask." Alas, poor Marian! Like Cain, a mark was set upon her, and she must be a wanderer and an exile upon the face of the earth for ever. The past was dark and stormy; the future looked darker and stormier still, yet she did not hesitate long. With a heavy sigh, she turned to Philip Vere. "I will go with you," she said. He bent down and kissed her cheek. Then placing her cold hand upon his arm, he led her silently away. CHAPTER XXVIII. "He takei the hand,I give not, nor withhold- Its pulse nor cheoled-nor'quickened-calmly cold, And when resigned, it drops a lifeless weight From one I never loved enough to hate. No warmth-these lips return by his imprest, And chilled remembrance shudders o'er the rest. Yes-had I ever proved that passion's zeal, The change to hatred were at least to feel: But still lie goes unmriourned-returns unsought- And oft whcn prasent, absent from my thought.  Or when rellection comes-and come it must- I fear that henceforth 'twill but bring disgust; I am Ins slave-but, in despite of pride, 'Twere v orse than bondage to become his bride." -BYaON.  It seemed to Marian, in her excited state, that that walk of a quarter of a mile lasted for ages. They reached the place at last. A horse and   gig, were in readiness there, and a sharp-looking man-servant was in attendance, He came for- ward, and touched his hat when he saw his mas- ter, but never glanced toward Iarian, who stood a little apart, pale, grave, and silent. "All right, Simmonds?" 'asked Mr. Vere. "All right, Sir." "No one knows that I have left the camp?" "Not as yet, Sir." "A precious row there will be when it is found out, or I am much mistaken!" he muttered, with a smile. Then, turning to Marian with an air of the greatest deference, he offered her his hand. "Shall I help you in?" "No, thank you." And she seated herself in the trap, without his assistance. "Please yourself, my dear, and you will al- ways please me!" he arswered, gravely, seating himself beside her. "Now, Simmonds, give us the reins, and mind you come up by the next train ; for I shall want you as a witness." "I will take care to be there. Good night, Sir." "Good night. Give her her head!" The servant stepped aside, and they whirled away. The horse was a strong black cob, who, without any preliminary flourishes or capers, laid back his ears, put down his head, and set about doing his work in good earnest. "A good one to go-worth his weight in gold, -very bit of it," said Mr. Vere., approvingly. ; Are you a judge of horses, my dear?" "No." "But you like them, I hope?" "Yes." "That is right. If you only have a tender reeling for the delightful animals, the rest is easy anough to learn, and I shall have you fit to pass an examination as a member of the turf in a lit- tle while." She did not answer. "Do you object to smoking?" he asked, after a moment's silence. "Have I your permission to light a cigar?' "Yes." He availed himself of it, struck a light, and was soon puffing vigorously away. A horrible inclination to laugh seized upon Marian, to which she could not help yielding. Was ever such an elopement heard of before?" The same thought seemed to strike Mr. Vere. He took his cigar from his lips, and gave a quiet little chuckle. "For two lovers, who are running away with each other in this most romantic fashion, it strikes me that we are remarkably discreet," he observed. "Very." "What can be the reason of our good behav- ior, I wonder?" "I can't say."   , "I is a lovely night. I begin to feel quite poetical. I wonder, if I put my arm around your waist, what effect it would have!" He tried the experiment as he spoke.  He might as well have embraced a log of wood. "Humph! IS there no feeling in you?" "Not for you." The words escaped from her lips before sle thought what she was going to say; nor was she sorry the next moment that she had uttered them. After all, what did it matter if he knew she hated him? One day he must learn it-as well now as then! He did not seem particularly grieved by the blunder she had made. He was silent for a mo- ment or two, then he begal to laugh. "Well, no one ever knows what may happen to him before he dies. I never expected to go and get married in this fashion; but 1 suppose it is all the same in the long run." And he began to sing: '"Oh, who will o'er the downs so free, Oh, who will with me ride? Oh, who will up and follow me, To win a blooming bride 2' Your case and hers are not precisely alike, by the way," he remarked. "( The lady in the bal- lad could not have run away with so little fuss and trouble as you have done: - "' Her father he has locked the door, Her mother keeps the key; But neither bolts nor bars shall hide My own true love from me!'  He really sang very well; but Marian scarce- ly seemed to listen to his song. "A very enthusiastic young gentleman, that, I should say. If he had lived to my age, he would have found out that it really makes very little difference whether you marry a grandmo- ther or her grand-daughter, except for the look of the thing. Are you cold, my dear 1" "Not at all." "Because I have an extra coat at your serv- ice, if you wish for it." "No, thanJk you." "A penny for your thoughts, Marian." "They are not worth it." "None of the pleasantest, I supposer?" No." "Well, never mind. Everything comes to an end in this world-that is the best thing one can say of it. And there are the station-lights be- fore us. Look as much like Mrs. Vere as you possibly can, will you, my love?" If to look like Mrs. Vere was to present an as- pect of the most woebegone kind, she certainly obeyed him well. The station-master stared at her inquisitively, as she alighted from the trap, and allowed Mr. Vere to escort her into the la- dies' room. He knew her well, and fancied that something strange must have happened to ac- count for her appearance there at such an houz and in such company. But it was not his busi- ness to ask questions; and so he held his tongue    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6472-00000042"/> and did not go near the room, where she sat, miserable and fearful, hoping against hope, that something might still happen that would pre- vent the catastrophe which loomed blackly close at hand. Nothing happened. Nothing ever does han- pen in those awful hours when a human soul hangs trembling in the balance between good and evil! The train came, punctual to a minute. Mar- ian was handed to a carriage by her attentive escort, and they were soon on their way to Lon- don. There was no escape for her now-she must go on, no matter what horrors were before her! With a slight apology for his rudeness, Mr. Vere composed himself in his corner, and went placidly to sleep. She sat by the other window, looking out at the black night through which they were whirling on. It was a fit type of the life she was doomed to live with him. I suppose every man or woman is nervous on the night before their marriage. It is such a breaking up of old ties, which are certain, for new ones, which look, to say the least of it, ex- ceedingly doubtful and precarious just at that moment-that-the lightest heart and giddiest head must bow beneath the weight of thought, and wonder vaguely what awaits them in the new existence upon whicl they are to enter. Mr. Vere, as we have seen, slept placidly, in spite of the approaching change. But he was different from his fellows, in that he had no feel- ing of any kind. He would have gone to be hung with the same composure with which he  went to be married; and would have looked up- on the one act much as he looked upon the other  -as a thing which was to be, and which no weak  scruples or misgivings of his own could alter.  But poor Marian, with her heart full of love for Lord Mountchayne--ofremorse for Rose, and of abhorrence for himself-was really to be pit 1 ied. The wildest thoughts shot through her  brain, as she sat watching him. What if she I sprung upon him as he slept, twisted that slight d handkerchief tightly round his throat, and hurl- t ed him from the window, or the door? Who f would know that it had not been an accident?  She smiled at her own madness for the next few I moments, and then she sighed. It was a horri- ii ble dream, from which she vainly strove to w rouse herself. She must go on, and dream it through to the end; which might-nay, which s must be, misery, and infamy, and shame! So b much the better, if that end came very speed- h ily! On, through the silent night, they sped. At s( last the gray dawn broke, and showed the roofs of city houses. They glided on more slowly; V then the train began to jerk from side to side, w and Mr. Vere opened his eyes.-      lo "I thought I knew those confounded curves!" c he exclaimed, as they glided softly into a large az   t, station, roofed overhead. "My dear Marian, I at beg a thousand pardons for having slept all the e- way up. But I shall be wide awake enough now, se for here we are in London!'  CHAPTER XXIX.

' -BYRoN. r  They entered Mr. Vere's lodgings through an infinity of streets, stopping at last before a large and imposing looking house in one of the t western squares. It was some time before they could obtain admittance; but at last a sleepy servant-girl opened the door, rubbing her eyes, and looking grievously injured at having had to leave her bed. Her look of inquiry, however, changed to one of open-mouthed astonishment when she saw who had summoned her. a "  LQr', Mr. Vere!" she exclaimed, staring at Marian, "  whatever will the Missis say?" "  Go tell her I am here, there's a good girl," said Mr. Vere, rather nervously. "  Ask her to get up, and come down to my room.   Here, cab!" He threw the man half-a-orown, and offered his hand to Marian, who stood on the steps, looking down the street with the strangest ex- pression upon her face. She was debating in her own mind whetherit would not be better to dash down that silent square, claim the protee- tion of some friendly policeman, and so get free for ever from  this accursed slavery, that was already beginning to eat to her very heart    But she had no money. The thought came just in time, and she followed Mr.-Vere up the stairs with a heavy sigh. Ah me I that want of money. I have known some of the finest schemes in the world utterly blasted by the want of two pounds ten I And here the lack of that same paltry sum forced Marian into a line of conduct which her very soul abhorred I The room into which she was ushered by Mr. Vere did not remove the dislike to the place which had taken root in her mind. It waa a long, high apartment, with carved ceilings and cornices, the showiest of furniture, and ' abund- anoe of gilding, wherever it was possible for it   to offend the eye. There was a gilded mirror over the fireplace, and a gilded clock beneath it; gilded pictures upon the walls, gilded rods to the curtains, gilded backs to the chairs, and gilded claws to the sofas. There were three or four tables covered with knicknacks scattered up and down the room, and as many easy-chairs be- side them. There were three sofas, and a gild- ed guitar, that reposed on its back in one cor- ner. Great staring windows looked out upon the street; a dirty ornament of cut paper filled the grate. The dust had settled thickly on every- thing, and the London blacks were flying all about. It was all dreary, comfortless, and wretch- ed, and far more like a private saloon at a flashy music hall, than a quiet, respectable apartment, which was to form the centre of a happy home. Marian walked up and down the room, feel ing strongly tempted to knock her head against the wall, and so make an end of it. Mr. Vore stood upon the hearth-rug, with his hands clasped behind him, watching her with a sardonic smile. "How do you like your new home, Marian?" This place?" she asked. "Yes." "I never was in such a horrible room in my life before." ' How very odd! Most people admire the apartments exceedingly; and I can tell you this -they amount up to a pretty sum in the course of a year. Four guineas a week I pay for this room, the dining-room, and the chamber over- head." "If you paid me four guineas a week, I would not live here!" said Marian, quickly. "Why not, my love?? "Do you suppose any one born and brought up in the country could live in this stifling air? Or that any one with the least love of neatness in their nature could endure this?" and she traced a line upon the dirty table with the point of her finger. "  Oh, that can soon be remedied! My land- lady did not know I was coming." "That is no excuse for her. No woman, with any respect for herself or her house, would let it get into such a state." "Don't be hard upon the poor soul. She will i be a great friend to you." "She need not take the trouble; I know I E shall hate her."  Mr. Vere smiled serenely.        a "You are a little perverse, my love. You E are tired with your journey, perhaps, and you v want your breakfast. So do I. And as I hear i my landlady on the stairs, I will just step out, a and see what she can get for us."  'He suited the action to the word; and the 1 next instant Marian heard a shrill " Mon Dieu,  Mr. Philip, I am so glad!" followed by a quiek  r"Hush!" and a whispered colloquy between t the two. It lasted a long while, and in the f meantime she sat upon the sofa with flashing a   *r eyes and burning cheeks. Oh, how crushei;, h how humiliated she felt just at that momentl s These horrible rooms, that disagreable man, and now this dreadful- woman--it was almost too r much to bear! The door was thrown open, and Mr. Vete en. - tered, followed by the mistress of the house. "Here, mv love, is Madame Angelo," he said. "She will take care of you till it is time to go to the clergyman.', Marian raised her eyes. A stout, bold look. ing woman of forty, wearing a false front and 1 rouge, even at that early hour, stood before her, - simpering and bowing, with her hands clasped r upon her heart.  One look was quite enough , for the girl. She hated her, just as she said she should do. "Dear me, Miss, this is a pleasure!" she t said, in a soft, wheedling voice. "I never e thought Mr. Vere would marry, and I amn so proud to think he has brought his bride to my house the first thing! Shall I show you up- stairs, Miss? You must be very tired" i "Yes," said Marian, glad toescape ; I should like to lie down a little while." "And while you are resting my love, I will see to your breakfast, and make all things ready for the ceremony," said Mr. Vere. She did not answer him, but followed the woman up-stairs. She threw open the door of a large bedroom, handsomely furnished, yet wearing the same look of tawdry discomfort which characterized the apartments down stairs, and bowed to Marian, with a significant smile. "Mr. Vere's own room, Miss. You will be perfectly quiet here." "  Is there no other?" "No, Miss; we'have other lodgers, and the house is quite full. But no one will come here, and you can lock the door, and be as quiet as a mouse till breakfast is ready." "That will do, then." The woman withdrew, and Marian turned the key in the lock with a little unnecessary em- phasis. ".His room!" she said, with a shudder of dis- gust; "and mine in future! Oh, how I hate it already!"   ' The mantelpiece was littered over with letters and cards. She glanced at them with a con- temptuous smile-looked at the Venus Reposing and the Diana Surprised, and some other en- gravings in the same style, which hung upon the walls, and then sat down with an impatient groan ina chair before the toilet-table, and glanced at herself in the glass. How pale and ugly, and, above all, how melancholy and despairing she looked! Well she might-well she might! And with another groan, she. dropped her head upon her folded arms, and closed her eyes. Ut. terly exhausted in mind and body as she was, five minutes had scarcely passed before she was sound asleep.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6472-00000043"/> She was roused from her uneasy slumber by the sound of voices in the next room. They were low and cautious, but the walls were thin, and she could not help hearing every word. It was Madame Angelo who was speaking. "Well, live and learn," she said, with a low laugh. "But I should never have dreamed that you, of all men on earth, would have gone and done such a tiing." "No man knows what may happen to him before he dies " was the reply. Marian recog- nized the voice-it was that of Mr. Vere. "When I said I would die a bachelor, I never thought to live to be married; but, for all that, heie is my wedding-day." ' And your lovely bride," sneered his com. panion. "And my lovely bride, exactly. With your usual penetration, X ou have discovered that she is beautiful and bewitching." The woman laughed. "I believe you would go to the scaffold with a joke on your lips, Philip." "Well, why not?"' "Come now, tell me what all this means?" she said, in a caressing tone. "I know that there is something behind the scenes. What is it?" "My love for the beautiful and accomDlished creature whom I soon hope to call my' wife," was his grave reply. "Fiddle-de-dee! Now, honor bright, Phil, what is it?" "I have spoken. I can say no more." "Is she rich?" ' What do you think about it?" "She don't look like it." "Why not?" "In the first place, she is dressed shabbily." "Remember that she ran away with me at a moment's notice, right out of a wood." "She looks as if she had." "Well, now, to end your suspense, I will tell you a secret, Polly. She is rich!" "Very rich?" Mariaa bent forward eagerly, to listen for his answer. ' A great heiress, my dear!" Dots she know it?" Yes, in a measure. But she does not know how to get at her property, or where it lies. I keep the key; and my lady must come to me for any information she may want on that point. Don't you understand?" "Oh, you are a deep one, Phil!" "Slightly, I flatter mvself." "And when will you touch the yellow boys?" Again Marian listened breathlessly. l ' Not just at present. It is not a straightfor- ward up and down kind of a thing. I can't walk up to the estate, and take possession in her -name without any previous bother. I wish I   could. But it all depends on her, and' she is as obstinate as a little mule just at present. I must get her well in hand before I tell her what I want her to do." "She looks as if she had got a spirit of her own," remarked the woman. "That she has." "And I don't think she took any great fancy to me." "Perhaps not," said Vere, laughing. "At all events, she would not if she knew all that I know about you." "Is she jealous?" "I cannot tell yet." 'She hates you, Phil, as bad as she hates me." "Do you think so?" "It is plain enough to be seen. She shows it in her face every time she looks at you." "Ah! wait till she is my wife, and I'll learn her to sing another song. You know, some people think it quite as well to begin with a lit- tle aversion." "Well, you have got more than a little in this case. I wonder why she consented to run away with you?" "Ah, that is her secret; and it is not fair to tell tales out of school, my pretty Polly. It was well for me that there were a hundred rea- sons for her coming. If they had only been ninety-nine, I do believe she would have stay- ed." "Well, I suppose you know best. But if I was a man, I wouldn't marry a woman who did not care for me-no, not if she was hung all over with diamonds." "Oh, you put your fdelings into the ques- tion!" "And you have none?" "Well, I don't quite say that," he answered, with a laugh. "But when I see a prize within my grasp, I don't stop to bother myself with asking whether it objects to me as its owner or not. Yonder plain little girl is Ily stepping- stone to wealth, and ease, and luxury; and do you think I will hesitate to place my foot upon her, simply because she objects to it? You ought to know me better." "I don't doubt thatyou will put your foot on her, if that is all, my dear Phil," replied the woman. "And after all, I am glad you don't care much for her. I should be awfully jealous if she was handsome, or if she seemed to care more for you. I can tell you that, Sir!" "Would you, Polly?"' replied Vere, in a kinder tone than he had ever used to Marian. "You know I would, Phil." "iTpon my word, I think sometimes you really do care for me!" "Think! Don't you know it? Have I not given you proof enough of it? Al, Philip! you may go as far as you like, and love as many as you choose, and you won't find one among   them all that will be a truer friend than I have been to you." "Perhaps not, Polly. In spite of all your little fancies for one and another, I think you are pretty true at heart to me." "Oh, I have a weakness for handsome men. I can't deny that," said the woman. with an un- pleasant laugh. "And when you are tearing all over the country in search of some pretty gipsy girl, or an heiress in a wood, or something of that kind, you can't expect me to stay here twirling my thumbs all day long alone-can you?" "No, no!" said Mr. Vere; and Marian's cheek burnt hotly. To this woman, who was quite as bad as himself, he had in roduced her his future wife. This woman was to be one of the witnesses of her marriage! No, never! She would sooner die than submil to such an insult  She was on the point of throwing open the door, and annoucirg her determination, when the sound of Mr. Vere's voice arrested her movement. "Speaking of gipsies, Poll," he said, in a hesitating way, "I must tell you that I have met Cara again." "Good gracious! What did she say to you? Did she try to tear your eyes out?" "Oh no. 'A very few words satisfied her. I told her that I had been to Australia, and the silly little goose believed me. In five minutes she had forgiven me, and taken me to the camp. I have lived there ever since I went out of  town.' "Bless us and save us! what next?  To think of you living in a tent, and eating out of  a black kettle, cheek by jowl with those great  hulking men!"  "Oh, I alwavs took good care to give them a i wide berth, and to get Cara on one side, and  the next prettiest girl in the camp on the other. They have not a bad notion of cooking, I as- t sure you ; and life in a tent, with a beautiful b dark-eyed girl for your bride, is not so Iunpleas- ant as you would imagine."         I "  Well, what was it all for?"    n "  You remember Miss Moyell?" "iIe! hle! I should think so8-haughty, proud ir minx! She looked at me that day het party  stopped at the door to leave concert-tickets for you; as if I liad been dirt at herfeet. How glad ki I was when you served her)out!"      of "  And you were revenged at the same time, since you went with me to France in her place. se Well, as women sometimes have a knack of re- membering such little kindnesse3 I thought she might make the place too hot to holme, if ca she knew I was there. So I took refuge with of my pretty Cara, and disguised myself as a be gipsy woman half the time. I actually met Miss Moyell, and gave her such a shock, while w: I was in my petticoats."          L i "(Did she know you?"          'bc   79 ve r "No." "But what were you after in that absurd ur dress? ou  "The little thing in the next room." "Did she live there, too?" 'n.

How- ig ever, I will tell you all about that another time. re I have something to say about the gipsy lassie n now." "Yes." 's  "She does not know where I have gone." s  "What I you have given her the slip a second r, time?" )f  "Yes; but she is as cunning as the very ie deuce; and she is older now than she was be. ;! fore. It is just possible that she may mistrust e something, get on my track, and follow me." n  "Wat    that lark thawould be" . lr  "For you, perhaps; but I should not see the fun of the thing at all. No, if by any infernal a chance she should turn up here, will you get e her quietly out of the way?" "Where to?" ?  "She must be mad, you know, or she would never follow me about the country so." I understand. But where could I find a e place?" s  ' Simmonds knows. I had a little talk with him before I left the camp, and he will take f care of her for you. Only let him lnow at once if she comes. She may not make her ap- pearance; but a gipsy on your track is very f much 'like a dog-he will follow you, if it is only by the track of your footsteps; and if he finds you, your life is not long worth the hav- inrg, provided he had received any injury at your hands." "All right, my dear Phil! I'll take care that the young lady does not spoil your beauty, if by any chance she comes." "What a friend you are to me, Polly I When I come into my fortune, depend upon; it, I will not forget you." "Don't, Phil. I want you to remember me in more ways than one," she answered, with a light laugh. "I shall, be sure to do that, my love. - Do you know, I think you grow handsomer every day of your life." "Hold your tongue, Phil, and let me go and see about the breakfast." "Hark! What is that?" Hie Imight well ask. A tremendous knock came at the street door, and tie moment it was opened there was a curious confusion is the hall below. "'You mustn't go flying up stairs in that wayv, said the serv, apparently struggling with some one. "Mkissus isn't at home to any- body."    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6472-00000044"/> "And Mr. Vere is not here-I assure yoil he is not!" said another voice, which Marian, as well as her neighbors, recognized as that of Simmonds. "Keep me at your peril!" was the reply. He is here! I know it; and I shall see him before I leave the house." "Ten thousand devils!" cried Vere, sinking into a chair; " it is Cara!" "You don't mean it!" said his companion. "I do. And she will wake Marian in the nest room with her cursed howling! What shall I do? How can we stop her mouth? I wish Simmonds would knock her silly brains out, and have done with it!" "Bah! You are like all other men. The minute a danger appears, you turn chicken- hearted, and don't know how to face it. I'll get you out of the scrape, as I have got you out of many a one before this." She unlocked the door, and went half way down the stairs. Marian could not see what passed-hut at least she could hear; and with- out any compunction she established herself in an easy-chair that stood against the wall, and leaned her hand against the paper. She heard Vere groan, and then swear. But the tumult in the hall was still again, and Madame Angelo was saying in a mild tone- "What does the young woman want?" "O madam!" cried the poor gipsy, spring- ing forward; ' I want to see Mr. Vere! I know he is in this house! Oh, don't refuse to take me to him!" "Of course I will not, my child," was the quiet reply; and the girl burst into tears. "But first tell me your name?" "Cara- " "Cara Vere!" said the woman, with an ac- cent of the most profound respect. "You see, I know all! Mr. Vere was just this moment talking to me about you!" "Oh, let me see him!" "Come with me, my love!" She led her up the stairs, and threw open the door of the little sitting-room which she had just left. "Here, Mr. Vere," she said, playfully; " your poor little friend has come to find you,littie thinking that it is on her account that you have come to town!" At this moment Marian discovered that the wall against which she leaned was but a papered partition. The two rooms had oncs been one; and beneath her searching band gaped a wide crevice in the shrunken planks, from which she speedily tore the paper, thus forming an aper ture to which she could place her eye. She looked eagerly into the next room; and saw, as she had half expected, the gipsy girl who had come to summon her from the Pleasaunce to Downe Reserve. Mr. Vere came forward to   meet her with a most natural look of astonish. ment and alarm. "My dear Cara, is anything the matter? What can have brought you here?" The girl was sobbing so that she coull scarcely speak. The wild suspicions, wit li which she had followed on his track were evi- dently allayed, and she scarcely dared to meet his eye. "O Philip, don't be angry!" she said'at last. "Angry for what?" "Because I followed you!" "But why did you do so, my pretty one?" "I thought-I feared-you  had left me again! ' she stammered; and Mr. Vere turned from her with a frown. "Have you no more faith in me than that, Cara? Then, indeed, we had better part!" "O no, Philip, don't say that!" cried the girl, flinging herself on her knees before him. "Forgive me this once, and-I will never offend you again. I saw you steal away last evening, and when you did not return I could not rest. I went to the station, and found that you had gone. I followed you alone, and when I got to London, the porter remembered your cab, and' the driver told me where he had put you down. I came at once; my heart was full of doubt, but now it is at rest again. Only say that you for- give me, and I will go back to the camp this very day, and wait for your return." "That will be your best plan, my love," he said, catching eagerly at her proposition. "I came upon some law business, which will de- tain me for several days, and I only stole away to save myself and you the pain of parting. I should have written to you to-day, naughty little thing that you are! but now I think I shall punish you by a week of silence." "Oh no, Philip, you will not be so cruel;" cried the girl, throwing her arms around his neck; "I will go home to-day, and you shall write to me to-morrow. Will you i" "Yes, my love; and now let me take you down stairs, and give you some refreshment. I am obliged to go out for a few minutes, but I will see you again before you set out for Downe." Cara went away quietly with Madame An- gelo. She was happy and beloved one more, and Philip was true. That was all she cared to know. Left alone, Mr. Vere broke into a little low laugh. "By heaven, what an escape! And if Marian had been startled by that young monkey, what a precious kettle of fish I should have made ol it! There would have been nothing left for me but the backwoods of America, or the gold mines of Australia, then."   CHAPTER XXX. AT THE ALTAR. "Deeds, thoughts, and words, perhaps remembered not So keenly till that hour, but ne'er forgot; Things light or lovely in their acted time.

Little did he think that Marian-close beside him-was watching every movement, listening to every word that he had said. When he had gone down stairs, she rose from hei seat, pushed her chair away from the wall, and stood for a moment or two in the middle of the room, thinking deeply. ' I have seen this man now at his worst," she said to herself. "He could not be more false and treacherous, and mean, than he lihs shown himself now. I hated him before; but, now, I look upon him with terror. Why God permits such creatures to soil the face of this fair earth, I cannot tell! "Now, since the vail has been lifted, shall I go on? "Shall I marry this man, whose crimes, if lie wasjudged justly, ought to earn him a gibbet? "Why not? "He has the secret which I want to know.  Some one else may have it, too; but I do not t know where to look for them; and I must work 3 with the instruments that are placed in my s hands. ' "  Through this wretch I can gain wealth, ease, s and luxury," as he phrased it. Without him, I am poor, friendless, and de- h spised? "He will not sell me this secret. Iknow him si too well for that. His price is the plain gold ring, and all the rights and privileges that nar- row circlet of yellow dross embraces     m "Well, be it so! He shall be my husband p -he shall share my dignity, my wealth, and l my home! Beyond that, let him attempt to go fo if he dares!" She smiled as she spoke the last words aloud. y It would have been about as safe to trifle with l a young tigress as with her just then.    H She went to the toilet-stand, bathed her face wa and hands, and arranged her hair carefully. ro She did not look much like a bride, with her ov high blue muslin dress and plain little collar; ch but she cared little for that. She shook the gr dust out of her hat and mantle, and put them neatly on. Then drawing on   her gloves, she ki sat down in the chair and waited. By-and y, a tap came   at the door. She bi opened it. Madame Angelo stood there, with   I    a small tray in her hands, containing a cup of coffee and a plate of toast.  "Oh dear! If you have not slept and lot dressed already!" she said, looking greatly sur- prised. "I was coming up to help you. I hope nothing disturbed your rest?" she added, in an anxious tone. "Nothing!" replied Marian, quietly. ' What should disturb me?" "Very true; only I thought the noise of the street might break your rest." "No!"   A "That is so nice Will you take this cup of coffee? Mr. Vere poured it out with his own le hands for you."  ' ig  H is very kind. Where is ? ' i  "Down stairs, taking his breakfast." d  "lith Cara, the gipsy, I suppose?" thought a Marian to herself; but she said nothing, but i, drank her coffee in silence, while Madanie An- gelo fidgeted about the room. e  "One little morsel of toast?" she begged, , but Marian shook her head. "Just to oblige me, mydear?" "I cannot eat."  "Ah  ! You feel a little nervous, i suppose. Well, it is no wonder! But there is one com- fort, the ceremony will be strictly private. I There will bcno one staring at you in che church!"  "Is it far away?" "In the city, my dear. A old college-friend of Mr.,Vere's is to marry you, and you will have the breakfast here. My servants are get- ting things ready down below now. And when you come back, I shall drive down Regent street, and buy you such a host of things  Mr. Vere would not wait, or I would have got you such a beautiful wcddiing dress 1" "I priefer this," said aMarian, loolking down at her plain muslin with a smile. "  Well, I will go and get ready, if you are sure you will have nothing more." "No more." Madame Angelo bustled away. In a few minutes, a cab drove up to the house. Marian peeped over the blind, and saw Simmonds handing the gipsy-girl to her seat, with a pro- found bow. "It is good to be off with the old love before you are on with the new!" thought MarinaS, laughing as she watched then drive away. Her heart was very hard just then. She felt at war with all the world, and poor Cara's sor- rows were as nothing in comparison to her own. She would not turn a step aside from her chosen path though a hundred lile her were groveling at her feet. Half an hour passed away, and then Mr. Vere knocked at the *door. "My love, the carriage waits." he said, blandly. Marian came out, and took hi. arm. She did    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6472-00000045"/> not speak, but let him lead her down the stairs,  and put her into the carriage, without a sign c of disapproval. Madame Angelo placed her- c self by Marian's side; Mr. Vere sat opposite t them. Simnuonds mounted the box, and they I drove away.  "We are to be married by special license, my love ; and an old friend of nine has kindly r consented to perform the ceremony," said Mr. I Vere. Marian bent her head, but did not epeak. She looked as if it was all a matter of indifference to her. Madame Angelo smiled, and Mr. Vere I threw himself back in his corner and bit his  lip savagely. She could not have insulted him more than -by showing so plainly that she hated  and despised him, in the presence of a woman whom he had already wooed and won, and de-  serted. The clergyman was the same young man who had performed a mock ceremony between  Mr. Vere and the gipsy-girl. He had taken orders now so that the marriage would be quite legal. In spite of his long acquaintance with Verc, lie could not help staring with won- der at the figure the young heiress cut when she presented herself before the altar. So plain, so strangely dressed, so sad, and looking with such scornful eyes upon Vere and his com- panion, and upon himself! What could it all mean? He grew more and more nervous as she watched him. Her lightning-glance made him feel what he had never felt before-that he was indeed unfit to deal .with holy or sacred things, and'that by thus acting in his sacred profession he was committing the worst of crimes. He bungled through the ceremony in a nervous, absent manner, that irritated Philip Vere, and made him wonder mentally what was the matter. Mr. Vere made his own responses audibly and clearly. Marian would not speak for a mo- ment; then she uttered the solemn words so strangely that the clergyman shuddered. In- etead of a troth-plight, they sounded to him like a denunciation and a curse. At last it was over; the ring was on, the names were signed, and Marian was a wife. Mr. Vere led her to the carriage with an exulting smile. His fortune was safe! He turned to his friend, with his foot on the step "Come up and take some breakfast?" he said, in a friendly tone. But the young man glanced at Marian, and bowed his refusal; so they returned as they came, only that now Marian Moyell occupied the back seat, and Mr. Vere was at Marian's side. CHAPTER XXXI. MATRIMONIAL BLISS. '"The breakfast passed off stupidly enough- lTo one except Madame Angelo seemed to have the slightest ni,petite, but she ate and drank   with the greatest good-humor, and prattled cheerfully all the while to her solemn-looking companions. Mr. Vere said little, ate nothing, but drank a great deal. As for Marian, she sat bolt upright in her place, and was by no means an enlivening spectacle to contemplate. At last the dreary farce was over, and they rose from the table. Mr. Vere turned to his bride with a forced smile, and said: "We shall have no honeymoon tour just at present, my love. In a week or two, we may be able to manage a trip to the Lakes, if you would like it." "Thank you," said Marian. "It really mat- ters very little to me where I go or what I do." "Flattering, upon my word! However, one can't still a woman's tongue, so I must even listen and bear it the best way possible. Now for our plans to-day. What do you intend to do?" "Nothing," she answered, looling out of the window, with a dreary sigh. "Well, for my part, I have a little business to look after in the city; and as Madame Angelo has to go out to purchase some things for you, I will drop her on myway. I shall be back by three o'clock at the latest; and then, if you like to visit any of the lions, I shall be happy to ac- company you." "Thank you, I prefer staying here," was the cold reply; and after fidgeting about for a min- ute or two, she left the room, and went up stairs, without a word of farewell. Mr. Vere looked blankly at Madame Angelo, who was smiling behind her handkerchief, in evident enjoyment of the scene. "Did you ever see anything like that?" "Never!" "What is to be done with her?'" "I'm sure I cannot say. I think, for once, -my dear Phil, you have met with your match." "Curse her! I'll break her spirit yet, or I'll break her neck!" he muttered, savagely. "It will not be the first time I have tamed a haugh- ty nature. Cara's was quite as proud when I e first knew her, and see how humble she is now!" "Yes," said Madame Angelo, softly, " but you g forget one thing!" ' "What is that?" "Cara loved you!" e  "Well?" "And a woman will often Obey the man she d loves, when she would rebel hotly against an- y other's rule. Now, this fair wife of yours is far d from loving you. Hatred looks out at you at 's every glance of her eye. It is to be hoped you will gain some very solid advantages from this marriage, my dear Phil; but as for anything so unsubstantial as happiness, don't look for it." "Well!" said Mr. Vere, with a slight smile. I "If she don't love me, I know of others that ,e will. So, come along, Polly, and I'll drop you &amp;k in Regent street, where you can buy some fur-   belows for my lady. Who knows? They may put her into positive good-humor with me!" Don't believe it, my dear. She is one of those monsters-a woman who does not care for dress. You can never win her heart with silk dresses, and bracelets, and coronets, and rings." "At all events, we will make the experiment; and if it fails, neither you nor I are to blame." Ten minutes afterward, they drove away to- gether in a cab. Marian watched them from the chamber-win- dow. A civil servantgirl, whose'round face ex- pressed both pity and wonder at the strange- ness of the whole proceeding, and the forlorn look of the bride, came up to offer her services as soon as the street-door had closed behind them. But Marian would not let her stay. She was too wretched, too despairing, to let any hu- man eye witness the agony she endured. "My good girl, I want nothing," she said, kindly. 'Only see that I am not disturbed, and I will try and sleep." "Do, Mum; and I will shake up these pil- lows, and keep the house as still as death." Marian burst into tears. The servant threw down the pillows-up went her apron to her eyes in an instant. ' Lor', Mum! don't take on so!" she sobbed. "Oh, go-leave me!" was all that Marian could say. "Yes, Mum; but don't cry-don't make your- self unhappy it will all come right in the end -sea if it don't, Mum 1" said the girl, retreat- ing, and half-choking herself With- her apron, as she closed the door. "All right in the end!'" said Marian, throw-  ing herself upon her knees beside the bed. "All  righi in the end! God help me! It is allwrong now! I wish that I was dead!" Hlow easy it is to say those words, and to wish I that wish  It takes far more courage at times I to live than to die I In the one case, there is a brief moment of agony, and so far as the trou- i bles of this world go, all is at an end. In the e other, day after day, year after year, of weary t effort and unsuccessful toil stretch out in an aw- ful perspective before the eyes of the tempted I and overburdened wretch, who ponders upon 1 suicide as the great cure-all for every ill under  the sun. Leaving out of the question the nature p of the next existence into which they so madly rush, who can wonder that the deed is sometimes c done   The day passed drearily enough for Marian. e To the gray sunshine of mid-day succeeded low- es ering clouds, and a heavy fall of rain. It mat- ta tered little to her. The gloomier the scene, the better it seemed suited to her gloomy thoughts. tl At 6 o'clock, the housemaid Bessie came again, tr ringing with her a   tiay nicely arranged, and et illed with tempting little dishes, which she had tl rnade with her own hands. Marian had eaten ti nothing since the previous evening, and she was, e   Ly i sick with hunger and fatigue. At first, she thought she could not touch a mouthful; but f Bessie's persuasions, and the tempting smell ol r the viands, were the strongest persuasives, and k by degrees her appetite came back, and she made a hearty meal.  When she had finished, Bessie took away the tray, and returned in a few minutes with a note. "- "Master's compliments, Mum, and he hopes you are better," she said, demurely. - "Has he returned?" "They have just come back, Mum, with two - great boxes for you.' n  Marina tore open the note. It ran thus: "y LovE :-The servants will bring two boxes to your room, which I hope you willcondescend to open. Accept their contents, and allo me to see you this evening in one of the beautiful dresses which Madame Angelo has hbeen kind enough to select for you. Accept, lso, the purse which you will fnd in the tray of the largest box. Its contents will be useful should you ish to go shopping. Im mc     tt  shala be o eay to receive I shall ait on you, wth your permission, atlhalf-pas 7 o'cloc, when I hope to find you quite recovered from your slight indisposition, and ready to talk over matters seriously with "Youfr affectionate husband,?p"  Marian gazed at the signature with a bitter 'smile. "Her affectionate hshandv!"Hcow he must have laughed in his sleeve as he wrote those wordsn  She tore the note intostrips, threw them into the empty grate, and turned to Bessie, who stood looking on wonderingly. "My compliments to Mr. Vere.  Tell him I am much better, and shall be ready to receive him at the hour he names.  And, Bessie, tell them to bring up the boxes. You may come with them   Ishal wantt youto u a  lady's- mai   mod for once in a way."  Bessie was very willing to play her part; and, descending to the hall, she summoned Sim- hands, and, with his help, soon deposited the eoxes in Marian's room. They were strong and handsome, plentifully studded with brass nails, and supplied  ith strong canvas covers, that suggested long Continental tours the moment the eye fell upon    them. Marian unlocked the largest. A crimson silk purse, filled with golden coins, lay conspicuous- ly upon a pile of snowy linen. She put it upon the table, and proceeded to examine her new possessions. They comprised every article of which she could possibly stand in need. And, in addition to the clothing, there was a dressing-case of ebony and gold, so small that it could be pack- ed in a moderately-sized carpet-bag, yet con- taining every article necessary for the toilet. She turnedl to the second box. It was smaller than the other, and was fitted up with tray over, tray for the reception of dresses, laces, ribbons, etc. Bessie uttered rapturous exclamations at the sight, and pounced upon a pink moire an- tique, which lay on the top, as the dress for the evening, but Marian put it aside with a smile.    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6472-00000046"/> "No ; I do not care to take all that trouble to-night," she said. "We must find a very quiet dress for the present, and I can wear that finery another time." The quiet dress soon made its appearance in the shape of a black silk, trimmed with eight' flounces. Marian put it on, and with her lace sleeves, and collar, and little knot, of blue rib- bon, looked so well, that Bessie scarcely regret- ted the pink moire. "It is not much like a bride; but it is very elegant and nice," she remarked. "It will do, Bessie-especially since I feel quite as little as I look like a bride," replied Marian. "And now you had better go down stairs with me, and tell Mr. Vere I am ready to see him." Bessie led the way to the drawing-room, where the gas had been lighted, and some attempts had been made to give the apartment a festal appearance. Mr. Vere was not there; but, five minutes after Bessie had gone to see him, Marian heard a door open below, and Madame Angelo's voice said, laughingly: "Good-bye, then, and luck go with you! I suppose I shall not see you again to night?" "In an hour's time you will have me back again," replied Mr. Vere. Marian's lip curled. ' It is barely possible that you may get back sooner than that," she thought to herself, as she took up a book, and appeared to be absorbed in its pages when he entered the room. He made a low bow at the door, and advanced toward her with a gait so unsteady that it in- stantly betrayed his state. If anything had 'been wanting to fill up the measure of her dis- gust for him, he had added it then. She drop- ped her book, pushed back her chair, and gazed at him more as if he had been a disgusting rep- tile, than a human being and her husband! "Well, my lovely bride!" he said, with another profound bow; " you have condescend- ed to let the light of your countenance shine upon me at last. I began to think I was never going to see you any more. If any one ever spent a queerer wedding-day than I have, I should just like them to send and tell me so. However, here you are, and really looking quite charming, and we will soon make up for lost time. I had no idea you were such an ele- gant woman-upon my soul I had not! Come, now, give me one kiss, and say you'll make up your mind to like me a little." He took her hand, and bent down toward her. His hot breath, redolent of cigars and wine, came full upon her cheek. She turned her head, and snatched away her hand with a look of abhorrence that did not escape him. ' What, on the high horse yet " he exclaim- ed, with a laugh. "Don't come nea. me L  on't tsuch me!" she cried, emphatically.   "Well, that is a good one! Especially when you come to remember that you married me of your own free will at ten o'clock this morning. Come, give me a kiss, like a good girl, and let bygones be bygones!" "Never!" "What do you mean by never?" Marian rose from her seat, and stood before him, pale as death, but resolute and calm. "I mean this I That if you ever attempt to come any nearer to me than you are at this moment-" "Well, what?" "Take care of yourself! That is all!" He measured the distance between them, with drunken gravity. "Three feet exactly-may be, an inch or two to spare! What will you do to me, my pretty tigress, if I venture to trench upon that taboo- ed place?" "You will find me a tigress indeed, if you attempt it!" "A pleasant look-out, truly, for the begin- ning of a honeymoon! Pray, Madam, may I take the liberty of inquiring why you married me?" "You know as well as I!" "I'll be shot if I do!" "There were several reasons!" "I know that-ninety and nine to begin with!-and then the hundredth, which made me the happiest man in the world! But pray favor me with one or two, if you have no objec- tions?" "I have not! In the first place, life was not worth living at Downe!" "Not while Lady Mountchayne was hovering on the brink of the grave, and my lord was at his wit's end about her! I understand all that!" "Secondly, I hate my Cousin Leonora!" "And you thought you could give her a stab by marrying me?' "You have guessed it!" "Amiable creatures you women are, and gen- tle as doves to one another! Well, go on! Was there no other reason?" ' One-the most important!" "And that?" "Was the secret which you possess-and which I could purchase only in this way." And she pointed to her wedding-ring. "You are a young woman of great penetra. tion," he said, with a sneer. '"I would not have sold the secret to you for less-nor will I!" "Well, there it is! I wear the symbol of my bondage. What more would you have?" "tray, have you any idea what that ring re- presents?" "I may have?" ' It means love, Mrs. Vere; and respect, Mrs. Vere ; and obedience, Mrs. Vere I All of which you promised to day at the altar to give wei   ['ll just trouble you to produce the article now!" "Bah!" said Marian, indifferently. "If I promised, you may be sure I did not mean to perform!" "That is honest, at any rate." "As for love-I have none to give you, or any one else. Respect is certainly wanting so far as you are concerned; and if you want a slave to obey you, you will not find her in Marian Mbyell!" Mr. Vere leaned on a chair, and whistled.. "There's nothing like plain speaking, my dear; but sometimes it may be carried a little too far. I recommend you to put a muzzle on that saucy mouth of yours, keep a civil tongue in your head, and remember that you are no longer Marian Moyell, but Marian Vere!" "You do well to remind me of it. I was actually happy enough to forget it for an in- stant."  ' Confound your impudence  Cut it! Stow It! Do you know who you are talking to?" "Yes!" said Marian, composedly. "To one of the greatest rascals in existence!" "Well, if ever I heard anyone like you in all my life! There's not a man in all England dares say as much tome as you have said just now." "I am not at all afraid of you, Mr. Vere. And I do not presume upon the privilege of my sex, because, if I was a man, I would tell you so still, and far more emphatically!" "Cool  But before you go too far, how- ever, allow me to remind you that you are my wife."  "I know it too well!" "And that we are in England!" "Yes." "Subject to English laws!" "What of that?" "A great deal, Ma'am. The law of England allows me to chastise my wife, as long and as much as I like, provided I never use a stick larger round than my thumb. I'll take advan- tage of that law, if you aggravate me any more -remember that!" "  More shame to England-that is all There is not another country in the world where such i a relic of barbarity would be allowed to existl  So far as I am concerned, however, it does not matter I Fol if you attempt to lay so much as your little finger upon me, in way of violence, I will kill you!" Mr. Vere looked at her pale face and flashing eyes, and thought it was as well to keep the peace. It was quite possible that she might mean what she had said, and act upon it in case he went too far. "I was only joking, my love, of course," he  said, soothingly. "But you take fire at the  smallest thing." She waved her hand disdainfully.   e  "If you have finished with that nonsense, perhaps you will listen to me 1" I  '"With great pleasure." s 'o "I know more about you, Mr. Vere, than you think." "Indeed!" or  "When the gipsy-girl came here this morn- o ing, I, in the next room, heard every word she a said." n  "The devil you did -" "I also heard your conversation with Madame Angelo." y  Mr. Vere looked dismayed. e  "You must be like Fine Ear, in the fairy a tale, then." e  "The walls were thin, and I listened." o  "Oh, you did!" "All is fair in love or war, you know. My s scruples are only for honorable people. When - I am dealing with men like you, and woman like Madame Angelo, I must stoop to the prac- r tices that you would make use of." "What did you hear?" he asked, sullenly. "Enough to open my eyes, be sure of that! I know what the gipsy is, and what Madame Angelo has been to vou!" "Well, what of that? I am no worse than other men, after the worst has been said of me." "I don't know that. I take leave to think , that most ' other men' would have hesitated to bring a young bride into a place like this." "What ails this place? It is all right, and most respectable people live here." "They may, but I shall not!" "You will live, Madam, in any place to which I choose to take you!" "I beg your pardon. I shall do nothing of the kind, as you will see in the morning." "You rebel against my authority?" "No! because I do not for one moment rec- ognize it!" "You'll have to, Ma'am, whether you like it or not. I'll break your spirit or your neck before I have done-I promise you that!" "You will have to break my neck first, Mr. Vere!" "Ah, you may laugh now; but my time will soon come! Now, is it your pleasure to go down stairs with me?" "To Madame Angelo's room?" "Yes." "Certainly not." "You refuse to be friends with us e?' "I do." "At what time shall you retire P" "What is thatf you?" He shrugged hbshoulders. "Understand  , Mr. Vere," she said, coldly. "  While you live your present life, and mix with your present associates, there is no tie between us, except that formed by the secret!" "Ha!"And his face lit up with a look of    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6472-00000047"/> savage joy. "I'll serve you out there, my lady! I won't tell you t R secret!" "But it is for your own interest to do so." "My own interest may be hanged! I,can afford to lose something for the sake of being revehged on you. No, Ma'am, you shall not hear one word of the secret till you ask my par- don for your impertinence, and promise to be an obedient and dutiful wife to me. Now I think I have you on the hip, my lady; and as you don't look much like doing it at present, 'lll just go back to Madame Angelo again. It is possible that she may allow me to share her room, since you refuse so decidedly to admit me to yours." So saying, he nodded slightly to his wife, and went down. CHAPTER XXXII. A CHANGE OF AIR. "God shield us in our weakness! I had said To meet the faggot or the blade-to die for that accounted holy, for the truth,  Were but a festal doom-a tribute paid  By the poor outward form, that it may lie A slave, and not a master of the soul. But harder far to bear a life-long test; To feel the weight of wrong in spring-time youth, Crushed heavier down as lagging winters roll; Benumbing thought and feeling in the breast, While selfishness and callous discontent Blight all the aspect of God's blessed earth, And tear from out our soul that which He lent- Its freshness, homage, freedomness of birth." -E. OAKES SMTH. There are some things a woman cannot and will not bear. This was one of them. The mildest Griselda on earth might have been excused for doing what Marian did. Which was to go into a towering rage I Rush up to her room! Ring the bell furiously! Hurl combs and brushes, hair-pins and curl- papers, towels and table-cloths, in a confused heap into the middle of the room, and execute something very like a war-dance gone mad, upon the top of them! It was not a dignified thing to do, and I am ashamed to have such a thing to write about my heroine. But she was a high-spirited, hot-tempered woman, with much more of the devil than oftlhe angel in her composition; and when her equi- librium was disturbed, it was necessary to use some violent physical exertion as a kind of safety-valve. A milder woman would have sat down and cried.  Marian threw  the things about, and danced, uttering exclamations quite the reverse of gentle and forgiving, all the "-while. Bessie, entering the room in obedience to her imperative summons, stood aghast at the spectacle which presented itself to her eyes. "Lor', Mum!  Whatever is the matter  And whatever are you doing?" The ludicrous horror of the girl's face, and the tone of utter astonishment, sent Marian-into   a violent fit of laughter. 1 She flung herself into a chair, and wiped her eyes. "Don't be afraid, Bessie. I have not gone mad," she said, as soon as she could find breath to speak. "Thank goodness for that, Mum! I was really afraid your brain was turned when I see you hopping about there, like a red Indian or a South Sea Islander." "Did I look as bad as that? Well, come in, and shut the door." The girl obeyed. "I want to ask you a few questions. Will you answer them truly?" ' Yes, Mum." "Do you think this is a respectable house?" Bessie stared widely. "And do you think your mistress is a re- spectable person?" Bessie twisted her apron. *' It's hard to say, Mum." "What do you mean?" "Nobody knows whether anybody is respect- able or not, now-a-days, Mum." "Indeed!" "Especially in London." "I was not aware of that." ' Oh, it's a horrid place, Mum-a horrid place! I often wonder the earth does not open and swallow it." "Perhaps it will some day." "Now is the time, if ever, Mum. But, as I was saying about my missus. You see, she is very liberal and easy with me, and all that-" Well-go on." "But I have my doubts about her." "So have I." "There are too many gentlemen coming and going-quite late at night sometimes. I don't like the look of it, Mum." "I should think not." "And then Mr. Vere." "Well, what of him?" The girl hesitated. "Perhaps I ought not to say it, after all. You are married to him, and no one has any business to make mischief between you." ' The mischief is made, my good girl,' and most effectually. So you may as well speak out." "I don't think it looked well for her to be going out with him to-day-his wedding-day, Mum. And then, ever since they came home, they have been sitting together in her parlor, talking and laughing like one o'clock, while you were up here ill. All the servants were talking about it, and cook says that it is only a very old story over again." "Cook is quite right!" said Marian, quietly. And she told her the occurrence of the evening, at which Bessie held up herhauds, and uttered Ia cry of horror. "Oh, the brute! Oh, the wicked, wicked   woman! I'll, go home to my poor mother to- morrow! I won't stop another day in such a terrible house ;. and, if you'll take my advice, Mum, you will go away too. If he begins like that, where will he stop? Deserting his young bride for that old wretch, who is fifty, if she is a day! Oh, Ma'am, don't you stand it, whatever you do!" "Rest easy, Bessie. I shall leave the house to-night." "To-night, Mum! But you are a stranger in London?" ( Yes." "Where will you go?" "I don't know. To some hotel, I would rather sleep on a doorstep, if it came to that, than beneath this roof!" "Quite right, Mum. I don't blame you. But you must not set off so late without knowing where you are going. That would never do. Now, my poor mother has a house of her own, and lets out lodgings. I know she has a spare bed room. It is very poor, but you will not mind that, just for one night?" "Oh no." "Then I will run and write a note to her, and when I come home to-morrow, we will see what can be done. Don't tell mother the worst, though. She would never forgive herself if she knew she had let me /come to a place like this."  "Bessie hurried away, and soon returned with a neatly-folded, letter, which she gave to Marian. "There is a cab-stand about a quarter of a mile from this door, in a straight line," she said. "You must walk there; and then they cannot trace you to this house. Or, perhaps, you had better not take a cab from the rank. You will see plenty- plying for hire in the street. Drive to this address, and my mother will be kind to you for my sake. I will pack a few things for you now in a carpet bag, and bring more with me in my boxes, to-morrow." She was busily employed as she spoke. In half an hour all was ready. The house was still, except for the sound of voices and laughter that still came from the little parlor below. Martin put on her hat and cloak ; Bessie took the bag, and they glided softly down the stairs together. The bolts of the hall-door were softly drawn-Bessie thrust the bag into Marian's hand-whispered a "Good night, God bless .you!"-and closing the door, gained her own room again unobserved. The daring deed was done, and Marian stood outside that hated house, free and alone once more. Following the directions of her friend, the house-maid, she went some distance on foot be- fore she called a cab to take her to her place of refuge. She was driven to a poor but neat-look- ing house in the north end of London; but it was   - nearly eleven o'clock before they got there, and I it took a great deal of knocking and ringing to rouse the mistress of the establishment from i her first sound sleep. At last she came: a sensible, kind-looking 3 woman of fifty, who looked somewhat doubt- r fully over her candle at Marian, as she stood upon the steps, and asked what she was pleased to want. "Are you Mrs. Jones?" asked   Marian, timidly. "That is my name." "I have a letter for you from your dauiter in -   square. She sent me here." "From my Bessy? Then don't stand there, , my dear, catching cold, on the step. Have you paid your coachman?" ' Yes; be is just going." "Then come in at once, and give me the let- ter. Poor Bessy! it is three weeks since I saw her good-tempered face in this room."  She led the way as she spoke, into a tiny par- lor on the ground-floor, whose shabby yet care- fully-kept furniture bore testimony alike to her poverty and to her neatness. "Sit down in the arm-chair, my dear. I'll just put the chain of the door up, and then read Bessie's letter." There was a great rattling outside for a moment or two; then she came back, found her spectacles, and proceeded to decipher the note.. Miss Bessy, being somewhat excited when she wrote it, had evidently made use of pretty strong language in describing her master's con- duct; for her mother dropped the note as if it had burnt her fingers, and sat looking at Marian with the eyes of kindest pity. "Dear! dear! only to think of that, now! And so young, too, as you are! But there!- all men are brutes; and that is the long and short of it. Poor Mr. Jones died many a year ago, and I don't want to rake up old stories. against him; but, my dear, I lived in purga- tory while I lived with him! and that is the- truth. Marian felt eminently relieved. She had' feared a cold reception when the strange storyv was made known. But if this woman's husband- had behaved badly to her, there was all the, more hope that she would not espouse the cause  of Mr. Vere. "1 was so miserable," she said, apologetical- ly. "Indeed, I could never have lived with. that man! "I should think not, indeed! said Mrs. Joiles,. brandishing the flat candlestick energetically. "Women put up with far-too much, my dear. If I had only had the pluck to run away from poor Jones the night he married me, I should not have been in this paltry place, and Bessy out a servant now. I had had better offers by far than his; but I fell in love with hisohand- some face, and pleased my eye and plagued my,    <pb n="88 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000048"/> heart, in consequence. Lord! what fools we women are, to be sure!" Marian assented to this somewhat humiliating doctrine most heartily. "And it seems that you were no better than the rest of us, my dear," the good woman went on. "Now, it is none of my business, to be sure; but what could have made you marry that man yonder?" "I don't know; or, yes, I do know'" "Was he very much in love with you?" "Not a whit." "To be sure, he could not have been, or he would not have served you sdch a shameful trick. Were you in love with him?" "1 Oh no! The fact is, I married him for the most interested reasons, and I am rightly pun- ished for it." "Well, never mind; I dare say you would just as lief I kept my questions to myself. Only I want you to tell me one thing. Bessy says he turned you out of the house, and then she gives a hint about that Madame Angelo she works for. She says she will tell me all about it when she comes home. Now, what does that mean? Is there anything wrong there? You must tell me that; for if there is, Bessy shall not stay there another day." "Your daughter has mistaken one thing," said Marian. "Mr. Vere did not turn me out of the house; I came of my own accord. You must take Bessy away at once. It is not a fit place for her." "That woman I I thought as much when I saw her with her fine gold chains and her real lace." "I won't say that she is no better than she should be, because that comparison might ap- :ply with equal truth to every one in the world; but she is almost as bad as she can be, Mrs. -Jones; and if Bessy were my daughter, she -should not stay in the house another day." "I'll send for her to-morrow," said the -nother, looking terrified and indignant. "What a mercy it was that you came here to -enlighten me about it! And now, my dear, as you must be tired and sleepy, I will show you to a little room that you can have for your own, as long as you like. It is but a garret, for the greater part of my house is let to an Italian image-maker and his family. I only keep a kitchen, this little parlor, and two attics. But your room is clean, if it is humble; and I shall sleep next door; so you may rest as safely as if you were in the Tower of London, with the Lord Chamberlain keeping the key." She led the way as she spoke up two steep and narrow flights of stairs, and into a small garret-chamber, furnished with a bed, a chair, a cheap yellow washstand, and a looking- glass. "Bessy sleeps here when she is at home, but she can share my bed," the good widow re-   marked. "Will you take anything before you go to sleep, my dear?" "Nothing, thank you." "Then good night, and pleasant dreams to you. Don't fret about that vagabond husband of yours. He can't find you here. And if you feel frightened or lonely in the night, just rap on the wall, and I will be with you in the twinkling of an eye." With this parting benediction, the worthy lady trotted away ; and in ten minutes more was sleeping the sleep of the just on her little hard pallet. Marian, left to herself, bathed her throbbing temples, and tried to steady her whirling head. The strange events of the day kept coming up before her till she was nearly mad. At last, she grew sleepy, and found herself nodding, as she thought. She drank a glass of cold water, extinguished the candle, threw herself, dressed as she was, upon the bed, and lost her care in the sound refreshing sleep of youth and unbroken health. CHAPTER XXXIII. TWO FACES UIDER ONE HOOD. "Alone, yet not alone, the heart doth brood With a sad fondness o'er its hidden grief; Broods with a miser joy, wherein relief Comes with a semblance of its own quaint mood. How many hearts this point of life have passed! And some a train of light behind have cast, To show us what hath been, and what may be; That thus have suffered all the wise and good, Thus wept and prayed, thus struggled and were free. So doth the pilot, trackless through the deep, Unswerving by the stars his reckoning keep: He moves a highway not untried before, And thence he courage gains, and joy doth reap, Unfaltering lays his course, and leaves behind the shore." It was nearly twelve o'cleck on the following day when Mbrian woke from her sound slumber with a sudden start. For a moment she could not understand where shelwas, or how, she hap- pened to be in so humble a place. The un- wonted flashing of the wedding-ring upon her left hand caught her eye, and recalled every- thing. "I wonder if I am safe here," she thought; and, springing from the bed, she washed her face and hands, smoothed her hair, and went down into the little parlor where she had been received oh the previous night. The old lady was not there, but a younger and slighter wom- an stood by the window, apparently absorbed in the contents of a newspaper. "Bessie!" said Marian, with a start of sur- prise. The young girl turned, and threw down the paper. "Oh, I am so glad you have come down! Mother told me to wake you by one o'clock. Shall I get you some breakfast?" "If you please."    <pb n="-89" xml:id="VAC6472-00000049"/> Bessie bustled about, and in ten minutes had the table neatly spread with a clean white cloth, and covered with all the comcomitants of a comfortable meal. There w,.s a rasher of bacon,'nicely fried, an egg, fresh bread and but- ter, and some strong tea, that soon relieved the dull aching of Marian's head. When she had finished her meal, she looked up at her attend- ant, and said, with a smile: Well, Bessie, you look full of news. What have you to tell me?" "Not much, Mum." "Begin at the beginning. When did you leave the Square?" "As soon as it was light enough to see, this morning, Mum." "Had they missed me?" "No, Mum" Marian sighed. It had come to that, then. Go where she-might, do what she would, still no one missed her.- "I brought all your boxes, Mum," Bessie observed, with a good-tempered grin. "Did you?" "Cook was for stopping them at first, till she heard where you hqd gone to. But when I told her about Mr. Vere-and-and that old cat, she said it was a great shame; and she helped me to get the things down this morning before a soul in the house was up." "She was very kind. Are the boxes here?" "No, Mum." "Where, then?" Bessie looked terribly embarrassed. "You see, Mum, we are very poor folks." "Well " "And it would not do to let it be known everywhere that we had helped you to get away. 1i nglish laws are very queer things; and if Mr. Vere should find you here, and make any dis- turbance about it, it would prevent my getting another place for ever so long." "I see. But does he know where you live?" "Madame Angelo 'does; and whatever he wants to know,' she will be pretty sure to tell him."    I     , "I am afraid you are right," said Marian. "And what do you think I had better do?" "If you would not think it too great a liber- ty, Mum-" "Notlhing is a liberty, Bessie, that is meant for my good." "Thell, there is a place dlose at hand where they would never dream of looking-a friend of my mother's, and she has a little garret to let, just like ours. I am sure we should be de- lighted, to have you here for the rest of your life, if that is all; but if you want to keep out of their way, it is not safe for you." "You are quite right, Bessie. I had better go to this place as soon as possible-that is, it your friend will take me in." "There is no fear of that, Mum. 'The boxes   are there already, and mother has just gone over to make it more comfortable for you." "Then we will follow her at once." "But we took the lodgings for an old lady, Mum," said Bessie, twisting the corner of her apron about, and looking very foolish. "What do you mean?" "I thought Madame Angelo might watch the, neighborhood, and ask questions of all the people. And so, as Mrs. Davis is a timid sort of woman, I thought she had better knoo oth- ing about you. If Madame was to gebtiTd of her, she would let the whole thing out at once; and so, as you will want to get a walk now and then to enjoy yourself a little, I thought-" She stopped, and turned alarmingly red in the face. Marian's look of utter bewilderment perplexed her sorely; and it began to dawn upon her novel-fed mind that the plan she was: about to propose might be, to say the least, rather ludicrous in the lady's eyes. You:rro- mantie people dread being-laughed at, above alli things; and, generally speaking, tlihey happen to be the very people, of-all-others, at whom it is next to an impossibility not to laugh. "But what is this wonderful plan of yours, my child?" asked Marian. "They will look for a young lady, you know, Mum. If you would but put on these, they would never dream of its being you, and you could go out as often as you liked." As she spoke, she drew out from a box be- hind her a prim looking dress of black bomba- zinc, a plain black lace cap attached to a "front" of iron-gray hair, a black straw bon- net and a crape vail, and a pair of steel-framed spectacles. Marian, of course, went off into a fit of laughter. Bessie looked terribly huffed, and dropped the things as if they had burnt her. "Never-mind, my dear child," said Marian, when she could speak properly again. i'  always laugh at anything new. But, rethy, when 1 come to think of it. your plan is a very good one, and I will put the dress on this min- ute, if you will help me." Bessie brightened up, drew down the blinds; and, amongst merry peals of girlish laughter, the strange toilet began. "Oh gracious, Mum! WhLtover would be- lieve it was you?" exclaimed Bessiey when the spectacles, and bonnet, and vail were adjusted. "Do come and look at yourself in the glass, Mum!" Marian stepped before the mirror; and start- ed back in astonish'menlt. There stood a wom- an, apparently fifty years of age, with a face that, in spite of its look of sadness, was almost handsome. The gray hair and look of age atoned for the somewhat indiffercnt complex- ion, and the whole countenance was utterly dif- ferent from that which had excited her wrath    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6472-00000050"/> so many times during the progress of toilets intended to be more becoming than this. * Well," she said, with a smile, " it is some- thing, at least, to know that I shall be quite good-looking when I get to be an old woman. Now, Bessie, let us get away as fast as possible. I like my disguise so well, that I shall be very sorry to have anything happen to render it quite useless." Bessie ran to fetch her bonnet and shawl; and, in en minutes more, they stood within the little attic room, which, for some time, at least, was to be Marian's home. The mistress of the house, a nervous-looking old lady, conducted them there, and evidently seemed greatly relieved to findsher new lodger so near her own age. Marian felt, at the first glance at the frighten- ed, hesitating face, that Bessie's romance had served her a good turn. If, indeed, Madame Angelo should come that way, Mrs. Davis was not fit to be intrusted with a secret, and the steel spectacles and the iron-gray wig took a higher value at once in her eyes. Mrs. Jones, who was busy about the room, could not help a little smile, as she saw her new acquaintance made over so strangely into one newer still ; but her manner was just what it ought to have been under the circumstances; and good Mrs. Davis never suspected the ex- istence of a mystery which would have worried her to death had she been a party concerned. The room was small-smaller than most serv- ants' attics, in fact; but Marian cared little for that. The bed looked clean and comfort- able-the curtains and the counterpane were marvelously white for a London apartment. Moreover, there was an easy- chair beside the window, and a look-out therefrom across a countless range of roofs; and a table for her books and papers; and a window-ledge where the bright-eyed sparrows might come for the crumbs she scattered, and sit and watch her as she wrote. Something in the place pleased her; and she felt, with a glad thrill at her breast, that she was going to be very happy there! The two widowed friends, having ascertained that the lodger wished for nothing more, took tihemselves off; Bessie remaining a moment longer, her bright eyes sparkling with delight. "It is a poor place, but I think you will be comfortable," sle said ; "and certainly you will be safe-and that is the great thing." "Yes; just at present," said Marian, thought. fully. "Law, Mum! how odd you do look in that dress, to be sure! Who would ever dream that it was you? Why, your mother might pass vou in the street without knowing you! I got that idea of the disguise from a story in the pa- per, Mum." ' Indeed!" said Marian, looking amused. "Yes, Mum. When the young and lovely   I heiress, Lady Philomela, runs away from lher hard-hearted guardian, who locks her up, she wears just such a dress as that. Law, Mum! who ever thought I wo'ud be acting such a story before. I died?--IJonly -wish some one would write it' out-it would beat the Lady Philomela all to nothing. But I must go now. I shall come in after dinner to see how you are getting on. Good morning, Mum!" Good morning!" said Marian, absently; and as the door closed upon her visitor, she sank into a fit of the deepest thought. Bessie was right. She was living a romance: why shoutld she not try to write it? A chance word often produces the strangest results. That simple question of a romantic house- maid gave the world of romance-realers one author more. CHAPTER XXXIV. BEAUTY IS O'LY SKIN-DEEP. "I dreamel last night that I myself did lay Within the grave, and after stood and wept, My spirit sorrowed where its ashes slept! 'Tqas a strange dream, and yet methinks it may Prefigure that which is akin to truth. How sorrow we o'er perished dreams of youth, High hopes and aspirations doomed to be Crushed and o'ermastered by earth's destiny! Fame, that the spirit loathing turns to ruth; And that deluding faith so loth to part, That earth will shrine for us one kindred heart  Oh, 'tis the ashes of such things that wring Tears from the eyes-hopes like to these depart, And we bow down in dread o'ershadowed by death's wing!"        -E. OAKES SMTH Meanwhile, how were all the other personages of our story, at Downe Reserve or elsewhere, getting on?  We will give precedence to rank, as in duty bound, and speak first of Lady Theodosia and her foreign spouse. It sometimes happens, that what looks upon the surface to be the maddest of actions, turns out, in reality, to be the very wisest thing we could possibly do.  In this case, those who heard of Lady Theodosia's elopement hinted very strongly that she ought to be shut up in I Colney Hatch; that if she had been in her right senses she never could have dreamed of such a thing. They forgot that the -lady was not quite a hundred years old, and that she had a spice of 1 romance in her composition, which even her long term of servitude in the treadmill of fash- ionable society had been unable totally to erad- icate. She was vain, and frivolous, and haugh- t ty, and selfish, it is true ; but, in spite of that, t she could fall in love after a fashion of her own, 3 and appreciate the love that was offered in re- t turn. I do not mean to say that she would - have gone to the scaffold for her husband, or performed any very stiriking act of heroism in his behalf; but-she was fond enough of him t6o. J be a faithful and affectionate wife-and that is   Baying 'a great deal for a woman brought up and educated to make marriage the chief and only end and aim of life, as she had been. They went abroad together till the outcry about their elopement should have ceased, and were quite as happy together as any newly married fashionable couple could expect to be. Miss Moyell follows next upon the list. She, too, became a bride within a short time after her cousin's disappearance, and went down with her old baronet to his country-seat-outwardly, a happily successful, and inwardly, a wretched and disappointed, woman. To the last, she had hoped that Philip Vere, enraged at her faith- lessness, would make his appearance, and forbid the sacrifice she was about to make. She had not seen or heard from him for a longtime; yet still some blind reliance upon his affection made her trust that it would be roused by the knowl- edge that she was about to bestow her hand, and, for aught he could tell, her heart, upon another.       St But she was disappointed. Mr. Vere had too much important business of his own upon his hands, just then, to waste many thoughts upon her; and she went to the altar, and came away from it " my Lady", without having once caught a glimpse of a despairing and penitent lover rushing to the rescue-not too late! With all these wonderful events happening so closely together, the villagers had little time to wonder over Marian's sudden disappearance. Miss Moyell, ever jealous for the honor of the family, even in the person of one of its meanest members, gave out that she had gone to Scot- land to attend upon a dying aunt: and the tale was immediately believed. Brt she herself was convinced that the girl had fulfilled her oft-re- peated threat of hurrying away to London, and that the proper place to look for her would be in the gaslit streets of that great city. Still she instituted n9 search. Marian was gone-so much the better! If she had disgraced herself, no one in Downe could ever know it; and for the rest, it mattered very little. Mrs. Pryor, the housekeeper, was full of anxious thoughts and surmises, it is true; but she kept them to herself. She was powerless to help the poor child, and at a loss to understand the reason of her flight. She could only wait and hjbpe, and pray also, that the stray lamb mighthe guided by a loving hand, and that all might yet be well. And Rose, the pride of the village, the sweet May Queen-where was she? Not in a silent grave, nor yet on the bed of sickness, which had so nearly Froved a bed of death to her. Thanks to the skill of her phy- sician, and the kind ctire'of her neighbois and her nurse, she had recovered sufficiently to sit in an easy-chair, beside the little Tparlor-win- dow, and look upon the green lanes, and hear her little canary singing his heart out in the rustic porch once more.,   )  The villagers wondered and speculated about I her much more than about Miss Moyell or Lady Theodosia. That one should marry a man old enough to be her grandfather, and the other elope with a lame Italian, was exciting and in- I teresting enough. But here was one of their own- order-a girl who had grown up with and , among them-suddenly elevated, by the mere power of the beauty they had admired so much, far aboie their heads. Whatever she Eiight be to the proud family at the Priory, she could never be the equal of her early friends again. But would that family acknowledge her? Would they sanction, by their own approval, the rash act of their son? The wildest rumors were rife upon this one point. Some said that Lady Revere had gone into fresh hysterics at the tidings of Rose's re- covery, and that Lord Revere had threatened to cut his son off with a shilling if he ever went near her again. The estates were'entailed, it is true, but the revenue they produced was but small; and it was known that the-allowance made to the young nobleman by his father was, from sheer necessity, scarcely equal to that of many a peer's son while yet at Eton. If this allowance were curtailed, the villagers rea- soned, and rightly, that the young man would be in no position to introduce his young wife to the circle to which, by right, she now belong- ed. But would this threat induce him to for- sake her? No one knew. But Rose had lost her beau- ty. She might regain it-it was a question of time. And till that question was decided, no one felt justified in pronouncing an opinion upon Lord Mountchayne's future course' of conduct. But it showed plainly how much Rose was beloved, when there was not a heart in the humblest cottage that did not wish her a perfect recovery, and a long and happy life with the man who had won her. No one envied her-every one rejoiced at the good, and grieved at the bad, fortune which had befallen her. And if Lord Monntchayne failed to do his duty nobly at this trying time, there was not one amongst them all who would not blame him for his cowardice, and hate him for his cruelty, for ever. There was one who blamed and hated him, as it was; one who would have laid down his life for the privilege which the young nobleman valued so lightly; one who, at the first warning of danger, would have been at the young girl's side; one who would have watched over her by day and night untiringly-caring little that the once bright eyes were dim, so they turned to him for pity-caring little that tie beautiful face was a hideous mask, so that its owner was his wife! Need I say that I am speaking of IIugh Den-    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6472-00000051"/> nett, the young blacksmith. The poor fellow still lingered in the village, though its light Was gone. He worked no more, singing, mer- rily, at the forge. His shop was sold; so was the little cottage, where he had once hoped to welcome Rose,i and he himself was only wait- ing for her recovery or her death, before he set out to seek his fortune in the gold mines of California. His days were spent in the neigh- borhood of the cottage; he was always at hand to go for the doctor, for medicine, or for any luxury craved by the invalid. Many a night he stretched himself upon the bench in the porch (where he had sat so often,with her by his side), and slumbered contentedly there, so that he might be near Rose-her servant and her slave, if she needed one. His chivalrous unselfish devotion contrasted strongly with the absence and apparent indif- ference of her noble husband. Yet no one ventured to tell Rose of it when she 'recovered. I doubt if she gave a thought to poor Hugl. Her hopes and wishes all went forward to' the time when her beauty should come back, and she should be restored to her, dear Mount- chayne's arms. She would not send for him till the marks of the fearful disease were quite effaced. And thinking thus, she sat by the window one pleasant afternoon, her poor scarred and discolored face bent over a cluster of fresh gathered roses, when a noise at the door, and a scream from the old nurse, made her start and look round. Lord Mountchayne stood before her I CHAPTER XXXXV. THE LAST LINK IS BROKEN. "1 gave thee tenderness too deep, Too deep for aught but tears, And thou wouldst teach the world's cold rule, Which learned, the heart but sears.  "I gave thee all, the soul's deep trust,  Its truth by sorrow tried. Nay, start not thou, What hast thou given?  Alas! 'tis but thy pride.

She half rose from her chair to meet him, but  sank back again the next moment, half fainting. h She had seen the glance of horror and disgust with which he, looked upon her altered face; n ' and though his manner was kind and gentle the b instant he recovered from the first shock of a surprise, no words of affection from  his lips 1 could possibly obliterate 'the impression that tI one glance had made upon her sensitive heart. tl She, who had once been fairest among the w daughters of women in his eyes, was now an un- F fortunate object, on whom he could scarcely p bear to look I She could never forget that! es Somewhat ashamed of having betrayed him- .   w I self so plainly, Lord Mounteaayne advaneed, it and tool her passive hand. as must you have thought of me all these weary ;o days?" -  "I was too ill to think, my Lord," said Rose, e sadly.. He felt the meaning she meant to con- )f vey by that formal use of his title; and though l- it gave him a momentary pang, it made his d errand there all the easier of fulfillment. y  "Poor girl I You must have suffered fenr- t fully indeed 1 But, Rose, I would have come to e you, let the danger be what it might, only for y my mother. She begged me so earnestly to o remain with her, and she was so ill. that I dared 1 not refuse. Can you forgive me for my seem- ing desertion." 1  "Yes," was the indistinct reply. ' "And now," he said, after a slight pause, "I have somelhing to say to you."  I am all attention," said Rose, with a heavy sigh. Her woman's 'instinct gave her some warnitg of what was coming. You know, my darling, that when I found you loved me, I did not take any base advan I tage of that love. Because you were a cottage. girl, and I the heir to a noble name, I did not think myself justified in leading you astray. You can at least give me credit in your memory for having behaved as respectfully to you as if you had been a lady in my own rank of life- -can you not?" She bent her head. "You are my wife, Rose-my legal wife! As much Lady Mountchayne as my mother is Lady Revere. No one can rob you of this title, nor can I ever give it to another while you live. Yc u understand this perfectly?" "Yes, my Lord." "My mother understands it, too; so does mv father. And yet, Rose, this day I must choose between you and them!" He had already chosen. The very tone of his voice betrayed it to her jealous heart. His love for her had been but a fancy for a charm- ing face ; and for the possession of so frail a toy, he had bartered his future willingly. The dream was over-the Charm was powerless now I Even if she had sat before him, blooming and beautiful once again, he could not have loved her as at first. Was he to blame? I think not I People can no more help being fickle than they can help breathing. It is their nature, and they are but acting up to it when they are " off with the old love and on with the new " a dozen times in the course of a year. It is rather mortifying to the loves, both old and new, I suppose; but what would you have? If in the month of February you fall violently in love with a pair of soft, dark eyes, and move heaven and earth to make them   smile upon you-if in March they do smile: and if by the last of   April you discover that you have made a mistake, and that blue eyes are much more beautiful-what then? Are you to be brought up for heavy damages if you are a man, or stigmatized as a jilt if you are a woman, in Con- sequence? You ought not to be! In Febru- ary, there was a chord somewhere in your nature, silent before from your earliest years, that suddenly thrilled into life beneath the capricious hand of circumstance. In April, the hand was withdrawn, and the chord silenced, never, perhaps, to be awakened again this side of the grave. What had you to do with it? What were you but the instrument upon which those fleeting fingers chose to play? Lord Mouultchayne did not make these ex- cuses for himself. He was not old or wise enough; neither was he sufficiently skilled in the amusing scienceof love, to think of them. He was ashamed of himself for changing, and yet he knew that he was changed. Rose had. lost her power over him. He sat by her, now, as if she had been an old woman of seventy; he looked furtively at her disfigured face, and thought that, if it was as fair as ever, it could win nothing more than quiet admiration of him. Knowing this, he pitied her-knowing what he haf to say and do, he feared for her. She was his wife, and he about to behave like a villain: she had given him an innocent and trusting heart, and he was about to trample it in the dust: her -whole future depended upon him, and he was about to blast it by a word. He could not do these things with an easy con- science; and he lingered and hesitated over it so long, that Rose took pity, and helped him out of his dilemma by a plain, straightforward question. "How are you to choose between me and them, my Lord? "Ihave acknowledged you as my wife in public. Every one in Downe knows that you are Lady Mountchayne!" "Yes; and Hthank you for that!" "It was but simple justice, Rose!" "True; but simple justice is not always done." "I have offended my parents deeply by this marriage!" "I can well understand that, my Lord! Oh, why --" She stopped short. and clasped her hands. "Why did I urge it?" he said, continuing her sentence for her. "Ah, you know how I -loved you! and-in, short, it was to be, I sup- pose I And there is no use in talking about it now; the thing is done 1" "I would die glndily, my Lord, if I could set you free!" cried poor Rose, so sadly, that the tears came inlto his eyes. "  No, no, Rose; I don't want you to die-be  sure of that! But you must give them time to recover from  this blow! You cannot expect  them to forgive either of us just ybt!'   a  "Will they ever forgive me?" e  "I am sure of it. But my rmother is heart- t broken just at present. She had set her heart r upon my marrying Lady Theodosia; and I, like - a coward, let her believe, up to the last moment, -that I was about to do so. Luckily, Lady Theo- r dosia did not suffer from my folly-she is more ', happy with that black-eyed Italian than she would ever have been with me. Bdt you, Rose, 3 how shall I tell you what my mother com- manded me to do in your case?" ' I can guess," faltered the poor girl, turn- ing her head away from him. "She wishes you i to leave me!" "Yes." "And will you go?" "How can I disobey her. If I refuse to accompany them abroad, my father will never allow me to enter his doors again. It would kill my mother if we quarreled." There was a long pause. He sat with his eyes fixed upon the floor. She was looking at the canary that warbled so blithely in the porch, and striving hard to keep down her sobs and tears. At last she said: "You are right. Your mother has more claim upon you than me. You must go with her." He gave a long sigh of relief, and seized her cold hand. "Rose, you cannot tell what a weight you have taken off my heart!" he exclaimed. "I 'have laid that weight on my own!' .she answered, with a mournful smile. "No; hear me! I will come back to you one day. I swear it, Rose, and I will keep my vowl My mother, too, will welcome you; and then we shall all be happy together. Only have patience, Rose. Let time dispel their prej- udices, and restore you to health, and all will yet be well." "It is a great pity that 1 have recovered." "No; do not say that." "If they had laid me in the grave before you had seen this altered face, my Lord, you would have remembered me with affectionate regret. But now, this dreadful mask will rise before your eyes whenever you think of me, and you will hate me soon-if, indeed, you do not hate me already." She burst into tears as she spoke; and his naturally kind heart was touched at the sight of her distress. ,    "' Don't let that fancy trouble you, my dear," he said, gently. "I remember your face so well as it was, that I can easily forget this change. When I think of you, it will be only as I knew you at first; and by the time I re- turn you will have regained all your beauty, and I shall have the handsomest woman of her yiar to present at St. James's as my wife."  Rose shook her head sadly. "I shall never get my good looks back again,    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6472-00000052"/> my Lord; and if I did, I should never see St, James's Palace." "But vhat do you fear?" "I cannot say. But something stands be- tween you und me ; I cannot tell what it is." "You are nervous and fanciful, my dear. You will lose these notions as you get better." "Perhaps so. But never mind me. Tell me of yourself. Where shall you go?" "My mother wishes to travel on the Conti- nent." "Iow soon?" "I don't know what you will say to it, but she wants to go at once." "Next week?" "To-morrow." She turned very pale, and clasped her hands convulsively over her heart. "This is our last meeting, then?" "I fear so. I do not think I can get over from the Priory to-morrow, we start so early." "No; do not come," she said, faintly ;and leaning back in the chair, she put her hand be- fore her eyes.  !"Where is your wedding-ring?" asked Lord Mountchayne, suddenly. "Here." She drew it from her breast. He took it from the silken cord, and placed it upon her hand. "Wear it openly now," he said. "The se- cret is a secret no longer. And now, Rose, 'isuen while I tell you what provision I have made for you during my absence. My father allows me only five hundred pounds a year; for he is a poor man, and till his death I shall have nothing more. I have placed two hundred pounds at your disposal iu the bank of Downe, and by the time you have used that sum, I shall return. Now where would you like to live? At the Priory?" "Oh no!" she said, with a shudder. "Shall I order my father's steward to hire a villa for you in the neighborhood?" "Oh no! Let me stay here, where I was born!" she said, glancing round the humble room with yearning affection. "I could not be happy in another home than this, alone!" "Very well, if you wish it. But you must have some one here to stay with you." "Must I?" "  Some nice, kind woman, who will be like a mother to you. Do you know of any one?" Mrs. Pryor." -        - "The housekeeper at the Pleasaunce?" "Yes." "Will she come?" "She might for a time. She is going to leave the Pleasaunce." "Then ask her to stop with you. There will be room enough in the cottage for you both." "Oh yes " "And you will try to be happy, or at least contented, while I am away?"   "I will try." "I shall write to you often, and shall expeet you to write to me at least once a month, Will - you do so?" "Gladly." "And 1 will send you a box of books from town next week, and a cottage-piano. You e must manage to make room for it somewhere, andtake lessons. I should be glad to hear you - play when I come back again." Rose lifted up her heavy eyes, and smiled. There was something painful, and yet ludicrous, t to her in all these directions-these preparations for a life which was never to be lived. He had tired of her; he was casting her off; it was their last meeting, perhaps, on earth; and, by way of consolation, he was advising her to learn-to play the piano! "Why do you smile, Rose?" he asked impa- tiently. ,' Do you not approve of ile provis- ions I am making for your comfort and happi- ness while I am gone?" w"You are very kind.  1 will do all you wish." "Then, pray, look more cheerful. I wish you would go to the Priory. It scarcely seems right to leave yoiu in this little place." , "I am best here-best suited to this place," was her only answer. "Rose, I believe in your heart you have not forgiven me," he said, after watching her for a moment.  You think I ought to have come to you." "No; I assure you I did not expect it." "You would have come to me had I been ill?" "Yes. But-then men are very different from women, and they love differently." She was only uttering her simple convictions. She did not mean to be sarcastic; but he start- ed up from his seat, with a frown, as she spoke. Now that her beauty was gone, it became neces- sary for her to pick and choose her words, if she wished to avoid giving him offence. "Well, we will not part unkindly," he said. Let the past go, since it is past, and trust to the future. When I come back, Rose, you wiil be well again, and my mother ivill soon be reconciled. I cannot stay with you now, and break her heart. But remember one thing: though she disowns you, you are her daughter and my wife; and as such, enittlcd to the re- spectful attention of my people here. I shall make that fully understood before I go; and if any of them dare be rude to you, let me know, and they shall be instantly discharged. Will you promise me this?" "Yes," she said, faintly. "And you will write often?" "Yes." "Tell me everything about yourself, mind." "I will." He stood silent a moment, then said, with an effort   :'I must go.  Good-bye, Rose-good-bye, dear wife! and may God keep you safe and well till we meet again!" He did not kiss her. He shrank with fastidi ous disgust from those parched and swollen lips; and she saw it, and turned her face away, with an added pang. "Good-bye!" she faltered, and bowed her head a moment upon his hand. The next instant, the door closed. It was over, then! He had gone and left her. Perhaps on earth those two would never meet again. "Oh! what have I done to deserve such misery?" she murmured; and fainted quietly on her pillows, just as the good'old nurse came trotting in to look after her charge. CIAPTER XXXVI. ANOTHER KIND OF LOVE. "Though thy voice may lose its sweetness, And thine eye its brightness too; Though thy step may lack its fleetness, And thy hair its sunny hue; "Still to me wilt thou be dearer Than all the world can own; I have loved thee for thy beauty, But not for that alone! "I have watched thy heart, my Mary, And its goodness was the wile That has made me thine for ever Bonnie Mary of Argyll!" - OLD SONG. As a matter of course, Rose had a relapse. In fact, she nearly died! The mere fset of her illness only shows how foolish it is to care too much for any one in this world. I beg to state that this observation is addressed solely to the womenkind who may read it. I should never dreamof doing such an absurd thing as to give advice to men in a mat ter of the heart, when it is a well-established fact that they are born without such inconven- ient appendages. No; a man, if he is liked too little or too much, bears it, in either case, most philosophically. If Phillis is unkind, he rushes from her presence, swearing that he will shoot or hang himself, and may be found within the hour smoking a cheroot at his club, or strolling i up and down Rotten row, with a critical eye to the  pretty faces that are mustered there. IfPhillisis  too fond-say she is his wife, and somewhat ab-  surdly affectionate in her manner-he yawns I mentally, listens to her prattle with an inatten-  tive ear, says yes and no in the wrong places,  lnd finally pleads a pressing engagement, which takes him to the pit of the opera-house, just as the ballet is beginning. But a woman loved over-much can rarely hide E that she is bored. She yawns physically, rather t than mentally-she snaps and snarls at noth- r ing; is given to wish herself dead, or in heaven; and generally contrives to make it manifest to i eyes that are not too blind to see, that her lot  is not exactly an enviable one. While, if she is , , \   e, not loved-nh, me!-no cigar, no clnugossip, "no brilliant Rotten' Row, ca heal that wound  She hides herself from every eye; she can. i not, because she will not, be cured; she loses heart, and hope, and courage, altogether; and thinks, as Rose did, that death will end it best of all! And aJ this, it may be, for the sake of r some man whose eyes are out of the right line, whose nose is a snub, and whose h's are not al- ways exactly where they should be! The game may not be worth the powder and shot, it is t true. But, then, one of the last things that will go out of fashion is, the folly of a woman. a Rose, tossing again on her sick bell, and call- 7 ing wildly on the lover who would come no e more! Lord Mountchayne in Londcn, the pet of an aristocratic circle of friends, some of whom were to travel with him! Which picture do you like the best? I know who had the most sense of the two. The box of books came. So did the cottage piano, which was a gem of its kind, and the wonder and admiration of all the simple vil- lagers, who came to see it unpacked. So came the letter; and it was kind, though somewhat cold. It began, "My dear wife," and ended, "Your affectionate husband, Mountehayne ;" and was very correct and proper, and very im- portant in a legal point of view, since it acknowl- edged the relation between them, in unmistak- able black and white. As if Rose cared for le- legal proofs! Dearer to her would have been the fondest scrap of nonsense--the most absurd pet name, to prove that she still held the first place in her lover's heart. But that assurance he could not give! She was "Lady Mountehayne" now; but she was no longer Rose neither to him, nor to any one else. She had gained a title, but she had lost her old familiar friends, as well as her lover. They seemed afraid to visit her- they called her "Madam," and looked shyly in- to her changed face. They loved her still, but no longer as one of themselves. If Lord Mount- chayne had disowned her, every house in the village would have been her home-every man and woman in the village her brother or her sister. But le had acknowledged her readily enough. The servants at the Priory drank her. health, as their future mistress; and one day she would reign supreme in the great house, anl go up to London, and be presented to the Queen! How, then, could the simple village-maidens of- fer themselves as her equals and companions during her temporary seclusion and security? She sat apart in her dreary grandeur, broken- hearted beneath its weight. By slow degrees she recovered from the shock of that cruel in- terview, took her place beside the window once more, and the .marks of the disease had almost passed away. She had lost her brilliant bloom, it is true, and resembled a lily rather than a rose. But her cheek was smooth again, though very pale, and her eyes as bright and blue as    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6472-00000053"/> ever; while the golden hair, which had fallen al- most entirely off during her illness, began to grow again in soft tentril-like curls, like those so often seen upon the head of a very young child. Her smile was as sweet as ever, but far more sad; and her whole face had a look of patient sorrow, much as a saint's might wear. There were many-and Hugh Dennett was one of the number-who said that she was even more beautiful than she had been before her illness. - The young blacksmith ought to have been in America by the last of August. In fact, his passage had been already taken, but he gave it up, and waited at Downe, till Rose was quite re- covered-waited till her husband had left her, and she had, in a measure, reconciled herself to the loss. Then, with a great pang tugging at his heart, he made his arrangements once again, and secured a berth on a fast-sailing steamer bound straight for New York. He was to leave by the mail-coach, which left Downe at nine in the evening, in time to catch the first train for London. Rose had been warned of his intention, and was awaiting him with some impatience. Now that another and a dearer love had failed her, there was some comfort in the thought that here at least was one heart that still was true. She was Lord Mountchayne's deserted wife-but she was also Hugh Dennett's first love; and her wounded spirit and hurt vanity were somewhat soothed by that certain knowledge. Pale, trembling, and .with a sick remembrance of other and happier days, Hugh Dennett en- tered the little room where he had so often been a welcome ind honored guest. The same old-fashioned chairs-the same bright, polished fender-the same pictures up- on the walls-the same little round table where he had so often sat on the long winter evenings, hindering Rose in her work or teaching her how to play backgammon, checquers, and chess Nothingaltered! Nothing, did I say? Nay -there was the vacant seat of the old laborer; there was Rose, with the plain gold ring upon her hand, which typified a future coronet upon her head ; there was himself, no longer gay and happy, but a broken-spirited and broken-heart- ed man, on the point of exiling himself from his native land for ever Yes, within these four low walls, some things were changed. He went up to Rose, who still occupied her favorite seat beside the window, and took her hand. He had meant to be coldly respectful, as befitting in the presence of the future Count- ess. But at thie first touch of those slight fin- gers-at the first look into that dearly loved yet altered face, lhis pride and his resolution broke down together.  Let her be what she might to others, to him she must remain for ever Rose, the "Rose of the world l"-the woman whom he loved so dearly, that to die for   her sake would be tjie happiest fate that could befall him i--the woman for whose sake he had hoped to live!-the wo man whom he had hoped to see the light of his happy homer--his own dear wife, and the mother of his children! It was all over now-all over now! He had no hope for the future connected with her ; and the memory of the past was the keenest anguish he could feel. Yet, in the midst of his life- wreck, it was sweet to sit beside her once again; sweet, even though he had no longer a claim upon her kindness I They were both silent. He, because he was afraid to speak, lest he should burst into tears; she, because a still small voice was whispering in her ears, that it would have been better for her if she had been satisfied with this love that had proved itself so true If she hadnever gone to the Priory-if she had never looked into Lord Mountchayne's beautiful eyes-if she had never listened to his flattering words, how much brighter life would have looked at that mo- ment! We all say "if it had not been", you know, when the mischief is done-when the bird is un- caged-when the stel is stolen through the un- locked stable-door. "If it had not been," for- tunes would have been made, that are lost for ever now-reputations tarnished to-day would have been left intact-friends would have been true, and lovers not lost--exiles would not have left their country, nor members of families their homes--you .would have been happy, and I should have been wise! But it was, and so all was spoiled; and the whole world is at sixes and sevens with us for ever! Poor Rose Of what avail were her unspoken regrets? She fell ashamed of them almost as soon as they sprang into existence, and broke the silence which was becoming, so dangerous. A'nd so you are going away, Hugh?" she said, softly. "Yes, Rose-away from the old village- away from the old friends, and away from you " She sighed, and dropped her eyes. "Does it grieve you to go?" "Not much-why should I stay here now?" Although he tried to make it kind, his tone was reproachful, and her deprecating glance showed that she felt it so. "I don't mean to blame you, Rose," he add- ed, hastily. "I don't want to say a single word that can give you pain. But you must know that any place on earth would be better for me now than Downe. I stayed to see you well once more. I have nothing else that can keep me in the village for a single day." "You are right to go, and I understand you perfectly. But, Hugh, if you suffer ihen you think of me, remember this, I suffer too-and be merciful 1" "Yes, you suffer through him 1" said Hugh,   clenchinpi his hands and setting his teeth in- stinctivelv. 'I Huslh!" snid Rose. "He is my husband- you must not forget that! He means it all for the best, no doubt, and I cannot expect him to give up his mother for me. It would not be right for him to do so. 'Still, it is hard to bear ; and you can forgive me the more readily, Ilugh, since I am not happy. I cannot afford to lose even one of my friends now." "You have not lost me, Rose-you never will lose me!" said the young man, with a trembling voice. "To the day of my death I will be your true friend, since I can be nothing more. And if you are ever in need of me-if you ever say, 'Hugh, I want your help,' I will come to you, though your letter may find me at the other end of the world! 1Will you re- member this?" Much moved, she placed her hand in his, Then some sudden impulse tempted her to ask him if he found her much changed. For some moments he looked at her with a sad smile.  ' "You can never change to me, Rose!" "But I have grown so thin and pale!" she said, sighing. "You are almost lovelier than you used to be, if that will- entent you! I never thought, six 'weeks ago, that you would-" He stopped short, for the surprised silence she fixed upon him reminded him that he had betrayed his secret. "Six weeks ago!" she cried. "Why, I was then-oh, how horribly I looked then! How did you see me, Hugh '" There was nothing for it 6ut to tell her the whole truth. "I watched here day and night, Rose. It was I who brought all your medicines, your fruit, your flowers! No; don't thank me! Good hcavens! if you could only know the pleasure it gave me to serve you, you would never dream of doing that! I would have fetched and car- ried like a dog, by day and by night, if it could have given you a moment's rest from pain!" Rose's eyes filled with tears. HJHoie'uiA she help contrasting this blind, unselfis!'reXVtion with the indifference of her husband'd"How could she help remembering that the one caught glimpses of her now and then in the very height of that loathsome disease, yet floved her all the same; while the other's first glAnce at her altered face showed her that it had aliehhated his heart, perhaps for ever? '"Hugh, I wish I had known you better when we were together," she said, with a faltering voice. "I was not worthy of you, and I had Itue presumption to think that you were not worthy of me.' Forgive me for that, with all the rest, and remember that I will never forget this kindness of yours till the day I die-never cease to hold you in my heart as my best and   I dearest friend. Now let us talk of something else. ,Let us talk of America-that land of promiseiwhere you are going." He tPassed, his hand across his eyes, and then said, quietly:'"It is a land of promise, indeed. It is a land where the poor man can become rich, -'and, what is more, a gentleman, if lie sets the right way about it." "And what are you going to do there?" tim- idly asked Rose. " Turu farmer, in the first place, and go out -and'settle upon Government land. There are rare openings in the West for a man with a strong arm and a bold heart; and I hope I have both," he said, with animation. :"I know you have, my poor Hugl," she re- plied, sadly. In ten years, Rose, I hope to be your rich Hugh. I believe I can make my fortune there; and as the first step I take will be to become a naturalized citizen of the Republic as soon as possible, you may hear of me yet in the hall of Congress-who knows?" he exclaimed. "I hope I may " "Straugei things have happened there. Many a legislator has driven a heard of cows- to pas- ture in his boyhood; many a President grasps the reins of G-'veriment with a hand that has grown hard against the plowshare.  It is a great country, Rose, that can afford to make its great men thus; and I shall try hard for the prizes which are won by the most deserving, partly because the struggle will give me an ob-  ject to live for; but, most of all, because I think my success will please you, Rose." In conversation like this the time passed rap- idly away. All his schemes for the future were poured into her listening ear-all his bright dreams and hopes received a stamp of approval from her gentle lips;, and when the time came for them to part, he felt strong enough to give the whole world battle, and she confident of his entire success. As he rose to say good-bye, she took a flower from her beautiful hair and gave it to him. "Keep that to remind you of England and of me, and of all that I expect you to do," she said, with a sad smile, "It shall be my talisman-it shall never leave me while I live; and when I die, its ashes shall mingle with mine in my grave," he axnswered, in a trembling voice. "Now, farewell, Rose. If my future boasts of any action that is good and pure, I shall owe it to this evening and to you. God bless you-God keep you-for ever, Rose!" "Good-bye!" she sadly murmured through her tears. He kissed her hand-but could not speak. With that little English flower upon his breast, he went away, and Rose was once more alone. 4r    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6472-00000054"/> CHAPTER XXXVII. IN THE LION'S DEN. "Steal softly in, for she who sitteth there, Pale in her watching, mindless of the night, Alone with that faint taper's gleaming light, Thus findeth refuge, from a world of care. Oh! twine no chaplet for her brow ; no voice That tells of fame can make her heart rejoice! She giveth form to visions of delight, That throng the simple hearth-stone, and the soul Alive to genial promptings, and would ask Requitance of the same for her sweet task. And should a cadence born of sorrow roll Along a voice she may not all control, Yet not the less an angel lurketh nigh, To feed life's flickering lamp, and heavenward lift the eye."       -E. OAK E SMTH. Our two heroines were, therefore, left entirely alone; the one, by her own act-the other, by the will of those who controlled her destiny, rather than her own. Of the two solitudes, Marian's was by far the most preferable. In the first place, the romance and fun of her disguise compensated for the con- straint it sometimes put upon her movements. She could not laugh, and dance, and sing, in her own room, if a frisky fit seized upon her; or go down the stairs three at a time, if she was in a hurry to reach the street-door. But then she could go out at any hour of the day or night, without exciting remarks; and many was the strange place she visited-many were the strange scenes she saw from behind the shelter of those spectacles of hers. Besides these amusements, she had an em- ployment of whose dignity she entertained the most absurd ideas. Acting upon Bessie's hint, she was trying her hand at authorship, and put- ting down in black and white a narrative of all shat she herself had undergone during the last few months. It was a pleasant occupation. The romance of her sorrow still remained, though its keenest sting had gone; and it was a mourn- ful yet sweet relief to recall all that she had thought and felt during her brief season of de- lusive joy-all that Mountchayne had said and looked, before he had been won away from her by the face of the young May Queen. I know a lady writer who makes a point of falling in love periodically, in order to supply herself with subject-matter for her forthcoming novels. And Marian was unconsciously doing the same thing for the first time, when she finished her story, and sat looking at the neat manuscript, with something of the proud happiness a young mother feels when she gazes upon her first-born child. Having written her story, the next thing was to sell it. Never doubting for one instant of her success, she folded it up in a neat parcel, wrote on the outside: "The Sorrows of an Or- phan. An Ower True Talc. By Marian. Price 100," and set off to seek her fortune among the publishers: 1t was the most ludicrous of errands. Don /   Quixote tiug at the windmills was a miracle of good se se compared to Marian with her one- hundred-pound novel. And so she began to fancy dimly before she had gone very fa. Of course, she saw very few publishers in pro- pria persona. The clerks in charge of the dif- ferent establishments took her for a woman of fifty, and indulged in some pretty audible jokes together as to the success of " the old party" in the path of literature, before they conde- scended to inform her that "Mr. So-and-so re- gretted to decline, but their list was entirely filled up for some months to come". Others would not even trouble themselves to look at her MS. Others, still, recommended her to ap- ply to the periodicals who published " that sort of thing". Taking this advice, in sheer desperation, she made her way into office after office, only to re- "ive civil denials, wondering stares, and half- concealed smiles, which she forgot to set down to the account of her disguis as she ought to have done. At last, heartsick and. humiliated, she ascended the steps of an office, where she determined to make one final application, and if it failed, go back into obscurity-perhaps re- turn to Philip Vere. A shock-headed boy met her at the door, and in answer to her inquiry for the editor, said, glibly, "This way, Mum!" and showed her into a large apartment, strewed with books and papers, where a sharp-looking lad of fourteen sat at a high desk, apparently writing, but really listening to the conversation of two gen- tlemen behind him. One of these, a tall, grace- ful foreigner, was explaining with many ges- tures, and much broken English, the plan of a manuscript which he held in his hand. The other, a tall, thin young man, in glasses, with a small face, remarkable for nothing save its ex- pression of stolid gravity and complacent con- ceit, listened without moving a muscle of his countenance. Both turned round when Murian entered. The thin young man stepped toward her, and asked in a voice of funereal gravity: "Pray, what is your pleasure, Madam?" "Is this the office of the --?" she asked, half afraid that she had made some blunder, and got into a judge-advocate's room, or an un- dertaker's establishment. "It is, Madam," he replied with a most awful bow. "I wish to speak to the editor." "He stands before you, Madam," was the stern reply. Then seeing her glance at the French gentleman, he added, more impressively than before :-"I am the editor, Madam. If you will take a chair, I will attend to you directly." Marian sat down. The lad in the corner glanced at her inquisi. lively, and she dared not laugh. But the incli-   nati,n to do so became stronger and stronger ev.-ry moment. The paper was a weekly periodical of the usual kind-filled with engravings, love-stories, historiettes, and merry anecdotes. There was nothing in its columns to justify the funereal gravity of its editor. He had to read the proofs of as many sensation novels and comical stories as the rest of his brethren, year by year; yet from his matncr one would have thought nothing. more mirthful than Young's "Niight Thoughts" or Fox's "Book of Martyrs" had ever been under his supervision. The truth was,- that he had but lately entered on the duties of his post; and being somewhat given to over-estimating himself, and under- estimating his fellow-creatures, he had come to think it the highest of all earthly posi- tions. To sit in that editorial chair, and reign supreme over a host of contributions and a "Balaam's basket", was all he asked of for- tune to bestow. When he went out in the streets, he fancied that people said to each other, "There goes - , the editor of the-", and took airs upon himself accordingly. He ate, drank, and slept as an editor-never as a ynan! Whatever he said, did, or thought, had me reference to that unhappy paper and his onnection with it; and his friends and ac- quaintances fled in terror when they saw him coming, so sure were they -of the conversation that must ensue. Your wife and children might die-your house might be burned to the ground --your fortune might take to itself wings-your friends cut you-and if you went to him with the tale of sorrow, he would answer you with the last account of the number of copies that horrilble paper had sold. , Saturated, as he was, with the idea of his own and his journal's importance, it was no wonder that he "assumed the god"-when in personal conference with his would-be contributors. He approached Marian with a look of supreme con- descension; took the neat little parcel from her outstretched hand, and deigned to say, "Mann-  script?" "Yes," she answered, biting her lip. "For the  ?" "If it is liked." "'The Sorrows of an Orphan'. Hum-ha! Prose, of course?" "Oh, yes." "Ever written before?" "Never." "OOh dear me! Will you allow me to keep it a few days? I will look it over. If I do not like it, you shall have it again. If I do-hum! -I'll give you five pounds for it, Madam " Five pounds I and she had marked it a hun- dred pounds! The magnificent air with which he named the sum, was too much for her gravity. She took the manuscript, muttered timidly that she   would call again, and made ncr escape. No doubt the worthy editor thought her mad. He would have been sure of it had lie seen her five minutes later-laughing, as if she would choke herself, in a quiet corner of the court. "Now, I wish I knew what amuses you so," said a rich, mellow voice by her side. She started and looked round. A  sunny- faced, white-haired old gentleman, whose mouth looked as if it could do nothing but smile, stood there, looking as if he would very much like to laugh too. Some lucky impulse made Marian give him a description of her visit to the editor. He laugh- ed till the tears ran down his cheeks. "Capital!" he cried. "The man to the very lifd! Give me your story, Madam, and I'll see justice done to it. Why, that is my paper, and my editor. Come here the day after to- morrow, and I hope we shall be able to give you an engagement." Marian's propensity to laugh had served her a good turn at last. She was engaged, within three days, upon the paper, at a salary of three pounds a week. It' seemed a fortune in her eyes, and never were fairer castles built in the air than those she constructed while she sat be- fore her desk. CHAPTER XXXVIII. A STRANGE MEETING. "There breathe but few whose aspect might defy The full encounter of his searching eye ; He had the skill, when Cunning's gaze would seek To probe his heart, and watch his changing cheek, At once the observer's purpose to espy, And on himself roll back his scrutiny, Lest he to Conrad rather should betray Some secret thought, then drag that chiefs to-day. There was a laughing devil in his sneer, That raised emotions both of rage anA fear; And where his frown of hatred darkly'fell, Hope withering fled-and Mercy sighed farewell!" -BYRON. For six months all went on well with Marian. She was employed regularly, paid regularly, and found more pleasure in her humble home and simple way of life, than any one could have imagined she would do. To her kind patron, the genial, merry-hearted old publisher, she had communicated some- thing of her own story; and, by his advioe, she had removed to other lodgings, and laid aside her disguise. "Masquerading is all very well in books, my dear child," he observed; "but we are such very matter-of-fact people in England, that we begin to suspect something is wrong the mo- ment there is anything hidden, so throw off your weeds, and let me see you as' you really are." She took his advice, losing somewhat in good looks by the exchange, but gaining immensely in his opinion, which was a matter of far great- er importance. Dressed neatly and becomingiy    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6472-00000055"/> in apparel suited to her age and sex, she tool a pleasant lodging in Brotmpton, and was fairly embarked upon the great sea of literature, un- der far more favorable auspices than many more worthy than herself could boast. She was very happy in her quiet way. The key-note of her character was a melancholy one, it is true, but over and around the minor chords played brilliant fantasias of joyous mel- ody; and she always impressed those who met her with the notion that she was one of the gay- est, happiest creatures on earth. Too philo- sophical to' mourn long over unattainable joys, too busy to fret over departed ones; her days were full of work, which was sufficiently en- grossing to tire her, and her evenings were spent at theatres, at concerts, wherever her good-natured patron deemed it right and proper that she should go. Having taken it into his head that she was an ill-used personage, he made an immense pet of her; and, as he had a kind old wife, who was quite as fond of her as himself, there was no danger of that ill-natured scandal which too often spoils, and sometimes utterly prevents, such friendly relations be- tween publishers and the lady-writers whom they employ. In one of the pleasant flowery suburbs of London this kind old couple had their home; and Marian was a most welcome visitor at "awn Mead" whenever it suited her to go there. Her Sundays were generally spent with them and with the guests who so often came to enjoy their hospitality. The lawn was a favor- ite resort with all students of character; for Mr. and Mrs. Canton were most Catholic in their recognition of talent. Artists, poets, au- thors, reporters, inventors, orators, actors, sing- ers, and musicians-all knew the way to Lawn Mead, and took it so often that the cottage at times could scarcely find room to accommodate its merry visitors. They did not mind a little inconvenience, however. There were im- promptu gatherings on the lawn, and moon- light dances, and amateur theatricals, and gip- -ying parties, and strawherry feasts-every- thing, in short, that was informal and delight- ful, offhand and hearty. If any one came once  to that pleasant place, he or she was very apt to wish to come again; and Marian considered  herself highly favored in being, in a measure, the daughter of the house. 'Every one unbent  there, unless it was the stiff editor, who could not forget his own importance, even while he  ate strawherry ices, and drank lemonade in the i garden porch. Everybody, with that one ex- ( ception, seemed to be simply and naturally ] happy-every one looked delighted with them- . selves and their neighbors, a state of beatitude  very seldom attained to by an Englishman in i company, or-low be it spoken-by an 'English i woman, either.  In this strangely mixod, yet really select cir-   a I cl of guests, Marian, by degrees, grew to be y quite at home. At first she was shy and timid. i- and fancied that whenever she spoke she made e herself ridiculous. But as the number of guests increased, her self-distrust wore away. e She saw other plain women there besides herself y -nay, some who were downright ugly, and vet r they were liked and listened to by every one. - She tool courage then, and ventured to open t her mouth. Finding that she could open it to - some purpose if she chose, one after another - out of the throng- began to talk with her. She , had no sooner begun to converse than she for- 3 got herself entirely (a thing which often hap- - Hens to very shy people), and made so agree- able a companion, that no party was considered a success unless she was there. Add to this so- cial popularity among the most agreeable peo- ple, the fact that little by little she was going , up the ladder of literary advancement-that her stories (simple sketches of evcry-day life though they were), were beginning to be read, liked, and inquired for; and that she, like all other beginners, thought this meant fame, which was to endure to the end of the world, and you will understand that her position was by no means an unenviable one. She changed greatly during those few short months-for better, and for worse. For better, since her shyness and morbid sen- sitiveness had gone, in a great measure, for ever. And because the kindness shown to her by her benefactor and his wife had softened her heart, and made her more disposed to look upon the world at large with friendly eyes. For worse, because, from being shy and hum- ble, she had grown to be, in the secret depths of her heart, both arrogant and proud. Because she had also grown luxurious and selfish. Her simple home-her quiet dress, no longer suited her. She pined for luxury-for wealth. She longed for a handsome house, where she, too, might entertain a host of friends; she wanted a carriage of her own, and some thoroughbred horses to draw it; she would' have liked splendid dresses, and magnificent jewels, and all the countless goods and pleasures which nothing but round pieces of the yellow metal known as gold can possibly procure. Now, a carriage, and a coachman, ant foot- men, and two thoroughbred horses, together with a saddle-horse for the Park, to say nothing of fine dresses and costly jewels, cannot, by any alchemy of which I am cognizant, be conjured out of five pounds per week. That sum was Marian earning by her pen. Not one1penny did she save. At the week's end her purse was al- ways empty. It was not enough; and there was danger of her growing envious of her richer friends, and a little discontented with her own position, promising as it was. At this time, if she had been free, she would V   have man led a manl for lis wealth nnd position, rather than for any affection she felt for him. "Love was the greatest nonsense in the world," she averred, with a manifest sincerity that kept any would-be suitor at bay, through dread of making himself ridiculous, and getting well laughed at. Mammon was by far the. most re- slpectable power in her eyes! And then the thought would flash across her mind, "Did not that horrible Philip Vere tell me that he held the key of my fortune in his hand? Why need I fear him? I am no longer a stupid child. Why should I not seek him out, and ask what this wonderful secret can be?" The thought lay dormant in her mind so long, that, at last, it shaped itself into a pur- pose. She would not let a fortune slip through her grasp, from an absurd dislike to the person who alone knew where it lay. And, according- ly, she went one morning straight into the lion's den. in other words, she hired a cab, drove to the house from which she hail made a moonlight flitting only eight months before, and asked to see Mr. Vere. But who can answer for the change eight long months may make in a London street and its in- habitants. Eight monoths! why, in that time, an English gentleman may take a trip "fromn Corluhll to Cairo", and discover the source of the Nile, by way of amusement, before he re- turns, if he likes. In eight months, you may make a tour through America; you may make a fortune or lose one'; you may get married or brought, up before Sir Cresswell Cresswell to settle your domestic affairs; you may find yourself at the top of the tree and lo;v down among the trees; you may be famous and infa- mous; b loved and hated; a millionaire whom all delight to honor, and a convict breaking stones-all in that little space of time. If countries can be ruined, and emnpires lost and won, in so many weeks, surely a London street may change all its innimtes, without exciting a eingle exclamation of surprise. Yet Marian was surprised, when a strange  I face appeared at the door, and a strange voice, with a most unmistakable brogue, informed her that nothing whateverwas known there of any  Mr. Vere-still less of any Madame Angelo l] Marianl drove back to her 13rompton lodgings, i feeling somewhat bewildered, angry, and disap- I pointed. It was very vexatious, that when just I as shy ventured to move one of the figures in her game of life for the first time, it should  be suddenly whisked away out of her sight and E reach--for aught she knew-for ever I    t She did not know where to seek for the truant i pair. She fancied that they were together, and  that to find one would be to discover the other. E But Bessie, whose advice she asked, could give X no guess as to their whereabouts. Mr. Vere had no business-address in London, and she did not  know the name of the club to which he belong.    n, ed, and Madame Angelo had no friends or ac- i. quaintances in the city, so that to search for her, was, the girl averred, like " looking for a needle ) in a bundle of hay". She seemed to wonder why )f any one could wish to do such a thing. " "If they've gone, Marian, joy go with them, - I say. It's the best thing thatever happened e to you, in my opinion, to get rid of a man like )t that so easily." d  Marian did not choose to enlighten her too d far; so she only smiled, said good-bye, and went i. back to her room again. But often she laid t down the rapid pen, and leaned back in a chair, while between her and the well-filled paperrose o the brightest visions of the future - visions - which mighyell make her forget the more 4o- ber present d the fitful light of their spletiid, glow.  oAlonger poor, no longer toilihgifor- - her daily bread, no longer chaining her triunt-" fancy to so many pages of ' copy" each wel ,; in order to supply those cormorants of printers,- t and their ravenous machinery! In the future, all was light, and bright, and beautiful. There was to be no more drudgery, only that light and pleasant labor which is one of love, and which really does justice-to the worker. There was a stately home, filled with gay and gallant guests-and she the light and centre of them all! Rich; famous, young, and full of health, what would there then be left for her to desire? But, alas! the key to this paradise was lost, unless she found the missing Philip Vere. She never, thought of him as her husband. He was something to be dreaded and feared at first; something to be found now, since so much depended upon his presence; something to be made use of-never something to be loved! How was he to be told that she needed him? She knew that'he would come at her bidding, since it was for his own interest to do so. But how should she summon him? She thought of the first column of the Times. Laughed at the idea at first, yet gradually be- gan to think it a feasible one. Some one must surely see those appeals, and answer them, else why did people go on inserting them? She wrote out a neat little form for the paper thus :-"Downe Reserve.-Will P. V. inform I M. M. where he is now to be found?" slipped it in her pocket, and went down to the office, in- tending to take it to the Times herself that af- ternoon. Chance ordained, however, that the sumi which she had set aside to pay for its insertion should remain in her purse; for as shle sat in the editor's room that- morning, correcting the proofs of her story, while the editor himself loomed imposingly over a review oil the other side of the table, she heard her k11ld patron's voice outside, in a most animated key. "Nonsense, my dear Sir! I insist upon your coming in! She will take it quite as a cotmpli- ment, I assure you!"    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6472-00000056"/> The door was flung open. Marian looked up, and the solemn editor elevated his eyebrows to an angle of forty-five degrees, as Mr. Canton entered, leading a tall, handsome gentleman by the arm. "My dear child, this is my best friend - my adopted son, I may say-just returned from a tour of several years in the East. Shake hands, as you two must be great friends!!' Thus the old man rattled on. And Marian sat, pale and silent, looking up into the dark, laughing eyes of Philip Vere. CHAPTER XXXIX. DARBY AND JOAN. "He knew himself a villain-but he deemed The rest no better than the thing he seemed And scorned the best as hypocrites who hiJ Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did. He knew himself detested, but he knew The hearts that loathed him, crouched, and dreaded too. Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt From all affection and from all contempt;  His name could sadden, and his acts surprise; But they that feared him dared not to despise; Man spurns the worm, but-pauses ere he wake The slumbering venom of the folded snake; The first may turn-but not avenge the blow; The last expires-but leaves no living foe; Fast to the doomed offender's form it clings, And he may crush-not conquer-still it stings!" -B RON. No doubt, you think I have chosen a most peculiar place for the meeting of my hero and heroine. A dull city office! a printing-office to boot! with a solemn owl of an editor, and a small boy looking on! Well-I don't know! Romantic scenes have not always romantic sur- roundings, except upon the stage. One of the most horrible tragedies of modern lifewas per- formed in a dusty office in the Strand, when two men nearly hacked each other to pieces, for the sake of a light-hearted woman, who probably laughed at them both when she read the account of their awful death in her next day's paper. And I, who write these words, have witnessed as pathetic a little drama as one would see at the New Adelphi, within the four walls where those heartless instruments of 'torture-those racks for luckless authors-known as "Hoe's cylinder presses", were grindling out their un- wearying remorseless din. I have seen a part- ing most heartrending, where a foreman in  paper cap and white apron looked unconscious- i ly on. I have seen the anguish of a broken  spirit show itself in'the eyes that were only  raised from the long strips of "proof" for an instant. I have seen, in fact, a woman and a man who loved each other dearly, part from  i amid that noisy din, conscious that it was the  last word on earth, yet never daring to make  either tender, for the careless witnesses that i stood around. Cupid can get into a printing- office as 'well as into a drawing-room, if need  be; and since one of the first novelists of the I   I day introduces hii hero and heroine to each o other in a thlee-penny boat, I have something a like precedent to guide me, in the peculiar place which I choose. Marian--poor child!-knew little aild cared y less just then, whether she was in an editor's a room, or the crypt of the British Museum. ,The first sensation at the sight of that man was one of aversion and horror. Her first thought was, "l He holds my secret in his hands!'. Hler p second, ' Now I shall be rich!". lie looked at her with an amused smile, and held out his hand. "Well, truth is stranger than fiction, to a dead certainty l" he observed. "Who could have expected, when I called to be presented to the most promising authoress of the day, that I should meet you?" She said that his mission was genuine, though not overpowering. He said that he had had no idea of meeting her; but that he was glad at having done so; and she determined, on tie in- stant, never to let him know how eagerly she had looked for him. Accordingly, she mur- mured an almost inaudible greeting, which he was at liberty to translate in any way he chose, and waited his further movements, with a per- fectly-composed air. The good publisher, by this time, was star- ing from one to the other, in the utmost bewild- erment. "You know Mr. Verner, then?" he asked of Marian. "Oh, perfectly!" she answered, with a smile that made'Mr. Yere utter a small mental oath, and break in somewhat rudely, with: "This is neither the time nor the place for explanation, much as you have to make, Marian. If you will allow me to accompany you home, Mr' Canton will, perhaps, look in upon us this even- ing, and hear all we have to tell him?" "As you please!" And she gathered up her papers, locked her desk, nodded a good-bye to her old friend, and left the office, utterly overlooking the arm which Mr. Vere proffered for her acceptance. The worthy old publisher rubbed his. hair furiously the wrong way when they were gone. - "Her home! Call on them-they will ex- plain!. And Je marches her off, without so much as saying, ' By your leave'. And what is  stranger still, she goes! Why, it can't be'; and yet it must! Bless my soul, what a stupid old donkey I was not to see it before!" ' With these incoherent exclamations, the wor- thy old gentleman trotted off, leaving the solemn editor much wondering, and the embryo publisher on the qui vive tdrget at the bottom 5 of this wonderful mystery, ira which his favor- ite, Miss Marian, bore so prominent a share. In the meantime, Marian took her silent com- panion to her lodgings in Brompton. Admit- ting herself by i latch-key, she led him into a   small but beautifully-frmiished drawing-room, motioned him to a sofa, took off her bonnet and cloak, unlocked a small chiffonler, and brought him a glass of wine and a plate of biscuits with the most immovable gravity. 'He made a low bow, drank the wine, and pushed the plate aside. "There is some sign of hope for me, since you allow me to break bread beneath your roof," he remarked. "And now sit down here beside me, and let us hear all about it." "I have nothing to tell," she said, quietly, taking an easy-chair at a little distance from the sofa. "Nothing! Well, that is a good one! A star of the first magnitude in the literary firmament, and yet not one word to say as to the cause, of your shining!" "You are very kind; but you have given me a brevet rank among the planets!" "Modest! By the piper that played before Moses! I have found a live authoress who ranks herself not as London particular, but as very small beer! Where's Barnum?" "In New York, most probably," replied Mar- ian, quite unmoved beneath his sneers. "I ought to send for him; but I have a great mind to take his business out of his hands and turn showman myself. Do yoa really mean to tell me, my dear. that you have no serious thoughts of setting the Thames on fire?" "You can take a sail as far as Kew with per- fect impunity. The river is in no danger from me." "Well, it is quite refreshing to see that you have some common sense left. Now, what pat you up to this dodge, if I may ask the ques- tion?" "What dodge?" "Pothooks and hangers, my love. Getting your living by the aid of the goose, or by the help of Gillott &amp; Co.!" "Perhaps it was the necessity of getting that living," she answered, quietly. "I should have starved if I had not found out that I could write. Unless, indeed, I had taken in washing or done plain sewing." "For the slop-shops, at the rate of sixpence half-penny a weeks out of which magnificent sum you would have had to board yourself, and pay for lodging, fire, and lights. What a for- tune you would have made there  I doubt whether it -would have been safe to trust you with so much spare cash." '* Perhaps not." "But in this business-for it seems to be a mere matter of bread and butter with you-I should say, you might do pretty well." "Very .wh indeed." He looked round the room.     ?r "That depends upon what your notion of doing pretty well may be. Is this your ohly roomy"    "Oh, no!" "Bedroom  at the back, I suppose, to match?" "Yes." "Hum! let us see. Brussels carpet that has seen its best days; horsehair chairs and sofas; rosewood pianoforte, more than slightly shab- by; sideboards, ditto; tablecloth a shade light- er than the curtains; hearthrug of quite a dif- ferent color; china shepherds and shepherdess- es, and glass vases on the mantle-piece; the 'Death of Nelson', and the 'Coronation of George the Fourth' upon the walls-to say nothing of those two landscapes which might pass for views in New Zealand or in Devonshire.. And this is what you call doing very well in- deed!" Marian smiled. "You have made the most of the room's de. fects. But I have a comfortable home among kind and respectable people-enough to eat, drink, and wear. What more can I ask for?" "Oh, nothing! I was not aware that you had been transformed into a female Diogenes. The tub is admirably adapted for your purpose, if such is the case. I was merely thinking that there were some women in the world who would not object to a whole house in the place of two rooms-to magnificent'furniture in the place of these worn-out chairs and tables-to brocades and moires in the phlce of that very neat black silk you wear-to diamonds in the place of those brown braids which are so becoming to your peculiar style of beauty!" Marian's eyes sparkled, and her cheeks flush- 'ed. In spite of the sneers and sarcasms which he uttered, he was gradually approaching the  sub1ject which she longed to hear discussed. "Perhaps I may have a taste for all the lux- uries you name, as well as other women," she said, carelessly. "But cui bono? My taste woulld only make me unhappy, if I stopped to- tlink about it, since it can never be gratified." "Humph I What fibs you do tell!" "Tiank you for your courtesy." "When you know, as well as I do, that all: these things may be yours for the mere ask- ing!" ' Tell me how?" "I would have done so long ago, if you had but had sense enough to know when you were well off. But you had not. You choose to take a Iliff, and run away jiust when you could have grasped the treasure in your hand. If it had not beon for my own advantage as well as yours, hang me if ever I would have taken a step to find you." "Well, let that pass. You did take steps, I presume?" "I should rather-imagine I did. I hunted London through, and actually put the detectives on your track. How you got away, or where you hid yourself, puzzles me to imagine."    <pb n="104 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6472-00000057"/> Marian lalighed. "Never mind where I went, or what I did. What did you do next?"' "Concluded you had gone to the Continent, and dashed off after you there; the search cost me, I should say, on the whole, about six hun- dred pounds. And all the while you were safe and snug in London. I met our old friend in the Strand this morning, and as I am rather a protege of his, he is wild on the subject of my marriage, and introduces me, with that view, to every pretty girl he comes across. I hnd not seen lim for a long time, and trumped up a story about absence on the Continent and in the East, as an excuse for not reporting myself sooner. The amiable old boy rcepted my ex- cuse immediately, and then went off into rap- tures about you. He said you were the clever- est and nicest woman he ever saw in his life- not a bit of nonsense about you-and so witty that you made him almost die with laughing, the first time. he ever met you. Between you and me, that is no great achievement; for the dear old fellow is always shaking his sides over something or other. But as I had never seen a witty woman in my life, I thought I might as- well improve the opportunity-and lo! the re- ult. The very thing I had been scheming for eight long months, which I had given up at last in sheer disgust, as an utter failure, was brought about in an instant, by a trivial fit of idle curiosity, without any exertion on my own part, which shows my dear, how much better it is after all, to trust implicitly to Providence, than to attempt to paddle your own canoe."  Marian paid little attention to the moral tag  which his recital closed. She had little trust in Providence, but greater trust in destiny; and  it seemed to her that that meeting so strange - so unexpected, yet so exactly what they both  wished, was indeed the work of something about :and beyond themselves.  That something she called, Fate! And for I the first time she felt that her whole future life must be inseparably connected with the life and t fortunes of this mnan who was her husband, and I whom she hated!  Well-be it so! At least she would secure  all the good possible from the unfortunate con, c netion.                  t "And now thit you have found me," she said, i what do you intend to do?" "Make you a rich woman, my' dear, if you kwill but let me." "I assure you I have not the slightest objec- tion." "Ah    I thought as much, notwithstanding all your boasts about the tub. Well, then, shall we let bygones be bygones, and start fair once more?" She was silent.  "Perhaps behaved badly to you at Madame tt Angelo's?"e   , "Only, perhaps 1" id.  "Well, say I did, then; say I am a scampn , and a villain, if you lke, anti you won't be far nt, from the truth! But .t that pass.

OAKEs SMTH. s  "In the first place, it is necessary to go back f for many years," said Mr. Vere; " and to speak of a place whose name will sound most familiar to you-of Downe Reservel" Marian's face flushed instantly. There was then, after all, some connection between her and that deserted place, toward which she had al- ways felt so strong and so mysterious an attrac- tion. "  You know the old crow's nest well enolgh," he went on. "Idare say you like it, tumble- down old nook as it is. More than I do-but that is a matter of taste. Do you happen to know, by the way, how far that estate extends?" "  The fields'and farm are large. They spread to the right and left, as far as you can see," re- plied Marian. "Exactly north and south, east and west, whichever way you choose to look, there lie the lands of Downe Reserve. The wind cannot stir a tree-top, or kiss a flower, within two miles of the house, that does not belong to it   Sweet winds they are, too. It is a pretty part of the country-I must acknowledge that. as the American poem speaks of another place, equally favored: " It may blow north-it still is warm; Or south-it still is clear; Or east-it smells like a clover-farm; Or west-no thunder fear!' "Like a clover-farm! I should like a clover- farm myself, by the way. I wonder if some of the spare land around the house could not be turned into one.  It would be worth trying the experiment.  Only fancy, three or four acres    <pb n="-105" xml:id="VAC6472-00000058"/> of perfume around your home! Where would Jean Maria Farina be then?" Marian folded her hands, and leaned back in her chair, with a look of patient endurance that seemed to say she had given up the idea of fol- lowing his meaning through this rambling rhap. sody about clover-farms. He laughed, and begged her pardon. "I have been so much alone all my life long that I have contracted a very bad habit of talk- ing to myself," he observed. " [ will not stray away from my subject any more to try experi- ments in fancy. Time enough for that when the land is under my foot, and the spade or hoe in my hand. Now, grant me your attention once more. You know that the estate of Downe Re- serve is large; but have you any idea what the property is worth?" "No." "Principal and interest have been accumulat- ing together for the last ten years. There is a very snug little sum laid up in the Three-per- Cents; and the whole of the farms, I should say, coqld not bring in less than five thousand a year. What do you think of that?" "A very nice income for its owner." "And going a begging-positively begging for that owner, my dear!" "Iow is that?" "You have heard the old wives' stories about the house?" "That it is haunted?" "What nonsense!" "Oh, but it is! I sawBomething myself there once 1" Mr. Vere burst into a loud laugh. Is it possible that you believe in ghosts?" "What are they?" 'Ghosts, my dear! But ghost is such a com- mon word. Now, the term which the negroes use, seems to me to have a certain grotesque force in itself which is well suited to the sub- ject. . A ghost is a myth to me. But when you mention a 'spook', I can see the thing at once, coming down a dark passage-a gruesome crea-  ture muffled in a sheet, with a white face, and horns, and a green eye in the middle of its fore-  head, or something of that sort. That is a  'spook', depend upon it 1",  "Then it was no 'spook '," said Marian, smil-  ing. "It was a genuine, old-fashioned English  ghost!"  - *'And in what form did it appear, if I may  ask such a question?"           c "In the form of a lady, who sat on an iron r chest, and wrung her hands and wept."   V Mr. Vcre whistled, and looked both surprised a and interested.              I "A lady on an iron-chest! Where did you s see her?"                 o "  At Downe Reserve."         t "Yes; but where   Inside thb house " c "Yes."   "You were plucky enough to go there? In what room did you see her?" "In a small room at he top of the house. It looks like a bath-room." Again Mr. Vere whistled. ' By Jove! There may be truth in such things, after all. Did you ever hear the history of that lady, Marian?" Not that I am aware of." sBut you surely know the legend of Downe Reserve?" "Oh, yes." I When Downe Reserve shall lose its heir-' Is that what you mean?" OIt is. Downe Reserve did lose its heir' you know." "But I never heard that 'shame and re. morse' lingered there in consequence, as the le- gend said they would do?9 "1No? Think again '" ' Oh, I know 1" and she colored vividly. "If one may tru3t to Madam Rumor, shame came with the last Lady Beaufort', as she was called; and remorse was not long after his brother, I fancy." "No. They were-not very happy." "So rumor says again. But the true story is far stranger than the fictitious one. Shall Itell it to you?" "  If you please." "Lady Beaufort she was in reality. Sir Pranu cis married her." "fPow do you know that?" "You will see presently. She was a hand- some and elegant woman, and the sister of the family solicitor, though that was never known. She did not love the baronet. She was broken. hearted at the loss of a former lover, who was reported dead in the West Indies; and she mar- ried simply to please her brother, who thought it a great thing to be connected with so old a family. Well, she came to Downe Reserve. Sir Francis refused to make his marriage public. lie gave no reason for his conduct; and when she found what it entailed upon her, she refused to leave the house or grounds. If she had gone through the neighborhood, saying, 'I am really Lady Beaufort', no one would have be- lieved her, if he kept silence. She knew this well, and submitted to her degradation, but it did not make her love her husband the better. If an heir had been born-or even an heiress- he would have acknowleged her as his wife at once. I am  afraid she was woman enough to rejoice, as year after year went by, and there was no child! While they were living this life, a mysterious stranger turned up, s i you have heard, at the village- inn. No, mysterious strangers are invariably in the way; and this one was peculiarly so, for he was no other than the first love, whlo ought to have been resting comfortably in his grave in the West Indies. "We went to Downe Reserve, and by some    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6472-00000059"/> means or other contrived to gain access to the private room of Lady Beaufort-one of the very rooms which you visited in your wild-goose search into the mysteries bf the place. A pret- ty scene ensued, as you may well imagine; and while she was weeping in his arms, or something of that kind, Sir Francis happened to walk in! "Now, the gay baronet had probably found his way into many a fair lady's boudoir in his time, without stopping to ask permission of her husband. But when one comes to marry one's self, then little peccadilloes present themselves in quite a different light. I should not like to find a handsome young man in your private study, my love. Sir Francis had serious objec- tions to his wife's receiving visitors also; and as he was rather apt to act before be spoke, at times, he made no more ado about the matter, but quietly ran the stranger through before he had time to draw in his own defence-in fact, while Lady Beaufort's arms were around him; so that he died upon her breast. I dare say that repaid him for all the comfort of being sent into the next world in such a violent hurry-don't you?" "Iam sure I cannot say," replied Marian. "But how did Sir Francis manage to escape the hangman?" "Very easily. You can do almost anything in this world, provided you have plenty of mo- ney, and brains enough to tell you how to use it. Sir Francis took the matter very quietly. Lady Beaufort, of course, went into hysterics. It is a way some women have; and it must be confessed that it was rather an unpleasant scene for the poor thing to witness." "I should think so," said Marian, dryly. "Well, it was the very best thing she could have done, under all circumstances. It gave Sir Francis time to act. He locked the door, put her ladyship comfortably on a sofa, and employed that time to such a good purpose, that when she recovered, there was no trace of her lover except the blood that stained the floor." "Where was he then?" "Ahl where, indeed?  You would never guess. You must know that all this happened in the boudoir-the outer chamber of the suite. The next room was a bedroom." "I know." "When she found her lover had disappeared, and that Sir Francis either could not or would not tell what lhad become of him, the poor woman rushed into her own room, snatcheid up a little penknife from her writing-desk, and stabbed herself, as she thought, to the heart." "Did she die too?" asked Marian, turning pale. as she remembered the disordered couch and blood-stained pillow, which she herself had seen. "Not a bit of it. She only gave herself a scratch just enough to draw blood, and frighten   'her ihalf to death, but not enough to scare Sir Francis. In spite of her illness, and her terror, he lugged her away bodily the very next morn- ing, and all the servants went with them. Downe Reserve was left to the bats and the owls, and, according to your account, to the spooks also." "But what became of Lady Beaufort?" ask- ed Marian, looking deeply interested. Mr. Vere laughed significantly. "She had her revenge, my dear. By hook or by crook, sooner or later, a woman always manages to get that, and she was like the rest of her amiable sex. The greatest desire of her husband's heart was for a child-an heir to his name and his estate. She knew that that desire was about to be granted at last. She was about to tell him the welcome news, when that un- lucky lover turned up, and set every one by the ears. After he was disposed of, she had a sulkv fit, as a matter of course, and held her tongue. Her husband knew nothing of her secret. Only two persons did know it; one was Mrs. Pryor- your friend at the Pleasaunce; the other, old Martin, the laborer." Marian uttered an exclamation. She began to see dimly what the end of this strange tale must be. "You are anticipating my news," said Mr. Vere, with a smile. "But never mind; hear me to the end. Lady Beaufort, before her her forced flight, continued to see these two, and made them promise, if any evil fortune be- fell her, that they would watch, even at a dis- tance, if needs be, over the welfare of her child. They did promise, and she went away. But in one month from the day of her departure, she managed to give Sir Francis the slip ; and though he searched, the Continent all over, he never saw her again, nor did he ever know of the birth of his'child." "And that child?" said Marian, pale with suspense. "Is yourself, you think I am going to say! And you are right, in a measure. But there were two children, as it happens." "Two?" "Twins, my dear!" A boy and a girl?" "On the contrary; two girls." "I have a sister, then?" said Marian, press- ing her hand union her forehead. "You have." "And I am the child of Lady Beaufort?" "And of Sir Francis also." "Downe Reserve belongs to me?" "To you and your sister; or, rather to your sister and to you!" "What do you mean?" "She is the eldest by some few minutes. She holds the position of an eldest son, therefore, and you of a younger one."   Marian dropped her hand, and looked at him Steadily. "And this sister--who is she? where is she?" "Can't you guess?" he asked, with a mali- cious smile. "I do not wish to guess; tell me!" "First hear my story quite through. Sir Francis lived for many a year, and enjoyed him- self greatly in the West Indies, I believe. But poor Lady Beaufort took all she had seen and suffered too much to heart, and six months after her twin children were born, she was in her grave. Not at rest, though, if all reports are true. But that is neither here nor there. Her brother, the solicitor, was summoned to her death-bed. What passed between them no one ever knew; but when the funeral was over, he took the infants and their nurse to London, and so all trace was speedily lost of them. "I know where they went, however. 'To a pretty little cottage on Hampstead Heath, where the babies grew famously, and got plenty of fresh air and new milk tilt they were two years old. Then the solicitor put himself into communication with Charles Moyell, Esq., of the Pleasaunce, through his housekeeper, Mrs. Pryor; and the result was that the youngest of the children was adopted by him, and brought up in his family, in what manner you can best say. The elder-the more important heiress- whose existence, by its dead mother's last com- mand, was to be even more strictly concealed from its father's knowledge-was hid as cun- ningly as a needle in a bottle of hay. Can you guess where, Lady Marian?" Marian groaned. "I see it-I see it all now." ". Pardon me," said Mr. Vere, politely. 'I think you are mistaken. At least, tell me what it is that you see." ' "It is plain enough, I think," said Marian, impatiently. "I am  the younger daughter; but Rose Martin-my rival in this, as in every- I thing else-is the eldest child, and the heiress i of Downe Reserve."  "Exactly. With your usual acuteness you 1 have hit the right nail on the head. Rose s Beaufort, falsely called Rose Martin, is the le- e gitimate heiress of the estate, But no one f knows this--that is, no one can prove it except  your humble servant."            t "  What do you mean?"  "The children were baptized, of course, I h have the certificate of that baptism. I have also Lady Beaufort's marriage-certificate in my w possession; and, in short, all the papers neces- sary to give either Marian Yere, or Rose Mar- tin, immediate and undisputed possession of the estate. It rests only with you to say for whose tl good those papers shall be used."'      e How can it rest with me, if Rose is the eld- ke est?" was Marian's moody reply.      al   imr a "Did you ever lead tie story of Jacob and Esau, in the Bible?" is  "Of course." "There is a precedent, if you want one." "- ("I don't see it." "Well, perhaps the two cases are not exactly alike. Because you are not robbing Rose of ir her father's blessing-much good that would do n- her, by the way; you are simply stepping into ut her shoes, and walking off with the lion's sare id of the property, that is all." er  "A just proceeding!", er  "Oh I if you have scruples, that is quite and re other thing, and I have no more to say," he re- er plied, with a shrug of the shoulders. r Marian sat silent for some time, considering. ie At last she said: te  "How is it that you are mixed up in thin d business? For that old man told me, when he was dying, to seek out Philip Vere." a  ' Did he tell you nothing else?" i,  "Stop-let me think. I have it now I He y said you were the lawyer's son." o  "Yes," said Mr. Vere, while a dark flush o crossed his brow; "really his son, but not law- f ful-though old Martin thought me so. I do  not bear his name; and, in my early youth, I f called another man father. You will pardon t me if I do not enter into details, since I must t name and blame those who are dead. The world knows nothing of my real parentage, nor - need, it. It is enough to say that wlen he was I dying, I was with him, and that I received this secret and these papers as a sacred deposit-the 1 only legacy he could leave one. But it waskaj valuable one, since it also gave me my fair wife," he added, with a courteous bow. "But Leonora, my cousin.-what of her?" asked Marian, looking bewildered. Ah! you will remind me of my little folly. To tell the truth, Marian, if she had behaved properly to me, I should now be looking after your rights as your cousin, instead of your husband. For her sweet sake I would have re- nounced the prize on which I had fixed my eyes for so many years. But it was not to be. The lady jilted me. I took muy revenge for the slighlt, and then waited quietly till you and Rose grew up. She, as you know, was very benuti  ful. I might have tried my luck with her, but my Lord Mountchayne was ahead of me. So I turned my attention to the Pleasaunce, and snared my bird even more easily than I had hoped to do." "And now that the bird is caught, what good will it do you?" asked Marian. "Don't you see?" "I do not."  "My father was a lawyer, and as cautious as the rest of his tribe. He knew which was the legal heiress, but lie took very good care to keep that knowledge to himself. Mrs. Pryor and old Martin eacaa believed you to be the eld,    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6472-00000060"/> est child. And so you were brought up\at the Pleasaunce, in order to ,fit you for the station you were to occupy-while Rose was transform- ed into the simple cottage-girl, as best befitting her humbklr lot. Ha! ha! I can't help laugh- ing when I think how easily they were all bam- boozled!" "Happy Rose!" sighed Marian. "She has everything by right. Beauty, grace, rank, wealth, and hearts that love her. And what have I?" "You may have a great deal, if you like," said Mr. Vere, composedly. "The case lies in a nutshell. If you say, 'Downe Reserve shall be mine', yours it is. If you say, ' Give it to Rose', I will obey' Only tell me what you wish me to do. I am. your most obedient Slave of the Ring in this matter." "I must say, 'Give it to Rose', since it be- longs to her," was the answer. "Humph! I don't see that, by any means. Few people have all that belongs to them by right. And of the two, I really think you need it the most. Look at her! She has recovered from the small-pox, and is prettier than ever,. I hear. Then, Lord Mountchayne has acknowl- edged her openly; and although he has been obliged to leave her for a time-" "Leave-her! They are not living together, then?" said Marian, so eagerly, that Mr. Vere laughed. "What! you are not cured of Chat folly yet? Some wounds are slow to heal. Is that it, Mar- ian? Well, set your heart at rest. He has left h4r for a time, but only to attend upon his mother, who is very ill, and who has been or- E dered to some foreign watering place. They I will soon return; and, in the meantime, she has every assurance of his love that the most ex-  acting woman could ask. The Priory is to be her home, if she will but accent It-the servants are at her command--the villagers do her hon- P or; and as for her husband, letters, hooks, pic-  tures, pianos, and goodness knows what else, s came pouring in upon her by eveiy mail. He makes no secret of his devotion, and the whole country-side sings with his praise and hers. If q it were my misfortune to wear petticoats, I thinkl I should not mind being Rose Beaufort, Lady t Mountchayne."              ' Marian's face grew darker and darker as she listened. When he stopped, she sat for a long t, time with her head leaning on her clasped \ hands. Mr. Vere watched her stealthily undero his long eyelashes.             I "Well," he said at last, "what conclusion t have you arrived at?" "At none," was her brief reply. "Sooner or later you must give an answer." ) "I know."  "Of course, so far as I am concerned, I would w rather see you at Downe Reserve than her. It tl is a file old house, in spite of the ghost."   ie  "Ah, that figure!". said Marian, starting. in  "You were going to tell me about it." "- "Nay! 1 don't meddle with the supernatu- g ral; it is not in my line. But if you did see h- anything, it is rather strange. For in a great i- iron chest, in one of the upper rooms, Sir Fran- cis Beaufort concealed the body of the man he is murdered." ",  "Was it ever found?" asked Marian, almost it in a whisper. "Not that I know of." "Then how-" "My dear child, my father was present at "your father's death-bed, as well as at your moth- o ei's. Without betraying her secrets, he learned h Isis; and that was one of them. Sir Francis f confessed the deed; and when you mentioned what you saw-or rather fancied that you saw - -at Downe Reserve, I could not help remem- bering the story of the iron chest." "But it is there now. I saw it with my own eyes." "Very well, my love. The first tiling we di Iat Downe Reserve will be, to force open the box, and if anything is there, bury it." A thrill of horror ran through Marian's veins at this careless speech. If anything is there I Only one thing could be there, if this were true! And what was that? "John Martin must have known!" she said, dreamily. "Known what?" "About the murder." Impossible!" "How, then, could he, too, have seen what I saw-a lady sitting there, weeping and wringing her hands?"  / -  Did he tell you he had seen that?" asked Mr. Vere, looking rather startled. Yes; when he was dying." "Then he must have entered the old house, and there may be more in ghost-stories than I have ever believed. At all events, we will see.' Marian shook her head. "What do you mean by that nod? It is quite as mysterious as Lord Burleigh's." "Do not build too much upon the founda- tions of Downe Reserve," she said. "It may be that nlther you nor I will ever be there." "  That is as it will be," he said, rising, and taking his hat. "You look tired and excited. IYou lhall sleep before you decide for yourself, or for Ruse-I mean Lady Mountchayne. May I come to-morrow, to know what you have de- termined upon?' "Yes." "Then, good-night; sound slumbers and pleasant dreams," he said, with a slight smile, as he bowed himself out of the room. He knew well that she would have neither of the three things he wI^lted her, all the while.   1i    CHAPTER XtI. THE DECISION.

OAKES SMTH. And so Marian was left alone, to accept or reject the fortune, as she chose. , Left "alone', in good truth, in one sense of the word.  For, though her guardian-angel looked down sorrowfully upon the conflict in that proud and worldly soul, she could not ap- proach too near; her assistance was not asked -was not evei thought of. While, onthe other hand, a hundred evil influences were at work, searing the white-robed visitant away. To look at the right and the wrong of the question, so far as hon'ri and generosity were concerned, was easy enough. But Marian ac- -krowledged, or, at least, referred only to a natural law ; she did not consider the divine one just then. To yield the estate, the fortune, the position to her sister Rose, would be magnanimous and noble. Granted! But then Rose, though still living in her hum- ble cottage, had only to speak the word to be transferred to a home far more beautiful than Downe Reserve. She had but a small income,  but Marian might easily make it larger in an un- I obtrusive vay. And then she was Lady Mount- J clayne, the wife of the only man Marian ever loved, and "prettier than ever".  That one e phrase had so much to do with turning the s scale. If Philip Vere could but have told the  truth for once in his life, and said: ' She has not v lost all her good looks, but she has lost her hus- t band's heart, and may never regain it." Mar- I ian might have acted very differently. If Rose g had been marked and scarred, a repulsive and 1i pitiable object to the view, I am sure that she s5 would. But to hear that her loveliness was in- a creasing, and that she was her husband's idol,  and was only left for' a time, that she might  watch over a failing, perhaps a dying mother, o that was quite a different thing. Was it to be x expected that she could resign all the good of this life to Rose, without a murmur?     w She paced up and down her lonely room  that p evening, debating the question, with the sharpest tr inward struggles ; she entered her little study. I There were her books-her dear familiar friends ti whose faces she was always glad to see. But al there also was the worn and battered writing- s   desk, the stumpey pen, the sixpenny inkstand, with which she performed her daily task. There also were long, horrible strips of '" proof'"- black and white erpents that infested her daily walk in life, and drove her half mad at times. There also was a Courteous but unmistakable note from the p,-intel's department, dated "Tuesday, one, p. j.", ,nd stating, that as there was a lack of " copy" for "Part III.", perhaps she would oblige with "fifty pages lby nine, A. m., on Wednesday", or some request quite as thoughtful and reasonable in its tone! From all theas. types and tokens of her drudg- ery she revolted more strongly than ever on  )r that night. It was all very well to obey those thick-coming demands for "brick without of straw", which it was necessary for her so to do. el She could solace herself the while by uttering n anathemas against the printers, which it was as )- well the sons of type were too far off to hear. d Bat now there was a way of release opened. r She had but to say the word, and she was free! ;, Free to pass a printer's devil without " hying" instinctively from the smutty face-free to read e a newspaper without turning pale at its con. e tents, horribly familiar beforehand-free to make fun of writers, and to laugh at their long- i winded stories, without a thin-skinned feeling that perhaps they were shaking their sides at the same moment over what she had intended for' the most pathetic passages. Can you won- d der that she grasped eagerly at her deliver- ance? No writer, who, for his or her sins, has been  - dipped in printer's ink"', week after weekl,-:'-- year after year, will wonder, I am sure. Ah, me! the tired brains-the aching heads-the weary fingers-the dazzled eyes-that belong to the paternity of the quill! It was Charlotte Bronte, I think, who uttered a thanksgiving in print because she had never put pen to paper, except wheu she felt that she had something to say. Those are not her exact words, but the pith of the remark was, that no writer ought to write, unless sure that he or she has 'something to say for which the world will be the better. A good doctrine that for literary stars, who can give out nothing but light, and from whose open lips fall pearls and diamonds in a continuous shower. But if you come down in the ranks,  and embrace magazinists and newspaper writers, whose bread lies among the types, what then? Wait till we have something to say for which our readers will be very much better I Why, we should all starve in a row, if we did that. Few penny a-liners, I think, can afford to write with "a purpose", unless it be the pur- pose of making money. Story-telling is now a trade-and, oh I how tiredl some people get of it! I know one who was tired long, long tigo-so tired that the sight of pen, ink, and paper- above all of a printer's imp-is to her like a saucer of cold water presented on a raging Au-    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6472-00000061"/> gust day to a dog who feels the first sharp twinge of hydrophobia coming on! And Marian was getting tired, too. Tired enough to detest constant drudging-yet willing still to write, provided she might do it in her own time and way. Here was the opportunity she wished. And did she seize it? We shall see! CHAPTER XLII. THE SISTERS. "There are who from their cradles bear The impress of a grief- Deep, mystic eyes, and forehead fair, And looks that ask relief; The shadows of a coming doom, Of sorrow and of strife, When Fates conflicting round the loom, Wove the sad web of life." -E. OASES SMTH. Marian decided in favor of herself. Of course it was wrong.- Of course she ought to have gone to Downe, and installed her elder sister in the place of honor, while she looked meekly on, from a much lower place! But it is so easy to do wrong-so hard to do right. And the good angel spread its wings badly, and the tempter had it all his own way. Of course there was great excitement in Downe when the news reached the place. Peo- ple could hardly believe their ears or their eyes, so many strange things had happened of iate. And now, to have Miss Marian back, again, no more the Cinderella of the Pleasaunce, but a lady in her own right-the wife of a rich and handsome man; the mistress of Downe lie serve, and the sister of the young Lady Mount- chayne. Well, surely after that, wonders would never cease in Downe. There was much speculation among the sim- ple villagers about two things. Would Mrs. Vere-or rather "Lady Marian", as they pre- ferred to call her-actually live at the old house, the haunted house, where she alone had never feared to go? And would Rose reside with her? These questions were speedily solved when the lady made her appearance; for she took up her quarters in one of her empty farm-houses- and workmen, summoned from all parts of the country, were to begin at once the work of making Downe Reserve habitable once more. It was plain that no ghost was dreaded by her; and the quick matter-of-fact way in which she set about remodeling her home, went far to dis- pel tie scruples of those who obeyed her or- ders. When they saw her passing with an air of perfect unconcern from one deserted room to another-not shrinking from the darkest closets of the most obscure passages, great strong carpenters and masons could not for very shame hang back, and refuse to go whore a young and feeble woman led the way. By degrees they forgot that a ghost inhabited thlse   I rooms, and ceased to work with one eye over their shoulder, ready to take flight upon the in-, stant, if any unearthly visitant made its appear- ance. As to the position which the deserted Lady Mountehayne was to occupy in the home and heart of her sister, there were many divided opinions. Some said that Marian refused to no- tice her; others, that her first visit in Downe had been paid to the iWhife Cottage. These last-mentioned gossips weire in the right; for on the very evening of Marian's arrival, she left her husband sitting over his wine after din- ner, and walked through the lanes and fields, where she had once lingered with the young ar- tist to see his wife. It was not a pleasant interview. On Marian's heart, tie burden of two secrets lay heavily. She could not forget that by her acts, Rose had been sent into danger which had well-nigh caused her death. Now that Rose ought to he dwelling at the Manor farm, and giving orders for the restoration of the old place, rather than herself, Rose, too, was uncomfortable. They had both loved the same man, and she had sup- ! planted her rival: But how long had her tri- umph lasted?  -Iow ruch good has it done her? When she last saw Marian, she was happy in the consciousness of a pure and innocent love, which was warmly returned. Now she stood deserted, despised, and almost hated wife, mocked with barren titles, when her heart cried for affection-offered empty state, where she only asl:ed for only one kind look or word, like those of old. Could her sister forget all this? Could she fail to feel some little thrill of tri- umph at her rival's humiliation? And oh! if Lord Mountchayne was to see them now, and choose once more between them, which would he take? The successful authoress, serene and self-possessed, and almost handsome, with her added sense of dignity and consequence, or the poor faded Rose, that' seemed to drop toward its parent earth, with longing sadness now that its last support had been so rudely wrenched away! Only one person witnessed that inter- view. It was Mrs. Pryor, the chosen friend and companion of Lady Mountchayne. Radiant with happiness, the gpod lady wel- comed her former protege, as she crossed the humble threshold. With meek thankfulness she called down a blessing on her head, and ex- pressed a wish that her days might be long and happy in her new home, and that the love of her sister might be the sweetest drop in the cup of pleasure, which was held to her lips. But as she spoke, with a simple earnestness that moved Rose to tears, Marian shrank away and frowned darkly. The worthy housekeeper was puzzled and grieved. Something was wrong-she felt still   more of it, as she sat beside the window, and listened to the sisters as they talked. What oould it be? Was it the influence of Philip Vere already at'work for evil, as his influence always must be? Could Marian really love him, that dark, bad man? And if she did not love, why had she married him? Thinking these thoughts, Mrs. Pryor plied her knitting-needles, and watched the face of her former charge, in an unobtrusive kind of way. Slle grew still more dissatisfied as she looked. Where was the frank, open look-the quick smile-the ready speech-the merry laugh? Gone, all gone together. It was not Marian whom she saw. It was a self-assured elegantly-dressed woman of the world, whose subdued tones, and the irritating speech, served rather to aid than to reveal their thoughts. There were marks under the eyes that told of anxious days and sleepless nights-there were lines about the mouth, and a guarded, doubtful glance of the eye which she did not like at all "Philip Vere's work, I am sure," she thought to herself, as Marian, after uttering common-  places for half an hour, rose to go; then her  frank relation got the better of her, and she  took the languidly proffered hand in both hers, c i gave it a warm pressure, and cried out:  t "My dear, what ails you?  You are so i changed that I should hardly have known you v all this time."  "Changed!" said Marian, coloring, and glanc- i ing at Rose. "Do you think me changed?"  "Very much, my dear. And, if I must add, a the truth, for the worse!"        a Marian laughed. "You always told me the world was a dread. a ful place, Mrs. Pryor.

But, e never mind, 1 shall know it all in time. And al now, tell me what are you two young things go- st ing to do?"

OAKES SMTH. it   en the summer came round again, Downe l- Reserve was furnished, Marian and her hus- r band lived there, and the long-deserted place e was all alive with gay visitors and their troops i, of servants in livery. There was a grand ball to begin with, and a succession of parties, which o made every belle and beau within thirty miles i well-acquainted with the interior of the old man- sion, and well-satisfied in their own minds that if there ever had been a ghost there (which they began to be inclined to doubt), the mirth, , and revelry, and feasting had scared it effectu- ally away. Every one came to Downe Reserve who was asked. In the first place, there was a mystery about the house;' in the second, a romance about its owner. It was a great boon to those people who were bored to death, if they had but known it, with the commonplaces of their own existence to find an heiress dropping down among them, as it were, from the skies, with a story attached to her name, that read exactly like a three-volume novel in the days of old. What with the dissipated father, and the mys- terious mother, and the pretty sister, and the long seclusion in which both had been reared- to say nothing of the handsome fortune and the grim old house, there was quitesenough to feed their curiosity, and wake them out of the stupid round of decencies in which they usually dwelt. Then, too, there was the gay and gallant hus- band, who had jilted Miss Leonora BMoyell so shamefully, a few years before. I am very much afraid that some of the younger ladies came to look at him. And certainly he appreciated the attention, and did his best'to reward it. Never did a married man make himself so agreeable to single damsels as he. There was no going any.    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6472-00000062"/> where-no doing anything without Mr.' Vere; and he did his best to serve all his fair enslavers, and worked like a negro during those hot sum- mer days. Did Marian resent these general courtesies? Not a whit. It was a matter of perfect indif- ference to her, where he went, or what he did. She was happiest when he was furthest from her side; so that while in company he paid her all those attentions which he would have paid to any other lady by whom he happened to sit or stand, she was quite satisfied. Her indifference was far too evident to please him. And yet he had nothing tangible to com- plain of. Her manner to him was always courte- ous, attentive, and kind. If he spoke, she listen- ed; if he asked her to ride or drive with him, she went; if he led her to the piano, she sang his favorite songs, and seemed to try to please him in every way possible. ' Yet, in spite of all this, the forced smile, the absent glance, the thoughtful, pre-occupied air, told tales -too often, that made him gnash his teeth with jealous rage. True, he did not love her. But he would have liked her- to love him, nevertheless; for there is much more glory for a vain man in de- serting a woman who cries her eyes out in his absence, than one who never cares two pins whether he goes or stays. If ladies understood this grand secret of indifference, I think we should find fewer husbands " obliged" to dine at clubs, or to have " pressing business" in town upon the morning of the Derby Day. For-a wife to have her own friends and 'her own amusements, is the surest way to charm a would-be truant to her side. If he goes one way, and finds out that she goes quietly anoth- er, the moment the street-door cioses upon him, he will very soon discover that it is far better that both their "ways" should be close to- gether. Not that I could for a moment hint at a rebel- lion on the part of the " weaker sex". Far be it from me! My dear sisters, don't you know that you and I, and "all the rest of us", are weaker than that glorious creature, man, who is lord of the creation and of us, even when he is lying drunk under the table after dinner? Don't you know that the sole end and aim of our crea- tion is, to minister to his pleasures, nurse him in sickness, cherish him in health, sew on his but- tons, mend his stockings, and never utter even a mild expression of dissent if he gallops past the window with a pretty girl by his side, while we are moping at home. If not, learn now that the whole duty of woman is to follow hum- bly the footsteps of man, whether lie be father, brother, lover, or husband, it is all the same. He has no faults, no failings. Did you ever know a man own himself in the wrong? Is he not cleverer, stronger, braver, and better thau we?  Admire him and tremble I  When he   boggles at spelling "cloudy", and substitutes the " w" for the " u", it shows that his mind is too godlike to stoop to a thing so trifiinA as the proper arrangement of the letters in a word. When, with a little twinge of toothache which you wolild bear in silence, while you did your day's ork, he howls and bellows like a mad bull, believe that so Jove did in Olympus, when he reigned triumphant there. When, at the first stroke of worldly calamity, he sinks down helpless and overpowered, never fancy for one instant that it was your superior " pluck" and endurance that pulled him through the scrape, and set him upon'his feet again. Believe noth- ing, in fact, but that he is above you in every-, thing, in every way. If by chance he deigns to love you sufficiently to allow you to dwell be- neath his roof, wear a plain gold ring, and look after his linen and his children, remember that your whole life ought to express your gratitude for the boon. You must have no thought, no wish, except for his welfare, and happiness. Your whole existence must be merged in his. I believe that is the proper phrase, and I fancy it means that you are to read the daily paper through your husband's eyes; and never, on any account, to say that the sun is shining till he has first certified that it has not set. This, ladies, is your duty.' You, who are sin- gle, must worship your big brothers, and un- derstand that your only mission is, to sew the buttons on their gloves. You who are so un- fortunate (bless mel what dreadful blunders those dreadful printers do make!)-I mean so fortunate as to be married, must think, and breathe, and live, and act for your husbands alone! Does he come at 3, A. M., with his hat on one side, and the string of a pink bonnet (a pink -bonnet, Ma'am!) tied in the button-hole of his coat--meet him at the door with a plea- sant smile, and say you hope he has enjoyed himself at Cremorne! Does he amuse himself now and then by pommelling you till you are black and blue, and swearing till he raises the neighborhood-remember that the law of your country permits a little gentle correction, and be patriotic enough to rejoice in your bruises. Is he an educated idiot, learned in the vocabu- lary of the turf, but totally unable to "make sense" of a page of history or a beautiful poem --still he is your " superior", though you read Greek like your mother-tongue, and can write t those poems or that history yourself with the greatest case!  Tiere! The above homily has teen preach- - ed at the instigation of an impertinent friend at my elbow,.who has just sought refuge in my  study, from a-quarrel with iher better-half, in r which, if I may'judge from' her conduct, she e was no means worsted. She actually accuses I me of having put independent notions into her ehead, by some forgotten story of my own. Iu-   deed, I investigate, or aid in a rebellion :gaint" our natural sovereigns!"Banish the Tlhought! And lest any one else should also unstake my meaning, or come to grief thereby, I hasten to print these, my real sentiments, upon the vex- ed question of woman and her rights. Woman's rights, indeed! don't we all know that she is born without any? I only wish that my heroine, Marian, had been persuaded of the truth of this doctrine as fully as I am myself! But Marian held most heterodox opinions upon this as upon many other subjects. She had little reverence in her composition, none at all, as she said, to waste upon that hybrid, man. The follies, the vices, the weaknesses of the sterner sex were mercilessly exposed by tongue or pen, whenever they came beneath her no- tice. And yet, although she despised, she did not hate them. Her very indifference gave her a power over their wandering fancies that younger, fairer, and prouder woman never at- tained. Each flattered himself for a time, as he bent before her, that he was to be the favored individual who was to waken her from her cold trance of apathy, and make her retract her bit- ter sarcasms and harsh judgments, by showing the world that she, too, must yield to the blind god's power, and believe that which she loved perfect, because she loved it. But each one fal!ed. The fault was in her alona A beautiful face might charm her for a time, but it could not hold her captive long. If ever she felt a faint thrill of interest for any of those who would gladly have called themselves her lovers, it was gone again, almost before she knew that it had life. She had loved once-she could never love again! Her heart was but a heap of ashes-cold ashes! where no fire could be kindled twice! And so her very indifference proved her best safeguard against the temptations that began to cluster thickly round her path. Meantime, what of the secret that had once made Downe Reserve a place to be feared and shunned? There was-there had been a secret there I On the -evening after her arrival, Marian, in company with Philip Vere and his valet (a sal- low down-looking man, whom he had hired in London), visited thegdeserted room at the top of the house, where the iron chest still stood. They forced open the lid of the chest, and as they did so, Marian bent eagerly forward to look. Something like a human form met her eyes for one instant-the next, it fell into a heap ofl dust! I 'thought as much!" said Philip Vere, quietly. And going into the next room, he brougnt, the blood-stained coverlet, and laid it carefully over the poor relics of what had once been a living, breathing, and loving man. ,They buried the chest that night in a quiet spot. near the Wishing Well. And Marian. who i.. .   w .i;s, after all, ai lirtle-ruperstitious, laid a cruci- lix, which had been blessed at Rome, within the gi ave, bciroi they -closed it up. The deserted rooms, left as they were, were locked and bolted from every curious eye. Ma- rian kept the keys And so was hidden every trace of Sir Fran- cis Beaufort's crime! so was banished that gen- tle and unhappy presence that had so long haunted the scene of its' early yet criminal love! 3 ,  CHAPTER XLIV DEATH ATONES FOR ALL. "ilid your nuptial rites allow, Though I was weeping near; I had respect for his bridal vow- Vows do not bind him here. ",Oh! if those colorless lips could speak- $ Those long-loved eyes could see; If the voice of love could his slumber break, Would he not smile on me? "Would he not plead that I long might stay Where I am kneeling now; Fondling his clustering locks away- Kissing his icy brow? "Leave me-I'll murmur beside his bed Words to your heart unknown-  ,    - Living-you pillowed his precious head; Dead-he is mine alone"! While matters were going on thus gayly at the- Hall, the course of time brought with it events far more important to the lonely inhabitants of the cottage. 'There came a startling rumor to the Priory, one fine summer morning. It was said that while traveling in the South of France, the party had met with an accident, by which Lord Mount- chayne had received a fatal injury. They (Lord and Lady Revere) were even then on their way home, bringing the dead body of their son with them; and poor Rdse was a widow almost be- fore she was a wife! Ill news travels apace. By mid-day every one had heard the sad tale, and some of the vil- lage gossips had even begun to speculate about Rose's future rmarriage to her first love, Hugh Dennett, in case he should ever return. The next day, however, all such speculations ceased; for the mournful party returned, only to show the villagers how great a mistake had been o made. It was the father, not the son,-who had  been Billed; and Rose Beaufort was Lady i Revere-enabled by that title to take prece- i dence, if she liked, of the proud woman who refused to acknowledge her in any way. She did not attempt to use that privilege. Nor did she go to the Priory. Lord Mountchayne had also been seriously hurt, and between his in. juries and his grief for his father, was in a dan- b gerous state. Poor Rose's heart bled for him- yearned after him-but Mrs. Pryor kept stern watch and ward over her, and would not permit t her to fly to his side till she was summoned ) there. The message came at last. Even the    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6472-00000063"/> Dowager Coun-tess's pride gave way in the face o;f sickness, suffering, and death; and within three days after her arrival, a splendid carriage drew iup before the cottage door, and a note was -given to Rose, in which the repentant woman begged her humbly to come to the invalid, who called constantly in his delbrium upon her name. Within ten minutes after the receipt of that newspaper, Rose was seated in the carriage and on her way to the Priory. For the first time, then, Rose approached her husband's hcme as its acknowledged mistress! Slie gazed with a feeling of curiosity, not un- mixed with sadness, out of the window of the carriage at the stately house. Though the Priory had been rebuilt for so short a time, it still managed to retain an air of antiquity that stamped its claims to 'considera- tion. The south front, which had stood stoutly enough since the days of Harry the Eighth, hlad been left untouched, and was clothed with clustering ivy as with a garment. The north side sheltered its stuccoed front and modern porch and portico beneath the friendly shade of a grove of oaks, and thus detracted nothing from the general aspect of the place. To that north porch they drove. The foot- man alighted and opened the door;- and then Rose saw, with an inward sense of embarrass- ment, that every servant in the establishment had been drawn up in a line gp receive her. 'She need not have feared the greeting. The moment she crossed the threshold, every face wore a smile, and the stately housekeeper step- ped forth in person to welcome her for all. "I am sure, my lady, this is a happy day for us all!" she said. "We are glad enough to see you here; and as for my lord--'. More she might have said; something Rose might have answered; but at that moment, a tall and stately lady descended the stairs. "My lady!" whispered the servants, and every one tell back instantly. Rose stood in the middle of the hall alone-her morning dress falling in graceful folds around her slight figure,-and her fair cheek burning with an un- wonted flush. Lady Revere looked narrowly at her as she descended the last steps of the stairs. Even at that moment her thoughts were of the world, worldly; and she was admiring the unconscious graoe of Rose's attitude, and the still striking loveliness of her face, rather than thinking of the goodness of heart which, had made her for- get and forgive the long slight and deep injury which had been inflicted upon her, and come there to forgive and console the sick-perhaps, the dying man. "  She will do to present at Court, after I have had her under my tuition a little while!" was all the lady thought, as she crossed the hall, and took the shy stranger by the hand. "A thousand thanks to you for coming, my   e dear daughter!" she said aloud, and tChen em. n braced her warmly. A murmur of delight ran e through the ranks of servants at this greeting, and Rose felt faint and giddy with surprise. Was this the cold, proud woman who had step- o ped between her and love-between her and happiness such a long and dreary while? t  "Come up-stairs with me, my love!" said the 1 silver voice. "Francis is asleep at this moment; but he will wake soon, and then I will take you r to him!"And, putting her arm around the girl's waist, she led her gently away. The sick man's slumber was of short dura- e tion, and as soon as he woke, Lady Revere led her newly-found daughter to his bedside. He gazed at her with heavy eyes, and tried to hold f out his feeble hand. "- It has been a sad thing for you, my poor ry Rose, but I shall be out of your way in a little ,while," he murmured. i  Rose burst into tears, and fell upon her knees beside him. She would have given her life to have saved his at that moment, but her first glance at f his pale, pinched face had told hel that it was in vain to hope. Lady Revere did not know that he was dying. No physician had had the courage to break the fatal tidings to her. But Rose took that duty upon herself, and perform- ed it so kindly and so well, that half the bitter- ness of the sorrow was taken away. And so they who had loved so fondly-who had been sepa- rated so long-met once more, and only to part. It was hard-but a fiat had gone forth from which there was no appeal. Lord Mountchayne was young and beautiful; so was Rose. She was at last in her rightful place and home, feel- ing that she was necessary to his comfort-a help and support to his stricken mother-the real as well as nominal mistress of the house- hold in which she dwelt. All this love, dignity, honor, and affection had been tardily given her at the eleventh hour, only to be snatched away again almost before she had time to feel that it was hers. Not for that did she abandon her gentle ministrations. All through anat long and painful illness, she was by her husband's side-his loving nurse-his faithful guide to the unknown land where he was going. She sooth- ed his pain, and calmed his fears; and when, at last, the parting hour came-when the death- film stole over those bright blue eyes, and the death-rattle sounded in the throat, it was her hand that wiped the cold brow-her breast that pilowed the heavK head-her voice thatsoothed the weeping mother, when she threw herself upon the corpse, and uttered a wild prayer that she too might die, rather than to be separated from her only and darling child. To Rose did the servants look for orders and instructions; upon Rose did all the arrange- ments for the funeral fall; and when all was over, when the grave was closed, and the will read, and she would ]gladly have sought some   solitary and tranquil spot, in which toindulge her own grief, the widowed mother clung to her with feeble, tearful entreaties, till she wasforced to stay. So in the Priory, not in the humble cottage, she made her home. Who mourned Lord Mountchayne most bit- terly? Was it his mother? Was it his widow? Was it any one of his numerous acquaintances or friends? I think not. They buried him, by his express wish, in the village churchyard-not in the family vault. The blazing sun, the silver moon, shone upon the turf that covered him; and in time, daisies, and violets, and the small sweet flowers the wild wind sows, would spring and bloom there. In the meantime, this ground was watered by tears as bitter and as unavailing as ever fell from human eyes. Night after night, when the villagers were all asleep, a tall, dark figure ling- ered there, and cold lips kissed the sod, and an aching 'heart was pressed against it, as it was never pressed against that dead, still heart in life. Whose was that figure? It came and went always in the direction of Downe Reserve, and the face was the face of Marian Vere! CHAPTER XLV. THE ACCOUNT SETTLED. "What is the worst of woes that wait on age? What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow? To view each lov'd one blotted from life's page, And be alone on earth as I am now. Before the Chastener humbly let me bow, O'er hearts divided, and o'er hopes destroyed: Roll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow, Since Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoy'd, And with the ills of Eld my earlier years alloy'd." -BYRON. Serenely unconscious of these nocturnal visits, Mr. Vere ate, drank, and made merry with his guests, as the pleasant summer months went by. When autumn came, however, it brought a change over the spirit of his dream. For autumn brought the gipsies to their former haunt beside the Wishing Well! Years had elapsed since they had visited Downe Reserve. Their return boded him no good. He knew it only too well, for all his treachery had been discovered-the tribe had not forgotten it-and Cara, the deserted Cara, was now their beloved Queen. It mwst be'confessed that he felt a little thrill of fear when the smoke of the first camp-tire rose above the woods of Downe Re- serve. But days passed by, and he was un- molested. His courage came back, and he laughed to himself at his romantic notions: he sneered in his thoughts at the idea of vengeance taken by a woman in these enlightened days, for so common a crime as his. The servants went to and fro to have their fortunes told; the village belles sometimes stole slyly through the lanes toward the camp;   and Queen Cara and her subjects seemed to have no thought in their minds inimical to the peace and comfort of the master of Downe Reserve, So all was well, and he returned to his usual pursuits and amusements with renewed interest and zest. While he rested, however, in fancied security, there were those who watched and waited n his behalf. Madame Angelo, after having helped her fickle lover to deceive and laugh at many, had been deceived and laughed at herself. She was a woman who knew neitheiKJrv to forget or forgive; and from the moment when she found herself duped and fooled, her life had been one long thought of revenge She sought out Cara through her tribe, and the two made common cause together. The fiery gipsy ceased to mourn her betrayer's deserticn when she heard how systematiq his deception had been, and lent herself willi'gly to the wily Frenchwomanl's plans. If Philip had but known that those smoking camp-fires warmed and fed both those women, I think his heart would scarcely have been so light, or his slumbers, night after night, so calm and sweet. The crisis came at. last, precisely as Madame Angelo had intended that it should do. Philip Vere and his victim met. The interview took place in the loneliest part of the wood near tie gipsy camp. Only one person ever knew what passed, and she was far  enough away when justice made its strict and stern inquiries. They parted. Cara and her companion returned to the camp. Philip Vere went home. The servants noticed his lowering face and impatient manner as he entered. Straight' to his wife's room he went; and soon after, high words and angry voices were heard there. The servants listened fearfully in the hall. There was a blow struck, then a door shut hastily, and all was still. Marian did not appear at the dinner-table that day. But Mr. Vere was there, gay and smiling as usual. At half-past ten, he bade his friends good-night, and retired to his own room, which was in another wing from that occupied by Marian. When the valet entered that room the next morning, his master did not stir. He called him-there was no answer. He drewthe curtains of the bed, and nearly fainted with horror at the sight he saw. For there lay Philip Vere-stone dead and cold-bathed in blood, with a gash across his throat that could never have been made by his own hand! The whole country-side was wild with excite. ment. He had been a bad man, a bad friend, and a bad husband; but his life was sacred in the eyes of the law; and justice demanded that his murderer should be punished. Suspicion pointed to his wife. She was the person with whom he had been on indifferent terms. There    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6472-00000064"/> had been a q-.:lrrel--a  blow; and those who i knew her best affirmed that she could never let  so deep an insult go unavenged.  She was- arrested! She made no resistance-offered no defence She was tired of life, and of everything it could  give. So far did this weary indifference influ-  ence her, that she was quite capable of suffering t the extremest penalty of the law, without even f saying a word in her defence.  There was 1 another reason for her silence. Her hand had ^ not; sBtuc the fatal' blow-another bad done  that! '-But well she knew that in her heart she had been a murderer that day?   And this thought made her speechless when the question' "Guilty, or not guilty?" was asked. If whrds, and wishes, and thoughts were to be judged, she was nut innocent of that man's blood! Her summer friends deserted her. That she i had expected. But there were two who came to her the instant they heard of her apperehen- sion-and whose love and support never waver- ed through all that dreadful time. Those two  were Mrs. Pryor and her sister Rose. On the day before the trial, a neighboring  clergyman laid a peculiar statement before the  magistrates, which saved the prisoner's life. He  had been summoned, in his ministerial capacity, to the bedside of a dying girl, in the next town, who confessed that she had once thought her- self the wife of Philip Vere. That he lind mar- ried her under a false name, and afterward de- serted her. That he had again sought her out, and again deserted her. That she had deter- mined to revenge herself, and in company with another woman who had also been wronged by him, she had gone to Downe Reserve, and sought and obtained an interview with him in his own park. That he had only laughed at her re- proaches and her threats, and left her abruptl y. defying her to do her worst. And that six hpurs afterward, she, with the help of her ac- complice, entered the hall by stealth, sought Mr. Vere's chamber, and murdered him. Her companion had fled to the Continent, and she was dying, but could not leave the world while Marian, who had never wronged her, was suffer- ing for her crime. This deposition, solemnly attested before the clergyman and three witnesses, was quite suffi- cient. Poor Cara 'was buried by her tribe in the old encampment, while Maria*a was set free; and those who had deserted her in the hour of need, came thronging round her to offer their congratulations and good wishes. She listened to them with a melancholy smile, but answered little. The spring of her life seemed broken. Her gratitude to Rose was the only feeling left to warm that cold and weary heart. Within twenty-four hours after her release, she had left Downe Reserve for ever. Not one of those who had once known her there ever looked upon her face again.   Within a week of Marian's departure, he solicitor arrived, and by her own orders, ex- posed the-fraud of which she had been guilty (and for which she craved her sister's pardon), and installed Rose-Lady Revere-as the true and legal mistress of Downe Reserve. So one more stately mansion opened wide its doors to the beautiful cottage-girl; and amid joy and feasting, and the ringing of bells, she entered her new home, and the legend of the fated place was brought to an end:' "Fair hand-steel glove! not long they reign! Clouds and darkness shall gather again! *   w   *    *   * Then comes the fairest! Who would not serve? All hail to the Ladye of Downe Reserve!" *   *   *   *    *   * j Three years passed tranquilly away. It seemed at last as if peace and prosperity, uninterrupted and unalloyed, had come to Downe Reserve. Under the gentle sway of Lady Rose all weat well, as it had been prophesied in the legend of the place. Marian, with her faults, her follies, her head- strong pursuit of pleasure, was well-nigh for- gotten. And Philip Vere! His guilty life, his violent death, were only remembered ' to point amoral or adorn a tale"; while over the grave of the gipsy Cara, made by gipsy hands, in the site of the old encampment, the pitying village-girls often strewed their wreaths of spring and sum- mer flowers. Madame Angelo was living in Paris the life which suited her best, and the man who had been her accomplice and tool was supposed to be with her. Only "supposed"; for he took very good care, wherever he might be, to keep out of the reach of the strong arm of the law. And Rose was happy? She ought to have been. She had a title and a handsome estate; she was beautiful as ever, tant far more humble and good; she was }he idol of the poor, and the honored friend and companion of the rich-what more could she ask? Nothing, you would say, if she was a wise and sensiule woman  Granted. But suppose s-s not? e She pined and yearned for some-ing which she could could not have; and that was, love. Her heart had been wounded; the half-healed ; hurts pained her yet. For all that, she was not f satisfied. Her thoughts turned sadly. from her ' husband's grave to one who had been more I kind and true. What was he? Would he ever I come back to her again? She asked herself this question one evening t as she walked up and down the terrace-path before her drawing-room windows. A traveler , sprang lightly over the hedge at the bottom of e the park, and answered that question by the r action. It was Hugh Dennett-no longer the stalwart and somewhat awkward blacksmith, '    but a handsome and gentlemauly-looking man, in the very prime of4ife.  Speechlessly she awaited his approach-eager- ly he came up to her, with extended hands. "Rose-Lady Revere!" he said, eagerly; "will you welcome me home?" "O Hugh!" The words, the look, the warm pressure of his hand were quite enough for him. ",I have been in a land where all men are equal!" he went on, with a glad, exultant look "I have studied; I have worked hard. All these years I have been treated as a man! Not as an English peasant, Rose, but as a man of education, and I can't forget it now! -I am rich; and, in a small way, beyond the sea, fa- mous. Had I staid in England, your title would have been a bar for ever between us; but, now, Rose-now may I hope that one day you will be mine!" She did not answer; but, when he held out his arms, she hid her face upon his breast. The lost love might have been dearer and sweeter than this calm, trusting affection; but there was little question, at that moment, which would bring most happiness to her! *    *    *    *    *    * Have you sufficient interest in Marian, my dear readers, to care to know what became of ler, after every one had been made happy and contented by her act of courageous honesty? I will tell you. Two years ago, while traveling through North Wales, I went with some friends to visit a Capuchin monastery, which had been erected upon the/outskirts of the town of Holywell, to the no small horror of its inhabitants. Holy- well owes its very existence, by the way, to Catholics, and is more known to fame for the virtues of "St. Winifred's Well" than for any peculiar virtues of its own. Be that as it may, the good natives are now-Episcopalians or Dis- senters to the backbone, and I don't know which of the two sects looks with the greatest horror   at the cross-surmounted chapel that rises near the well. When we proposed visiting St. Beano's Mon- astery, therefore, there were some murmurs of dissent on the part of our guides. But we pre- vailed, and crossed the mountain on a beauti- ful summer-day, a merry party of sixteen, not one of whose well-remembered faces I shall ever see again. We visited the monastery, paid our respects to the solem monks who were walking about in their picturesque robes and sandals, and then returned to Holywell in time for dinner. Passing a small lodging-house in the High Street, on our way to the' hotel, I chanced to look up at the parlor-window, and there I saw something which I shall never for- get. A lady, still young, though not beautiful, and wearing the dress of a nun, stood there. appar- ently talking to a: small yellow canarly, that sat upon her finger, looking up in her face, and quivering in an ecstasy of affectionate song. And, oh, that face into which the warbler's bright eyes so unconsciously gazed! What a revelation of grief, of suffering, of cold and calm despair, was there! The priest came from the chapel-house just then. We knew him well, and I asked him who the nun was. "She has just come from Paris, to fouhd a sisterhood here," he said, with an air of reserve. "Her name is Sister Mary Francis, of the Sa- cred Cross." I took him aside. "I have a reason for asking this question," I said. " ' In the world,' as you Catholics call it, was not that lady's name Marian Vere?" "It was." And then I knew why, even beneath the vail and wimple, that face was so pale and sad; why, even upon her pet companion-that creature whose life was but one long breath of joy-her eyes, however kind, could only look with pain!

"The murderers of my wife, seek my blo d, they would rob me of my child!" said Arpiaka. "They had better put their hand in the nest of the hooded Cobra than seek my white brother among the Seminoles!" cried Chikika.
