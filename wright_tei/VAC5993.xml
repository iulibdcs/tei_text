                  <p>LONGER than I can remember, my father, who is an old man now, has been in the habit of driving from his home seven miles away to this goodly city in which I now live, every Friday morning. I may well say goodly city, from the view which presents itself as I look out from the window beneath which I have placed my table for the writing of this story, for my home is in the "hilly country" that overlooks the western queen, whose gracious sovereignty I am proud to acknowledge, and within whose dominions this hilly country of which I spoke, lies.</p>
                  <p>I cannot choose but pause and survey the picture. The Kentucky shore is all hidden with mist: I cannot see the young cities whose sloping suburbs are washed by the Ohio (river of beauty), save here and there the gleam of a white wall, or the dense column of smoke that rises through the silver mist from the hot furnaces where swart labor drives the thrifty trades that speeds the march to refined elegance. I cannot see the blue-green nor the golden green of the oat and wheat fields that lie beyond these infant cities, nor the dark ridge of woods that folds its hem of shadows along their borders, for all day yesterday fell one of those rains that would seem to exhaust the cloudy cisterns of heaven, and the soaked<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5993-00000005"/> earth this morning sends up its coal-smelling and unwholesome fogs, obscuring the picture that would else present itself.</p>
                  <p>I can only guess where the garrison is, but could not even <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> if the time of challenge were not past, though long before the sunrise I woke to the music of the reveille, that comes floating over the waters and through the crimson daybreak to chase the dream from my pillow, morn after morn. Faintly I discern the starry home of science crowning the summit of the mount above me, and see more distinctly at its base the red bricks of St. Philomena, and more plainly still the brown iron and glittering brass of the uplifted spire, with the sorrowful beauty of the cross over all; while midway between me and the white shining of the cathedral tower, away toward the evening star, I catch the dark outline of St. Xavier.</p>
                  <p>Beautiful! as I said, I cannot choose but pause and gaze. And now, the mists are lifting more and more, and the sunshine comes dropping down their sombre ground.</p>
                  <p>Growing on the view into familiar shapes, comes out point after point of the landscape—towers and temples, and trees of forests and orchards, and meadow-land—the marts of traffic and the homes of men; and amongst these last there is one to which I would particularly call the reader's attention. It is very humble, to be sure, but its inmates, as you guess from the cream-white walls, overrun with clematis and jasmine, and the clambering stalks of roses, are not devoid of some simple elegance of taste from which some inference of their characters may be drawn, for the things we feel are exhibited in the things which we do.</p>
                  <p>The white-pebbled walk leading from gate to doorway, is edged with close miniature pyramids of box, and the smoothly-shaven shaven sward is shadowed by various shrubs and flowers, and the gold velvet of the dandelion shines wherever it will, from the fence up close beneath the windows, sending up its bitter fragrance out of dew, while sheaves of green phlox stand here and there, that in their time July will top with crimson flowers.</p>
                  <p>The windows are hung with snowy curtains, and in one that fronts the sun, a bird-cage is hung, with an inmate as wildly chattering as though its wings were free. A sky-blue wreath of smoke is curling upward just now, pleasantly suggestive, and drifting southward from the tall kitchen chimney, and Jenny Mitchel, the young housewife, as I guess, is baking pies. Nothing becomes her chubby hands so well as the moulding of pastry, and her cheerful singing, if we were near enough to hear it, would attest that nothing makes her more happy. And well may she sing and be happy, for the rosy-faced baby sits up in its white willow cradle, and crows back to her lullaby; and by and by the honest husband will come from healthful labor, and her handiwork in flour, and fruit, and sugar, and spice, will be sure of due appreciation and praise.</p>
                  <p>Nowhere from among the suburban gardens of this basin rimmed with hills, peeps from beneath its sheltering trees a cozier home. They are plain common-sense people who dwell there, vexed with no vague yearnings for the far off and the unattained—weighed down with no preponderance of sentiment that is blind to all good that is not best, oppressed with no misanthropic fancies about the hatred of the world which they have never injured—nor yet affected with spasmodic struggles as though their great enemy should not wholly baffle them—No, no! dear reader, the great world cares nothing about them—and what of it!</p>
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5993-00000006"/>
                  <p>Its indifference is not a stab in their bosom, the slow bleeding of which can only be stifled in the grave!</p>
                  <p>Helph Randall, the sturdy blacksmith, whose forge is aglow before the sunrise, and rosy-cheeked Jenny, his blue-eyed wife, though she sometimes remembers the shamrock, and sighs, have no such aching wounds concealed—on that I will stake my gold pen, the only valuable I possess.</p>
                  <p>But were they always thus contented and happy?—aye, that's the question. Did they cross that mysterious river whose course never did run smooth, without trial and tribulation such as most voyagers upon its bosom have met since the world began; certainly since Jacob served seven years for Rachel and was then put off with Leah, and obliged to serve other seven for his first love? We shall see; and this brings me back to the opening of my story, and to one of the many Fridays on which my father comes to town. I am not sure but that I must turn another leaf and begin with Thursday—yes, I have the time now. As bright an afternoon it was as ever turned the green swaths into gray, or twinkled against the shadows stretching eastward from the thick-rising haycocks.</p>
                  <p>Early in July it was, when the bitter of the apples began to grow sweetish, and their sunny sides a little russet; when the chickens ceased from peeping and their following of the mother hen, and began to scratch hollows in garden beds, and to fly suddenly on to fences or in trees, and to crow and cackle with unpractised throats, as though they were well used to it, and cared not who heard them, for which unmannerly habits their heads were now and then "brought to the block." Blackberries were ripening in the hedges, and the soft silk swaying beneath the tassels of the corn.</p>
                  <p>Such was the season, and the time just after dinner, that Mrs. Wetherbe came to pass the afternoon, and, as she said, "kill two birds with one stone," by securing a passage to the city on the morrow in my father's carriage. For many are the old ladies, and young ones too, who avail themselves of a like privilege.</p>
                  <p>Of course it was a pleasure to us to accommodate her, and not the less, perhaps, that it was a favor she had never asked, and was never likely to ask again.</p>
                  <p>A plain old lady she was, whom to look at was to know—good and simple-hearted as a child. She had been born and bred in the country, and was thoroughly a country woman—certainly her high, squeaky calf-skin shoes had never trodden off the grass of her own door-yard more than once or twice before; for a friendly tea-drinking with a neighbor was to her a state occasion of not oftener than biennial occurrence. And on the day I speak of she seemed to feel a good deal mortified that she should spend two consecutive days like a <hi rend="i"/>gad-about, in view of which she felt bound in all self-respect to offer many apologies.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, she had not for six years been to visit her niece, Mrs. Emeline Randall, who came to her house more or less every summer, and really felt slighted and grieved that her visits were never returned. So Mrs. Randall expressed herself, and so Mrs. Wetherbe thought, honest old lady as she was, and therefore she felt as though she must go and see Emeline, notwithstanding she would just as soon, she said, put her head in a hornet's nest any time as go to town, for she regarded its gayeties and fashion (and all city people, in her opinion, were gay and fashionable), as avenues leading direct to the kingdom of Satan. Therefore it would have been, as I conceive, quite doubtful whether for the mere pleasure of visiting Emeline, Mrs. Wetherbe would have entered city limits.</p>
                  <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5993-00000007"/>
                  <p>She wanted some <hi rend="i"/>cap stuff and some home-made linen, if such a thing were to be procured in these degenerate days, though if she only had the flax she could spin and weave it herself, old as she was, and would not be caught running about town to buy it, for, if she did say it herself, she was worth more than half the girls now to work, and no one who saw how fast her brown withered fingers flew round the stocking she was knitting, would have doubted it at all.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing is fit for the harvest-field but home-spun linen," said Mrs. Wetherbe, "and if Wetherbe don't have it he'll be nigh about sick, and I may <foreign xml:lang="FRA">jeste</foreign> as well go fust as last, for he won't hear to my spinning, sense I am sixty odd; he says he don't like the <emph>boozz</emph> of the wheel, but to me ther's no nicer music."</p>
                  <p>The last trowsers of her own making were worn out, and along for several days past her good man had then been obliged to wear cloth ones, which fact was <hi rend="i"/>reel scandless in the estimation of our visitor, and in this view it certainly was time she should bestir herself as she proposed.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, she had one or two errands that especially induced her to go to town. A black calico dress she wanted and must have, inasmuch as she had worn the old one five years, and now wanted to cut it up and put it in a quilt, for she had always intended it to <hi rend="i"/>jine some patchwork she had on hand a long time, and now she was going to do it, and make a quilting party and have the work all done at once. I, of course, received then and there the earliest invitation.</p>
                  <p>This was years ago, my reader, and the fashion of such parties has long since passed away, but in due time I will tell you about this, as you may never have an opportunity of personal observation and participation.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you may have seen persons, if not, I have, who seem to feel called on from some obligatory feeling I do not understand, to offer continual apologies for whatever they do or propose to do. And after the announcement of the proposed frolic, she talked a long chapter of whys and wherefores after this wise.</p>
                  <p>William Helphenstein Randall, Emeline's oldest son, had been living at her house three or four years, and he had teased month in and month out to have a wood-chopping and quilting some afternoon, and a regular <hi rend="i"/>play party in the evening, and he had done so many good turns for her and <emph>him</emph> that it seemed as if a body could hardly get round it without seeming reel disobleegin', and though she didn't approve much of such worldly frolics, she thought for once she would humor Helph, and then, too, they would get wood prepared for winter, and more or less quilting done, "for though on pleasure she was bent, she was of frugal mind."</p>
                  <p>I remarked that I was under the impression that Mr. Randall was a man of fortune, and asked if Helph was out of college so early: "Bless your heart, no," said Mrs. Wetherbe, "he was never in a univarsity more'n I be this minute; his father is as rich as <hi rend="i"/>Creseus, but his children got all their larnin' in free schools, pretty much; Helph hasn't been to school this ten years a'most, I guess—let me see, he was in a blacksmith's stop sartainly two or three years before he cum to my house, and he isn't but nineteen now, so he must have been tuck from school airly—the long and short on't is," said the old lady, making her knitting-needles fly again, "Emeline, poor gal, has got a man that is reel clost, and the last time I was there I a'most thought he <hi rend="i"/>begrutched me my vittals, and I was keerful to take butter and garden-sass and so on, enough to airn all I got." And the good lady really dropped her work, so exasperated was she, for though economical and saving in all ways, she was not meanly stingy. She had chanced to glide into a<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5993-00000008"/> communicative mood by no means habitual to her, and the perspiration stood in drops on her forehead, and her little black eyes winked with great rapidity for a minute ere she added, "and that ain't the worst on't neither, he is often in drink, and sich times he gits the Old Clooty in him as big as a yearlin' heifer!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>WHEN first morning began to redden over the eastern stars, our household was astir; and, while we partook of an early breakfast, the light wagon, which was drawn by two smart young bays, was brought to the door. Baskets, jugs, &amp;c., were imbedded among the straw—with which our carriage was plentifully supplied—and a chair was placed behind the one seat for my accommodation, as Mrs. Wetherbe was to be a passenger. I have always regarded the occupancy of that chair upon that occasion, as a virtue of self-sacrifice, which I should not like to repeat, however beautiful in theory be the doctrines of self-abnegation. But, dear reader, I cannot hope that you will appreciate that little benevolence of mine, from the probable fact that you have never ridden eight or less miles in an open wagon, and on a chair slipping from side to side, and jolting up and down behind two coltish trotters; and over roads that, for a part of the time, kept "one wheel in the gutter and one in the air."</p>
                  <p>But it was not my intention to make myself a very prominent character in this story, and therefore I must leave to be imagined the <hi rend="i"/>ups and <hi rend="i"/>downs of this particular epoch of my life. Still one star stood large and white above the eastern hills, but the ground of crimson began to be dashed with gold when we set forward for the city.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the "rough, uneven ways which drew out the miles and made them wearisome," these goings to the city are among the most delightful recollections of my life. They were to my young vision "fresh fields and pastures new;" and after a passage of a few years with their experiences, the new sensations, that freshen and widen the atmosphere of thought, are very few, and precious exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>Distinctly fixed in my mind is every house; its color, size, and the shrubberies and trees with which it was surrounded, and by which the roadsides, between our homestead and that "dim speck" we called the city, was embellished; and nothing in the world would probably seem to me so fine now, as did the white walls, and smooth lawns, and round-headed gateposts, which then astonished my unpractised eyes.</p>
                  <p>Early as we were, we found Mrs. Wetherbe in waiting at the gate; and long before reaching the place of her residence, the fluttering of her scarlet merino shawl, which looked like the rising of another morning, apprised us of the fact.</p>
                  <p>She had been nigh about an hour watching for us, she said, and was just about going into the house to "take off her things" when she saw the heads of the horses before a great cloud of dust; and though she couldn't see the color of the wagon, nor a sign of the critters, to tell whether they were black or white, she knew right-a-way that it was our team, she said, for no body <hi rend="i"/>druv such fine horses as Mr. —. "Here, Mrs. W<hi rend="i"/>itherbe, get right in," said my father who was fond of horses, and felt the compliment as much as though it had been to himself; and it was entirely owing to it that he said Mrs. W<hi rend="i"/>itherbe instead of Mrs. Wetherbe, though I am not sufficiently a metaphysician to explain why such cause should have produced such an effect.</p>
                  <p>Helphenstein, who was chopping wood at the door, called out,<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5993-00000009"/> as we were leaving, "Don't forget to ask Jenny to come to the quilting:" and Mr. Wetherbe paused from his churning, beneath a cherry-tree, to say, "Good-by, mother: be careful, and not lose any money, for its a <emph>divelish</emph> hard thing to slip into a <emph>puss</emph>, and its a <emph>divelish</emph> easy thing to slip out."</p>
                  <p>The good lady held up her purse—which was a little linen bag tied at one end with a tow string, and pretty well distended at the other—to assure the frugal husband that she had not lost it in climbing into the wagon; and having deposited it for safe keeping where old ladies sometimes stow away thread, thimble, beeswax, and the like, she proceeded to give us particular accounts of all moneys, lost or found, of which she ever knew any thing, and at last concluded by saying that she had sometimes thought her old man a leettle more keerful than there was any need of; but after all she didn't know as he was: just the conclusion which any other loving and true-hearted wife would have arrived at in reference to any idiocrasy pertaining to her <hi rend="i"/>old man, no matter what might, could, would, or should be urged on the contrary.</p>
                  <p>One little circumstance of recent occurrence operated greatly in favor of the keerfulness of Mr. Wetherbe, in the mind of the very excellent and prudent Mrs. Wetherbe. Helph had lately, in a most mysterious and unaccountable manner, lost out of his trowsers' pocket two shillings.</p>
                  <p>"It was the strangest thing that ever could have happened," said Mrs. Wetherbe. "He was coming home from town—Helph was—and he said when he paid toll, he said he just had two shillings left, he said; and he put it in the left pocket of his trowsers, he said: he said he knew he had it then, for just as he rode up the bank of the creek, his horse stumbled, and he heard the money jingle, he said, just as plain as could be, he said; and when he got home, and went up stairs, and went to hang up his trowsers before he went to go to bed, he just thought he would feel in his pocket, he said, and behold, the money was not there! He said then, he said, he said he thought he might have been mistaken, he said; and so he felt in the other pocket, he said, and lo, and behold, it was clean gone! And such things make a body feel as if they could not be too keerful," concluded Mrs. Wetherbe; "for that you might as well look for a needle in a haystack, as for a dollar once lost. Helph," she added, "rode back the next morning as far as the toll-house, and though he kept his eyes bent on the ground, the search was useless." And the good lady suddenly started, and clapped her hand, not in her pocket, but where she had deposited her own purse, exclaiming, as she did so, "Mercy on us! I thought at first it was gone; and I declare for it, I am just as weak as a cat now, and I shall not get over my fright this whole and blessed day."</p>
                  <p>"You are a very nervous person," said my father—which was equivalent to saying, you are a foolish woman—for he had little patience with much-ado-about-nothing; and, venting his irritation by a sudden use of the whip, the horses started forward, and threw me quite out of my chair; but the straw received me, and I gained my former position, while the hands of Mrs. Wetherbe were yet in the air in consternation.</p>
                  <p>This feat of mine, and the laughter which accompanied it, brought back more than the first good-humor of my father, and he reined in the horses, saying, "They get over the ground pretty smartly, don't they, Mrs. Wetherbe?"</p>
                  <p>"Gracious sakes," she replied, "how they do whiz past things; it appears like they fairly fly." The conversation then turned on the march of improvement; for we had come to the turnpike, and the rattling of the wheels, and the sharp striking of the hoofs on the stones, were reminders of the higher civilization<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5993-00000010"/> zation to which we were attaining, as well as serious impediments to the colloquial enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>"A number of buildings have gone up since you were here," said my father, addressing the old lady.</p>
                  <p>"What has gone up where?" she replied, bending her ear towards him. But failing to note that she did not reply correctly, he continued: "That is the old place that Squire Gates used to own; it don't look much as it used to, does it?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, la me, what a nice place it is," she replied. "Somewhere near old Squire Gates's, isn't it?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he was an old man," said my father, "when he owned that place; and near sixty when he married his last wife, Polly Weaver, that was."</p>
                  <p>"Dear me, neighbor," said Mrs. Wetherbe, "how we get old and pass away! but I never heard of the old man's death. What kind of fever did you say he died with?"</p>
                  <p>"He is dead, then, is he?" replied my father. "Well, I believe he was a pretty good sort of man. I have nothing laid up against him. Do you know whether he made a will?"</p>
                  <p>"Who did he leave it to?" inquired the lady, still misapprehending. "Jeems, I believe, was his favorite, though I always thought Dan<hi rend="i"/>el the best of the two."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I am glad Jeems has fared the best," replied my father; "he was the likeliest son the old man had."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the old lady, vaguely, for she had not heard a word this time.</p>
                  <p>"What did you say?" asked my father, who liked to have his remarks replied to in some sort.</p>
                  <p>The old lady looked puzzled, and said she didn't say any thing; and after a moment my father resumed: "Well, do you know where the old man died?" and in a tone that seemed to indicate that she didn't know much of any thing.</p>
                  <p>"What?" asked the lady; and she continued in a tone of irritation: "I never saw a wagon make such a terrible rattletebang in my born days."</p>
                  <p>"I asked you if you knew where he died?" said my father, speaking very loud.</p>
                  <p>"Oh no, we did hear once that he had separated from his wife, and gone back to the old place: folks said she wasn't any better than she should be; I don't pretend to know; and I don't know whether he died there, or where he died. In fact, I don't go about much to hear any thing; and I didn't know he was dead till you told me."</p>
                  <p>"Who told you?" asked my father, looking as though she would not repeat the assertion the second time.</p>
                  <p>"I said I didn't know it till you told me," she answered, innocently; "and I was just about to ask you where he died."</p>
                  <p>"The devil!" said my father, losing not only all gallantry, but all patience too; "I never told you no such thing, Mrs. Wetherbe. I have not seen you to talk with you any for a number of years till this morning, when you told me yourself that the old man was dead; and if I had ever told such a story I should remember it."</p>
                  <p>"Why," replied the old lady, "you will surely remember when you think of it. It was just after we passed Squire Gates's house; and the fever he died with you mentioned too."</p>
                  <p>"Good heavens!" said my father, "it was just there you told me; and I had not heard till that minute of his death. I will leave it to my daughter here," he continued, turning to me, who, convulsed with laughter, was shaking and jolting from side to side, and backward and forward, and up and down, all at the same time.</p>
                  <p>Just at this juncture, a smart little chaise, drawn by a high<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5993-00000011"/> headed black horse, with a short tail, approached from the opposite direction. Within sat a white-haired old gentleman, wearing gloves and ruffles; and beside him, a youngish and rather gayly-dressed lady.</p>
                  <p>Both looked smiling and happy; and as they passed, the gentleman bowed low to Mrs. Wetherbe and my father.</p>
                  <p>"That is Squire Gates and his wife now!" exclaimed both at once; and they continued: "It's strange how you happened to tell me he was dead."</p>
                  <p>"Both are right, and both are wrong," said I. Whereupon I explained their mutual misunderstanding, and the slight irritable feelings in which both had indulged subsided, and ended in hearty good-humor.</p>
                  <p>The slant rays of the sun began to struggle through the black smoke that blew against our faces—for the candle and soap factories of the suburbs began to thicken—and the bleating of lambs and calves from the long, low slaughter-houses that ran up the hollows opposite the factories, made the head sick and the heart ache as we entered city limits.</p>
                  <p>Fat, red-faced butchers, carrying long whips, and reining in the gay horses they bestrode, met us, one after another, driving back from the market great droves of cattle, that, tired and half maddened, galloped hither and thither, slashing their tails furiously, and now and then sharply striking their horns against each other, till they were forced through narrow passages into the hot, close pens. No sniff of fresh air, no cool draught of water between them and their doom!</p>
                  <p>Now and then a little market-cart, filled with the empty boxes and barrels that had lately been overflowing with onions, turnips, and radishes, went briskly by us: the two occupants, who sat on a board across the front of the wagon, having thus early disposed of their cargo, and being now returning home to their gardens. Very happy they looked, with the market money in the pockets of their white aprons, which not unfrequently held also a calf's head or beef's liver, a half-dozen pig's feet, or some other like delicacy, to be served up with garlics for dinner.</p>
                  <p>Countrymen, who had rode into market on horseback, were already returning home. The market-basket, which had so lately been filled with the yellow rolls of butter, and covered with the green broad leaves of the plantain, was filled now instead with tea and sugar, perhaps some rice and raisins, and possibly a new calico gown for the wife and baby at home. What a pleasant surprise when he shall get home, and the contents of the basket be made known!</p>
                  <p>After all, the independent yeoman, with his simple rusticity and healthful habits, is the happiest man in the world. And as I saw them then returning home, with happy faces and full baskets, I could not help saying: <q>
                        <l>"When ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"What is it, darter?" said Mrs. Wetherbe, bending towards me; for her poetical apprehensions were not very quick. "I was saying," I replied, "that the farmers are the happiest people in the world."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, they are the happiest," she replied, her predilections, of course, in favor of her own way of living. "It stands to reason," she continued, "that it hardens the heart to live in cities, and makes folks selfish too. Look there," she continued, "what a dreadful sight!" and she pointed to a cart filled with sheep and lambs, on top of which two or three calves were thrown, with their feet tied together, and thrown upwards, their heads stretched back, and their tongues lolling out. "Really the law should punish such useless<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5993-00000012"/> less cruelty," she said; and I thought then, and I still think, that Mrs. Wetherbe was right.</p>
                  <p>Men and business began to thicken; blacksmiths were beating the iron over their glowing forges; carpenters shoving the plane; and the trowel of the mason ringing against the bricks. Men, women, and children hurried to and fro; all languages were heard, and all costumes presented themselves.</p>
                  <p>"What a perfect bedlam!" said Mrs. Wetherbe; "I wish to mercy I was ready to go home. Here, maybe, you had better wait a little," she added, seizing the rein, and pointing in the direction of a grocery and variety store, where some crockery appeared at the window, and a strip of red flannel at the door. "Don't you want to go down town?" said my father, reining up.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she replied, "but I see some red flannel here, and I want to get a few yards for a pettikit."</p>
                  <p>Having assured her that she could get it anywhere else as well, she consented to go on, fixing the place in her mind, so that she could find it again. And we shortly found ourselves at Mr. Randall's door.</p>
                  <p>"We will just go in the back way," said Mrs. Wetherbe; "I don't like to ring the bell, and wait an hour;" and accordingly she opened a side door, and we found ourselves in the breakfast-room, where the family were assembled.</p>
                  <p>"Why, if it isn't Aunty Wetherbe!" exclaimed a tall, pale-faced woman, coming forward and shaking hands. "Have you brought me something good?" she added quickly, at the same time relieving the old lady of the basket of nice butter, the jug of milk, the eggs, and the loaf of home-made bread, which the good lady had brought, partly from the kindness of her heart, partly to secure her welcome.</p>
                  <p>Thus relieved of her burdens, she went forward to the table—for Mr. Randall did not rise—and offered her hand.</p>
                  <p>"Lord-a-mighty, woman, I didn't know you," he said, in a blustering way; but he evidently didn't wish to know her. "Who the devil have you brought with you?" indicating me with a nod of the head, and bending a pair of pale blue eyes upon me.</p>
                  <p>This salutation was not particularly well calculated to make me feel happy, or at home, for I was young and timid; and removing my position from the range of his glance, I deliberately surveyed the group before me.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>MR. RANDALL, that interesting personage, having inquired who I was, with an expletive that I will here omit, remarked to his relative, that half the town was on his shoulders, and he must be off: he supposed also she had enough to do in her little sphere, and would probably have gone home before he should return to dinner; and having wrung her hand and told her she must come and stay six months at his house some time, he departed, or rather adjourned to the adjoining room, for after the rattling of glasses, and a deep-drawn breath or two, he returned, wiping his lips, and said to the old lady in a quick, trembling, querulous tone, and as though his heart were really stirred with anxiety—"Satan help us, woman! I almost forgot to ask about my son—how is Helph? how is my son?"</p>
                  <p>His paternal feelings were soon quieted, and turning to his wife, who had resumed her seat at the table, her hair in papers,<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5993-00000013"/> and dressed in a petticoat and short-gown, he said: "Emeline, don't hurry up the cakes too fast; I don't want dinner a minute before three o'clock," and this time he really left the house. Besides Mrs. Randall, there were at the table two little boys of ten and eight, perhaps; two big boys of about fourteen and sixteen, and a little girl of fourteen, or thereabouts. "Oh," said one of the larger boys, as if first aware of the presence of his aunt, and speaking with his mouthful of beefsteak and coffee, "Oh, Miss Malinda Hoe-the-corn, how do you do? I didn't see you before."</p>
                  <p>Of course the old lady was disconcerted, and blushed as she had perhaps not done since her worthy husband asked her if she had any liking for his name over and above her own.</p>
                  <p>Observing this, the young man continued, "Beg pardon for my beefsteak, I thought it was Malinda Hoe-the-corn, but its my sweetheart, Dolly Anne Matilda Steerhorn, and she's blushing head and ears to see me."</p>
                  <p>And approaching the astonished and bewildered woman, he began to unpin her shawl, which was of an old fashion, saying, as he attempted to pass his arm around her waste, "Get up, my love, and let's have a waltz; come, take off your hoss-blanket."</p>
                  <p>But the old lady held her shawl tightly with one hand thrusting the impudent fellow away with the other, as she ex claimed: "Get along with you, you sassy scrub."</p>
                  <p>"That is right, Aunty Wetherbe," said the mother, "he is a great lubbersides, and that is just what he is;" but she laughed heartily, and all the group, with the exception of the little girl, seemed to think the young man was behaving very funnily. And in his own estimation he was evidently making himself brilliant, and had quite confounded, as he supposed, a simple-minded old woman with his abundant humor and unembarrassed manners. "Well," he continued, no whit discomfited comfited by the evident displeasure of his aunt, "I am a business man, and must leave you, my dear, but I'll bring my wedding-coat and the parson to-night, and an orange-flower for you."</p>
                  <p>There was now an opportunity for the older brother to exhibit some of his accomplishments, and the occasion was not to be slighted; so, after having inquired what news was in the country, how the crops were, &amp;c., he said, "I am sorry, aunt, that I have such a complication of affairs on hand that I can't stay and entertain you, but so it is: you must come round to my house and see my wife before you return home."</p>
                  <p>"Mercy sakes!" exclaimed the old lady, adjusting her spectacles to survey the youth, "you can't be married!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, yes," he replied, "haven't you heard of it? and I have a boy six <hi rend="i"/>munts old!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I'd never have thought it," the aunt said; "but you have grown all out of my knowledge, and I can hardly tell which one you be; in fact, I would not have known you if I had met you any place else," she continued, "and yet I can see Emeline's looks in you."</p>
                  <p>"That is what everybody says," replied the youth; "I look just like my mammy;" for, fancying it made him seem boyish to say mother, he addressed her in a half mock, half serious way, as mammy.</p>
                  <p>"And so you have to go away to your work, do you?" resumed the credulous woman: "what kind of business are you doing here?"</p>
                  <p>"I am a chicken fancier," he replied: "got any Polands or Shanghais out your way?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," replied Aunt Wetherbe, unobservant of the smiles and tittering about the table.</p>
                  <p>"I'd like to get some white bantams for my wife and baby;"<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5993-00000014"/> and the facetious nephew closed one eye and fixed the other upon me.</p>
                  <p>"What do you call the baby?" inquired the aunt.</p>
                  <p>"My wife wants to call him for me," he said; "but I don't like my own name, and think of calling him Jim Crow!"</p>
                  <p>"Now just get along with you," the mother said, "and no more of your nonsense."</p>
                  <p>He then began teasing his mammy, as he called her, for some money to buy white kid gloves, saying he wanted to take his girl to a ball. "Then you have just been imposing upon me," said Mrs. Wetherbe, to which the ill-mannered fellow replied, that he hadn't been doing nothing shorter; when, turning to the little girl who was quietly eating her breakfast, he continued, taking her ear between his thumb and finger, and turning her head to one side, "I want you to iron my ruffled shirt fust rate and particular, do you hear that, nigger waiter?"</p>
                  <p>After these feats he visited the sideboard, after the example of his father, and having asked his mammy if she knew where in thunder the old man kept the dimes, adjusted a jaunty cap of shining leather to one side and left the house.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad you are gone," said the girl, looking after him and speaking for the first time.</p>
                  <p>"Come, come, you just tend to your own affairs, Miss Jenny, and finish your breakfast some time before noon," said Mrs. Randall, putting on a severe look.</p>
                  <p>"I had to wait on the children all the time you were eating," she replied, rising from the table with glowing cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Oh you had to wait on great things!" replied the lady, tartly: "big eaters always want some excuse."</p>
                  <p>Not till the two little boys had demolished the last remnants of what seemed to have been but a "spare feast" in the first place, was the bell rung for "Aunt Kitty," the colored woman who presided over the kitchen. She was one of those dear old creatures whom you feel like petting and calling "mammy" at once. She was quiet, and goodness of heart shone out all over her yellow face, and a cheerful piety pervaded her conversation.</p>
                  <p>She retained still the softness of manner and cordial warmth of feeling peculiar to the South; and added to this was the patient submission that never thought of opposition.</p>
                  <p>Nearly fifty years she had lived, and most of them had been passed in hard labor; but notwithstanding incessant toil she was still, to my thinking, pretty. Perhaps, reader, you are smiling at what you consider a preposterous idea of beauty. True, she possessed few of the concomitants which, in the popular estimation, go to make up beauty; neither matchless symmetry, fairness of complexion, nor that crowning beauty of womanhood, long and silken tresses.</p>
                  <p>Ah no; her face was a bright olive, and her hair was concealed by a gorgeous turban, and I suspect better so concealed, but her teeth were sound, and of sparkling whiteness, and her eyes black as night, and large, but instead of an arrowy, of a kind of tearful and reproachful expression; indeed in all her face there was that which would have seemed reproachful, but for the sweetly-subduing smile that played over all. Short and thick-set in person was Aunt Kitty, and as for her dress, I can only say it was cleanly, for in other respects it was like that of the celebrated priest who figures in the nursery rhyme, "all tattered and torn." And as for her slippers, they had evidently never been made for her, and in all probability were worn out before they came into her possession; but her feet were mostly concealed by the long skirt of her dress, a morning wrapper of thin white muslin, past the<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5993-00000015"/> uses of her mistress, and she, be it known to you, gave nothing away which, by any possibility, could serve herself.</p>
                  <p>To adapt it to her work, Aunt Kitty had shortened the sleeves and tucked up the skirt with pins; but the thinness of the fabric revealed the bright red and blue plaids of the worsted petticoat, making her appearance something fantastic. Courtesying to us gracefully as she entered the breakfast-room, she proceeded to remove the dishes.</p>
                  <p>"Why don't you take a bite first yourself?" asked Mrs. Randall.</p>
                  <p>"No matter about me," she said; "I want to guv these ladies a cup of coffee—they are come away from the country, and must feel holler-like—thank de Lord, we can 'suscitate em;" and with a monument of dishes in her hands she was leaving the room, when Mrs. Randall asked, in no very mild tones, if she considered herself mistress of the house; and if not, directed her to wait till she had directions before she went to wasting things by preparing a breakfast that nobody wanted; and turning to us, she said, a little more mildly, but in a way that precluded our acceptance, "You breakfasted at home, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>Poor Aunt Kitty was sadly disappointed, but consoled herself in the hope that we would return to dinner—but Mrs. Randall said nothing about it. But before I proceed with our shopping expedition, I have somewhat to say of Jenny, a pretty rosy-faced Irish girl, whom Mrs. Randall told us was her adopted daughter; and certainly we should never have guessed it otherwise.</p>
                  <p>"I do by her just as I would by my own child," said the lady; "and for her encouragement, I give her three shillings in money every week to buy what she likes."</p>
                  <p>"You can well afford it; she must be a great deal of help to you," Mrs. Wetherbe said.</p>
                  <p>But Mrs. Randall affirmed that she was little assistance to her, though she admitted that Jenny did all the sewing for the family, the chamber-work, tending at the door, errands, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>From my own observation for a single hour, I felt assured that the girl's situation was any thing but desirable: called on constantly by all members of the family to do this thing and that,—for having no set tasks assigned, it was thought she could do every thing, and furthermore be responsible for all the accidents of all the departments. "Here, Jenny," called one of the little boys, and they were no less accomplished in their way than the older brothers, "black my shoes, and do it quick, too,"—at the same time throwing a pair of coarse stogies roughly against her.</p>
                  <p>"I haven't time," she answered, "you must do it yourself."</p>
                  <p>"That's a great big lie," said the boy; and prostrating himself on the floor, he caught her skirts and held her fast, as he informed us that her father was nobody but an old drunkard, and her mother was a washerwoman, and that Jenny had better look at home before she got too proud to black shoes.</p>
                  <p>"Let me go," said she; "if my father is a drunkard, yours is no better,"—and she vainly tried to pull away from him, her face burning with shame and anger for the exposure.</p>
                  <p>"Jenny!" called Mrs. Randall from the head of the stairs, "come along with you and do your chamber-work."</p>
                  <p>"Franklin is holding me, and won't let me come," she answered. But the lady repeated the order, saying she would hear no such stories.</p>
                  <p>"It's pretty much so!" called out Mrs. Wetherbe, "it's pretty much so, Emeline." But as she descended, the boy loosened his hold, and of course received no blame—and the<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5993-00000016"/> girl a slap on the ear, with the admonition to see now if she could do her work.</p>
                  <p>"Sissy," said Aunt Kitty, putting her head in the door, "can't you just run, honey, and get me a cent's worth of yeast?"</p>
                  <p>And this is only a sample of the constant requirements at her hands, and of the treatment she received.</p>
                  <p>Meantime Mrs. Wetherbe had asked Jenny to pass a week at her house, assist in preparations for, and enjoy the quilting party; but she feared to ask liberty, and the kind old lady broke the matter to Mrs. Randall, and I too seconded the appeal.</p>
                  <p>"She has no dress to wear," urged the mistress.</p>
                  <p>"Then she ought to have," responded the old lady, with spirit.</p>
                  <p>"I have money enough to get one," said Jenny, bashfully; "can't I go with these ladies and get it?"</p>
                  <p>But Mrs. Randall said she had been idling away too much time to ask for more, and she enumerated a dozen things that required to be done; however, Mrs. Wetherbe and I combated the decision, and volunteered our assistance, so that reluctant permission to go out with us was granted. Gratitude opened the heart of the little maid, and as we hastened our work, she confided to me many of her trials and sorrows, from which it appeared that the three shillings per week made all her compensation, with the exception of now and then an old pair of gloves or a faded ribbon, cast off by her mistress. True it was, her father was a drunkard, and her mother, a poor weakly woman, had six children to provide for, and that she gave her own earnings to their support, almost altogether. "They have pretended to adopt me as a child," she said, "that they may appear liberal in the eyes of the world; but I am, as you see, an underling and a drudge."</p>
                  <p>My heart ached for her as I saw the hardness and hopelessness of her fate; and when at last she was ready to go with us, the poor attempt to look smart really made her appear more ill than before; but between her palm and her torn glove she had slipped two dollars in small change, and she was quite happy. Then, too, the new dress should be made in womanly fashion, for she was in her fifteenth year.</p>
                  <p>We were just about setting out, when, with more exultation than regret in her tone, Mrs. Randall called Jenny to come back, for that her little brother wanted to see her.</p>
                  <p>"O dear!" she said, turning away with tears in her eyes; and in that exclamation there was the death of all her hopes.</p>
                  <p>We soon saw how it was: the miserable little wretch was come for money, and without a word, Jenny removed the glove and gave him all.</p>
                  <p>"Don't wait to blubber," said the mistress; "you have lost time enough for one day"—and the poor girl retired to exchange her best dress and renew her work.</p>
                  <p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Randall had belonged to the poorest class of people, and the possession of wealth had increased or given scope to natural meanness, without diminishing their vulgarity in the least.</p>
                  <p>If there be any class of people with whom I really dislike to come in contact, it is the naturally mean and vulgar, and accidentally rich. You need but a glimpse of such persons, or of their homes, to know them. No expenditure in lace, silks, gold chains, Brussels, and mahogany, can remove them one hand's breadth from their proper position; and the proper position of the Randalls was that of the menials over whom their money only gave them supremacy.</p>
                  <p>A long time we were in getting through our many errands, for Mrs. Wetherbe was detained not a little in wonderment<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5993-00000017"/> at this novelty and that. When a funeral passed, she could not think who could be dead, and essayed all her powers to get a glimpse of the coffin, that she might know whether it were child or adult; and if a horseman cantered past, she gazed after him, wondering if he was not going for the doctor, and if he was, who in the world could be sick. Then, too, she selected little samples of the goods she wished to purchase, and carried them up to Emeline's, to determine whether they would wash well; but notwithstanding her frugality and cautiousness, she was not mean. And here let me record to her honor, that she lightened her purse on Jenny's account to the amount of a pretty new dress. But she could not be spared for a week, and it was agreed that Helph should be sent to bring her on the day of the quilting; and so, between smiles and tears, we left her.</p>
                  <p>Alas for Aunt Kitty! nothing could alleviate her disappointment: she had prepared dinner with special reference to us, and we had not been there to partake of it, or to praise her.</p>
                  <p>"Poor souls! de Lord help you," she said; "you will be starved a'most!"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Randall was sorry dinner was over, but she never thought of getting hungry when she was busy.</p>
                  <p>It was long after nightfall when, having left our friend and her various luggage at her own home, we arrived at ours; and I assure you, reader, we had earned excellent appetites for the supper that waited us</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>THAT going to town of Mrs. Wetherbe, about which I told you in my last chapter, was chiefly with a view to purchases in reference to the proposed quilting party and wood-chopping. Not only did we select calico for the border of the quilt, together with cotton batting and spool-thread, but we also procured sundry niceties in the edible way, among which I remember a jug of Orleans molasses, half a pound of ground ginger, three mackerels, five pounds of cheese, and two pounds of raisins.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wetherbe had never made a "frolic" before, she said, and now she wouldn't have the name of being <hi rend="i"/>near about it, let it cost what it would.</p>
                  <p>And great excitement and talk ran through all the neighborhood so soon as it was known that Mrs. Wetherbe had been to town; and rumor speedily exaggerated the gallon of molasses into a dozen gallons, the three mackerels into a keg, and so on.</p>
                  <p>Many thought it was not very creditable in a "professor" to make such a "spree;" some wondered where she would find any body good enough to ask; others supposed she would have all her company from town, and all agreed that if she was going to have her "big-bug" relations, and do her "great gaul," she might for all of them. The wonder was that she<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5993-00000018"/> didn't make a party of "whole cloth," and not stick her quilt in at all.</p>
                  <p>There was a great deal of surmising and debating as to the quilt itself; some hoped it was a little nicer than any patchwork they had seen of Mrs. Wetherbe's making.</p>
                  <p>But this unamiable disposition gradually gave way when it was known that the frolic would embrace a wood-chopping as well as quilting; for surely, they said, she don't expect chaps from town to cut wood!</p>
                  <p>The gossip concerning the quilt began to lose interest; what matter whether it were composed of stars or stripes, "rising suns" or "crescents," Mrs. Wetherbe knew her own business of course, and those who had at first hoped they would not be invited because they were sure they would not go if they were wavered visibly in their stout resolves.</p>
                  <p>From one or two families in which the greatest curiosity reigned, spies were sent out in the shape of little girls and boys, whose ostensible objects were the borrowing of a darning-needle or a peck measure of the harmless family who were become the centre of attraction, but whose real errands were to see what they could see. So the feeling of asperity was mollified, inasmuch as reports thus obtained circulation favoring the neighborly and democratic disposition and character hitherto borne by the Wetherbes.</p>
                  <p>At one time the good old lady was found with her sleeves rolled back and mixing bread as she used to do; and invariably she inquired of the little spies how affairs were going forward at home. After all, the neighbors began to think the quilting was not going to be any such great things more than other quiltings. But I may as well report the rest from actual observation.</p>
                  <p>One morning as I looked up from the window where I sat. I saw Helphenstein Randall approaching, and at once divined his errand, in which guess-work I was assisted by the method of his coming, for he was mounted upon Mrs. Wetherbe's old roan mare, and riding a side-saddle. The boy seemed in spirits, as I judged from his having the ragged brim of his hat turned up jauntily in front, as also from his goading forward the beast with heels and bridle-rein: but not a whit cared she; with her youth she had lost ambition and moved in slow and graceless fashion, her neck drooping, and her nose greatly in advance of her ears. Half an hour afterwards I was on the way to assist in preparing for the approaching festivities. I, however, was only a kind of secondary maid of honor, for first and foremost upon all occasions of the kind was Ellen Blake, and in this instance she had preceded me, and with her hair in papers and her sleeves and skirt tucked up, came forth in a kind of at-home-attire, mistress-of-the-house fashion, to welcome me, a privilege she always assumed on occasions of the kind.</p>
                  <p>In truth, Ellen really had a genius for managing the affairs of other people, and for the time being felt the same interest in whatever was being done as though it were her own. She was also thought, in our neighborhood, to be "very good company," and therefore it is no wonder her services were much in demand. Very <emph>ambitious</emph> about her work was Ellen, and few persons could get more through in a day than she, in fact there are few more faultless; nevertheless, there was one objection which some of the most old-fashioned people urged against her—she was dressy, and the rumor was just now current that she had got a new "flat," trimmed as full as it could stick of blue ribbon and red artificial flowers, and also a white dress flounced up to the very knees!</p>
                  <p>Already the quilt was in the frames and <hi rend="i"/>laid out, as the<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5993-00000019"/> marking was called; the chamber was all ready for the guests, and Ellen said she thought she had been pretty smart if she did say it herself.</p>
                  <p>"I wanted to take the bed out of my front room and have the quilting there," Mrs. Wetherbe said, "but this headstrong <emph>piece</emph> (pointing to Ellen) wouldn't hear of it."</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed," replied the girl, "it would have been the greatest piece of presumption in the world; la, me! if we young folks <hi rend="i"/>cut up as we do sometimes, we'd have that nice carpet in doll-rags, and then the work of taking down and putting up the bedstead, all for nothing as you may say."</p>
                  <p>I fully agreed that Ellen had made the wisest arrangement; and here I may as well briefly describe the room. It was large, covering the space occupied by three rooms on the ground floor, and next to the roof, so the quilt could be conveniently attached to the rafters by ropes, and thus drawn up out of the way in case it were not finished before nightfall. The walls were unplastered, and the one on either side sloped within a few feet of the floor, but the gable windows admitted a sufficiency of light, and there was neither carpet nor furniture <hi rend="i"/>in the way, except, indeed, the furnishing which Ellen had contrived for the occasion, and which consisted chiefly of divans, formed of boards and blocks, and cushioned with quilts and the like. Besides these there were two or three barrels covered over with table-cloths and designed to serve as hat-racks; save these, there was no other furniture unless the draperies formed of petticoats and trowsers here and there suspended from pegs might be deemed such.</p>
                  <p>The rafters, too, were variously garnished with bags of seeds, bunches of dried herbs, and hanks of yarn, together with some fine specimens of extra large corn, having the husks turned back from the yellow ears and twisted into braids, by which it was hung for preservation and show. One more finishing touch our combined ingenuity gave the room on the morning of the day our guests were expected, consisting of green boughs and decorations of flowers.</p>
                  <p>While we were busy with preparations in the kitchen the day following my arrival, Mrs. Randall suddenly made her appearance, wearing a faded dress, an old straw bonnet, and bearing in one hand a satchel, and in the other an empty basket.</p>
                  <p>"Hi O! what brought you, mother?" exclaimed Helph, who was watching our progress in beating eggs, weighing sugar, crushing spices, &amp;c., which question was followed with "Where is Jenny?" and "How did you come?"</p>
                  <p>We soon learned that she had come in a market wagon for the sake of economy, that her basket was to carry home eggs, butter, apples, and whatever she could get, and that, though she proposed to assist us, she would in fact disconcert our arrangements and that our pleasure. Jenny was left at home to attend the house, while she recruited and enjoyed a little fun.</p>
                  <p>No sooner had she tied on one of Mrs. Wetherbe's checked aprons, and turned back her sleeves, than our trouble began; of course she knew a better way to do every thing than we, and the supper would not do at all, unless prepared under her direction.</p>
                  <p>Very glad we were when Mrs. Wetherbe said, "Too many cooks spoil the broth, and I guess the girls better have it their own way." But she was not to be dissuaded; she had come to help, and she was sure she would rather be doing a little than not.</p>
                  <p>She gave us accounts of all the balls, dinners, suppers, &amp;c., at which she had been, and tried to impress upon us the necessity<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5993-00000020"/> cessity of having our country quilting as much in the style of them as we could.</p>
                  <p>"We must graduate our ginger-cakes," she said, "and so form a pyramid for the central ornament of the table; the butter must be transformed to pineapples, and we must either have no meats and tea, or else call it a dinner, and after it was eaten, serve round coffee on little salvers, for which purpose we should have pretty china cups," she said.</p>
                  <p>Alas, I knew right well how simply ludicrous it would be to attempt the twisting of Aunt Wetherbe's quilting and wood-chopping into a fashionable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soirée</foreign>, but I had little eloquence or argument at command with which to combat her positive assertions.</p>
                  <p>"Have you sent your notes of invitation yet?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"No, nor I don't mean to send no notes nor nothing," said the aunt, a little indignant; "it ain't like as if the queen was going to make a quilting, I reckon." But without heeding the negation, Mrs. Randall continued to say she had brought out some gilt-edged paper and several specimen cards, among which she thought perhaps the most elegant would be, "Mr. and Mrs. Wetherbe at home," specifying the time, and addressed to whom ever was designed to be invited. But all in vain the lady urged the point; the old-fashioned aunt said she would have no such <hi rend="i"/>mess written, that Helph might get on his horse and ride through the neighborhood and ask the young people to come to the quilting and wood-chopping.</p>
                  <p>There was but one thing left to mar the general happiness; a rumor that Mrs. Wetherbe had hired a "nigger waiter" for a week.</p>
                  <p>Many there were who didn't and couldn't believe it, but others testified to the fact of having seen her with their own eyes.</p>
                  <p>What with all our combined forces, preparations went actively forward, and before the appointed day all was in readiness—coffee ground, tea ready for steeping, chickens prepared to broil, cakes and puddings baked, and all the extra saucers filled with preserves.</p>
                  <p>Ellen stoutly maintained her place as mistress of ceremonies, Mrs. Randall took her place as assistant, so that mine became quite a subordinate position, for which I was not sorry, for I did not feel competent to grace the elevated position at first assigned me.</p>
                  <p>Helph had once or twice been warned by his mother that Jenny would not come, that he need not trouble himself to go for her, but he persisted in the determination to bring her; in fact his heart was set on it, and the aunt seconded his inclination; it was chiefly for Helph and Jenny she designed the merry-making, and now she could not be cheated of her darling expectation.</p>
                  <p>"Well, have your own way and live the longer," said the mother; to which the son answered that such was his intention; and accordingly, having procured the best buggy the neighborhood afforded, and brushed coat and hat with extra care, he set out for the city before sunrise of the long anticipated day. Dinner was eaten earlier than usual, and at one o'clock we were all prepared—Mrs. Wetherbe in the black silk dress she had had for twenty years; Ellen in her white flounced dress, with a comb of enormous size, and a wreath of flowers above her curls; but when "Emeline" made her appearance our surprise burst forth in exclamations—she had appropriated Jenny's new dress to herself.</p>
                  <p>"Now you needn't scold, Aunt Wetherbe," she said; "it was really too pretty a thing for that child, and besides, I intend to get her another before long."</p>
                  <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5993-00000021"/>
                  <p>"Humph!" said the old lady, "every bit and grain of my comfort is gone," and removing her spectacles she continued silently rubbing them through her apron till Ellen, who was standing at the window on tip-toe, announced that Jane Stilman was coming with her "changeable silk on."</p>
                  <p>And Jane Stilman had scarcely "taken off her things" when Polly Harris was announced. Her dress was of thin white muslin, and she wore a broad-brimmed Leghorn hat, set off with a profusion of gay ribbons and flowers, notwithstanding she had ridden on horseback; but in those times riding-dresses were not in vogue.</p>
                  <p>Amid merry jesting and laughter we took our places at the quilt, while Ellen kept watch at the window and brought up the new-comers, sometimes two or three at once.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wetherbe had not been at all exclusive, and her invitations included all, rich and poor, maid and mistress, as far as her acquaintance went. So, while some came in calico gowns, with handkerchiefs tied over their heads, and walking across the fields, others were dressed in silks and satins, and rode on horseback, or were brought in the market wagon by their fathers or brothers.</p>
                  <p>Along the yard fence hung rows of side-saddles, and old work horses and sleek fillies were here and there tied to the branches of the trees, to enjoy the shade and nibble the grass, while the long-legged colts responded to the calls of the mothers, capering about as they would.</p>
                  <p>Nimbly ran the fingers up and down and across the quilt, and tongues moved no less nimbly; and though now and then glances strayed away from the work to the fields, and suppressed titters broke into loud laughter as one after another the young men were seen with axes over their shoulders wending towards the woods, the work went on bravely, and Polly Harris soon called out, clapping her hands in triumph, "Our side is ready to 'roll.'"</p>
                  <p>Very busy and very happy was Ellen, now attending the "rolling" of the quilt, now examining the stitching of some young quilter, and now serving round cakes and cider, and giving kind words and smiles to every one.</p>
                  <p>"O, Ellen," called a young mischief-loving girl, "please let me and Jane Stilman go out and play," and forthwith they ran down stairs, and it was not till they were presently seen skipping across the field with a basket of cakes and a jug of cider, that their motive was suspected, when for the first time that day gossip found a vent.</p>
                  <p>"I'd be sorry," said Mehitable Long, a tall, oldish girl, "to be seen running after the boys, as some is."</p>
                  <p>"La, me, Mehitable," answered Ellen, who always had a good word for everybody, "it ain't every one who is exemplary like you, but they are just in fun, you know; young wild girls, you know."</p>
                  <p>"I don't know how young they be," answered the lady tartly, not much relishing any allusions to age, "but 'birds of a feather flock together,' and them that likes the boys can talk in favor of others that likes them."</p>
                  <p>"Why, don't you like them?" asked Hetty Day, looking up archly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I like them out of my sight," answered Mehitable, stitching fast. Upon hearing this the dimples deepened in Hetty's cheeks, and the smile was as visible in her black eyes as on her lips.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose you wish you had gone along," said Mehitable maliciously, "but I can tell you the young doctor is not there, he was called away to the country about twelve o'clock, to a man that took sick yesterday." Hetty's face crimsoned a<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5993-00000022"/> little, but otherwise she manifested no annoyance, but replied laughingly that she hoped he would get back before night.</p>
                  <p>Mehitable was not thus to be baffled; her heart was overflowing with bitterness, inasmuch as he whom she called the <hi rend="i"/>young doctor was, in her estimation, old enough to be a more fitting mate for herself than Hetty, her successful rival, and no sooner was she foiled in one direction than she turned in another, evidently "chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancies." "I guess he is no great things of a doctor after all," she said; and then elevating her voice and addressing a maiden lady on the opposite side of the quilt, she continued, "did you hear, Elizabeth, about his going to visit Mrs. Mercer, and supposing her attacked with cholera, when in a day or two the disease fell in her arms!"</p>
                  <p>This splenetic effervescence was followed by a general burst of laughter, during which Hetty went to the window, ostensibly to disentangle her thread, but Ellen speedily relieved her by inviting her to go with her below and see about the supper.</p>
                  <p>"I should think," said Elizabeth, who cordially sympathized with her friend, "the little upstart would be glad to get out of sight;" and then came a long account of the miserable way in which Hetty's family lived; every one knows, they said, her father drinks up every thing, and for all she looks so fine in her white dress, most likely her mother has earned it by washing or sewing; they say she wants to marry off her young beauty, but I guess it will be hard to do.</p>
                  <p>When Hetty returned to the garret, her eyes were not so bright as they had previously been, but the sadly subdued manner made her only the prettier, and all, save the two maidens alluded to, were ready to say and do something for her pleasure. They, however, were not yet satisfied, and tipping their tongues with the unkindest venom of all, began to talk of a wealthy and accomplished young lady somewhere, whom it was rumored the doctor was shortly to marry, in spite of the little flirtations at home, that some people thought meant something. Very coolly they talked of the young lady's superior position and advantages, as though no humble, loving heart shook under their words as beneath a storm of arrows.</p>
                  <p>Opportunely came back the young girls from the woods, and hearing the reports they had to make, of the number of choppers, how many trees were felled, &amp;c., the broken mirthfulness was restored, though Hetty laughed less joyously, and her elderly rivals maintained a dignified reserve.</p>
                  <p>Aside from the little episode recorded, all went merry, and from the west window the golden streak of sunshine stretched further and further till it began to climb the opposite wall, when the quilt was rolled to so narrow a width that but few could work to advantage, and Ellen, selecting the most expeditious to complete the task, took with her the rest to assist in preparing the supper, which was done to the music of the vigorous strokes echoing and re-echoing from among the wooded hills.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <p>BENEATH the glimmer of more candles than Mrs. Wetherbe had previously burned at once, the supper was spread, and very nice and plentiful it was; for, more mindful of the hungry wood-choppers than of Mrs. Randall's notions of propriety, there were at least a dozen broiled chickens, besides other meats on the table I need not attempt a full description of<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5993-00000023"/> conserves and cakes, bread, pies and puddings, delicious tea and coffee, with all the etceteras, which country housewifes provide with liberal hands on occasions of this sort.</p>
                  <p>Very proud was Ellen, as she took the last survey previously to sounding the horn for the "men-folks;" and well she might be proud, for it was chiefly through her ingenuity and active agency that all was nice and tasteful as it was.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Randall still made herself officious, but with less assurance than at first; and Ellen was in nowise inclined to yield her position, and indeed almost the entire responsibility rested upon her, for poor Mrs. Wetherbe was sadly out of spirits in consequence of the non-appearance of Helph and Jenny. All possible chances of evil she exaggerated, and in her simple mind there were a thousand dangers which did not in reality exist. In spite of the festivities about her the tears would come. Likely enough, she said, the dear boy had got into the canal or the river and was <hi rend="i"/>drownded, or his critter might have become frightened, there were so many <hi rend="i"/>sceerry things in town, and so have run away and broken every thing to pieces.</p>
                  <p>Once or twice she walked to the neighboring hill in the hope of seeing him in the far distance, but in vain—he came not; the supper could be delayed no longer, and sitting by the window that overlooked the highway, the kind-hearted woman wept and gazed alternately. Not so the mother—little trouble she gave herself as to whether any accident had befallen her son; perhaps she guessed the cause of his delay, but whether so or not, none were gayer than she.</p>
                  <p>Her beauty had once been of a showy order, and indeed she was not yet very much faded, and on this occasion her hair was tastefully arranged, and though her gown was of calico, she was really the best dressed woman in the assembly. Of this she seemed aware, and glided into flirtations with the country beaux in a free and easy way, which greatly surprised some of us unsophisticated lassies—in fact, one or two elderly bachelors were sorely disappointed, as well as amazed, when they knew that the lady from town was none other than Helph's mother! I cannot remember the time when my animal spirits had much of the careless buoyancy which makes youth so blessed, and at the time I write of I was little more than a passive observer, and for this reason, perhaps, I remember more correctly the incidents of the evening.</p>
                  <p>The table was spread among the trees in the door-yard, which was all illuminated with tallow candles; the snowy linen waved in the breeze, and the fragrance of tea and coffee was for the time being pleasanter than flowers. But flowers I remember were in requisition, and such as were in bloom, large or small, bright or pale, were gathered for adornment of tresses, curled and braided with elaborate care. At a later hour some of them were transferred to the buttonholes of favored admirers.</p>
                  <p>What an outbreak of merriment there was, when down the twilight hill that sloped against the woods came the little band of choppers, with coats swung upon their arms and axes gleaming over their shoulders. Every thing became irresistibly funny, and from the beds of poppies and hollyhocks went peals of mingled jests and laughter.</p>
                  <p>The quilt was finished, but Mehitable and Elizabeth remained close within the chamber, whether to contemplate the completed work, or to regale themselves with a little gossip of their own, I do not know.</p>
                  <p>A large tin lantern was placed on the top of the pump, and beside it stood a wash-tub filled with water which was intended to serve, and did serve, as a general basin for the ablutions of the young men. Besides the usual "roller-towel,"<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5993-00000024"/> which hung by the kitchen door, there were two or three extra ones attached to the boughs of the apple-tree by the well; and the bar of yellow soap procured for the occasion, lay on a shingle conveniently at hand, while a paper comb-case dangled from a bough betwixt the towels.</p>
                  <p>These toilet facilities were deemed by some of the party quite superfluous, and their wooden pocket-combs and handkerchiefs were modestly preferred. During the "fixing up" the exuberance of spirits found vent in liberal splashing and dashing of water upon each other, as also in wrestling bouts and mere wordy warfare, at the conclusion of which the more aristocratic of the gentlemen resumed their coats, while others, disdaining ceremony, remained not only at the supper, but during the entire evening, "in their shirt sleeves," and with silk handkerchiefs bound about their waists after the fashion of reapers.</p>
                  <p>"Come, boys!" called Ellen, who assumed a sort of motherly tone and manner toward us all, "what <emph>does</emph> make you stay away so."</p>
                  <p>The laughter among the girls subsided to titters, as in a demure row they arranged themselves along one side of the table, and the jests fell at once to a murmur as the "boys" seated themselves opposite. "Now, don't all speak at once," said Ellen; "how will you have your coffee, Quincy?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Quincy Adams Bell said he was not particular—he would take a little sugar and a little cream if she had them handy, if not, it made no difference.</p>
                  <p>"Tea or coffee, Mehitable?" she said next. But the lady addressed didn't drink either—coffee made her drowsy-like, and if she should drink a cup of tea she should not sleep a <emph>wink</emph> all night.</p>
                  <p>Elizabeth said Mehitt was just like herself—she drank a great deal, and strong. This joke produced much laughter; and indeed the mirthfulness was quite irrepressible; on the part of the ladies, because of the joyous occasion and their greater excitability; and on that of the gentlemen, because of the green and yellow twisted bottles that had glistened that afternoon in the ivy that grew along the woods; even more for this perhaps than for the bright eyes opposite.</p>
                  <p>One said she drank her tea <emph>naked;</emph> another, that Ellen might give her a half-a-cup—she would rather have a little and have it good, <emph>as</emph> to have a good deal and not have it good. And in this she meant not the slightest offence or insinuation. "I hope," said Mr. Wetherbe, speaking in a tremulous voice, and pushing back his thin gray hair, "I hope you will none of you think hard of my woman for not coming to sarve you herself—she is in the shader of trouble, but she, as well as myself, thanks you all for the good turn you have done us, and wishes you to make yourselves at home, and frolic as long as you are a mind to," and the good old man retired to the house to give his wife such comfort as he could. The shadow of their sorrow did not rest long upon the group at the table, and for its temporary suppression the mirth was louder than before. There were one or two exceptions, however, among the gay company. Poor Hetty Day, as her eyes ran along the line of smiling faces and failed of the object of their search they drooped heavily, and her smiles and words were alike forced. Between her and all the gayety stood the vision of a fair lady conjured by the evil words of Mehitable and Elizabeth, and scarcely would the tears stay back any longer when her light-hearted neighbors rallied her as to the cause of her dejection. At the sound of a hoofstroke on the highway her quick and deep attention betrayed the interest she felt in the absent doctor.</p>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5993-00000025"/>
                  <p>"Why hast thou no music on thy tongue, fair maiden?" asked a pale slender young man sitting near her; and looking up, her eyes encountered the blue melancholy orbs of a young cooper, who had lately neglected the adze for the pen, in the use of which, by the way, he was not likely to obtain much facility.</p>
                  <p>His flaxen hair hung in curls down his shoulders, he wore his collar reversed, and a sprig of cedar in the buttonhole of his vest, which was of red and yellow colors, otherwise his dress was not fantastical, though he presented the appearance of one whose inclinations outstripped his means, perhaps. A gold chain attached to a silver watch, and a bracelet of hair on the left wrist, fastened with a small tinsel clasp, evinced an undisciplined taste, though his face attested natural refinement. He had recently published in the "Ladies' Garland" two poems, entitled and opening as follows:</p>

                  <p>These poems he took from his pocket and submitted to the critical acumen of Hetty, saying he should really take it as a great favor if she would tell him frankly what her opinion was of the repetitions in the last line of the first stanza, as also what she thought of the idea of comparing a child to a flower, and of Death's transplanting it from earth to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Hetty knew nothing of poetry, but she possessed an instinctive sense of politeness and something of tact withal, as indeed most women do, and shaped her answer to conceal her own ignorance, and at the same time flatter her auditor. This so inflated his vanity that he informed her confidentially that he was just then busily engaged in the collection of his old letters, for nobody knew, he said, what publicity they might come to.</p>
                  <p>In his apprehensions and cautious endeavors the lady's judgment concurred with his own, and he resolved at once to put in the "Ladies' Garland" an advertisement, requesting all persons who might have in their possession any letters or other written documents of his, to return them to the address of P. Joel Springer, forthwith. High above the praises of his simple listener he heard sounding the blessed award of the future time, and the echoes of his unrequited sorrows went moaning through the farther end of the world.</p>
                  <p>Ah, me, who of us after all are much wiser; for on bases as unsubstantial have we not at one time or another rested some gorgeous fabric, whose turrets were to darken among the stars.</p>
                  <p>Time soon enough strips the future of its phantasy—drives aside the softening mists, and reveals the hard and sharp realities of things.</p>
                  <p>But, to return—merry were the guests generally, and ample justice they did to the viands before them, partly in response to excellent appetites, and partly in answer to the urgent entreaties of Ellen, though she constantly depreciated her culinary skill, and reiterated again and again that she had nothing very inviting. But her praises were on every tongue, and her hands were more than busy with the much service required of them, but this added to her happiness; and as she glided up<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5993-00000026"/> and down the long table, serving the tea and coffee, snuffing the candles, or urging the most bashful to be helped to a little of this or that, just to please her, or to put a good taste in their mouths, she was the very personification of old-fashioned country hospitality. Every one liked Ellen, for she was one of those who always forget themselves when there is any thing to do for others.</p>
                  <p>At length, one of the young men who had had communication with the bottles I mentioned as lying cool among the ivy during the afternoon, protested that he would bring a rail to serve as a pry, unless his companions desisted from further eating of their own free will. "That is right, Bill," called out one of nature kindred in bluntness and coarseness, "here is a fellow wants choking off." "I own up to that," said another, "I have eaten about a bushel, I guess." "If I had a dollar for every mouthful you have eaten," said one, "I wouldn't thank nobody for being kin to me." "Well," answered the person alluded to, "if I have <hi rend="i"/>busted a couple of buttons off my vest, I don't think you are a fellow that will be likely to let much bread mould." "La, how you young men do run on," said Ellen, neither surprised nor offended at the coarse freedom of the jests; and amid roars of laughter the party arose, and many of the gentlemen resorted to the whiskey bottles anew, for the sake of keeping up their spirits, as they said; after which, with lighted cigars in their mouths, they "locked arms" with the ladies, and talked sentiment in the moonlight as they strolled in separate pairs, previously to assembling in the garret for the usual order of exercises upon such occasions.</p>
                  <p>Meantime the candles were mostly carried thither by certain forlorn maidens, who said they were afraid of the night air, and from the open windows rung out old hymns—"How tedious and tasteless the hours," "Come thou fount of every blessing," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hidden by shadows, and sitting with folded arms upon a topmost fence-rail, P. Joel Springer listened alone to the dirge-like sighing of the wind, and the dismal hootings of the owl.</p>
                  <p>And our good hostess, the while, could neither be prevailed upon to eat or sleep, even though her excellent spouse assured her that Helph was safe enough, and that she knew right well how often he spent the night from home in his young days, and that too when no accident had befallen him; but the dear old lady refused to be comforted—every unusual noise to her fancy was somebody bringing Helph home dead.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wetherbe had the autumn passed missed a land in the sowing of his wheat field, and that she had always heard say was a sure sign of death.</p>
                  <p>In couples, already engaged for the first play, the strollers came in at last, and what a tempest of laughter and fun there was—I cannot describe it. The entertainment which passed current then is not the fashion of these times, but I in nowise exaggerate the manners or pastimes of the time I write about. Some awkward embarrassment followed the assembling in the garret under the blaze of the many candles, but when it was whispered that Jo Allen, the most genial and good-hearted fellow of them all, had just been taken home on horseback, and that Abner Gibbs, for his better security, had ridden behind him, mirth flowed anew, and was considered to flow from a most legitimate source. Others, it was more privately rumored, had taken a drop too much, and would not be in trim to see the girls "safe home" that night.</p>
                  <p>"Come," said Ellen, as she entered the room last of all, having been detained, beyond her other duties, in kindly endeavors to induce Jo Allen to drink sweet milk as an antidote:<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5993-00000027"/> "come, why don't some of you start a play?" But all protested they didn't know a single thing, and insisted that Ellen should herself "start the play."</p>
                  <p>"Hunt the Key" was proposed, and the whole party formed into a circle, with hand joined to hand, and were directed to move rapidly round and round, during which process, a key was attached to the coat of some unsuspecting individual, who was then selected to find it, being informed that it was in the keeping of some one present. The circle then resumed its gyrations, and the search began by examining pockets and forcing apart the interlocked hands, a procedure relished with great gusto, all persons except the searcher for the key being well aware of its whereabouts.</p>

                  <p>Two chairs were placed some three feet apart, over which a quilt was carefully spread, so as seemingly to form a divan, a lady being seated on either chair, during which arrangement the gentlemen withdrew to the lower apartments, to be separately admitted again when all was prepared. A rap on the door announced an applicant for admission, who was immediately conducted by the master of ceremonies to the treacherous divan and presented to the ladies, being asked at the same time which he preferred, love or war, and no matter what he answered, requested to sit between them, they at the same time rising and precipitating their innocent admirer to the ground, a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> followed by the most boisterous applause.</p>
                  <p>"I guess," said Mehitable, "whispering in a congratulatory way to Elizabeth, "that Hetty will have to get home the best way she can, I haven't seen any body ask her for her company." But just then there was a little bustle at the door, a murmur of congratulations and regrets, over which sounded the exclamation, "just in time to see the cat die;" Mehitable raised herself on tiptoe—the doctor was come. A moment afterwards he stood beside Hetty, who was blushing and smiling—genuine smiles this time; but in answer to some whispered words she shook her head a little sadly, as it seemed, and the doctor's brow darkened with a frown. Of this Mr. P. Joel Springer was not unobservant, and coming forward, reluctantly, as he said, relinquished the pleasure he had expected. "Adieu, fair maiden," he said, "alone I take my lonely way, communing with the stars."</p>
                  <p>Hetty and the doctor were next to go, and then came a general breaking up. Horses were saddled, and sleepy colts<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5993-00000028"/> left the warm dimples in the grass and followed slowly the gallants walking beside the ladies as they rode. Some there were, too, walking across the fields, and others through the dusty highway, all mated as pleased them, except Mehitable and Elizabeth, who both rode one horse, comforting each other with the assurance that young men were very great fools.</p>
                  <p>And so we take our leave of them, as in separate pairs they wend homeward, each gentleman with the slippers of his ladylove in his pocket, and her mammoth comb in his hat.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <p>IN our last chapter we gave some account of Mrs. Weatherbe's quilting, and of the sorrow and disappointment of the good lady on the occasion; and we now propose to return to Helph, and give you some particulars of the night as it passed with him. It was near noon when he drew rein before the house of his father, with a heart full of happy anticipations for the afternoon and evening; but his bright dream was destined quickly to darken away to the soberest reality of his life. His father met him in the hall with a face flushed, and taking his hand with some pretence of cordiality, said in an irritable tone, and as though he had not the slightest idea of his errand—"Why, my son Helph, what in the devil's name has brought you?"</p>
                  <p>He then made a doleful narrative of the discomforts and privations he had endured during the few days of Mrs. Randall's absence, for whom he either felt or affected to feel the greatest love and admiration whenever she was separated from him; though his manner, with the exception of these spasmodic affections, was neglectful and harsh towards her in the extreme.</p>
                  <p>"What in the devil's name is a man to do, my son Helph?" he said; "your poor father hasn't had a meal's victuals fit for a dog to eat, since your mother went into the country: how is she? poor woman. I think I'll just get into your buggy, boy, and run out and bring your mother home; things will all go to ruin in two days more—old black Kitty aint worth a cuss, and Jenny aint worth another."</p>
                  <p>And this last hit he seemed to regard as most incidentally happy in its bearing upon Helph, whose opinions of Jenny by no means coincided with his own; and this coarse allusion to her, so far from warping his judgment against her, made him for the time oblivious to every thing else, and he hastened in search of her.</p>
                  <p>"Lord, honey, I is glad to see you," exclaimed Aunt Kitty, looking up from her work in the kitchen, for she was kneading bread with the tray in her lap, in consequence of rheumatic pains, which disabled her from standing much on her feet.</p>
                  <p>"What in the world is the matter?" asked Helph, anxiously, as he saw her disability.</p>
                  <p>"Noffin much," she said, smiling; "my feet are like to bust wid de inflammatious rheumatis—dat's all. But I's a poor sinful critter," she continued, "and de flesh pulls mighty hard on de sperit, sometimes, when I ought to be thinkin' ob de mornin' ober Jordan."</p>
                  <p>And having assured him that she would move her old bones as fast as she could, and prepare the dinner, she directed him where to find Jenny, saying, "Go 'long wid you, and you'll find her a seamsterin' up stairs, and never mind de 'stress of an old darkie like me."</p>
                  <p>As he obeyed, he heard her calling on the Lord to bless him, for that he was the best young master of them all. Poor kind-hearted creature—she did not ask any blessing for herself!</p>
                  <p>In one end of the long low garret, unplastered and comfortless<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5993-00000029"/> less from the heat in summer and the cold in winter, there was a cot bed, an old dilapidated trunk, a broken work-stand, a small cracked looking-glass, and a strip of faded carpet, denominated, by courtesy, Jenny's room; and here, seated on a chair without any back, sat the poor girl, stitching shirts for her adopted brothers, when he, who from some cause or other never called her sister, appeared suddenly before her. Smiling, she ran forward to meet him, but suddenly checking herself, she blushed deeply, and the exclamation, "Dear Helph," that rose to her lips, was subdued and formalized to simple Helphenstein. The cheek that was smooth when she saw him last, was darkened into manhood now, and the arm remained passive that had always thrown itself lovingly about his neck; but in the new timidity, she appeared only the more beautiful in the eyes of her admirer; and if she declined the old expressions of fondness, he did not.</p>
                  <p>The first feeling of pleasure and surprise quickly subsided on her part into one of pain and embarrassment, when she remembered her torn and faded dress, and the disappointment that awaited him.</p>
                  <p>"Come, Jenny," said Helph, when the first greeting was over, "I have come for you; go, get ready as soon as possible."</p>
                  <p>Poor child, she turned away her face to hide the tears that would come, as she answered, "I cannot go—I have nothing to get ready."</p>
                  <p>And then came inquiries about the new dress of which he had been informed, and though for a time the girl hesitated, he drew from her at last the confession, that it had been appropriated by his mother, under the promise of procuring for her another when she should have made a dozen shirts to earn it. An exclamation that evinced little filial reverence found expression—then as he soothed and sympathized, the boyish affection was deepened more and more by pity.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, Jenny," said Helph, in tones of simple and truthful earnestness, "wear any thing to-day, but go—for my sake go; I like you just as well in an old dress as in a new one."</p>
                  <p>Jenny had been little used to kindness, and from her lonely and sad heart the gratitude flowed in hot thick-coming tears.</p>
                  <p>Certainly she would like of all things to go to the quilting, and the more, perhaps, that Helph was come for her; but in no time of her life her poverty seemed so painful a thing. During the past week she had examined her scanty wardrobe repeatedly—her shoes, too, were down at the heel and out at the toe—to go decently was quite impossible, and yet she could not suppress the desire, nor refrain from thinking over and over, if this dress was not quite so much faded, or if that were not so short and outgrown, and then if she had money to buy a pair of shoes, and could borrow a neck-ribbon and collar—in short, if things were a little better than they were, she might go, and perhaps, in the night, deficiencies would be less noticeable.</p>
                  <p>But between all her thinking and planning lay the forbidding <hi rend="i"/>if; and in answer to the young man's entreaties, she could only cry and shake her head negatively.</p>
                  <p>She half wished he would go away, and yet feared at the same time he would go; she avoided looking at the old rundown slippers she wore, as well as the patched gown, in the vain delusion that he would thus be prevented from seeing them; and so, half sorry and half glad, half ashamed and half honestly indignant, she sat—the work fallen into her lap, and the tears now and then dropping, despite of the frequent winking and vain efforts to smile.</p>
                  <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5993-00000030"/>
                  <p>At length Helph remembered that his horse had not been cared for; and looking down from the little window, he found, to his further annoyance, that both horse and buggy were gone, and his return home indefinitely delayed.</p>
                  <p>"I wish to Heaven," he said, indignantly turning towards Jenny, "you and I had a home somewhere beyond the reach of the impositions practised upon us by Mr. and Mrs. Randall!"</p>
                  <p>The last words were bitter and sarcastic, and thus in anger and sorrow began the love-making of Helph and Jenny.</p>
                  <milestone n="* * * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Down the thinly-wooded hills to the west of the great city, reached the long shadows of the sunset. The streets were crowded with mechanics hurrying homeward—in one hand the little tin pail in which the dinner had been carried, and in the other a toy for the baby, perhaps, or a pound of soap or of meat for the good wife.</p>
                  <p>The smoke curled upward from the chimneys of the suburban districts, and little rustic girls and boys were seen in all directions, hurrying homeward with their arms full of shavings—old women, too, with their bags of rags, betook themselves somewhere—Heaven only knows whether they had any homes, or where they went—at any rate, with backs bent under their awful burdens, they turned into lanes and alleys, and disappeared. The tired dray-horses walked faster and nimbler as they smelled the oats in the manger; and here and there, in the less frequented streets, bands of schoolboys and girls drove their hoops, or linked their arms and skipped laughingly up and down the pavement; while now and then a pair of older children strolled in happiness, for that they dreamed of happier times to come. The reflection of the beautiful things in the future made the present bright, and well it is that it is so, for the splendor fades from our approach, and it is only in dreams that we find ourselves shadowed by the glory.</p>
                  <p>We have need to thank Thee, O our Father, that Thou hast given us the power of seeing visions and dreaming dreams! Earth, with all the glory of its grass and all the splendor of its flowers, were dreary and barren and desolate, but for that divine insanity which shapes deformity into grace, and darkness into light. How the low roof is lifted up on the airy pillars of thought, and the close dark walls expanded and made beautiful with the pictures of the imagination! And best of all, by this blessed power the cheeks that are flattened, and the foreheads that are wrinkled by time, retain in our eyes the smoothness and the sheen of primal years; to us they cannot grow old, for we see <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>Poured upon the locks of age,</l>
                           <l>The beauty of immortal youth.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> Life's sharp realities press us sore, sometimes, and but for the unsubstantial beams upon which we build some new hope, we should often rush headlong to the dark.</p>
                  <p>They were sitting together, Helph and Jenny, with the twilight deepening around them, speaking little, thinking much, and gazing down the long vistas opening to the sunshine, and brighter than the western clouds. Ah me, they did not think of the night that was falling, they did not hear the wind soughing among the hot walls and roofs, and prophesying storm.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly appeared before them a miserably clad little boy, the one mentioned in a previous chapter as coming for money, and now, after a moment's hesitancy, on seeing a stranger, he laid his head in the lap of Jenny, and cried aloud.</p>
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5993-00000031"/>
                  <p>Stooping over him, she smoothed back his hair and kissed his forehead; and in choked and broken utterances he made known his mournful errand: little Willie was very sick, and Jenny was wanted at home.</p>
                  <p>Few preparations were required. Helph would not hear of her going alone; and in the new and terrific fear, all her pride vanished, and she did not remonstrate, though she knew all the wretchedness of poverty that would be bared before him. Close folding the hand of her little brother in hers, and with tears dimming her eyes, she silently led the way.</p>
                  <p>It was night, and the lights of a hundred windows shone down upon them, when, turning to her young protector, she said, in a voice trembling with both shame and sorrow, perhaps, "This is the place." The house was a tolerably new one, built of brick very roughly, but substantially, fronting about a hundred feet on an alley, and five stories in height.</p>
                  <p>It was situated in the meanest suburb of the city, on an unpaved street, and opposite a ruinous graveyard, and had been erected on the cheapest possible plan, and with special reference to the poorest class of the community. Scarcely had the wealthy proprietor an opportunity of posting bills announcing rooms to let, so soon were they taken; and with its miserable accommodations and crowded with people who were almost paupers, it was a perfect hive of misery. Porch above porch opened out on the alley, and served as door-yards to the different apartments—places for the drying of miserable rags—play-grounds for the children—and a look-out for the decrepit old women on sunny afternoons.</p>
                  <p>Dish-water, washing suds and all, from the tea and coffee grounds to all manner of picked bones and other refuse, were dashed down from these tiers of porches to the ground below, so that a more filthy and in all ways unendurable place can scarcely be imagined than was presented in the vicinity of this money-making device, or house of terrible refuge.</p>
                  <p>Leaning against the balusters, and smoking and talking, or quarrelling and swearing, were groups of men who might be counted by tens and twenties; and the feeble querulous tones of woman, now and then, sounded among the others. A little apart from one of these groups of ignorant disputants, sat an old crone, combing her gray hair by the light of a tallow candle; others were ironing and washing dishes; while others, again, lolled listlessly and gracelessly about, listening to, and sometimes taking part in, the conversation.</p>
                  <p>Children, half naked, were playing among the pools of stagnant water, and now and then pelting each other with the heads of fishes and the slimy bones caught up at random; and one group, more vicious than the rest, were diverting themselves by throwing stones at an old cat that lay half in and half out of a puddle, responding by feeble kicks as the rough missiles struck against her.</p>
                  <p>Depravity, as well as poverty, had joined itself to that miserable congregation. Smoke issued thick from some of the chimneys, full of the odors of mutton and coffee, and as they mixed with the vile stenches that thickened the atmosphere near the ground, Helph, who had been accustomed to the free air of the country; fresh with the scents of hay-fields and orchards, found it hard to suppress the exclamation of disgust and loathing that rose to his lips as they turned to the alley and his senses apprehended in a twinkling what I have been so long in describing.</p>
                  <p>Up the steep narrow wooden stairs, flight after flight they passed, catching through the open doors of the different apartments as they did so, glimpses of the same squalid character—greasy smoking stoves, dirty beds. ragged women and children<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5993-00000032"/> dren, with here and there dozing dogs, or men prostrate on the bare floors, either from weariness or drunkenness, and meagerly-spread tables, and cradles, and creeping and crying and sleeping babies, all in close proximity.</p>
                  <p>On the third landing they turned into a side door, and such a picture presented itself as the young man had never seen before: the windows were open, but the atmosphere was close, and smelled of herbs and medicines. A single candle was alight, and though the shapes of things were not distinctly brought out, enough was visible to indicate the wretchedness and poverty of the family.</p>
                  <p>It was very still in the room, for the children, with instinctive fear, were huddled together in the darkest corner, and spoke in whispers when they spoke at all; and the mother, patient and pale and wan, sat silent by the bed, holding in hers the chubby sun-burned hands of her dying little boy.</p>
                  <p>"Oh mother," said Jenny, treading softly and speaking low. Tears filled the mild blue eyes, and the lip trembled as it answered, "It is almost over—he does not know me any more."</p>
                  <p>And forgetting, in the blind fondness of the mother, the darkness and the sorrow and the pain, and worst of all, the contagion of evil example, from which he was about to be free, she buried her face in her hands, and shook with convulsive agony. All the deprivation and weariness and struggle that had sometimes seemed to her so hard, were in this new sorrow as nothing; with her baby laughing in her arms, as he had been last week, she would be strong to front the most miserable fate.</p>
                  <p>Tie after tie may be unbound from the heart, as the steps climb the rough steep that goes up to power, for the sweet household affections unwind themselves more and more as the distance widens between aspiration and contentment, and over the tide that sweeps into full glory there is no crossing back. The brow that has felt the shadow of the laurel, will not be comforted by the familiar kisses of love. And up to the heights of fame, the rumble of the clods against the coffin of some mate of long ago, go softened of the awfullest terror; but where the heart, unwarped from its natural yearnings, presses close, till its throbbings bring up echoes from the stony bottom of the grave, and when from the heaped mound reaches a shadow that darkens the world for the humble eyes that may never look up any more—these keep the bleeding affections, these stay the mourning that the great cannot understand. Where the wave is narrow, the dropping of even a pebble of hope sends up the swelling circles till the whole bosom of the stream is agitated; but in the broader sea they lessen and lessen till they lose themselves in a border of light. And over that little life, moaning itself away in the dim obscurity of its birth-chamber, fell bitterer tears, and bowed hearts aching with sharper pains than they may ever know, whose joys are not alike as simple and as few. "Oh Willie, dear little Willie," sobbed Jenny, folding her arms about him and kissing him over and over, "speak to me once, only once more." Her tears fell hot upon his whitening face, but he did not lift his heavily-drooping eyes, nor turn towards her on the pillow. The children fell asleep, one upon another, where they sat. In the presence of the strong healthy man they were less afraid, and nestling close together, gradually forgot that little Willie was not amongst them—and so came the good gift which God giveth his beloved.</p>
                  <p>In some chink of the wall the cricket chirped, the same quick short sound, over and over to itself, and about the candle circled and fluttered the gray-winged moths, heedless of<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5993-00000033"/> their perished fellows; on the table stood a painted bucket half filled with tepid water, and beside it a brown jug and broken glass.</p>
                  <p>Now and then the mother and daughter exchanged anxious looks, as some footstep sounded on the stairs, but when it turned aside to some one of the adjoining chambers, they resumed their watching, speaking not their hopes or fears, if either had been awakened.</p>
                  <p>From the white dome of St. Peter's sounded the silvery chime of the midnight: the sick child had fallen asleep an hour before, but now his eyes opened full upon his mother, and his white lips worked faintly. "Jenny," she said, in a tone of low but fearful distinctness—for with her head on the bedside she was fast dozing into forgetfulness—"he is going—going home." "Home," he repeated, sweetly, and that was the last word he ever said. The young man came forward hastily—the soft light of a setting star drifted across the pillow, and in its pale splendor he laid the hands together, and smoothed the death-dampened curls.</p>

                  <p>"OH, my children!" cried Mrs. Mitchel, bending over the huddled sleepers, and calling them one by one to awake—"your poor little brother is dead—he will never play with you any more."</p>
                  <p>"Let them sleep," said Jenny, whose grief was less passionate, "they cannot do him any good now, and the time will come soon enough that they cannot sleep.'</p>
                  <p>I know it, oh, I know it!" she sobbed, "but this silence seems so terrible; I want them to wake and speak to me, and yet," she added, after a moment, "I know not what I want. I only know that my little darling will not wake in the morning—oh," she continued, "he was the loveliest and the best of all-he never cried when he was hurt, like other children, nor gave me trouble in any way;" and then she recounted (feeding her sorrow with the memory) all his endearing little ways, from the first conscious smiling to the last word he had spoken; numbered over the slips he had worn and the color of them, saying how pretty he had thought the blue one was, and how proud he had been of the pink one with the ruffled sleeves, and how often she had lifted him up to the broken looking-glass to see the baby, as he called himself, for that he always wanted to see the curls she made for him.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes she had crossed him, she wished now she had never done so, and sometimes she had neglected him when she had thought herself too busy to attend to his little wants; now that all was irreparable, she blamed herself harshly, and thought how much better she might have done.</p>
                  <p>The first day of his sickness she had scolded him for being fretful, and put him roughly aside when he clung about her knees, and hindered the work upon which the bread depended; she might have known that he was ailing, she said, for that he was always good when well, and so have neglected every thing else for him; if she had done so in time, if she had tried this medicine or that, if she had kept his head bathed one night when she chanced to fall asleep, and waked with his calling her "mother," and saying the fire was burning him; in short, if she had done any thing she had not done, it might have been better, her darling Willie might have got well.</p>
                  <p>"The dear baby," she said, taking his cold, stiffening feet<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5993-00000034"/> in her hand, "he never had any shoes, and I promised so often to get them."</p>
                  <p>"They are warm enough now," interposed Jenny.</p>
                  <p>"I know it, I know it," she answered, and yet she could not subdue the grief that her boy was dead, and had never had the shoes that he thought it would be so fine to have.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, mother, do not cry so," Jenny said; "I will come home and we will love each other better, we who are left, and work together and try to live till God takes us where he has taken the baby, home, home," she said; but in repeating his dying utterance, her accent faltered, and hiding her face in the lap of her mother, she gave way to the agony that till then she had kept down.</p>
                  <p>But, alas, it was not even their poor privilege to weep uninterrupted, and shuddering they grew still, when slowly and heavily climbing the narrow and dark stairs, sounded the well-known step of the inebriate husband and father. A minute the numb and clumsy hand fumbled about the door-latch, and then with a hickup and a half articulate oath, the man, if man he might be called, staggered and stumbled into the room.</p>
                  <p>His thick, maudlin brain apprehended but imperfectly, and seeing his wife, he supposed her to be waiting for him, as he had found her a thousand times before; and mixing something of old fondness with the coarse and disgusting familiarity of a drunkard, he put his arm about her neck, saying, "What the hell are you waiting for me for, Nancy, when you know them fellers won't never let me come home. Daughter," he continued, addressing Jenny, "just hand me that jug, that's a good girl, I feel faint like," and putting his hand to his temple, where the blood was oozing from a recent cut, he finished his speech with an oath.</p>
                  <p>"Hush, father, hush," said the girl, pointing to the bed; but probably supposing she meant to indicate it as a resting-place for him, he stumbled towards and half fell upon it, one arm thrown across the dead child, and the blood dripping from his bruised and distorted face, muttering curses and threatening vengeance on the comrades who, he said, deprecatingly, made him drink when he told them he wanted to go home, G—d d—n them.</p>
                  <p>In muttering imprecations and excuses he fell into dreadful unconsciousness. Not knowing whom else to call, Helphenstein summoned Aunt Kitty, and with the aid of his arm and a crutch, but more than all, leaning on her own zeal to do good, she came, and in her kindly, but rude fashion, comforted the heavy mourners, partly by pictures of the glory "ober Jordan," and partly by narratives of the terriblest sufferings she had known, as taking the child on her knees she dressed it for the grave, decently as might be.</p>
                  <p>"She had lost a baby too," she said, "and when her breasts were aching with the milk, she felt as if she wanted to be gwine to it wharever it were, for that she couldn't <hi rend="i"/>resist without it no ways, but she did, and arter a while she got over it. Another son," she said, "was sparred to grow up and do a heap of hard work; he was away from her a piece down the river, and kep a liberty stable, and at last, when he had saved a'most money enough, a vile-tempered critter kicked out his brains, and dat ar was his last. And so," said Aunt Kitty, "it was wust for de one dat growed up, arter all."</p>
                  <p>The stars grew motionless among the clouds, and blank and weary the night went by; gray began to dilute the heavy darkness, and adown the gaps of the thick woods away over the eastern hills, the chilly river of morning light came pouring in.</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5993-00000035"/>
                  <p>The funeral was over, and it was almost night when Mr. Randall returned from the country, having availed himself more largely of the horse and buggy than he at first intended, by taking several widely separate points, where errands called him, in his route. Mrs. Randall came too, and with her the great basket, but not empty, as she had taken it.</p>
                  <p>The poor animal had been driven mercilessly, and gladly turned to his young master and rubbed his face against his caressing hand, dripping with sweat, and breathing hard the while.</p>
                  <p>It was no very cordial greeting which the son gave the parents, and they in turn were little pleased with him, for any special liking is not to be concealed even from the commonest apprehension, and the attachment of Helph and Jenny had lately become a felt fact.</p>
                  <p>"What in the devil's name are we to do with that girl, mother, she don't earn her salt," said Mr. Randall.</p>
                  <p>Their first inquiries on entering the house had been for Jenny, and Helph, with provoking purpose, had simply said she was not at home. Words followed words sharper and faster, until Mr. Randall, with an affirmation that I will not repeat, said he would suffer his house to be her home no longer; if she could not be trusted with the house for a day, she was not worthy to have any better place than the pig-sty in which her parents lived.</p>
                  <p>"I always told you," interposed the wife, "that girl was a mean, low-lived thing; and it was none of my doings, the taking her from the washing-tub, where she belongs, and making her as good as any of us. I tell you them kind of Colks must be kept down, and I always told you so."</p>
                  <p>"You always told me great things," said the husband, coloring oring with rage; "what in the devil's name is there you don't know, I wonder."</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," she answered, speaking very low and calmly—"there is one thing I didn't know till it was too late."</p>
                  <p>With all his blustering, Mr. Randall was a coward and craven at heart, and turning to the sideboard he imbibed a deeper draught of brandy than usual, diverting his indignation to Jenny, whom he called a poor creep-louse, that had infested his house long enough.</p>
                  <p>"If you were not my father," answered Helph, who had inherited a temper capable of being ungovernably aroused, "I'd beat you with as good a will as I ever beat iron to a horseshoe."</p>
                  <p>"What in the devil's name is the girl to you, I'd like to know," Mr. Randall said.</p>
                  <p>"Before you are a month older you will find out what she is to me," replied the youth, drawing himself up to his full height, and passing his hand across his beard proudly.</p>
                  <p>"My son, your father has a great deal to irritate him, and he is hasty sometimes, but let by-gones be by-gones; but what business had the girl away?"</p>
                  <p>And with a trembling hand Mr. Randall presented a glass of brandy as a kind of peace-offering to his son. But for the first time in his life the young man refused; he had seen its brutalizing effects the night past, saw it then, and had determined to be warned in time. But in answer to the allusion to Jenny, he related briefly and simply the melancholy event which had called and still detained her from home.</p>
                  <p>"A good thing," said Mr. Randall, "one brat less to be taken care of, but that's no reason the girl should stay away;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5993-00000036"/> if the young one is dead, she can't bring it to life, nor dig a hole to put it in, either."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Randall, having adjusted her lace cap, and ordered Aunt Kitty to keep the basket out of the reach of the big boys, and to remember and not eat all there was in it herself, ascended the stairs to ascertain how Jenny had progressed with her shirt making.</p>
                  <p>Such family altercations as we have recorded may be thought exceedingly rare—I sincerely hope they are, but I have not exaggerated the truth in reference to the people I write of.</p>
                  <p>Ignorant, passionate, vulgar—nothing redeemed them from the lowest grade of society but money, and a tremendous influence it was in their favor.</p>
                  <p>In all public meetings, especially those having any reference to the poor, Mr. Randall was a prominent personage. Upon more occasions than one he had set down large figures for charitable purposes; in short, his position was that of an eminent and honorable citizen, when, in fact, a man guilty of more little meanness and niggardliness, a man in all ways so debased, might scarcely anywhere be found. The drunkard whom he affected to despise, had often a less depraved appetite than he, for though he did not reel and stagger and lie in the gutter, it was only habitual indulgence in strong drinks which rendered him impervious to their more debilitating effects. He lay on the sofa at home, and swore and grumbled and hickuped, and drank, and drank, and drank. His children did not respect him, and how should they, when the whole course of his conduct was calculated to inspire disgust and abhorrence in every heart naturally endowed with any notions of right. The two bullying, beardless sons, who had grown up under his immediate influence, were precociously depraved, and possessed scarcely a redeeming quality, and the younger ones were treading close in their footsteps. Helph; however, possessed some of the ennobling attributes of manhood. Blunt and plain and rustic he was, to be sure, but he was frank and honest and sincere; industrious, sober, and affectionate, alike averse to the exactions and impositions of his mother, and the niggardly withholdings of his father.</p>
                  <p>He was neither ashamed of the toil-hardened hands that earned his daily bread, nor proud for that his mother's earrings dangled to her shoulders, and that her dress was gay and expensive, or that his father was president of a bank, and lived in a fine house.</p>
                  <p>Independent and straightforward, and for the most part saving enough—indeed he might give himself some pains to find a lost shilling, yet where he saw real need he would give it with as much pleasure as he found it.</p>
                  <p>Towards evening Jenny returned home, pale and sad and suffering, but there were no little kindnesses, no softness of word or manner towards her—she was required at once to resume work, and admonished to retrieve lost time, for that crying would only make herself sick, and do no good. Helph, however, subdued his bluff kindness into tenderness never manifested towards her before, and an occasional smile through tears was an over payment.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Randall and lady began to be seriously alarmed, lest a hasty marriage should bring upon them irretrievable disgrace. A long consultation was held in which it was resolved to postpone, by pretended acquiescence, any clandestine movement, until time could be gained to frustrate hopelessly the design evidently meditated by the son.</p>
                  <p>We have been talking of our own love, said they, how hard we should have thought it to be parted, and seeing that you<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5993-00000037"/> really are attached to each other, we oppose no obstacle; a little delay is all we ask: Jenny shall go to school for a year, they said, and you, Helph, will have more experience, and more means, perhaps, at your command.</p>
                  <p>Much more they said in this conciliatory way, and the ruse was successful; and that night, instead of stealing away together as they had proposed, Helph slept soundly in his country home, and Jenny dreamed bright dreams of the coming years.</p>
                  <p>Deep midnight overspread the city; the clouds hung low and gloomy, and the atmosphere was close and oppressive, when stealthily threading through by-ways and alleys, now stopping and looking noiselessly backward and forward, and then with trembling and unsteady steps sliding forward, a man past the prime of life, miserably clad, might have been seen. He wore no hat, his gray hair was matted together, and over one eye there was a purple and ghastly cut from which he seemed to have torn the bandage, for in one hand he held a cloth spotted with blood.</p>
                  <p>He apparently thought himself pursued by some enemy from whom he was endeavoring to escape, and now and then huddled in some dark nook whence his eyes, bright with insanity, peered vigilantly about. So, by fits and starts, he made his way to the old graveyard mentioned in the previous chapter. The trees stood still together, for there was scarcely a breath of air, and noiselessly moving among the monuments and crosses and low headstones, the man went, pausing not till he came to a little, new grave; the mound smooth-heaped and fresh.</p>
                  <p>"Here," he said, squatting on the ground and digging madly into the earth with his hands, "here, by h—ll, is the very place they put him, d—n them! but his mother shall have him back, I ain't so drunk that I can't dig him up," and pausing to listen now and then he soon flattened the mound.</p>
                  <p>"In God's name, what are you doing," exclaimed an authoritative voice, and a club was struck forcibly against the board fence hard by. Howling an impious imprecation in the name of the Redeemer, the frightened wretch rushed blindly headlong across the graves, leaped the fence like a tiger, and disappeared in the hollow beyond. An hour afterwards he had gained the valley which lies a mile or two to the northwest of the city, and along which a creek, sometimes slow and sluggish, and sometimes deep and turbulent, drags or hurries itself towards the brighter waters of the Ohio.</p>
                  <p>The white-trunked sycamores leaned towards each other across the stream, the broad faded leaves dropping slowly slantwise to the ground, as the wind slipped damp and silent from bough to bough. Here and there the surface of the water was darkened by rifts of foliage that, lodged among brushwood, gave shelter to the checky blacksnake and the white-bellied toad. Huge logs that had drifted together in the spring freshet, lay black and rotting in the current, with the toadstools springing rank from their decay.</p>
                  <p>Towards the deepest water the wretched inebriate seemed irresistibly drawn, and holding with one hand to a sapling that grew in the bank, he leaned far out and tried the depth with a slender pole. He then retreated, and seemed struggling as with a fierce temptation, drew near again and with his foot broke off shelving weights of earth and watched their plashing and sinking—a moment he lifted his eyes to heaven—there was a heavier plunge, and the man was gone from the bank. A wild cry rose piercing through the darkness; the crimson top of a clump of iron weeds that grew low in the bank was drawn suddenly under the water as if the hand reached for<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5993-00000038"/> help—then the cry and the plashing was still, and the waves closed together. A week afterwards the swollen corpse of Jenny's father was drawn from the stream.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <p>ALL the boyish habits of Helph were at once thrown aside, and much Aunt Wetherbe marvelled when she saw him a day or two after his return from the city, bring forth from the cellar a little sled on which all previous winters he had been accustomed (out of the view of the highway, it is true), to ride down hill.</p>
                  <p>"What on airth now?" she said, placing her hands on either hip, and eyeing him in sorrowful amazement. A great deal of pains had been lavished on the making of the sled, the runners were shod with iron, and it was nicely painted; indeed Helph had considered it quite an article of bijoutry, and now as he dragged it forth to light, dusted it with his handkerchief and brushed the spider-webs from among its slender beams, he found it hard to suppress the old admiration for his beautiful handiwork. Nevertheless, when he found himself observed, he gave it a rough toss which lodged it broken and ruined among some rubbish, and drawing his hat over his eyes to conceal from them the wreck, he strode away without at all noticing his aunt, who immediately went in search of her good man, who (in her estimation at least) knew almost every thing, to ask an explanation of the boy's unaccountable conduct.</p>
                  <p>But the strange freaks of the young man were not yet at an end, and on returning to the house he took from a nail beneath the looking-glass a string of speckled birds'-eggs and the long silvery skin of a snake, where they had long hung, the admiration of all visitors, and threw them carelessly into the fire, thereby sending a sharp pang through the heart of Aunt Wetherbe, if not through his own. He next took from the joist a bundle of arrows and darts, the latter cut in fanciful shapes, and which he had made at various times to amuse his leisure, and crushed them together in a box of kindlings, saying in answer to the remonstrance of his relative, that was all they were good for.</p>
                  <p>From the pockets of coats and trowsers he was observed at various times to make sundry ejectments, such as the election tickets of former years, variously colored, yellow, blue, and pink, together with bits of twine, brass-headed nails, &amp;c. But when he brought from an out-house a squirrel's cage, where many a captive had been civilized into tricks never dreamed of in its wild swingings from bough to bough, Aunt Wetherbe took it from his hands just as she had done when he was a wayward boy, exclaiming with real displeasure, "Lord-a-mercy, child, has the old boy himself got into you!" But Helph soon proved that he was not possessed of the evil one, by the manliness with which he talked of the coming election, discussing shrewdly the merits of the several candidates. All the apparatus pertaining to shaving operations were shortly procured, and Helph was observed to spend much of his time in their examination and careful preparation, though no special necessity for their use was observable, and hitherto the old razor of his uncle had only now and then been brought into requisition.</p>
                  <p>When the first flush of exuberant manhood had subsided, a thoughtful and almost sorrowful feeling pervaded the dreams of the young man; he kept much alone, knit his brows, and answered vaguely when questioned. At last he abruptly announced<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5993-00000039"/> nounced his intention of beginning the world for himself. He would sell his horse and the various farming implements he possessed, together with the two young oxen that he had played with and petted, and taught to plough and draw the cart, and with the means thus acquired he would procure a small shop in the vicinity of the great city, and resume his blacksmithing.</p>
                  <p>"Tut, tut," said the aunt, "I'd rather you would steal away from the splitting of oven-wood and the churning of a morning, just as you used to do, to set quail traps and shoot at a mark, than to be talking in this way. Your uncle and me can't get along without you: no, no, my child, you mustn't think of going."</p>
                  <p>Helph brushed his hand across his eyes and appealed to the authority which had always been absolute; and removing his spectacles the good old man rubbed them carefully through the corner of his handkerchief as he said, sadly but decidedly, "Yes, my son, you have made a wise resolve—you are almost a man now (here the youth's face colored), and it's time you were beginning to work for yourself and be a man amongst men;" and approaching an old-fashioned walnut desk in which all manner of yellow, musty receipts and letters from relatives were kept, he unlocked it slowly, and pouring from a stout linen bag a quantity of silver, counted the dollars to the amount of a hundred, and placing them in the hand of the young man, he said, "a little present to help you on in the world—make good use of it, my boy, but above all things, continue in the honest, straight path in which you have always kept, and my word for it, prosperity will come to you, even though you have but a small beginning. I have lived to be an old man," he continued, "and I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread."</p>
                  <p>Boyishly Helph began drawing figures rapidly on the table with his finger, for he felt the tears coming, but it would not do, and looking rather than speaking his thanks, he hurried from the house, and for an hour chopped vigorously at the wood-pile.</p>
                  <p>It was soon concluded to hurry the preparations of his departure, so that he might get fairly settled before the coming on of cold weather, and a list of goods and chattels to be sold at public vendue on a specified day, was made out, and bills posted on the schoolhouse, at the cross-roads, and in the barroom of the tavern, stating the time and place of sale. Ellen Blake was sent for in haste to come right away and make up half a dozen shirts, and the provident old lady briskly plied the knitting-needles, that her nephew might lack for nothing. All talked gayly of the new project, but the gayety was assumed, and Ellen herself, with all her powers of making sombre things take cheerful aspects, felt that she succeeded illy.</p>
                  <p>Now that he was about to part with them, the gay young horse that had eaten so often from his hand, and the two gentle steers that had bowed their necks beneath the heavy yoke at his bidding, seemed to the young master almost humanly endeared, and he fed and caressed them morning and evening with unusual solicitude, tossing them oat sheaves and emptying measures of corn very liberally.</p>
                  <p>"Any calves, or beef cattle to sell," called a coarse, loud voice to Helph, as he lingered near the stall of his oxen the evening preceding the day of sale.</p>
                  <p>"No," answered the young man, seeing that it was a butcher who asked the question.</p>
                  <p>"I saw an advertisement of oxen to be sold here to-morrow," said the man, striking his spurred heel against his horse, and reining him in with a jerk.</p>
                  <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5993-00000040"/>
                  <p>"I prefer selling to a farmer," said Helph, as he leaned against the broad shoulders of one of the steers, and took in his hand its horn of greenish silver.</p>
                  <p>"My money is as good as any man's," said the butcher, and throwing himself from the saddle he approached the stall, and after walking once or twice around the unconsciously doomed animals, and having pinched their hides with his fingers, he offered for them a larger sum than Helph expected; he however shut his eyes to the selfish advantage, saying he hoped to sell them to some neighbor who would keep and be kind to them.</p>
                  <p>A scornful laugh answered in part as the butcher turned away, saying he was going further into the country, and would call on his return—they might not be sold.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, Helph had not advised with Jenny relative to the new movement he was about making, and when all arrangements were made, and it was quite too late to retract, he resolved to ask her advice; and I suspect in this conduct he was not acting without a precedent.</p>
                  <p>From amongst a bunch of quills that had remained in the old desk from time immemorial, he selected one with great care, and having rubbed his pocket-knife across the toe of his boot for an hour or more, there began a search for ink, of which his uncle told him there was a good bottle full on the upper shelf of the cupboard. But said bottle was not to be found, and after a good deal of rummaging and some questioning of Aunt Wetherbe, it was finally ascertained that the ink alluded to must have been bought ten or twelve years previously, and that only some dry grounds remained of it now in the bottom of a broken inkstand: to this a little vinegar was added, and having shaken it thoroughly, the young man concluded it would do. More than once during all this preparation paration, he had been asked what he was going to do, for writing was not done in the family except on eventful occasions, but the question elicited no answer more direct than "nothing much," and so at last with a sheet of foolscap, ink, and quill, he retired to his own room—Aunt Wetherbe having first stuck a pin in the candle, indicating the portion he was privileged to burn.</p>
                  <p>Whether more or less candle were consumed, I am not advised, but that a letter was written, I have good authority for believing. Murder will out, there is no doubt about that, and the day following the writing Aunt Wetherbe chanced to have occasion to untie a bundle of herbs that in a pillow-case had been suspended from the ceiling of Helph's room for a long time, and what should she find but a letter addressed to Jenny Mitchel, fantastically folded and sealed with four red wafers, where it had evidently been placed to await a secret opportunity of conveyance to the post-office. Long was the whispered conference between the old lady and Ellen that followed this discovery; very indignant was the aunt at first, for old people are too apt to regard love and marriage in the young as highly improper, but Ellen, whose regard for matrimony was certainly more lenient, exerted her liveliest influence in behalf of the young people, nor were her efforts unsuccessful, and unobtrusive silence was resolved upon.</p>
                  <p>During this little excitement in doors, there was much noise and bustle without; Helph's young horse was gayly caparisoned, and bearing proudly various riders up and down the space where, among ploughs, harrows, scythes, &amp;c., a number of farmers were gathered, discussing politics, smoking, and shrewdly calculating how much they could afford to bid for this article or that. Yoked together, and chewing their cuds very contentedly, stood the young, plump oxen of which I have<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5993-00000041"/> spoken, but no one admired them with the design of purchasing.</p>
                  <p>The vendue was soon over, and all sold readily and well but the oxen. The sleek bay was gone, proudly arching his neck to the hand of a new master, and the farmers brought their teams to carry home whatever they had purchased, and Helph half sighed as one after another put into his hand the money for which he had sold them.</p>
                  <p>As he lingered at the stile he saw approaching a large flock of sheep; closely huddled they were, and the red chalk marks on their sides indicated their destiny; close behind came a mingled group of cows, calves, and oxen; all driven by the butcher mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>"Well, neighbor," he said, thrusting his hand in his pocket and drawing thence a greasy leathern pouch, "I see you have kept the bullocks for me."</p>
                  <p>At first Helph positively declined selling them, but he didn't want them; it was very uncertain when an opportunity of disposing of them as he wished, would recur, and when the butcher added something to his first liberal offer, he replied, "I suppose, sir, you will have to take them;" and riding into the yard, he drove them roughly forth with whip and voice from the manger of hay and the deep bed of straw. Free from the yoke they were, and yet they came side by side and with their heads bowed close together just as they had been accustomed to work. Passing their young master, they turned towards him their great mournful eyes, reproachfully, he thought, and crushing the price of them in his hand, he walked hastily towards the house.</p>
                  <p>"The bad, old wretch," exclaimed Ellen, looking towards the butcher, as she stood on the porch wiping her eyes with the sleeve of the shirt she was making, and just within the door sat Aunt Wetherbe, her face smothered in a towel, and crying like a child.</p>
                  <p>A week more, and Helph was gone, Ellen still remaining with the old people till they should get a little accustomed to their desolate home. The tears shed over his departure were not yet dry, for he had gone in the morning and it was now dusky evening, when, as the little family assembled round the tea-table, he entered, with a hurried and anxious manner that seemed to preface some dismal tidings.</p>
                  <p>Poor youth! his heart was almost breaking—he had no concealments now, and very frankly told the story of his love, and what had been his purposes for the future. Mr. and Mrs. Randall had given up their house—gone abroad, and taken Jenny with them, under the pretext of giving her a thorough education in England. But the young lover felt instinctively that she was separated from him for a widely different purpose.</p>
                  <p>Poor faithful Aunt Kitty had been dismissed without a shilling above her scanty earnings, to work, old and disabled as she was, or die a beggar. After much inquiry, he had learned that she had obtained an engagement at an asylum as a servant for the sick.</p>
                  <p>"Poor old soul!" said Aunt Wetherbe, "you must go right away in the morning and bring her here; she shan't be left to suffer, and I know of it."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind—all will come out bright," said Ellen, as Helph sat that night on the porch, alone and sorrowful.</p>
                  <p>But he would not be comforted—Jenny had not left a single line to give him assurance or hope, and even if she thought of him now, she would forget him in the new life that was before her. All this was plausible, but Ellen's efforts were not altogether idle; and when she offered to go with him to the city<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5993-00000042"/> and see Aunt Kitty, who perhaps might throw some light upon the sudden movement, he began to feel hopeful and cheerful almost: for of all eyes, those of a lover are the quickest to see the light.</p>
                  <p>Some chance prevented the fulfilment of Ellen's promise, and I was commissioned by her to perform the task she had proposed for herself. "It will help to keep him up like," she said, "if you go along." A day or two intervened before I could conveniently leave home, but at last we set out, a clear frosty morning of the late autumn. Behind the one seat of the little wagon in which we rode, an easy chair for Aunt Kitty was placed. A brisk drive of an hour brought us to the hospital; and pleasing ourselves with thoughts of the happy surprise we were bringing to a poor forlorn creature, we entered the parlor, and upon inquiry, were told that we were come too late—she had died half an hour before our arrival, from the effects of a fall received the previous night in returning from the dead-house, whither she had helped to convey a body. "I have ordered her to be decently dressed," said the superintendress, "from my own wardrobe; she was so good, I thought that little enough to do for her,"—and she led the way to the sick ward, where Aunt Kitty awaited to be claimed and buried by her friends. It was a room some fifty or sixty feet in length, and twenty in width, perhaps, lined on either side with a long row of narrow dirty beds, some of them empty, but mostly filled with pale and forlorn wretches—some nigh unto death, some groaning, some propped on pillows and seeming to stolidly regard both the fate of others and themselves. The sun streamed hot through the uncurtained windows, and the atmosphere was pervaded with most offensive odors.</p>
                  <p>As my eye glanced down the beds of suffering, it was arrested by the corpse of the poor old woman—gone at last. I shuddered and stood still as the two haggish-looking old women wrapped and pinned the sheet about the stiffening limbs, with as much imbecile glee as they apparently were capable of. "What in Heaven's name are you laughing at?" said Helph, approaching them. "Just to think of sarving a dead nigger," tittered one; and looking in his face, she drew from her pocket a sealed letter, saying, "May be you can tell who this is for—we found it in her bosom when we went to dress her." It was a letter from Jenny to himself: poor Aunt Kitty had been faithful to the last.</p>
                  <p>Not till I was turning from that terriblest shelter of woe I ever saw, did I notice a young pale-cheeked girl sitting near the door on a low wooden rocking-chair, and holding close to her bosom an infant of but a few days, not with a mother's pride, I fancied, for her eyes drooped away from mine, and a blush burned in her cheek as though shame and not honor covered her young maternity. A moment I paused, praised the baby, and spoke some words of cheer to herself; but she bowed her head lower and lower on her bosom, speaking not a word,—and seeing that I only gave her pain, I passed on, heavy in spirit, and this more for the living than the dead.</p>
                  <p>Jenny's letter proved a wonderful solace, and cheerfulness and elasticity gradually came back; but when, at the expiration of a year, his parents returned without her, and bringing the report of her recreancy and marriage, all courage and ambition deserted him, and years and years and years went by, during which he lived in melancholy isolation. Poor youth! he had no liking for quiltings and wood-choppings any more.</p>
                  <p>Nearly fifteen years were gone since Jenny crossed the sea, and country belles had bloomed and faded before his eyes, without winning from him special regard: when, as he sat before a blazing hickory fire one evening, waiting for Aunt<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5993-00000043"/> Weatherbe, who still enjoyed a green old age, to bring to the table the tea and short-cake, there was a quick, lively tap on the door, and the next moment, in the full maturity of womanhood, but blushing and laughing like the girl of years ago, Jenny stood in the midst of the startled group—Jenny Mitchel still! I need not speak of the base desertion and downright falsehood of her adopted parents, of her long struggle with sorrow and poverty, striving the while to bind her heart from breaking for the faithlessness of her lover, whom she was taught to believe had abandoned her—all this the reader can imagine, as well as the new life that dawned upon, and endowed her with almost superhuman powers of exertion, when she learned by chance that Helph still lived, true to her memory.</p>
                  <p>As we introduced the reader to their happy home in the opening of this story, we need not linger, save to say that the quilting-quilt, still as good as new, adorned the nuptial bed; and that Ellen Blake, good and generous and amiable as ever, presided at the wedding, quite forgetful of her waning maidenhood in the happiness of others.</p>

               <head>THREE SCENES IN THE SOUTH.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY C. B. PARSONS.</head>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>SCENE I.—THE COTTAGE.</head>
                  <p>MUCH has been written and said, and deservedly too, of the beauty and gracefulness of New-England towns and villages. The uniform white painted walls of their houses, their regular walks and avenues, with their clean fields and nice "home lots," all indicative in no small degree, of intellectual training and moral thrift, are sure to attract the attention of the traveller, and are worthy of all praise. But this state of things is not confined alone to the land of the Pilgrims,—the soil of chivalry, also boasts of the beautiful and picturesque. The villas and verandahs of the South, interspersed as they are with orange groves and magnolia forests, though not so prim and precise, are more gorgeous and grand; and, compared with the North, show as the unrestricted expanse of the magnificent sun-flower, to the trim-built and exclusive little buttercup. We remember a cottage scene of the South; and though years have passed since the events transpired, which we are about to record, there are those living, in the green of whose memories they will ever remain—so strong is the impress of woe upon the tables of the mind.</p>
                  <p>In the lovely village of H—, where it was our good fortune to be some time resident, in the year 184—, and just at the turn of the Big Road, which stretches down the Bay on towards the Gulf, stood a beautiful cottage, built after the style<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5993-00000044"/> of the Peninsula, in the age of Cervantes. A venerable grove of magnolias, more gorgeous than Acedemus ever dreamed of, spread their arms to each other above, and embracing together, canopied the place. The broad white blossom in summer, and the perpetual green of winter, of these monarchs of the woods, not only filled the surrounding atmosphere with the most delicious odors, while they closed in the whole area above with umbrageous and unbroken shade, but furnished the beholder, at every elevation of the eye, a fadeless remembrance and emblem, of the imperishable life of hope—that hope, which, as a heavenly cynosure, leads the Christian to the contemplation of things beyond this suffering vale. In the midst of this gorgeous clump of evergreens, and in happy contrast, rose the white walls of the "Spanish Cottage." It was a lovely scene to look upon. Without, and in splendid profusion, festoonings of running rose, eglantine and honeysuckle, sweetly intermingling together, entwined the pillars and draped the porches; while within, the richer elegance of intellectual culture and moral worth, adorned the place. The fields were carpeted with flowers of every hue, and the air rung merrily, with the songs of birds. It was such a picture as Chateaubriand describes, as peculiar to the great valley of the South. This was the residence of old Mr. Wilton, who had now been dead about two years, leaving his son William, who was his only child, the sole heir and possessor of his sufficient fortune. The estate had formerly belonged to the Spanish agent, Sir William Dunbar, a noble gentleman, who was an intimate friend of Mr. Wilton, and in honor of whom William was named. Young Wilton was a highly educated young man, of many noble virtues—generous, charitable and brave, and seemed to emulate the distinguished qualities of heart and mind, of both his father and his patron. He had been, during the years of his novitiate, a student at one of the eastern universities, where he had graduated with <choice>
                        <sic>th</sic>
                        <corr>the</corr>
                     </choice> first honors of his class; and where, as the sequel will show the beginning of circumstances was made, which ultimately involved much misery and more crime. In the same hour of his high college honors, and ere he had descended from the platform of his achievements, a letter bearing the impress of a black seal, was handed him by the janitor. The superscription was in a strange hand. Tremblingly, and with fearful foreboding, he broke the envelope, and read,—his brain reeled with the shock,—his father was dead! How strange a world is this, where the quality of joys and sorrows are so assorted to each other. Little <emph>joys</emph> are modified with little <emph>griefs</emph>, but great transports must be rebuked by great suffering. Into the cup of ecstacy, just about to be quaffed by the Roman Father, an envious fate stood ready, to cast the life-drops of a daughter slain in the moment of triumph, by a victorious brother's hand.</p>
                  <p>With a saddened heart, young Wilton, turned his footsteps towards his home in the South, where now his presence was imperiously demanded. A warm welcome from the two old domestics greeted his arrival, but a father's smile of approbation, that boon which he had so calculated upon, and for which he had toiled, had been stricken away. All that was now left, was to pay the tribute of a tear at his father's grave, and look about himself for his future course. This he speedily adjusted, and having given a few brief orders, was soon on his way again for the North—gossip said to select a partner for life's mazy dance, with whom to share the joys and sorrows of his cottage home. In this instance the old dame of many tongues told the truth; for he soon returned again, and bearing with him his beautiful and accomplished bride, the elegant daughter of the Honorable Mr. B—. Rumor says the match was a rash one—<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5993-00000045"/> on the lady's part—that her parents were bitterly opposed to it on the score of prejudice against the South, and that to accomplish their purpose the young couple were compelled to elope. Be that as it may, it was now near two years since their settlement in the cottage, and by common consent they were the happiest people in all this region, especially among the poorer classes, they have been idolized; with whom the lady is an angel of mercy, and the gentleman a <choice>

                        <corr>benefactor</corr>
                     </choice> of his race.</p>
                  <p>"But come," said our friend, "as we are so near the cottage, let us extend our walk a little, and pay them a morning call. It will be pleasant to make the acquaintance of this interesting family. This is the place."</p>
                  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Wilton; a pleasant morning, sir;" said we.</p>
                  <p>"Good morning,—good morning, sirs," was his reply. "Yes, sirs, a delightful Southern morning. Come, sirs, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans ceremonie</foreign>, walk in and rest you a bit; I am glad to see you both, and feel no little honored by this early visit. Your drowsy, after-dinner visitations, may do for loungers, who, overcome with spiritual <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign>, study more sedulously how to kill time, than ever Archimedes did to solve his great problem; but for me, there is more music in the notes of the lark than in the song of the cricket."</p>
                  <p>"You are right, sir," said we; "and your taste, in this regard, well accords with our own. But there's another to be consulted in this matter, I think; perhaps the madam might not fancy to see company at this early hour."</p>
                  <p>"O, yes," said he, smiling, "my wife is myself in that respect; and, indeed, in almost every other. Our <emph>love-path</emph>, it is true, was not as smooth, perhaps, as it might have been, but when it widened into wedlock, it was equal to the famous 'shell-road.' When we married, we two 'were no longer twain but one flesh.' She would consider the hour a little out of season perhaps, if she was, at her father's, in the far 'down-east' country, but with us here, in the sunny South, we shake off many of those arbitrary notions of upper-crust-dom, (which, by the way, are sometimes a little 'done brown,' by our baking,) and in place thereof we have untrammeled intercourse and enjoyment with our friends at all hours. Isn't it so, wife? I beg pardon, Alice, this is our friend, Mr. P— from Kentucky, with Mr. — from the village; this is Mrs. Wilton, gentlemen."</p>
                  <p>We bowed, and he went on.</p>
                  <p>"I often thought," said he, "while resident in the North, in the family of Dr. BIRCH and Professor HICKORY, that compared with the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans-souci</foreign> and wreathy ease of our Southern homes, the image of their manners was like a figure of snow, with icicle trimmings."</p>
                  <p>"Come, come," said we, "you must not be too severe upon the manners and customs of the cold land, because you are so snug and warm here in the South; recollect, you gathered the loveliest flower you ever saw, in that sterile clime."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, sir," said the lady, slightly coloring.</p>
                  <p>"I acknowledge the compliment," said he, bowing, and casting a glace of unmingled affection upon his gentle wife; "but you see, even <emph>that</emph> blossom, so perfect and so good, had to be transplanted to a southern soil before it could mature into fruitfulness; don't you see," said he, laughing, "the richness and beauty of our southern production;" and he pointed to a lovely babe of near a year old, who was quietly sleeping upon its mother's lap.</p>
                  <p>"You must not mind Mr. Wilton," said she, recovering a little from the confusion which the last remark had occasioned, "he don't mean half he says about the coldness of the<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5993-00000046"/> North, for he knows full well that some of his happiest hours were spent there."</p>
                  <p>"That's true, Alice," said he; "and I will never forget them: no—never."</p>
                  <p>"O, I don't mind him," said I, "nor will my friend here. We rejoice to see you so delightfully situated and so happy. May no blighting spirit ever cross your threshold to mar your felicity."</p>
                  <p>"God grant it," said Wilton; while a respondent tear glistened in the eye of the wife, and told the deep interest she felt in the subject.</p>
                  <p>"But come," said Wilton, "before you go you must take a glass of wine, or brandy if you prefer it, and pledge our young and promising household. I suppose the Temperance folk have not got hold of you yet?" They tried a little after me once—it was some time since, when I was at Cincinnati—but they soon discovered it was no go to follow that trail. That man GOUGH, though, did come mighty near hooking me, at one time, and Genl. CAREY at another, but I shook them off. By the way, these Temperance associations seem to me, to be, not only unnecessary and unreasonable, but they strike at the most manly prerogative of human constituency—liberty. I cannot think with complacency, even upon the <emph>invitation,</emph> to sign away my freedom, much less upon the <emph>act itself</emph>. As if a man needed a conservator to keep his moral machinery checked and balanced, lest it should run wild. The very thought is humiliating, and unworthy the dignity of intelligent manhood. But come, what shall it be—wine, water, brandy? What you will; take your choice; but for my part, I like something a little stronger."</p>
                  <p>Water was the beverage of <emph>our</emph> pledge, of course, but <emph>he drank brandy</emph>. We said farewell, and turned away from that beautiful cottage and happy family; but for days and weeks, that "something a little stronger," haunted our mind, and seemed to predict, that it would one day prove the "strong man armed," that would destroy their peace for ever. Poor Wilton!</p>

                  <head>SCENE II.—THE CONTRAST.</head>
                  <p>How truly it is said, that "virtue does not always meet its just reward in this bad world," where the honest, the excellent and the noble, are as likely to be made the quarry of an insidious and subtle foe, as the base, the worthless and the vile. Nature's universal characteristic, is mutation; change, is written upon all things. It is a common duty therefore, dictated as well by safety, as by happiness, to watch with exceeding carefulness, in order that moral progress may lead from good to better,—else, through carelessness and temptation, its tendencies may be, in an opposite direction. About seven years after the period of the previous chapter, it was our fortune, again to visit the sunny land, where <q>

                           <l>"The notes of the wild Thrush, ring through the brake,</l>

                        </lg>
                     </q> Just as the sun was sinking to rest, wrapt and pillowed by one of those red and portentous hazes, peculiar to the south in the vernal season of the year, we found ourselves once more entering the pleasant village of H—.</p>
                  <p>We had almost forgotten the happy family of the Wiltons, whom we knew on our first pilgrimage south,—but as we had several acquaintances in the village and some among them remembered our former visit to the cottage,—especially the friend who accompanied us on that memorable morning, it was not long before their name was introduced. We were anxious to hear of<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5993-00000047"/> their welfare, and yet we knew not why, we felt a sad foreboding that all was not right there. <emph>That</emph> "something a little stronger," came back again with the name, and assumed, in the mirror of the mind, the hideous demon of the Still—glancing and gloating upon his victims. To-morrow morning, said our friend, we will resume again our early walk, of seven years ago, in the direction of what was then the beautiful Spanish Cottage; but strange changes have been rung upon the bells of life, from that day to this. Poor Wilton!—but I will not anticipate—you shall see and judge for yourself. "Do you remember your remark then, about the strong man armed?" "Yes," said we, perfectly; the vision has been with us a hundred times. "Well," said he, significantly, he has been there, sure enough. How strange is the philosophy of life. Moments, sometimes, make impressions upon the mind which years of oblivion can never efface or obliterate. By the dim fore-shadowings of the future, such seemed to be the character of events, which the coming day was to evolve.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, the sun rose murky and red, and as with swollen face, he peeped forth from the chambers of the east,—looked more like a drunken sluggard, forced forth from his rest to his task, than the coming up of a cheerful bride-groom, or as "a strong man, rejoicing to run a race." We were soon on our way towards the cottage. "Come said we, tell us of the ruin which has befallen the—what's that?"</p>
                  <p>"O nothing," said he "but the distant croaking of a family of Ravens, which have singularly enough taken up their abode among the magnolias at the cottage. Their hoarse notes have filled the air of late, to the no little annoyance of the neighbors; many of whom are superstitious enough to think it ominous of evil. They say the croaking of the raven, indicates the shedding of blood; but I have no belief for such things."</p>
                  <p>"You remember the time when Wilton made us drink with him, and pledge his family, when <emph>we</emph> drank water, and he "liked something a little stronger?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; I remember it as a thing of yesterday."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that '<hi rend="i"/>liking' never left him, but grew upon him," without abatement, until, as with bands of iron, it bound him an abject slave, and it is FOREVER. He soon became a confirmed drunkard; though for a year or two, while his fortune held up his wild orgies, his debauches and his abuses were chiefly confined to his own cottage, where, as far as possible, they were concealed by his amiable wife from the public view. But as his means became scant, his vice grew bold; every sense of shame was at length banished, and the once elegant and accomplished William Wilton was lost. He has for years been the common tavern-loafer, and pot-house sot. One circumstance, however, in his miserable career, more than anything else, removed from him the last vestige of sympathy, and fixed him in the eye of the community as a loathsome and repulsive moral offence. There were two aged servants, whom you may remember, that were left by his father as a part of his estate, a male and female; whether they were man and wife, or not, I do not remember. The woman—and probably the very nurse of his infancy—he sold to a trader for a barrel of whiskey (she was redeemed, however, by one of the neighbors who would not see the horrid sacrilege, but HE knew nothing of it) and the other, an old man, he tied up and beat, in a drunken fit, for some imaginary insult, so severely, that he soon died of his wounds. It was with great difficulty that the public was restrained from taking popular vengeance on him for these acts; but on account of his family they spared him, and partly in the hope also, I suppose, that he would finish himself with his barrel of whiskey (so they said). But in this last they were disappointed<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5993-00000048"/> pointed; like a monster, as he is, he lived through it, and he still lives on."</p>
                  <p>From the accomplished gentleman <emph>you</emph> knew him, he has become an incarnate fiend, and to such an extent does he demonstrate his nature, that the neighbors often tremble for the safety of his wife and child. The little girl, you remember, was an infant when you were here; she is now near eight years old, and a most intelligent and interesting child. Poor Mrs. Wilton, she bears it all with meek patience, and much submission, but every one can see that she is a broken-hearted woman.</p>
                  <p>"And all this misery," said we, "is the fruit of that one error,—the liking of 'something a little stronger.'"</p>
                  <p>"Well, here we are, in sight of the place," said our friend. Mark the contrast of seven years. <emph>One</emph> thing you will note, and that is, a strict harmony has been preserved betwixt the moral and the physical of the scene; the outer change is as great as that of the inner man."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and all this," said we, "is the work of the bottle. Where, now, is the 'dignity of intelligent manhood'—the 'freedom,' of which he spoke so eloquently? The dog at his vomit; the sow in the wallow; or the man with his bottle; which of these three hath most of the beast?"</p>
                  <p>There stood the shattered and decayed cottage, it is true,—like a tomb ruin—a gloomy remembrance of other days; and there, too, what remained of the splendid Magnolia grove—time and abuse had done their work on both. The axe had leveled most of the beautiful trees for firewood, while those that remained, seemed to stand silent and sad in their dark foliage, as if sensible of the dishonor that had befallen them. The largest and noblest of the grove had been ruined by the lightning ning, during a severe thunder-storm, and hung in halves, sustained by the adjacent trees, which seemed in this, as dutiful children, amidst the desolation, holding up a stricken sire. The very thunderer had spoken in threatening and in wrath. The grounds had been let go to waste; briars had usurped the fence corners, and thistles covered the fields. Since the murder of the old servant man there was no one left to till the soil, which, like the moral waste of Wilton's mind, seemed as if a simoom had passed over it; and was not such the fact? More blasting than the "Zamiel," is the fire breath of the Still. With the cottage itself, the contrast was greater, if possible, than with the grove. Doorless openings, and sashless windows, with furniture broken and destroyed, told of times of violence. Desolation and misery, had been lighted to their possession of the beautiful cottage, by the spirit-lamp of hell, where now, hand in hand, they stalked and ruled supreme. A Satan, in the Garden of Eden, is that "<hi rend="i"/>something a little stronger," in the house of the happy.</p>
                  <p>Some one comes; it is the little daughter, and followed to the door by her ruffian father, who, with threatening and abuse is sending her upon some errand. He seems even now, at this early time in the day, to be under the influence of the demon. See, he is standing and staggering in the door-way still, and with bloated face and blood-shot eyes, is muttering something betwixt his teeth, in reference to that little girl. Alas, for the fate of a drunkard's daughter!</p>
                  <p>"And is that man Wilton? The man we knew? the gentleman and the scholar? Merciful heaven, what a metamorphosis!"</p>
                  <p>"Did you observe," said our friend, "that the little girl had a jug in her hand as she left the house? He is still under<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5993-00000049"/> the maddening influence of the last night's drunken brawl, and has doubtless sent his child to the grocery in the village for more whiskey to cool off upon. Woe betide that little innocent if she fail in her degrading mission."</p>
                  <p>"Come," said we, "let us go; we have seen enough. O it harrows up the very soul. What talents; what usefulness; what respectability; what everything, indeed, might have been his; but all—all, are sacrificed to that prince of evils, strong drink. Why don't Mrs. Wilton take her little daughter and return to her father's house? he would receive her kindly, we doubt not."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that has been spoken of," said he, "but when Wilton is sober, as he sometimes is, his former good nature returns again; he is kind then, and promises amendment. And though every body else has lost all confidence in his pledges, his wife has not, but hopes still. A woman's heart is slow to give up the object of its early affections; a woman's love never forsakes. Besides, the match at first, was consummated by an elopement, and a sense of pride, perhaps, forbids the idea of such an event as her return. I think, however, that some of the friends (unknown to her) have written to the old gentleman, and if I mistake not, he is expected here about this time."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad of it, may God speed his journey. I would he was here now; for O I fear—I fear! Let us return to our lodgings. Our walk has produced a melancholy upon my mind which I cannot shake off. If I was superstitious, I should think there was some fearful calamity at hand. Poor Wilton, what a terrible contrast has the progress of seven years drawn upon the tables of his life, and how fearfully has his own hand guided the pencil. Is there hope? O God! is there hope? let us think."</p>

                  <head>SCENE III.—THE CATASTROPHE.</head>
                  <p>AN hour, it may be, had elapsed, after the morning ramble of the last scene, during the interview of which we had sought the retirement of our chamber and communion with God. "<emph>He</emph> is our refuge," and always "a present help in trouble." Such was our condition and though we had no adequate conception of what the cause should be, a trouble seemed ready to settle down upon our mind. From this we sought relief, only where relief can be found for an oppressed spirit, at the throne of grace. Suddenly a busy hum in the street below, fell upon our ear. On approaching the window to ascertain the cause, we observed a crowd about the door and a fainting female just being borne within the house. Almost immediately, as if moved by a common impulse, the whole village—men, women, and children—were seen hurriedly crossing the lawn, in the direction of the cottage.</p>
                  <p>"What has happened? Some dire event has transpired to cause this rush of excitement. We will follow, also, and learn the cause."</p>
                  <p>Just then our door opened, and our friend of the morning, pale and agitated, entered the room.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter?" said we. "What has occurred? For heaven's sake, speak!"</p>
                  <p>"I am come," said he, "to ask you, once more, to accompany me to the cottage. The dreadful drama is near the close, the bloody <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> of which is terrible to behold."</p>
                  <p>"Bloody! do you say? What has happened?"</p>
                  <p>"Murder has happened," said he. "Murder, not only most 'foul and unnatural,' but of circumstances so horrible that the mind trembles to know and think upon them."</p>
                  <p>"Who is murdered?" said we; "and who is the murderer?"</p>
                  <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5993-00000050"/>
                  <p>"They have just borne the fainting form of Mrs. Wilton into the house below, but little Alice and the wretched father—come put on your hat, and let us visit the scene; I came for you on purpose, because I saw you were so interested in the welfare of the family. As we go, I will tell you what has come to pass."</p>
                  <p>We immediately started for the cottage.</p>
                  <p>"The state of the case appears to be about this," said he, "as near as we could ascertain, from the incoherent and anguished speech of poor Mrs. Wilton: the fiend of a father, as we learn, who was still under the influence of last night's drunkenness, had sent the little girl to the grocery for more whiskey; just as we supposed was the case, when we saw her pass us with the jug in her hand."</p>
                  <p>"Where," said one, "could he have gotten the means to purchase the poison? would they trust him?"</p>
                  <p>"O no," said he. "It appears that on yesterday, while the miserable drunkard, and <emph>more</emph> wretched husband and father was absent at his tavern orgies, Mrs. Wilton, driven to her last extremity, in order to purchase food for herself and daughter, sold to a pedlar who passed through the Village, her wedding ring. This was the last article of any value that remained, and even this brought but a trifle. Still, it would buy a little bread—and though she had clung to it, as a remembrance of faded joys, and wept upon it as a witness of untold sorrows,—the pressing demands of hunger were not to be resisted, and the ring, which was placed upon her finger with solemn oaths, now left it, midst bitter sighs. This transaction, by some means Wilton found out, and demanded the money. This she refused. With threats and imprecations, he persisted, and even went so far as to fetch the axe from the yard, and raise it menacingly over her head, threatening her life if she continued to refuse. Alarmed for her safety, at length she yielded, and gave him the money. Immediately the scanty product of the sacrifice, which was intended to purchase bread to sustain life, was on the way to the Grocery, for "<hi rend="i"/>more whiskey," to produce death. On her return, it seems, the little girl stumbled against some obstacle in the path, and unfortunately fell. In her fall, the jug was broken, and the whiskey spilled. Sensible of the extent of her misfortune, and the violent wrath which awaited her, little Alice, gathered up the fragments of the broken jug, in token of her mishap, and weeping bitterly, made her way, fearful and trembling, into the presence of her unnatural parent. In a moment he saw the truth, and maddened into a paroxysm of rage, at his disappointment, he bounded like a tiger from his seat, and seizing the axe, with a savage yell swore instant vengeance. Against the child, his first fury was levelled, who fled out at the back door, pursued by her father, while the mother, who was equally the object of his hellish design, escaped through the front of the house. It is likely the fleetness of little Alice would have baffled the pursuit of the monster father which she had often done before, had not her feet become entangled in some brushwood about the door, which had been placed there for purposes of fuel. This proved fatal to her life—the murderous axe came down, and poor little Alice was dead.—A single horrid scream from the child, reached the fleeing mother's ear, who with a groan, sank senseless by the road side;—whence she was borne to the house we left. One stroke of the axe did the deed, and almost cleft the child in twain. The descending blow struck her, in a falling condition as it would seem, just at the back of the head, and passed quite through the neck and breast, dividing them entirely asunder. Poor child, it was a sight horrible to behold. No sooner had this fiend in human shape accomplished this part of his design, than he rushed back into the house<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5993-00000051"/> again, to finish his work upon his abused and devoted wife.—Fortunately she was not there. Disappointed of the chosen subject of his vengeance, his next purpose seemed to be to select some object, animate or inanimate, upon which to wreak his fury. A portrait of Mrs. Wilton, painted by Inman—a beautiful picture, hung upon the wall of the apartment,—against this he now launched his wildest and most frantic madness. It is said that the frenzied soul, which under the influence of alcoholic madness steeps itself in murder, knows neither mercy nor remorse. One broad cut appeared in the face of the portrait, but in the effort to inflict a second blow, the head of the axe struck the ceiling of the room,—being lifted too high,—and glancing struck deep into the side of his own head and neck, severing the main artery, and producing instant death.</p>
                  <p>"This is the apartment," said our friend,—"and there you see he lies, in the centre of the floor weltering in his blood,—with the fatal axe still in his grasp;—and just over him the indentation in the ceiling.—And there too they have laid the body of little Alice.—Great God, what a sight is here?—This also is the work of the bottle,—the legitimate fruits of '<hi rend="i"/>something a little stronger.'"</p>
                  <p>Let us turn aside from this place of terrors. Horrors thicken fast,—they rise like the whelming tide, and mock at rest.—The very currents of the heart curdle and chill, and the pulses pause in fear, among scenes like these. And this is the end of that beginning, which was so bright and joyful, and so full of promise. Like the coiled adder at the bottom of a lucid fountain, poisoning its sweet waters with the virus of death, is the spirit of the still, midst the springs of life. Who would have said seven years ago, that this would be the end of William Wilton,—the accomplished, the generous and the just.—But so it is—the tempter was busy—and the fire streams were full,—they roll unresisted, and have borne to hell their victim.</p>
                  <p>It were idle to attempt a description of the scene, which communicated to the bereaved and distracted wife, the terrible events that had taken place. Scream answered to swoon,—and swoon succeeded scream,—following close upon each other, and in such rapid succession, that fears were entertained that her reason would perish, if her life was not also added to the list. But kind heaven directed otherwise,—<emph>her</emph> time was not yet. The next day at an early hour, was the appointed time for the funeral, which was to take place near the cottage, where the grave had been already prepared.—Sorrow and gloom held vigil together that night, in the village of H—.</p>
                  <p>"John;" said a voice to a servant man, as he was hurrying through the hall of the Hotel early in the morning,—"who was that tall old gentleman, that came in the stage last night?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, sir," said John, "he is the strangest old man that I ever saw, that's certain. He seems almost like he was a lunatic."</p>
                  <p>"Why so, John?"</p>
                  <p>"Why sir," said the servant, "though he had been riding in the stage for two days without rest or sleep, he did not he down nor ask for a bed at all, but wandered about the village all night like a ghost. He asked about the murder down at the cottage, and while they told him the story, he shook and groaned as if he had been in an ague fit.—Two or three times he started off to go down there, and then turned suddenly back again, afraid I reckon, that he would see the spirit of Wilton."</p>
                  <p>"It is certainly <emph>he</emph>," said the voice, and the door closed.</p>
                  <p>"HE," said John, looking for a moment at the closed door,—yes, <emph>it is</emph> HE,—and a singular HE he is. I think <emph>he</emph> is mad.</p>

                  <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5993-00000052"/>
                  <p>The assembled village stood round the grave. A large plain coffin had been provided, which contained the bodies of both father and daughter—the murderer and the murdered. This, it is likely would not have been the arrangement, but a sympathetic <choice>
                        <sic>commisseration</sic>
                        <corr>commiseration</corr>
                     </choice>, had suddenly sprung up in the popular mind on behalf of the wretched murderer, ascribing the horrid deed rather to madness, than to premeditation. This, without doubt, was a right view of the subject. It <emph>was</emph> madness, and of the worst and most fatal type. A madness, full of horrors, and fit exponant of the condition of the damned,—the madness of the Still.</p>
                  <p>Upon the coffin, in gorey state, lay the fatal axe. The instrument of the murder, was to be buried with the murderer and the murdered. A strange "hatchment," truly, but in strict keeping with the nature of the scene. The services were short, solemn and impressive, and as the coffin was lowered to its last resting-place, the widow sunk upon her knees, and remained in that situation until the friends had filled the grave. The tall grey-headed stranger stood unnoticed by her side. As the crowd was about to disperse, he turned to the mourner, and with tremulous emotion said, "<emph>Alice</emph>." It was like the shock of a Galvanic battery. She threw back her veil at the sound of his voice; started to her feet, and with a long, piercing, unearthly shriek, fell senseless into his arms.</p>
                  <p>A moment more, and the story was told;—<emph>he was her father, She was dead!</emph>

               <head>MARY NEILLY.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY MRS. JENNIE DOWLING DE WITT.</head>
               <p>"HA! ha! our Paddy friend is far enough gone now we'll make him take us over to Widow Neilly's to-night to see his pretty sweetheart; I guess she will not be saying much to him in this plight." The speaker gave a significant glance at a young man lying at full length on one of the boxes at the furthest corner of a low groggery (of which so many can be found in every city and town in our Western country), and, advancing towards him, administered a plentiful shower of oaths and kicks, in order to assist to his feet his almost senseless victim. "Here, Joe," shouted the first speaker, "come along and help me, or I'll have hard work to get him home. We are goin' home with you, Bill, for fear you'll break your neck before you get there; ain't we mighty kind to you, old boy?" As he spoke, he leered triumphantly over his fallen rival, and said in an under tone to his less intoxicated companion: "Very kind; if I play my cards well, I'll get Mary Neilly yet, with her pretty face, and may be her rosy cheeks will come back again, if she leaves off her eternal worrying over this drunken fool. Come on, Bill, or it'll be dark before we get over there."</p>
               <p>The drunken man looked vacantly up, and made a vain effort to free himself from the firm grasp of his companions. "I—I'll be afther gitting along as well without the like of ye's. Mary don't like me to be fetchin' ye home with me, so ye had bitter stay here and—"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" shouted he; "she'll not like you to be bringing yerself home to-night, I'll warrant you; she'll like me better than you this time, so come along."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5993-00000053"/>
               <p>The young Irishman, intoxicated as he evidently was, staggered round to face his tormentor, muttering: "You'll not be daring to say that, when it was yersel' that lured me to the drhink, and faith, I'd knock any other man down that would be afther sayin' it."</p>
               <p>"You look like knocking anybody down, don't you? You don't think I made you drunk on purpose to get your pet done away from you; never fear, I'll have her yet in spite of you."</p>
               <p>"Hould yer lying tongue," answered the other, at the same time aiming a blow at his persecutor, which the other avoided, thereby precipitating his assailant over the steps into the street. A loud laugh echoed from his two comrades just as a female figure appeared at the side of the fallen man. She laid her hand on his arm, and whispered, in a choking voice: "Willie, for my sake, for Heaven's sake, come away home; why did ye come with the two bad men that'd take the life o' ye if they dared? Come quick, they are coming."</p>
               <p>"Here she is," cried the one inside, coming towards them: "come now, we'll see which your beauty likes best." The speaker pushed the veil and hat from the face of the anxious and terrified girl. Her lover, intoxicated as he was, rushed in between them, but the other mockingly pushed him aside, and threw his arm about her neck, exclaiming in a jeering tone: "Now for a dozen kisses, if I like; your protector isn't in a very fit condition to hinder me."</p>
               <p>One glance at his lovely Mary, pale and trembling, a second vain attempt to interpose, and he seized a knife lying upon a barrel, and plunged it into the bosom of his tormentor. They rolled over together upon the ground, while the terror-stricken girl could only gaze in mute horror upon the deed of murder that she thought had been committed.</p>
               <p>Three months passed away, and the trial of William Harty, for an assault, with intent to kill, upon the person of George Brown, was brought before the court. The prosecution was carried on with all the energy that hatred, revenge, and jealousy could prompt. George Brown, on his recovery, had spent the earnings of years in the attempt to have his rival put out of his way, for since the affray, Mary had so effectually avoided him, that he had not once seen her. The trial was one of unusual length, enlisting the warmest sympathy of the spectators in behalf of the prisoner and the fair young girl who was compelled to testify against him. It was difficult to imagine that, beneath the open, manly brow, and mild blue eye, a heart was hidden so full of guilt and evil passions, as the charge preferred against him implied. But justice, not mercy, were demanded at the hands of the court; it was theirs to decide, not from the appearance of the prisoner, but from the facts of the case.</p>
               <p>The jury brought in a verdict of guilty, and William Harty was sentenced to ten years' solitary confinement. As the sentence was pronounced, Mary Neilly uttered a cry of pain, and her brother rushed forward, only to carry her half-fainting from the court. The prisoner started up as if to follow, but sank back with a burst of uncontrollable agony, as he remembered that he was not at liberty.</p>
               <p>All that night poor Widow Neilly watched over her child, while James glided about holding his breath, as if fearful of the young life flickering out from his sister's breast. "Ah!" wept the mother; "my swate, swate child, ye was the darlint o' my life; little did I iver think to see ye so for Willie's sake. Sorra's the day for ye that ye let him away from ould Ireland. Not all the gould o' the counthry could ha' tempted ye if ye'd dhramed o' this. Poor Willie! I love ye yet, though it's nigh enough ye ha' come to laying my wee Mary in the ground;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5993-00000054"/> but it was the dhrink that did it, not yer own thrue heart. Bad luck to the wretches that made ye the slave o' the crathur when we weren't by to kape ye. Oh! Mary mavourneen! Mary mavourneen!"</p>
               <p>James was active during the next month in obtaining signers to a petition drawn up by a kind clergyman in behalf of the unfortunate prisoner. The circumstances of the case, combined with the young Irishman's earnest pledges of his friend's future abstinence from intoxicating drink, the indulgence in which seemed, to nine out of every ten who heard the case, the only absolute crime of which he was guilty, that he found no difficulty in obtaining names.</p>
               <p>With the greatest confidence, he presented his petition, signed by over a thousand persons, but, to his utter dismay, was positively refused. For several weeks the household was gloomier than ever. Mary seemed failing under her weight of sorrow; her mother could do nothing but watch her and weep with her, while James hung over his twin sister almost with the sadness of despair. * * * *</p>
               <p>One day, when the governor was seated in his private study, he heard a timid knock at the door. Upon opening it, what was his surprise to see a middle-aged woman, plainly, but neatly dressed, standing without! Not waiting for him to speak, she immediately explained the cause of her intrusion. "Yer honor, it's for life and death I'm come; an' I thought may be your servants wouldn't be letting the likes o' me in to see the governor. But it's meself that has heard o' the kind heart in yer honor's bosom, an' I thought ye'd like enough give a helping-hand even to a poor ould body like me."</p>
               <p>"Come in, my good woman," answered he; "I am not in the habit of refusing to do what I can for my fellow-beings."</p>
               <p>His kind tone encouraged her, and she held out to him a folded paper. A shade passed over his brow as he glanced at the contents, and he returned it instantly, saying: "Indeed, it is utterly impossible for me to yield to your desires in this respect; I have examined this case before, and felt it my duty to refuse the petition. There have been half a dozen similar cases lately, and we must make an example of him that shall intimidate others. The community, as well as the individual, requires justice, and one must suffer for the good of many."</p>
               <p>The poor woman burst into tears, exclaiming, "Indade, sir, its Willie'd be killed hisself before he'd be killing another, if the dhrink didn't dhrive him beside hisself. Don't I know him better than them all, an' sure ye'll not belave me word. Ye must listen to me, sir, for a little, I'll not kape ye long. It was fourteen years agone that I was left a widow in ould Ireland, with my two blessed childher. Ye see Willie Harty's mother and I were always sisters like, bekase we lived in the one house, from the time we weren't more nor two year old. When she died (that was just afther I was married), she tould me to take care of her orphan baby, and God would reward me for the dade of mercy. Poor Ellen! it would almost make her wape, though she's a blessed angel in heaven now, to see her Willie where he is this day. A good many years went on, an' I got childher o' my own, but I always loved Willie just the same; and faith, niver could yer honor ha' found in all Ireland a cleverer or a nicer boy.</p>
               <p>"At last I found out that he an' my swate Mary loved each other. I was as glad as the childher at the betrothal, an' right proud was I when I heard the people whispering, as they went home from church, that Willie and Mary would be the prettiest couple in Ailendeen. Jist a twelvemonth afore the wedding was to ha' been, we thought we'd come to Ameriky, bekase ever since my husband died we had tight work to get along Willie came first to find us a place. How well do I mind that first letter that we got, telling us that he was so<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5993-00000055"/> lonely, and wanted so much to see us. Well, after a while, we came, too; we were all in a bustle at first, hurrying to get ready for the weddin', and two happier hearts niver beat than theirs. But Willie had a new frind, that I didn't like at all at all, an' that was George Brown. He used to be coaxin' Mary to go out with him when Willie was away, an' I could see plain enough that he'd ha' put 'em apart if he could, but Mary couldn't bear him, an' at first he seemed angry at 'em both, but all of a suddint he got very friendly like wi' Willie, and purtended to be very fond o' him. But by-and-by Willie would come in wi' the fire o' the dhrink in his eyes, an' I can't be saying how it was that he got such a fast hold on the boy, but I'm sure he maned to make Mary lave him, though he didn't often come to see her hisself, for fear we'd be having suspicions of his black heart. He'd watch for him where-ever he could find him, and get him away wi' him. Mary would sometimes go out, o' dark nights, after him hersel', an' she growing pale an' sick when the wedding was put off so many times, for she wouldn't marry Willie till he'd lave off dhrinking. George Brown niver said any thing to Mary for a good while afore Willie stabbed him, nor I don't belave he would then, barrin' he'd been taking a little o' the crathur. He thought he'd get her after a while, when nobody stood in his way. When Willie was better o' the liquor they'd been pouring down his throat, he hardly minded a thing he'd done, an' when I went to the prison to see him, he asked me what he was there for, and told me the next day, when he was free, he'd sign the pledge.</p>
               <p>"When the sentence was spoke, my poor Mary fainted, and her brother brought her home, but she acted wild like all night, an' didn't get off her bed for two weeks; now she goes about more like a shadow nor a young, hopeful girl, an' I'm sure she'll niver live ten years, with the shame, an' grief, an' a', to see poor Willie out again. He's his own blissed silf again now, I saw it in his eyes in the coort.</p>
               <p>"Oh! your ixcellence," cried the weeping mother, dropping on her knees, "if ye've e'er a child at home to bless ye, an' call ye father, ye'll not send mine to the grave, for if ye but say the word, ye can save her."</p>
               <p>The tears sparkled in the eyes of the governor. "Hold, hold! my good woman," said he, "yours is an extraordinary case. Before night the prisoner will be set at liberty." The sobs so choked her utterance that she could not thank him; but the savior of her child was never forgotten in her prayers.</p>
               <p>Before nightfall Mary Neilly was clasped rapturously, yet tearfully, to the bosom of her repentant lover and affianced husband.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Eight or ten years after the above events, when the merciful governor was travelling in Illinois, his carriage-wheel broke, and he alighted at a nice, snug-looking farm-house, to repair it. What was his surprise to recognize in the fine sturdy farmer the pardoned prisoner of former years, and to receive again the tearful thanks of the old mother, joined to the blessings of the happy wife, while two or three rosy children, with clean frocks and faces, peeped from behind grandmother's dress upon the illustrious stranger! He discovered that James also was married and settled close by, but he had never been able to prevail upon his mother to leave her favorite child. Willie and Mary declared that they had ceased to look with sorrow upon the events of that memorable trial, and could only thank God for the never-to-be-forgotten lesson they had received, and pray blessings upon his head who had changed the night of sorrow into the morning of joy, and given them the peace of a happy life, instead of the misery of a disgraceful punishment.</p>

               <head>THE LAST OF TORCONNIER'S BAND.</head>
               <head type="sub"/>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>PART FIRST.</head>
                  <p>TORCONNIER was an Italian, and the leader of a band famous for its great harmony and power. All Verona rang with its praise. Was there to be a marriage of some Don's dark-eyed daughter? Torconnier must be there with his handsome, straight young musicians, that is, if one was able to pay them their stipulated price, which, it must be confessed, was enormous.</p>
                  <p>Of gigantic stature, massive frame, and portly mein, this chief of melody surpassed all others of his countrymen in grace of form and commanding beauty of feature. Passionately fond of his profession, at times his deep set eyes would sparkle with a fire that made them almost too intensely brilliant, and his finely cut lips, naturally of a coral glow, grew pale and tremulous with the emotion that, wild or sweet sounds conjured in his heart.</p>
                  <p>To belong to Torconnier's band was esteemed a great honor; and many young men of noble families met with him in private at his rehearsals, and in public showed him much favor and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fêted</foreign> him, getting up entertainments in a style of almost princely magnificence. The great leader was unmarried, constantly receiving immense sums of money, yet, always poor. His saloons were rich in adornment, beyond description; the rarest works of art, the most elegant and costly tapestry, the softest frescoing on walls and ceilings, carpet of luxurious pattern and material, statue of the finest marble, and gorgeous furniture; indeed the mansions of the great were rarely equalled with that of Torconnier.</p>
                  <p>But alas' what a sight was this mighty leader, at times, when the carousel was over, and the last midnight lamp gave a yellow tinge to his handsome face as its sickly flame streamed over him. Stretched out upon one of his velvet couches, his great eyes glaring and bloodshed, his fine features convulsed, poor Torconnier laid, drivelling and insensible; he had sipped the wine till he was drunk; and none of his band as they reeled home from his splendid suppers were in better condition than himself. Generally, at such a time, a young female of great beauty stood, weeping over him and lavishing caresses upon his insensible form. She was his niece; the beautiful Viola Torconnier, whom a dying brother had commended to the care of his famous kinsman; and she was betrothed to young Tricolo, first player upon the flute, who, Torconnier himself said, would yet be the wonder of the world.</p>
                  <p>Both loved with a passionate fervor peculiar to that clime burning and fervid as it is, and Viola seldom appeared in public because her loveliness made her subject to many annoyances, for all Verona knew that the famous Torconnier had in his splendid home, a gem for the possession of which, many would have parted with their whole fortunes.</p>
                  <p>A dark day dawned upon the Italian city. Not that the sun shone with less splendor, not that the soft winds were less cool and fragrant of flowers, or the skies shorn of their blue enamel-like transparency—no; the harp still sounded in the land of song, but fair fingers elicited most melancholy cadences; Torconnier was dead; the man who moved all hearts with his stirring melodies, who brought forth, tears, smiles or sighs at his<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5993-00000057"/> pleasure, would never again sway the baton, or with the magic of his pen clothe with glorious garments the noble creations of his genius.</p>
                  <p>No! he slept for ever; his tongue was mute, his thrilling glance passionless. Shorn of his great strength, he slept motionless beneath a canopy of sable velvet over the dim splendor of his darkened room, the tall candles threw at times a startling light, the warm wind from between the marble pillars sweeping their dull flames aside, as the mourner, or the sorrowing stranger entered to pay their last tribute of respect to Torconnier. The massive cross at the foot of his couch, all blazing with diamonds, flashed with a ghastly radiance over the scene of death, and the tall forms of monks gliding here and there in the funeral gloom, gave a ghastly sort of harmony to the sad scene.</p>
                  <p>Poor Viola, her slight girlish figure trembled like the silver aspen; she leaned upon young Tricolo near the tall jasper vase that a monarch had presented the gifted Torconnier; one of her white arms shining through its slight drapery of black, laid upon the embossed handle of the ornament, the other within that of Tricolo.</p>
                  <p>Her betrothed occasionally spoke to her soothingly, but his eyes were troubled, though tearless, and his manly heart swelled with this swollen grief. He of the few favored ones admitted into the great composer's presence, enjoyed most his confidence, understood best his wild, wayward genius. Early bereft of parents, the chance child of fortune, he cherished in Torconnier all the emotions of filial gratitude because he had indeed been as a father to him. And then did he not feel the gentle but more decided pressure of that fair arm? had not that little hand been laid within his own, by the doting uncle? and now, left as she was without father, mother, relatives; full of gentleness, guileless as innocence and beautiful as the light, was he not bound to stand before the altar with her—yes, even on the morrow, and take upon himself those vows which no strong power but that of death could sever.</p>
                  <p>Not such were the thoughts of Viola, her sorrowful glances were fixed on the still troubled face of the corpse. He had died in her presence, died raving mad—drunken with wine. She knew whatever the smooth-faced physician might say, that, to his last breath, he had raved the incoherent blasphemy of the inebriate, the sot; that he knew her not, though her fingers sometimes laid upon his burning temples—that he saw her not, though his starting eyeballs glaring with the red lustre of the maniac, roved meaningless from feature to feature of her beautiful face. And yet so accustomed was she to the sight of this ruby beverage, crowned with frothy pearls as it leaped from the sparkling champaign crystal, so often had she seen it upon the tables of the wealthy, so frequently had she herself sipped the juice of the grape, since she was a little child, that she comprehended not the true source of this great calamity, or very slimly felt that an excess of indulgence and that only, had been the ruin of her beloved uncle.</p>
                  <p>The grand funeral procession marched from the house of mourning in solemn state; it was conducted on an almost regal scale of splendor. Neither music nor mourners were wanting; the priests chanted, and the solemn line of monks, all belonging to the monastery where Torconnier had sometimes electrified thousands with his entrancing strains, swelled the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cortege</foreign> to an immense number, and gave an appearance of due solemnity to the occasion.</p>
                  <p>Viola returned to her desolate home; sobbing like a child, and throwing herself within the open arms of her old nurse, she half shrieked, half sobbed, "what friend have I now on earth, dear old Lara—oh! this terrible loneliness at my heart."</p>
                  <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5993-00000058"/>
                  <p>"Tricolo will take care of you now, my child, see—you distress him with your grief. Compose yourself, my darling, nay, he does not hear me, he is weeping over Master's baton—I can see his eyes are full of tears. Torconnier, your uncle—may his soul be at rest—has left you all this beautiful furniture. these magnificent rooms; Tricolo has wonderful genius, your uncle himself said that; he will yet be a leader; he will be famous; rich; ah! he will take care of you as if you were a queen. See, yonder; the poor youth is refreshing himself with wine; I do not wonder; he wishes to drive away his heavy thoughts."</p>
                  <p>Viola shuddered as she turned her gaze slowly towards him; the nurse's kindly meant consolation had not lifted an atom of the weight that crushed her spirit.</p>
                  <p>Before many months Viola wore the long bridal veil with its complement of orange blossoms, and her young face, though pale, gleamed bewitchingly sweet through the thick tresses of curling hair that fell heavily over her white neck and down to her jewelled waist. And there she spoke solemn words which one like her breathes not lightly, and from thence she moved, amid admiring multitudes, the bride of Tricolo, the matchless flutist of Torconnier's band. A home of splendor had been decorated for her; a deathless fame seemed awaiting the husband of her love, in the future. By degrees, the sad calamity that had befallen her assumed a softer shade, and though for a long while she mourned Torconnier, and looked through tears upon the many possessions which his touch had hallowed in her eyes, yet the sunny smile came back as of old, and she gradually forgot that she had ever felt so lonely and heartbroken, as when she left the ashes of the great composer in his last and lowly home.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>PART SECOND.</head>
                  <p>Bellonte, a citizen of Verona, noted for his benignity and deeds of benevolence, was hurrying along a narrow street, lighted here and there by the flames of candles in the shop-windows, whose gaudy red signs displayed a legion names of choice liquors.</p>
                  <p>A man stood near one of these villainous pits, whose master is the great prince of darkness, and peered so strangely, holding out his long thin neck at Bellonte, that he could not forbear pausing, and gazing into the cavernous eyes that met his own.</p>
                  <p>The stranger deliberately raised the slouching cap that kept his face in shadow, and speaking in a sepulchral tone, exclaimed, "how do you like the looks of a starving man, signor?"</p>
                  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Bellonte, falling back apace, for the horribleness of the countenance before him was too much for even his equilibrium, seldom though it was moved.</p>
                  <p>The eyes of the wretched man shone like a fitful fire, but they were deep, deep within his brain. His hair, intensely black, fell in unstudied waves over his threadbare coat collar, and his cheeks, whiter than parchment, were plastered in as it were to the very bone. Wild and ghastly, famished, yet awful, as if inside that pallid receptacle, a mighty and restless spirit struggled for release, looked that strange, yet truly, as he had said—starving face.</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible! can you want for food?"</p>
                  <p>"I could gnaw the verriest bone that ever a dog fought over in the street; but—but, sir—I would die sooner than tell you this, had I not a wife—a wife"—he articulated thickly,<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5993-00000059"/> and then his utterance was checked by tears. Bellonte had never so pitied a human creature. He drew nearer to him and smelt the fumes of wine upon his breath; he looked closer, and noticed the unmistakeable rim of flame around those tomb-like eyes, such as none but the Bacchanalian displays.</p>
                  <p>"You have had wine recently?" he said in a tone of inquiry.</p>
                  <p>"To-night, once. I snatched it from the very lips of my sick babe; it was a choice treasure, saved by my poor girl for the hour of need; but my tongue was swollen with starvation; my breath was leaving me and already sounded dry and rattling; away down my throat was Death, choking me; good heavens! I could not bear the thought of starving then, of falling dead at the feet of my wife—no, no; I prayed for strength to carry me from the house; and if I find no succour—to-morrow—" he made a fierce gesture passing his lean forefinger across his shrivelled cheek.</p>
                  <p>Bellonte shuddered. "My poor man;" he exclaimed, his heart deeply moved, "do not tempt God. Has he not sent me to your relief? Have faith in Him."</p>
                  <p>"Give my sick wife some nourishment, and then I will talk to you about faith. I only ask mercy when I feel to what depth of poverty I have brought her. But if you will go with me—no—no, trust me not with that"—he quickly added, as a piece of silver shone in the hand of the stranger, "go to her; give it to her; I have not the heart to ask it of her."</p>
                  <p>Bellonte, at one glance, comprehended the case; he threw the folds of his ample cloak around him, and motioning the sufferer to go forward, walked hurriedly after him.</p>
                  <p>In a still narrower and more filthy street, where balcony after balcony of the tall grey buildings overhung each other, like inverted terraces, until the old black walls nearly met away up in the gloomy space, lived this poor victim of his own base appetite. Flight after flight of broken and still crumbling stairs did the two men ascend, hearing on all sides noisy mirth and drunken revelry, till they had gained and entered the topmost apartment. A feeble little candle flickered upon the hearth, and close beside it, watching the face of her babe with the most agonizing earnestness, sat a young creature whose soft mournful eyes were floating in unshed tears, so that they flashed like diamonds in pearl setting, as they were raised, with sudden surprise, to the benevolent countenance of the stranger.</p>
                  <p>She, too, had the abundant and glossy locks of an Italian woman, and her rich, clear complexion was instantly suffused with a burning flush, as she glanced quickly around the wretched room, and then with almost a look of reproof, towards her husband.</p>
                  <p>In truth it was a most deserted and cheerless place, being a room of unusually large dimensions, containing not a particle of furniture beside a high-post bedstead without coverlid, and a low bench or table, perhaps used as both, against the wall from which latter hung remnants of diverse colored paper.</p>
                  <p>Closet there appeared to be none; there was no food in sight; the ember had long ago died out in the black fire-place, and that young creature, so beautiful, sitting wan and hopeless by the desolate hearth, completed the most affecting picture that Bellonte had ever beheld.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter with the babe?" he asked, in a low voice.</p>
                  <p>"Want of proper nourishment," exclaimed the father, abruptly; "he and that poor girl are dying by inches."</p>
                  <p>The woman moved her face towards the wall; large tears were streaming from her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Go and get whatever this will furnish;" exclaimed<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5993-00000060"/> Bellonte, placing a gold coin in the burning palm of the husband and father; "but—stop," he ejaculated rapidly, as the man turned away, "promise me—"</p>
                  <p>"I know what you would say," interrupted the other, almost haughtily; "but there is no need; yesterday I promised the Infinite—did I not, my Viola—that I would never again quaff the infernal poison; and perish this right arm if I keep not my oath," he muttered with clenched teeth; and the slight frame of the woman shuddered perceptibly, as again the large hot tears rolled unrestrained over her cheeks. "Stop!" exclaimed her husband, with energy, and hastening to a corner, he returned with something wrapt in green baize. Unrolling it, he displayed a magnificent flute with silver rims and keys, and curiously inlaid with crimson and violet pearl that ran in delicate vines from end to end. Kissing it reverently, he held it forth to the stranger, saying, as he did so, "take it as a pledge; never yet have I asked charity; I do not now. Take it—it is costly; the companion of my life; I have declared that nothing should separate us but death; but I cannot beg. Dear and loved relic of Torconnier, farewell; I will redeem it should my fortunes brighten;" and he held it out towards Bellonte.</p>
                  <p>"You mentioned Torconnier;" said the stranger, in a tone of inquiry, without assenting to his proposition; "is it the great composer, you speak of?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," answered the other, toying nervously with his flute, "but Torconnier is dead—perhaps you knew; his band did badly after his death; and, would you believe it, out of his twenty fine fellows, as most of them were, but one remains. You see him before you. Yes," and his voice grew low, "I am the last of Torconnier's band, and in a few little days, the sun will shine too upon my grave."</p>
                  <p>"Alberti!" exclaimed a voice in agonized accents, and before either could spring to her assistance, the fragile creature, the gentle wife, had fallen insensible upon the hard floor.</p>
                  <p>"My poor girl!" said Alberti, in a low tone, springing beside her; "you are starving, and I am mad thus to forget—oh! that we might both die. I, that have been a brute, have murdered you, my poor, poor lily—so pale—so deathly!" and a groan from the very depths of his spirit, told of anguish, mortal in the extreme, as he took both mother and child in his arms, and staggered with them to the wretched bed.</p>
                  <p>Bellonti hurried from the room; his steps were bent towards a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salon</foreign>, as he left the ricketty tenement; he ordered fresh viands and a basket full of delicacies, and, with a boy to carry them before him, returned to the suffering family of Tricolo the once eminent flutist. He found him still hanging over his wife, who had partially revived, lavishing the most passionate kisses upon her marble forehead. Tricolo started, as the food, varied and bountiful, was taken from the basket, and spread over the narrow table; his cheeks, his high temples, his very throat crimsoned; but mastering his pride, he snatched a delicate cake with which to tempt the appetite of the young mother, and held it to her lips.</p>
                  <p>"You will take my flute," he said rapidly, as Bellonte, assuring him that he would send him many comforts on the morrow, turned to depart.</p>
                  <p>"But I am no musician; I do not need it, and you do You are welcome, wholly welcome, to the favors I have show! you, and some time, not now, you can repay me."</p>
                  <p>"I insist that you <emph>must</emph> take the flute," exclaimed Tricolo, with energy springing to his feet; but Bellonte had already gone, and was hurriedly descending the stairs, aided here and there by the casual opening of some door, through which light streamed upon the broken staircase.</p>
                  <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5993-00000061"/>
                  <p>The following day, two hours before high noon, Bellonte, true to his promise, again visited the lodgings of Alberti Tricolo. Before he gained the door, he was astonished to hear loud voices as though a harsh and angry altercation were going on within. Entering, a terrible sight, truly, presented itself. The young wife, crouched in a corner, corpse-like and with distended eyeballs, was vainly striving to hush the moaning of the miserable babe. Two or three persons stood near the bed, and as they moved aside at Bellonte's wish, he saw that the unfortunate man was lashed, almost limb by limb, with strong cords to the bedstead. Tricolo, frothing at the mouth and making most unearthly noises, was now, the men assured the stranger, much calmer than he had been; still, for all their assertions, Bellonte instinctively shrank from the scene, and the yells were unlike anything he had heard before.</p>
                  <p>"He has gone mad," thought he to himself; "he is dangerous; he will burst his puny bonds;" but just then a half-whispered sentence, gave him a better light on the subject.</p>
                  <p>"I thought it would come to this," said one; "for three weeks drunk—drunk steadily—and for a week this has been advancing steadily. Delirium tremens, they call that complaint; that is what he has got, signor."</p>
                  <p>Suddenly, as Tricolo's blood-shot eyes rolled upon his benefactor, he ceased raving and became comparatively quiet. Bellonte's mild face seemed to act like a charm upon his bewildered senses, till by degrees he grew passive.</p>
                  <p>"Where is my flute? give me my flute," he whispered; "unbind my hands, and let me call forth its forgotten melodies for the last time; give me my flute;" he repeated, so plaintively, that the men turned to Bellonte, recognizing his superiority, and to their mute inquiry, he said, "give him his flute, poor fellow."</p>
                  <p>They unpinioned his arms, and Viola, grieved and careworn, came forward with the beautiful instrument, and as she timidly bent over her husband and placed it within his hands, she imprinted a kiss upon his hot forehead.</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, my poor, forgiving girl," exclaimed Tricolo, gratefully, "you will not be troubled with me long; take care of her, signor, she is a dear wife;" and as Viola retreated to the corner to weep unobserved, the musician, half reclining on his elbow, placed the flute to his lips, while the bystanders stood ready to seize him on any renewed act of violence.</p>
                  <p>"My fingers are strangers to it," he murmured, after running lightly through the scale; "yet 'tis the same flute; Torconnier loved it; it has swayed the impulses of an audience both divine and mortal; it has the tones of an angel—hear;" and again resuming an attitude, he broke out into a soft foreign melody, beautiful and impassioned, and performed with so much skill, that the strangers present gazed at each other, seemingly transported with pleasure. By degrees, a sort of inspiration came upon him; the tones grew wilder and leaped from the flute as from the silvery throat of a mocking-bird; they seemed to have flashed and penetrated the very soul of the listener; now dancing and sparkling, anon tumultuous and intermixed—flying from harmony to discord, and from discord to harmony with inconceivable rapidity. In the pathos, Tricolo would bow and bend, and sway his thin body from side to side, his eyes swimming in tears; in the <choice>
                        <sic>excution</sic>
                        <corr>execution</corr>
                     </choice> of the swifter passages, his brow flushed, his eyes were rigid, his whole frame trembled, the veins on his white hands, delicate as a woman's, swelled and grew purple; indeed, sitting on the wretched mattrass, his lean arms thrust through the wide sleeves of what had once been a rich dressing tunic, and to which some of the silken fringe yet adhered, his black wiry tresses falling in disorder down his<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5993-00000062"/> bony neck, his fingers quivering yet flying over the stops, he looked the personification of a fiend, striving to pour all his unhallowed passions into the thrilling language of melody.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly pausing, he blew a shrill, unearthly note, his brow gathered blackness, and his eyes shot fire, as he raised the flute high above his head, and with a yell of agony, dashed it against the opposite wall with such violence that it was broken into fragments.</p>
                  <p>"It has struck him," he yelled; clapping his hands with maniac triumph; "the blood streams and the wound gapes; let me at him and thrust him to perdition—" the arms of four strong men held him firm; they struggled with him, grappling as often as he with his giant strength shook them off again; but his frenzy gradually forsook him, and once more were the ropes crossed and recrossed above his slender body; in his exhaustion he resisted them not; and Bellonte, without striving to soothe the agonized wife, who stood sobbing aloud, motioned to one of the attendants to keep strict watch, and hurried away. When he returned, he came in a carriage with two men; they were ushered into the chamber of the wretched victim, and in a few moments more he was pinioned within a straight-jacket, and led down stairs, Bellonte, in the meantime, detaining the poor distracted wife, who implored, with piteous shrieks, to be allowed to follow her husband.</p>
                  <p>"He shall be well cared for, and you too;" he said—as finding her passionate entreaties useless, poor Viola had thrown herself upon her knee and was violently weeping; but the woman looked up with such a strange mixture of pride and dislike, glaring in her dark eyes, that the benevolent man was distressed; "I have aided her, I have done a most needful office for her husband," he thought, "and she evidently hates me.</p>
                  <p>"I leave here, in a few hours, for England;" at last he said, when Viola was more calm; "if you will, you shall have a home in my family, you and your child, till the recovery of your husband. To-morrow, if you are willing, I will send for you, and my servant will convey you to my residence; you should not distrust me, I wish to befriend you and save your husband."</p>
                  <p>In the morning a grand equipage rolled up before the frowning tenement, and Bellonte springing out, wended his way up to the forlorn room of the Tricolo's. It was empty; neither mother or child was there; the people in the next apartment had seen them go away the night before. Bellonte returned dissatisfied to his carriage, near which some curious tenants of the old house had crowded.</p>
                  <p>"It is useless to wait!" he exclaimed to the driver, "drive to the quay, I must lose no more time; tell the family when you return that the bird has flown."</p>
               </div>

                  <head>PART THIRD.</head>
                  <p>Five years had gone; Bellonte was becoming an old man; his abundant locks were tinged with grey, yet his forehead was smooth, for a peaceful life, a clear conscience, and temperate habits, seldom indent a man's brow with wrinkles. He had sojourned two years in America; and, since then, he had heard no tidings of the last of Torconnier's band, except that he was discharged from the hospital, cured of his malady, but wretchedly thin and dispirited. Time banished the trio from his mind though his benevolence was more active than ever, and he was always bestowing charity upon some needy recipient.</p>
                  <p>On his sixty-seventh birth-day, all his family met together as usual, to celebrate the occasion. They were assembled in the beautiful parlors of Signor Bellonte; the young and the lovely and the gay were there—wit, mirth, music and dancing had alternately engaged the happy company, till it was now near the midnight hour. All had grown still and thoughtful—lovers whispered together, as they sat in the wide nooks that shielded them from prying observation; and of the older persons some were serious, some sleepy.</p>
                  <p>On a sudden, when each one thought of whispering a happy "good night," a tone of tremulous music floated on the breeze—unearthly and heavenly. Purer and stronger it arose, the clear, soft music of a flute; and so much did each one fear to break the sweet illusion than an angel filled the midnight air with melody, that no one stirred until two very beautiful airs had been played entirely through.</p>
                  <p>Then a murmur arose—who could it be? Several ran to the window as the music ceased, but only in time to behold an elegant carriage start from before the mansion, and move rapidly away.</p>
                  <p>Every tongue was busy with conjecture, save Bellonte's, he alone was silent, revolving anxious thoughts in his mind; anxious yet pleasing, and perhaps, too, somewhat perplexing—but he kept his own council.</p>
                  <p>The next afternoon, Bellonte and his two nieces were riding in a volante; the weather was peculiarly charming, and the ladies, more pleased than otherwise at the attention their very beautiful faces attracted, persuaded the old gentleman to drive slowly through the avenue that led directly on the suburbs. They had just reached an extremely elegant cottage, whose grounds were laid out with such faultless taste, that they paused to admire them. The girls broke out with exclamations, commenting on this and the other rare flower, when a sound that thrilled them to their innermost being, surprised them into silence. As if entranced they sat there, while a <choice>
                        <sic>wierd</sic>
                        <corr>weird</corr>
                     </choice> and singular melody issued from behind the Venetian blind; a flute solo, so magical that the youngest niece declared it to be the production of no human effort.</p>
                  <p>"Hark!" said Bellonte suddenly, "I recognize that—it is so distinct, I shudder—I remember the night"—he continued, half speaking to himself, while the young girls looked at him in astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"We will get out here," he said, abruptly, and leaping to the ground—he assisted his wondering nieces to alight.</p>
                  <p>A little rosy cheeked girl with a happy round face, and laughing black eyes, answered to his impatient knock. Who should he ask for?</p>
                  <p>"Do you want to see papa?" asked the little fairy, "he told me to let you come in;" and leading the way, she threw open the door of a beautiful little study, ushering them into the presence of her father.</p>
                  <p>"Is it you? Tricolo," and "Signor Bellonte I am overpowered;" both simultaneously exclaimed, as each sprang forward.</p>
                  <p>"I am happy beyond measure to behold you thus," said Bellonte with unusual animation; "your wife—"</p>
                  <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5993-00000064"/>
                  <p>"Is here;" answered Tricolo, with a proud smile, as Viola, lovely as ever, and with a sweet dignity, entered at that moment, followed by a noble little fellow, and the child who had met them at the door.</p>
                  <p>Frankly smiling, she advanced towards Bellonte, and exclaimed,</p>
                  <p>"How much do we owe you; thanks my good benefactor, it is you that have saved us and restored us to happiness; my little son, and you Viola, this is the good gentleman we have taught you to pray for."</p>
                  <p>"The generous man was affected almost to tears; but half smiling he replied, "I hardly see how I have been of this very essential service, since you so cunningly eluded me and my family when we have attempted to find you, in order to learn how you were prospering."</p>
                  <p>"Be seated, sir," said Tricolo, "with these young ladies."</p>
                  <p>"My nieces, sir; and let me add that they paid you a high compliment; declaring that no mortal power called forth the strains to which they have just listened."</p>
                  <p>Tricolo's face grew red, and he looked grateful: "I have much praise in public," he said, "because I am popular; but when commendation is given impulsively, and from such a source, I am always happy. My little boy, or my little girl sometimes say, 'Oh you do make such sweet music papa;' it is better Signor, than showers of ducats, it is so fresh, so real."</p>
                  <p>"We think them good judges," said Viola, smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Excellent;" exclaimed her husband; "my boy there, plays even now upon this difficult flute; it is my highest ambition that he shall be a second Torconnier. But I must tell you my story Signor; I left the hospital whither I was carried that dreadful night, in company with my wife who had lived concealed, near me. I was weak and penniless; Viola too looked languid, our child was still sick. I knew not what to do—where to get food; we had already taxed too much the purse of poor old Zara, once the nurse of my wife, with whom we were residing for a time. Each morning I felt less inclination for life; my wife smiled in vain; how humiliating the feeling, that I, a man—an Italian, was dependant upon the bounty of a faithful old servant. The thought distracted me; I sat one night weeping inwardly; I was too proud to show my tears; my wife had just said, "surely if you do right, something good will happen," when the door opened, and in walked Zelda; Claude Zelda, the superintendent, whom I had often seen at the hospital. He came straight up to the table, and I know not why, but in a moment my heart was light.</p>
                  <p>"I have been absent from my post, the last week," he said, "else before you came away, I should have delivered you a message left by Signor Bellonte, to this effect; that you should use this purse of gold; consider it as a loan, and pay it back whenever you shall be able."</p>
                  <p>"The good man went out, leaving me in bewilderment; I doubted the evidence of my senses; I drew the purse towards me, and pushed it back again twenty times; but my Viola came and laid her head upon my shoulder; that restored me to recollection. If you had seen me then, signor, you would have thought me delirious in reality; I felt free; a man once more; I was elated beyond reason; I danced around the room, <choice>
                        <sic>draging</sic>
                        <corr>dragging</corr>
                     </choice> Viola after me; I laughed and shouted; I could scarcely contain myself for happiness."</p>
                  <p>"Now, my wife," said I, as soon as I could command my faculties, "here we are, placed once more above want, thanks to our benefactor: I have three things to do which are imperative; the first is, not a particle of this gold shall be expended for that fire-liquid which has proved almost my undoing; the<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5993-00000065"/> second, I will buy a good flute to-morrow; the third, you shall go in the country and drink plenty of milk, you and the boy, till you are healthy again."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! signor, how can I repay you? I went forth into the world; they crowded again in my path; they clamored for my music. I had some choice pupils who paid me well; I have tasted not a drop of wine since; my concerts have brought me a fortune, and signor, here is your purse—the same amount is there; take it, and make some other poor heart rejoice as mine does now."</p>
                  <p>"I will accept it," said Bellonte, with quivering lip, "because I know the delicacy of a noble heart; but—I—I am overcome with delight—I really know not what to say; young man you have done bravely; I thank God that it is so good to help His creatures."</p>
                  <p>The evening was near; Bellonte and his nieces prepared to depart, after exchanging mutual kind wishes. The latter had fallen in love with the amiable and beautiful Viola, and they were lavish in her praise long after they reached home. There the story was told, and the unknown flutist of the birth-night recognized.</p>
                  <p>The following day, a parcel was delivered into the hands of Tricolo, by a servant in livery; it was one of the costliest flutes that could be purchased in Verona, adorned with pearls and gems; and inscribed on a delicate plate of pure gold were the words: "To the son of Tricolo the flutist—may he be Torconnier the Second."</p>
                  <p>And now I have only to say, that for many years the citizens of Verona boasted that there had been raised in their midst so glorious a genius as young Alberti Tricolo, and so good and virtuous a musician as the great flutist, THE LAST OF TORCONNIER'S BAND.</p>

                  <l>Of the ruin that's wrought by dread Alcohol's sting;</l>
                  <l>For I feel in my soul that there lurks in the bowl</l>
                  <l>A foul demon of evil, that few can control.</l>
                  <l>And I've seen how he fills human hearts with his ills,</l>
                  <l>How he slaughters their hopes—how he mangles and kills!</l>
                  <l>All alone, all alone, a poor widow I've known,</l>
                  <l>On the cold icy breast of this selfish world thrown;</l>
                  <l>All alone with her fears, and alone in her tears,</l>
                  <l>And alone with the grief and the anguish of years:</l>
                  <l>For a father, a son, and husband had run</l>
                  <l>A quick race to disgrace, and were slain one by one.</l>
                  <l>Yes, they drank till they sank where their life was a blank,</l>
                  <l>Or was worse, was a curse—and now whom could she thank!</l>
                  <l>Oh! 'twas Brandy and Gin that had won them to sin,</l>
                  <l>And that scooped out their graves and then hurried them in;</l>
                  <l>That had burnt their foul stain on the heart and the brain,</l>
                  <l>And had made all their living far worse than in vain;</l>
                  <l>That had filled her with gloom, and had stolen the bloom</l>
                  <l>From her cheek till she seem'd but a form from the tomb.</l>
                  <l>It were well I could throw into language the woe</l>

                  <l>Upon pillows of torture, tormented by foes;</l>
                  <l>And who weep in their sleep, as the huge serpents creep</l>

                  <l>And in dreams lift them high, very nigh to the sky,</l>
                  <l>And then dash them and crush them and leave them to lie</l>
                  <l>Pale and mangled and bleeding, the foul vultures' prey,</l>
                  <l>That in screams of delight sing their joy at the sight</l>
                  <l>Of a prize they may slay, and may feed on by day,</l>

                  <l>Of the ocean of evils—and are but a link</l>
                  <l>Of the chain that has bound in its cold cruel coil</l>
                  <l>Human hearts without number, and made them its spoil.</l>
                  <l>Oh, but words are too feeble—they feel it—they blush</l>
                  <l>To describe such a monster, that lives but to crush</l>
                  <l>With the heel of a tyrant—the heart of a fiend!</l>
                  <l>That from blood and from slaughter was never yet weaned.</l>
                  <l>But I turn from the task, and I yield with a sigh,</l>
                  <l>Yet I pray that the day that will slay him is nigh:</l>
                  <l>I will lift up my voice with thanksgiving and shout</l>

               <head>A COUNTRY RECOLLECTION, OR, THE REFORMED INEBRIATE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY MRS. E. F. ELLET.</head>
               <p>IT is many years since I was in a certain neighborhood among the mountains of New Jersey, where the richest cultivation enhances the beauty of scenery unusually fine, though not wild or bold enough for sublimity. It was a valley somewhat extensive, bordered on the south by abrupt and very high hills, wooded to their summit; except a small strip of cultivated land near their base, and terminating on the north side in sloping uplands covered with the wealth of harvest. A quiet stream murmured through the meadows, now narrowed between high banks, now expanding into a lakelet, near which stood a flour-mill. The house where I passed some days, at this time, had lawns sloping down to the stream; and I remember there flourished three large drooping willows, which I hoped might always escape the axe, and grow old, as guardians of the crystal waters. Their exact locality was fixed in my memory by the circumstance, that over their tops might be seen a cottage, situated on the side of the mountain, just in the verge of the woods, and about half a mile distant. The loneliness of its situation gave it something of romance; and I observed then,<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5993-00000067"/> that what had once been a garden was choaked with tall weeds and briers, and that a rude screen of boards had been built directly in front of the cottage, so as to shut out all view of the neighboring dwellings. This strange precaution seemed misanthropical; or, was it adopted for the purpose of concealing from curious eyes what might pass within door? To my inquiry who occupied that hermit's hut, the reply was "Walter B—."</p>
               <p>"The B— who married Jane S—?"</p>
               <p>"The same."</p>
               <p>Her name called up distant recollections. I had seen Miss S. once at a rustic ball. She was a country beauty; rather better educated than most of the damsels who were her companions. Indeed, her father used to complain that she spent too much time in reading. His idea was, that after a girl had left school, and completed her education, she had nothing more to do with books. But he rarely interfered except by a little grumbling, with her pursuits, especially as his house was always in the best order and his dinners excellent. Jane was a choice housekeeper, and her leisure hours she spent as pleased herself—not heeding her father's ominous shake of the head, when he saw her earnestly devouring a book, or noticed the shelves filled with books in her little chamber. "She will leave off such follies when she marries," was his consolatory remark; and in truth, when the indulged girl did marry, whether she gave up her reading or not, she did not suffer it to interfere with her household duties. She was the most exemplary wife and mother in the country; and all her neighbors predicted happiness from her union with young B. His father had left him a small farm, well stocked, with a house large enough for comfort and even elegance; and few men began life with better prospects of contentment. Walter was active and ambitious, and wanted to secure something more than a competency for old age. My acquaintance with the young couple had left them thus, and I was naturally somewhat <choice>
                     <sic>suprised</sic>
                     <corr>surprised</corr>
                  </choice> to find them living in a home of so little pretension.</p>
               <p>"The only marvel about it," said the friend to whom I expressed my wonder, "is, that they have a home at all. When Walter took to drink, his stock went first, and then his farm was neglected, till at last, when sold to pay his debts it brought less than half its value."</p>
               <p>Alas! it was the common story of the intemperate man; first moderate indulgence in frequent convivial meetings with his friends; then occasional excess that unfitted him for work for days, during which time he would vow and resolve and pledge his word to his wife that each should be the last, followed by more frequent returnings to the same excess, till the doom of the victim was sealed, and the very friends who had led him into vice abandoned him in disgust.</p>
               <p>Since the desertion of his boon companions, Walter had become gloomy and sullen; a mood which, under the excitement he now every day sought, gave place to a wild and savage ferocity. The little children ran from him if they saw him on the road; and it was rumored that his wretched home too frequently witnessed his cruel brutality toward his unoffending wife. But he soon removed to this retired cottage on the mountain, and the screen of boards he built, effectually excluded all observation.</p>
               <p>I listened to this melancholy history with the deepest sympathy for the unfortunate girl, now a helpless mother. She had sought no assistance from the neighbors, and few visited her, partly because they dreaded her husband, partly because she herself did not encourage them. But some compassionate persons sent her provisions from time to time.</p>
               <p>While I looked at the little dwelling which was now the<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5993-00000068"/> scene of so much misery, with an aching heart for the countless victims of this dreadful vice, a bright flash suddenly shot up from the roof of the hut, while at the same time a volume of smoke poured from the chimney and upper windows. At the same moment a female figure rushed from behind the screen before mentioned, clasping an infant to her breast, and dragging along a child of about four years of age, and rapidly descended the slope of the mountain. Not many paces behind, her husband followed, calling upon her with shouts and execrations to return; but his evident intoxication rendered it impossible for him to equal the speed of his flying wife; and well was it for her, for a large knife was in his hand, which he brandished with frightful menaces. In less time than it would take to narrate what passed, several of the neighbors had run to meet her. Just as she reached the stream, through which she rushed with both children in her arms, then sank exhausted on the bank, they crowded round her with eager offers of assistance.</p>
               <p>B. now came up, heedless of the men and women who regarded him with looks of fear and horror. He had dropped the knife, but had not changed his threatening tone; and with shocking imprecations he ordered his wife to "get up, and come home this instant." The poor woman uttered no reply, indeed she was hardly capable of speech; but the miller, a sturdy man, answered for her that she should go no more to the home of a villain who had nearly killed her. These words provoked B. to unbounded fury; he rushed upon the man who had spoken them, with such violence as to throw him off his guard, and would have strangled him but for the interference of others. When he found himself overpowered by superior strength, he revenged himself by the most fearful curses, vented especially on his poor wife, whom again, with abusive epithets, he ordered to go home, and not expose herself in this ridiculous manner.</p>
               <p>"No, Walter," said his wife, rising at last, and confronting him with pale but determined face; "no—I will <emph>not</emph> return to you. I could have borne, as I have long done, your harshness and violence towards me, but you have this day raised your hand against the lives of these children; and, as it is my duty before God to protect <emph>them</emph>, I leave you for ever!"</p>
               <p>Whatever reply the drunkard might have made, it was drowned in the indignant clamors of the by-standers, and he was dragged off to gaol. His wife was cared for by her sympathizing female acquaintance, and soon provided with a permanent situation, where, by the labor of her hands, she could support herself and her little ones. And soon, very soon, did her changed appearance bear witness to the improvement. She became contented and even cheerful; and the playful caresses of her children beguiled her of many sad thoughts.</p>
               <p>When B. awoke from his intoxication in prison, the recollection of what he had done overwhelmed him with shame and remorse. He sent for one of his neighbors, and entreated him to go, on his part, to his injured wife, supplicate her forgiveness, and pledge the most solemn promises of future amendment. Jane wept much; she forgave him from her heart, as she prayed God he might be forgiven; but she could not, dared not trust his oft-violated word, and sacrifice her children. Her determination was fixed; and for weeks together, though with a bleeding heart, she returned the same answer to the entreaties of her repentant husband, she dared not even see him lest her resolution might be shaken.</p>
               <p>When at last B. was discharged from gaol, full of indignation at what he termed the cruel obstinacy of his wife, he made no effort to see her or the children; but—after shutting himself up a month or two in the cottage, which had been saved, by timely attention, from being burned the night of Jane's escape—<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5993-00000069"/> he departed, none knew whither. He left a reproachful letter to his wife, professing himself driven to desperation by her desertion, and laying on her the blame of his future crimes. No furniture of any value was found in the house, the greater part having been disposed of to procure food and—liquor.</p>
               <p>Two years after this occurrence, (I have the particulars from a friend,) a crowd was assembled round the gaol in the little town of —. A murder, under the most appalling circumstances, had been committed in the neighborhood; a man to whom suspicion attached had been arrested, and after strict examination committed for trial. Particulars that had transpired, left no doubt of his guilt on the minds of the people; and it was with suppressed execrations that the multitude followed the suspected felon to prison. When he disappeared from their sight within the gloomy walls, the popular rage broke out in groans and murmurs. One woman, young and interesting in appearance, who had listened with undisguised eagerness to a knot of idlers discussing the case, walked away when they ended their conference, and presenting herself at the door of the magistrate, who had conducted the examination, asked leave to speak with him. It was the wife of B. She had seen her husband led to gaol, loaded with the most terrible suspicions, and she came to have her worst fears allayed or confirmed.</p>
               <p>The magistrate soothed her by assuring her that the evidence against B., though strong, was only circumstantial, and by no means absolutely proved his guilt. It was impossible to say what might be the event of the trial; but there was ground for hope. Poor Jane clung to this hope. "Oh, sir," sobbed she, "if he is guilty and must die, it is I who have murdered him! I deserted him, when all the world cast him out!"</p>
               <p>When the unhappy wife returned home it was to give way to the bitter anguish of remorse; to weep and sob all night as if her heart would break. "How have I been able to kneel, night and morning, to ask pardon of God," she cried to herself, "when I refused my aid to save a fellow-being from destruction!" And yet—these little ones—and she hung over her sleeping children; the fair boy, with bright cheek, shaded by his clustering curls; and the sweet dark-eyed girl, so like him, before excess had marred his manly beauty! <emph>Could</emph> she have brought these innocent ones into wretchedness; perhaps guilt? Had she not done right to snatch them from ruin, even by abandoning their father? She knelt once more, and prayed for guidance, for discernment of the right; and her mind was calmed.</p>
               <p>The next day before noon, the gaol was again visited by groups of idlers, gazing into the window of B.'s cell, which looked upon the street. It might be that the prisoner was maddened by their taunts and derision; he was leaping about with frantic gestures, clapping his hands and laughing immoderately, or thrusting his face between the bars to grin defiance at his tormentors. Suddenly a woman, her face concealed by a drooping bonnet and thick veil, glided through the crowd, and reaching up to the window offered a parcel to the prisoner. He grasped it eagerly, with a wistful look, but the woman did not stay to be recognised. It was observed, as she hastened away that her steps tottered, and she held down her head apparently overcome by emotion. Well might the fearfully changed countenance of the accused appal one who had known him in better days!</p>
               <p>The parcel contained a portion of food more palatable than is usually allowed to prisoners, and a small pocket Bible—the book B. had once prized—the gift of his dying mother. His name was written on the first page in her hand. Many times<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5993-00000070"/> in the week, always at dusk, did the same compassionate visitor stand at the grated window, and offer food or books to the prisoner, who was evidently affected by the kind attention. He ceased his idiotic dancing and laughing; he answered nothing more to the upbraidings of vagrants without, and those who looked into his window saw him most frequently seated quietly at the table reading, or with his head on his hand in deep thought. With thankfulness unspeakable, Jane saw this change; but her joy was dashed with sadness, when on one of her visits the prisoner besought her, with piteous entreaty, to bring him a bottle of brandy.</p>
               <p>It now occurred to the wife to do what she had never dared, when B. was at home, to force on his perusal some tracts containing the most awful warnings against intemperance, and encouragements to the victim to struggle for recovery. He had no other books to beguile the time; he could not now as formerly, rail at or punish her, even had he any suspicion who she was; <emph>what</emph> might ensue if he read them? Her effort was crowned with success. Not a week had passed, when the abject entreaty for liquor, which had been urged night after night, was dropped, to be renewed no more. Jane's heart throbbed when she thought of this; but alas! even if he were really reformed, would he live to prove himself so?</p>
               <p>Thus days rolled on, and the time for the trial arrived. The prisoner had communicated with his counsel; witnesses had been sent for; the principal lawyer engaged in the prosecution had unfolded the chain of evidence by which his guilt was to be proved; the court was to open next morning. The accused had received some of his former acquaintance during the day, and as night drew near he was alone. On his table lay a letter which he had just written; he was pacing the room, tranquil, but with mind filled with painful thoughts. The gaoler opened the door, announced a name, received the prisoner's startled assent; and the next moment the long estranged husband and wife were together. B. did not stir; he was petrified by surprise; but Jane rushed to him; her arms were round his neck, and she wept aloud. Her husband was moved, but struggled apparently with his pride; he unclasped her arms, stepped back a little, and looked earnestly at her.</p>
               <p>Sad, indeed, the contrast between the two; the man almost spectral in aspect, haggard, wan, emaciated—not even the shadow of his former self; the woman blooming in the freshness of almost maiden beauty: no unhallowed vigils, or excess, or evil passions, had stamped their traces on <emph>her</emph> brow, or marred the symmetry of her form, and the very purity and tenderness that shone in her expression, rebuked the conscious sinner as loudly as if an angel's tongue had proclaimed his degradation! As he shrank back, and stood thus silent, Jane stretched out her hands beseechingly; "Oh, Walter!" she cried, "have you not yet forgiven me?"</p>
               <p>"Forgive you, Jane? Oh, Heaven! what a wretch am I!"</p>
               <p>"I was wrong, Walter, to desert you, even at the worst; but oh! say you do not bear hard thoughts towards me!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Jane, is it you who brought me these?" pointing to the books.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Walter; for I thought you would read them now—and—"</p>
               <p>She was interrupted by the sobs of her husband; he sank on his knees as if to thank her, but to prevent that, she knelt with him, and prayed for him in the deep emotion of her heart.</p>
               <p>When B. was sufficiently calm, he asked after his children, and, pointing to the table, said: "There, Jane, is a letter I had written you, in a better spirit, I trust, than the last. If it were<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5993-00000071"/> God's will I should live longer, I might make a better husband and father; but I dare not think of that now."</p>
               <p>Jane longed to ask one question, but her tongue refused to utter the words. Her husband seemed to read the meaning of her anxious look.</p>
               <p>"Before high Heaven," said he, "I declare to you that I am innocent of the crime for which I shall be tried to-morrow."</p>
               <p>A shriek of joy, scarce suppressed, burst from the wife; she clasped her hands and raised them upwards; gratitude denied her speech.</p>
               <p>"Then you will live"—she gasped at length.</p>
               <p>"No—Jane—I dare not hope it; and I deserve to die. I am guiltless of murder, but what have I been to you and my children? What have I been these last years? a reckless outcast—my own destroyer—the enemy of God! I tell you, Jane, I have long looked to the gallows as the end of my career, and I have come to it at last! But I have mastered the tyrant that brought me to this; yes, I have!" He laughed convulsively as he said this, and his wife turned pale. "Look here, Jane—look here!" and lifting up the coverlet of his bed, he produced several bottles of brandy and whiskey. They were <emph>full</emph>.</p>
               <p>"I asked you to give me liquor," he continued, "and you would not; but others, less merciful, brought these to me! Do not shudder and grow so pale, Jane; I swear to you, I have not tasted one drop, though I have had them a fortnight! Those books saved me; for I read of even worse cases than mine. I took an oath, Jane, on the Bible you brought me the first night, my mother's Bible, that I would never taste liquor again. And I have these, to try if I <emph>could</emph> keep my resolution."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Walter!" was all the sobbing wife could say; but her tears were those of joy.</p>
               <p>"You know, Jane, I was always fond of books, and if I had not been a slave to drink, I have been fit society even for the judges who are to try me to-morrow. Oh, if I could only live my life over! But it is too late now, yet it is something—is it not," and his pale face kindled, "to think that I <emph>can</emph>, that I <emph>have</emph> overcome the fiend at last! <emph>That I shall not die a drunkard!</emph> Remember that, and let everybody know it; I have it written here in your letter. God will remember it, will he not, when my soul stands before him in judgment."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my husband, you shall not die!" cried the wife, as with streaming tears, she clasped him again to her arms.</p>
               <p>"The will of God be done; and that I can say now sincerely; I am willing to go. The Bible says no drunkard shall enter His kingdom; but I am <emph>not</emph> a drunkard! I am a degraded wretch, an outcast of men, about to die a felon's death; but I feel a triumph, Jane, a joy unspeakable, that I have conquered my worst enemy. I thank God that he has supported me through the struggle. It was a terrible one!"</p>
               <p>I need not at length record this interview; I need say no more than that, after weeks of the most agonizing suspense and anxiety, Jane had the happiness to hear that her husband was fully acquitted of the crime laid to his charge; to receive him once more and welcome him to a home.</p>
               <p>For months he lay helpless, the victim of a wasting sickness; but his wife worked day and night to procure him comforts, and her children played round his bed, and in her was what the poet sweetly terms, "a hymn of thankfulness," never silent. When he recovered, he found it not hard to bear her company in her cheerful toil, and never would he suffer himself<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5993-00000072"/> self to be persuaded to touch what once had proved his bane, and so nearly brought him to an ignominious end.</p>
               <p>It is not long since I heard an address of touching eloquence, on the subject of Temperance, delivered by Walter B. There was truth in every word of it, for he deeply felt what he uttered; and it came home to many a heart, and drew tears from many an eye. He told his own history, and described himself as once the most wretched and lost among the victims of that vice, and yet there had been others more lost than he, who recovered. It was this, he said, that first inspired him with hope for himself.</p>

               <head>THE DYING HUSBAND.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY WILL. WILLOWILL.</head>
               <p>YOUR husband, while yet young, begins to fade and wither like the rich fig-tree <unclear>in</unclear> whose boughs the hot air of Etna's lungs has been <unclear>fiercely</unclear> breathed. You see him helpless on the snowy couch your own hands have smoothed a hundred times, and he is writhing with strong pain. When he looks on you with his red, fiery eyes, he laughs satirically, and hisses you from his presence, saying you are a stranger.</p>
               <p>Your physician comes again, and you bid your failing heart hope afresh, against the evil to come, through the man of the healing drugs and elaborate skill.</p>
               <p>He ministers unto his wants, but your husband grows wilder and worse. A tear fills your eye—both of them, until the white curtains about the bed look dim, and just as you never saw them before. Your eye is so full of a big tear, that burns you so hotly that nothing looks natural to you, not even your sleeping baby in its crib; and a strange wildness whirls through your bewildered brain, until you wish in your soul you were resting beside your mother in the churchyard.</p>
               <p>Your husband grows constantly worse; a wilder glare lights up his distorted countenance; new features arrange themselves, one by one, until you can scarcely believe it is the husband of your youth whom you loved like a wife.</p>
               <p>The attendants walk stealthily around the couch on silent tiptoe, as if fearful of startling the spirits that you feel certain tain must be whirling in invisible circles through the mysterious room.</p>
               <p>You hear a vague, indistinct whisper, passing one from another, and you wonder at its meaning.</p>
               <p>The tall candle, on the little stand your mother gave you, burns brightly enough, but a dim, mist-like halo surrounds it, so full is your eye with big tears, and so flooded your lashes with its waters.</p>
               <p>You try to read the thought of your physician, who stands gravely at the head of the couch, with his hand on your husband's brow, that you know must be throbbing with pain.</p>
               <p>You bend over your husband, to see if he will not recognize you, but he does not, and a glassy film is gathering its cold cloud in his eye.</p>
               <p>Your ear catches the whisper of your physician, and it brings you tidings of terror. For a moment, or more, you forget your being. The physician has said, "<hi rend="i"/>He is passing away!"</p>
               <p>And the husband you loved so wildly, like a faithful wife, has grown, ere you thought it, cold as ice, and you scream when you lay your hand on his cold brow, that is damp with the death-dew, and you wish in your soul that you too were dead, that you might rest with him and your mother where the cypress and the yew tree wave their sleepy branches.</p>
               <p>And a motherly-like old lady, with her soft gray hair nicely braided under a delicate snowy cap, your good old aunt, acts like a mother towards you now, and takes you by the hand, leading you weeping away. And she sits down with you, away in another part of the house, with your hand in hers, and tries to console and comfort you with kind words, and tells you to hope your husband is in heaven. And you<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5993-00000074"/> wonder how your aunt can talk so strangely about comfort for you refuse to be comforted, like Rachel, because your husband is not.</p>
               <p>And you hear the busy shuffle of many feet on the floor—the comers and goers. You wonder why such goeth on in your house; your aunt anticipates your thoughts, and she whispers solemnly, "They are preparing to put him away!"</p>
               <p>Your aunt, who has become your protectress, asks you if you want to see him again, and you arise to follow her, leaning on her arm. She leads you to the death-chamber, and the attendants give way on either side to let you pass. A nicely polished coffin sits by the bed where your husband died; the coffin is polished until it shines like glass, and its fragrant varnish fills the room. And the undertaker is there, gliding around the coffin as quiet as you could wish, feeling proud in his heart of the nice coffin his skill has polished for your husband to rest in. He cautiously brushes the little motes of dust from the shining boards, and you feel grateful towards him because he is so nice, and his solemn face tells you he deeply sympathizes with your sorrow.</p>
               <p>And your husband is straitened and stiff in the narrow coffin, shrouded with clean white linen, that rustles like dry leaves in the autumn wind, as your aunt lays back the folds that conceal your husband's cold, pallid face, and his lifeless, glassy eyes.</p>
               <p>And your soul grows full of bitter anguish as you gaze through your helpless tears, and your aunt leads you, weeping as you are, away from the sad, sad spectacle, while you wish in your soul that you too were dead.</p>
               <p>And they lead you to a new-made grave among the same tombs in the old churchyard where you wandered when you were a little girl, reading the inscriptions on the grave-stones scarce knowing what they meant. And you stand above the new grave that is yet tenantless, and, like Esau, with tears in your eyes, you weep painfully until your poor heart grows so heavy that you feel sure your bosom will burst.</p>
               <p>And you see strong men ease the smooth, varnished coffin, with its tenant, in its narrow home into the earth, and you follow it with your eyes down, down to where it rests, and your tears go with it!</p>
               <p>And you kneel there, near the spot where your kind mother has been sleeping for years in death's embrace, and you weep as you never wept before, and wish in your soul that you too might die and be with them. If in this terrible moment, when the heart struggles, should there come upon you like the rushing of a mighty wind this sad reflection to your sorrowing soul: <emph>By my influence the cup of Death and Drunkenness was pressed to his lips; but for me he might have lived the joy and comfort of his house!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Sister! Sister, if this be thy reward how the deep, damp grave beneath the yew-tree will reprove thee! How the hollow, dismal knock of the valley clod on the smooth coffin boards as it greets its brother dust, and calls the little worm to its filthy feast, will echo the shrieking cry of <emph>Remorse!</emph> REMORSE!! in the aching chambers of thy wretched heart! Remorse will seize you as the strong eagle does its prey. Remorse! oh, remorse! Can you paraphrase the terrible word? The great Randolph of Roanoke could not, and can you—YOU?</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE CHRISTMAS SUPPER.</head>
                  <p>PELEG.—A homely name for a homely boy, but a boy as good as he was homely. Peleg Brown, or as the school boys tauntingly called him, because his complexion was nearly the color of a hazel nut, Brown Peleg, was the only son of a worse than widowed woman, who lived in an humble cottage on the outskirts of a village situated upon the romantic stream, Kishacoquillas, a Pennsylvania tributary to the noble Juniata.</p>
                  <p>Peleg's mother, one of those gentle women, who seem only able to hold life in its sunshine aspects, but whose experience is an evidence that they have latent strength for cloud and storm, was worse than widowed, because her husband, John Brown, had, for several years, been a confirmed drunkard, dependent upon the efforts of his gentle wife and feeble son for his food, raiment and shelter, as well as for the means, obtained through force and stealth, by which he purchased, at the village grog-shop, the numerous drams that rendered his wife a creature of sorrow, and his son a youth shunned and forsaken by the boys of his age.</p>
                  <p>It was Christmas—a holiday to most boys—but a day of labor to Peleg Brown. With his saw-buck upon his shoulder and his wood-saw under his arm, Peleg trudged through the snow, from one house to another, seeking a job. A pile of wood in front of the mansion of one of the wealthiest men of the village attracted his attention, and he begged the privilege of sawing it into proper stove-lengths. He was told that he might carry it into the back-yard, saw it, and pile it in the wood-house. It was a good job, Peleg was a small boy, but he thought how many comforts he might buy his mother with the money the job would bring him, and, with a cheerful heart, and a willing hand, he went to work. Noon came and he sat down on his saw-buck to eat his frugal Christmas dinner. It was a blustering day, and the snow, whirled from the tops of the houses, fell upon Peleg, until he looked as if he were a miller's apprentice, but he heeded not the snow or the cold, and was hurrying with his repast, that he might have the more time to work, when he found himself face to face, with a handsome, well dressed boy, about his own age, but of much larger size, who said to him:</p>
                  <p>"Halloa, little fellow, how much did you have to spend for Christmas?"</p>
                  <p>"I had nothing, sir," honestly answered Peleg, somewhat<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5993-00000081"/> astonished at the abrupt question, "but if I work well to-day, mother will make me a nice pie when I go home."</p>
                  <p>"Ha, ha," cried the well dressed boy—"work on a Christmas and get a <emph>nice</emph> pie for it. You're a little unfortunate. Where <emph>do</emph> you live?"</p>
                  <p>This was said with an air, as if the speaker regarded Peleg a curiosity; but Peleg was too honest to notice such irony, and he answered frankly.</p>
                  <p>"I live in the little house back of the church on the common."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! ho! then, you're the son of drunken Brown. No wonder you don't have any money to spend on Christmas. <emph>I</emph> had three dollars—<emph>my</emph> father ain't a drunkard."</p>
                  <p>Peleg was hurt—sorely hurt—but he thought of his mother and uttered no retort. He made his saw run glibly through the wood, and paid no attention to the careless boy that had taunted him. When he turned around to get another stick of wood to lay upon his buck, he noticed that his tormentor was gone.</p>
                  <p>This boy was the only son of the merchant for whom Peleg was sawing wood. When he left the yard, he ran into the parlor, where his mother, father and sister were sitting, and marching up to the latter, he whispered,</p>
                  <p>"There's a character in the yard, Jane, a chap that'll just suit you. He is sawing wood on Christmas to get a pie at night. Ain't he a character?"</p>
                  <p>"What character," inquired the father, catching the last words, "come, Frank, what mischief have you been up to now?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, Pa," returned the boy, "only I had been out to see my pony, when I found a character in the yard—the son of drunkard Brown is sawing our wood, and I had some fun with him."</p>
                  <p>"You did not make fun of his misfortunes, I hope, my son," said the mother.</p>
                  <p>"No, mamma," returned Frank, "I only laughed at him a little for having to saw wood on Christmas, and being content with a <emph>nice</emph> pie at night."</p>
                  <p>"That was naughty, Frank," said Jane.</p>
                  <p>"Come, come, Jane," interrupted the father, "let Frank have his sport to-day. You may preach to him to-morrow. But, Frank, you must not associate with drunkard's sons and wood-sawyers. It is bad enough to have <emph>one</emph> in the family given to such company."</p>
                  <p>The last sentence was intended as a reprimand to Jane. She felt it, and left the parlor. As she walked to her own room, the tears started in her eyes, and her heart said "Why does not father love me? He tells me I am homely. He says Frank is his only pride: but I love father, though he never does call me Pet. I'm sure if I do associate with drunkard's children it's not to disobey <emph>Pa</emph>, but it is because I love to see them have something good to eat, and wear. Ma loves me for this, and other people say I am good. Why does not Pa love me?"</p>
                  <p>Again, and again she asked herself this question, and still she could find no answer, but that she was a homely girl, and Frank was a handsome boy. She did not feel that her father was a worldly man—one whose heart was on houses and lands and stocks and bills—that he loved Frank because he was fine looking, and, what the parent was pleased to term, a "<hi rend="i"/>sharp" boy—that he expected him to sustain the credit of the house of Pridore &amp; Co., and that he had nothing to expect of Jane, because she was not only homely, but seemed to have no joy in the society of the rich and proud who visited his house—would rather, even when it stormed, carry a basket of clothing around to the poor children in the neighborhood, than sit in the parlor<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5993-00000082"/> and play the piano for visiters. Frank laughed at Jane for these "<hi rend="i"/>whims." He loved the dashing company that visited his father's house—he was well pleased when his father allowed him to sit down with the proud visiters to a rich supper, and drink the choice wine which flowed freely around the board. Sometimes his mother thought he took too much wine, but the father said,</p>
                  <p>"No. It don't hurt him. He's of the real Pridore stock. He knows what good wine is, and it is <emph>good</emph> for him."</p>
                  <p>Night was approaching—little Peleg prepared to quit work for the day. His "job" was not finished, but he sent a modest request into the house that, as it was Christmas, he might be paid for what he had done; promising to come on the morrow and complete his work. His request was granted, and he was carefully placing the hard earned sixpences in the pocket of his ragged jacket, when a young lady crossed the yard towards him. It was Jane; who had determined to do something for the drunkard's son, which would cause him to forget Frank's harshness, and remember that Christmas with pleasure.</p>
                  <p>She spoke kindly to Peleg, and told him he must not think hard of what her brother had said. He was a thoughtless boy.</p>
                  <p>"I didn't only for a moment, kind lady," said Peleg, "I know he doesn't feel what it is to be a drunkard's son. I am a poor boy, but I've got a good mother, and I love her."</p>
                  <p>"You are a good boy," said Jane, "stay here a moment I have something to send your mother."</p>
                  <p>Peleg put down his saw-buck, and Jane ran into the house. In a moment she appeared again, bringing a basket which was carefully covered, and which Peleg found to be heavy when Jane put it into his hand, saying,—</p>
                  <p>"Carry this to your mother, and tell her it is from Jane Pridore."</p>
                  <p>"We are not beggars," was on Peleg's lip, but Jane smiled upon him so sweetly, he could not say it. Thanking her with a tone which made her heart thrill, he bid her good evening, and ran homewards. He had worked hard, and he was tired; he carried his wood-saw and buck and a heavy basket, but the remembrance of Jane's smile was warm in his heart, and he walked not a step until he reached his mother's cottage.</p>
                  <p>He was gladly received—joyfully welcomed, and the basket was quickly opened. There, nicely and carefully packed, was an assortment of delicacies such as Peleg had never partaken of, and such as his mother had not seen for many years.</p>
                  <p>The mother prepared the Christmas supper in the neatest style her meagerly furnished house would allow, and when Peleg had dressed himself, in his Sabbath school suit, they sat down to such a repast as had never been eaten in that cottage. There was but one thing wanting to complete comfort—the husband and father could not partake with mother and son. He was at the village grog-shop, and he did not come home till long after Peleg had recited his lessons to his mother, and was dreaming of Jane Pridore.</p>
                  <p>The wife had left for the husband a portion of the Christmas supper in the most tempting manner she could prepare it, but he was in no mood for "delicacies." He threw himself upon his couch—slept the sleep of a drunkard, and was away from the cottage again as soon as it was light, seeking his bitters.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE BIRTH-NIGHT PARTY.</head>
                  <p>SPRING had come—Birds sung sweetly in the bushes and modest flowers were springing to new-life in the narrow beds around the pretty cottage where dwelt little Peleg, and his mother—but within there was sadness, sorrow and death.—There lay a body, prepared for the narrow bed "appointed for all the living" from which there is no <emph>new</emph>life—the Spirit <emph>un</emph>prepared; had been liberated, by violence, from the bonds which confined it to earth, and was now where it witnessed, in all dreadful reality, the degrading results of those habits which debase high resolves and yield holy pleasures, for the gratification of low passions and grovelling appetites.</p>
                  <p>The husband and father had been found dead, on the highway between the village grog-shop and his home,—his death was a violent one—what man who ever died of the direct influences of intoxication did not have a violent death!</p>
                  <p>The funeral was not numerously attended; from the church yard to their saddened home, but one person accompanied the chief mourners—that one was Jane Pridore. She was welcomed to the cottage in a manner which showed that she was a frequent but never a tedious visiter.</p>
                  <p>"You have been so kind to us," said Peleg—"You are a little girl not bigger than I am, but you can do so much."</p>
                  <p>"Father is kind to me, Peleg. He is rich, and I have something to do with. If you were as rich as I am, you could do a great deal more than I do."</p>
                  <p>"I'll be rich <emph>some</emph> day," said Peleg, I know I will, and then I'll do a great deal. I'll not forget the poor, I know I won't."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps you can do something for some of my folks some day," returned Jane.</p>
                  <p>"But you're so rich, you'll never be poor, and what I can do I must do for the poor. I never can forget the time when I was a poor drunkard's son, if I live to be a hundred years old, and get as rich as Stephen Girard," answered Peleg.</p>
                  <p>"I've read in my books, Peleg," said Jane, "of many rich people becoming poor. You nor I don't know what may happen; but I must run home now. Good bye Peleg, and good bye Mrs. Brown."</p>
                  <p>"Good bye, my little benefactress," said Mrs. Brown.</p>
                  <p>Peleg followed Jane to the garden gate, and there said good bye, as Jane went tripping over the common towards the village. In a moment she cried "Peleg! Peleg!"</p>
                  <p>Peleg ran to meet her when she whispered, as if the wind must not catch the sound and bear it to other ears.</p>
                  <p>"I've thought of something, Peleg—I've something to tell you, Peleg—but I won't tell it now—to-morrow, Peleg, to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>And although the boy made an effort to detain her, in a moment she was tripping across the common again. Peleg could not imagine why Jane should not tell him then, if she had any thing important to communicate, nor was he able to conjecture what she might have to tell him. He went back to the cottage, but said nothing of Jane's conduct, determined that until he knew her secret, he would keep his own.</p>
                  <p>When Jane reached home, she found that her father and mother had just taken dinner, and were in the parlor. She ate her dinner in haste, fearing that her father would go the store before she could see him. When she was ready to enter the<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5993-00000084"/> parlor, he was still at home, however, and she greeted him in her most pleasant manner.</p>
                  <p>"And where have you been roaming to-day, Jane?" inquired Mr. Pridore.</p>
                  <p>"I went to Mr. Brown's funeral."</p>
                  <p>"The Brown's have become great favorites of yours, Jane.'</p>
                  <p>"They are nice people, father, and I could not neglect the mother, and that honest little boy, just because Mr. Brown was a drunkard."</p>
                  <p>"Well—well, Jane, you <emph>can't</emph> be Frank, and I suppose you must have your whims; I don't expect much of you."</p>
                  <p>"Now, pa, don't be cross, or scold me to-day," said Jane, walking up confidently to her father, and placing her hand on his knees, "I have something to ask of you."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Pridore was a man, who, with all his harshness to Jane, loved to indulge her. He was touched by her winning manner, and said, smiling,—</p>
                  <p>"Well, Jane, I am not in a bad humor, and it would not be strange if I granted you a favor, notwithstanding you have been a truant to-day."</p>
                  <p>"No, pa; mother said I might go to the funeral; but I don't want to ask anything for myself. I heard one of the clerks say, this morning, that a boy was needed at the store. Wont you let that little Peleg Brown, come? He'll work hard, father, and I know he's honest."</p>
                  <p>"Well—<emph>well</emph>, Jane," said Mr. Pridore, I should think you were getting familiar with the Browns. The first we know, this little Peleg will be a beau of yours: a drunkard's son waiting upon <emph>my</emph> daughter!"</p>
                  <p>"No—no, father; I am sure I never thought of having a beau. I don't want a beau," interrupted Jane, in her simplicity, not seeing the bearing of her father's objections. "But, pa, do give this boy a place. He supports his mother, and I'm sure he's honest."</p>
                  <p>"You've set your heart on it, Jane. Perhaps I'll take this fellow: I'll see about it this evening."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, pa; not for myself, but for the poor boy's widowed mother," said Jane; following her father, as he walked through the hall, on his way to the counting-room of the firm of Pridore &amp; Co.</p>
                  <p>Whether Mr. Pridore made any inquiries respecting Peleg Brown, he never chose to disclose; but certain it is that, on the morrow, Jane sent a note to the boy which, when he opened it, with beating heart, and glistening eye, he found to contain the following words:</p>
                  <p>"DEAR PELEG:—I could not come to see you to-day, and tell you that secret, so I have sent this note. You are to live at our house—no, you are to work in the store, and live at home if you please. Will you come? Don't say no. I got the place for you, from pa. Come this afternoon. Pa will tell you what you must do, in the evening: he is so kind.—JANE."</p>
                  <p>"Mother—mother!" cried Peleg, after he had read the note over and over again, half a dozen times, "mother, oh mother! see here—I told you I should be rich—I know I shall. See here—see what that little girl, not bigger than I am, and not as old, has done for me. I couldn't do anything for myself or you, but saw wood and run errands; but mother, see what Jane has done. Oh! I never thought it; but now I will do something for myself, mother, and for you. I <emph>will</emph> be rich, and I'll have a store of my own some day, and then I'll give poor boys a chance; and good boys, whose fathers are dead, like mine, shall have the first chance. Oh! mother, we shall be <emph>so</emph> happy: don't you think we shall?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my child," said Mrs. Brown, who, during Peleg's<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5993-00000085"/> rhapsody, had read the note; "I am glad you have got this place: Jane is very kind to us."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed she is, mother. I love her so. I'll be a brother to her—more than a brother."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Brown looked at her boy with a singular expression; she felt the meaning of his words, but knew that he did not, and she was compelled to think that when he did understand their true import, they might be to him the talisman of his severest trial.</p>
                  <p>In a few days little Peleg was regularly installed, assistant clerk, with the duties of an errand boy, in the store of Pridore &amp; Co. His salary was a meager one, but he was accustomed to frugality.</p>
                  <p>He performed his duties, for nearly a year, with such strict assiduity and excellent judgment, that he was more rapidly promoted than boys of his age usually are in extensive stores, and before the end of the first quarter of the second year, he was considered one of the most useful and trustworthy sales-men of the establishment. He had not been in the employment of Pridore &amp; Co. a year and a half, when he was made assistant bookkeeper, with an increased salary.</p>
                  <p>Jane had watched the promotions of her little friend with much interest, but, that he might hold her father's favor, she said nothing about him, unless spoken to in reference to his conduct.</p>
                  <p>Peleg often wondered why Jane was not as familiar with him, as she had been when he was a wood-sawyer, but as he grew older, he felt that they could not be brother and sister, except in such circumstances as placed them socially for ever apart, and whenever he had reason to rejoice over prosperity, he would go to his trunk, and taking out Jane's note, which had been most carefully treasured, he would again peruse it with a beating heart and glistening eye, and say, as he had said to his mother, when he read this note for the first time.</p>
                  <p>"I will be rich—I know I will."</p>
                  <p>One afternoon, Peleg was arranging some accounts in a private room, when Frank Pridore paid him a visit.</p>
                  <p>"Come little Brown," said he, "<emph>You</emph> never have been one of us, but you <emph>must</emph> come out to-night, this is my twenty-first birth-day. After the party at father's to-night, where you will be, <emph>of course</emph>, the boys in the store will adjourn down town for a grand spree. You will join us this <emph>once.</emph> You <emph>shan't</emph> back out."</p>
                  <p>"You will excuse me, Mr. Pridore," said Peleg, mildly.</p>
                  <p>"No, I <emph>won't</emph> excuse you," answered Frank shortly, "I won't do <emph>any</emph> such thing."</p>
                  <p>"I have never been on a spree," said Peleg.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> needn't spree, if you don't want to," returned Frank, "but you <emph>shall</emph> go." "I cannot go," returned Peleg, firmly, "I would not countenance a spree by my presence."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! I remember," said Frank, "you are one of these timid fools of wine, afraid of being a drunkard. <emph>I'm</emph> not; <emph>I</emph> need not get drunk unless I want to. <emph>My</emph> father did not die a drunkard."</p>
                  <p>"These are hard words, Mr. Pridore," answered Peleg, with a trembling voice; "if you live many years you will repent them; but I forgive you now, for your sister's sake."</p>
                  <p>"Pooh!" cried Frank, with a sneer. "<emph>She's</emph> another of your canters, who think there's death in a social glass of wine. We wanted no empty chairs at our feast to-night, but empty chairs are better than canting fellows, who have no sociability. <emph>Good</emph> day, Mr. Temperance Preacher."</p>
                  <p>Peleg's heart was heavy when Frank left him. He did not care for the sneers thrown at him, but associations were<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5993-00000086"/> awakened, which ever carry a bitter sting to the sensitive heart. He determined that he would not attend the birth-night party at Mr. Pridore's, an invitation to which had been given him by Frank, at Jane's solicitation. When he left the store after the work of the day was over, he despatched a note to Jane, in these words:— <q>

                                 <p>"MISS PRIDORE,—A conversation with your brother this afternoon, in which my father's misfortunes were the subject of ridicule, will make it necessary for me to forego the pleasure of seeing you at his birth-night party. Your friend,</p>

                  <p>Jane did not receive this note until she had been expecting Peleg for some time. She flew to Frank for an explanation.</p>
                  <p>"Bravo!" he answered, when he had read the note. "Bravo! I like the fellow's spunk. He forgives the <emph>inestimable</emph> pleasure of seeing you, Jane, because when he refused to join the boys in a jubilee after the party, I told him he was afraid of being a drunkard, like his father."</p>
                  <p>"You were naughty," said Jane, in a tone which, had not the brother been flushed with wine, he would long have remembered. "It was unworthy of my brother; I would not have come here to-night, if I had been in Mr. Brown's place."</p>
                  <p>"To be sure <emph>you</emph> would not; you and he would make a good match. But yonder's a party drinking bumpers to me; <emph>I</emph> cannot waste time with <emph>you</emph>, Jane."</p>
                  <p>Frank was gone to join his wine-drinking companions. As she saw him drink glass after glass, Jane thought of what she had once said to Peleg about doing something for her folks some day, and she pressed closer the little note she had that evening received, and wished —.</p>
                  <p>When Peleg had taken supper with his mother, and many times refused to confide to her the cause of a manifest depression of spirits, he walked down into the village, found his way to his little room back of the store, and, taking up an engaging book, read and thought, and calculated, till a late hour. It was after midnight when he began to retrace his steps to the cottage. As he sauntered slowly through a portion of the village sparsely inhabited, he observed a man lying across the dilapidated steps of an untenanted building. He stooped to look at the unfortunate being, and ascertain whether he was intoxicated, or had been physically injured by ruffians, when something familiar about the dress arrested his attention. He dragged the apparently lifeless body towards a hotel a few rods distant, and by the light reflected from the bar-room, was able to discover that he had found—as it were, dead in the street—the only son of his employer. His birth-night spree had been too much for Frank Pridore: he had entered <emph>manfully</emph> upon the year of his majority.</p>
                  <p>Peleg was grieved and bewildered—grieved to find young Pridore in such a situation, and bewildered in respect to his duty towards him and the family. He forgot all the harsh words Frank had said to him, and determined that he would endeavor to get him to his father's house without calling such assistance as might make public the young man's degradation. He applied at the hotel, and succeeded in arousing the ostler, who, for half a week's wages, consented to assist Peleg. Frank was borne home. When they approached the Pridore mansion, Peleg dismissed his "help," and knowing the appointments of the house, he awakened a servant without arousing the family, and told him that he wished to see Mr. Pridore on important business, and that he must be awakened without alarming any other member of the household. The servant was faithful—he had often discharged such duties—and Mr. Pridore soon met Peleg, who conducted him to Frank, and explained the circumstances under which he had been found.</p>
                  <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5993-00000087"/>
                  <p>The services of the servant who had awakened Mr. Pridore, were further required, and Frank was secretly conveyed into the house, and silently placed in his own bed. When Peleg departed from Mr. Pridore, the latter said:</p>
                  <p>"I am deeply indebted to you for your discretion; neither Miss nor Mrs. Pridore must know a word of this."</p>
                  <p>"I have only done my duty, sir," returned Peleg; "<unclear>I</unclear> should respect your feelings."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Pridore wished Frank had fallen into the care of any young man of the village, rather than Peleg Brown. As he stood by the bedside of his drunken son, he thought of the time when he knew John Brown, who died a drunkard, to be a wealthy and respectable man; he thought of the Christmas-day Peleg sawed wood in his yard, and he reflected on the encouragement he then gave his now drunken boy, to take freely of that which had degraded him.</p>
                  <p>These were bitter thoughts for an over-indulgent father.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.</head>
                  <p>Five years have elapsed since Frank Pridore celebrated his twenty-first birth-night. Peleg Brown was first clerk in the extensive store of Pridore &amp; Co. Mr. Pridore had treated him with distant, but marked respect ever since the night on which his judgment was so nicely exercised for the reputation of the heir apparent to the Pridore station and importance. But there were now no occasions for the exercise of nice discrimination on this subject. Frank Pridore was a genteel sot, and he was so regarded in the village generally; not that a man can be genteel and be a sot—but Frank Pridore's sottishness was genteel compared with that of many drinking men in the village. He was never seen drunk in the streets—he was never engaged in drunken brawls—his father kept the strictest watch upon him.</p>
                  <p>Little Brown's mother had been in the land of Spirits two years. Peleg had, through life, loved his mother with that child-like fondness which ever regards MOTHER the dearest of names, and he mourned her deeply.</p>
                  <p>The first clerk in the store of Pridore &amp; Co. knew well that for at least three years the capital of the firm had not been augmented, and he well knew also that in the last year it had very materially decreased, and he believed that something of this state of affairs was owing to the insidious influences of the "siren foe," that had saddened his earlier years and embittered, for life, the recollections of his childhood.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of the sixth year of little Brown's clerkship he was engaged to take an inventory of the "stock in trade" of Pridore &amp; Co. When the work was completed to the satisfaction of his employers, he was informed that it was the intention of the junior partner of the firm to retire, and that he was desirous of finding some person who would purchase his interest. On the evening after Peleg learned this fact, he called at the Pridore mansion and begged an hour's conversation with the proprietor.</p>
                  <p>Supposing that something important in reference to business, was to be communicated, Mr. Pridore promptly invited little Brown to his private room. When they had talked together on general matters for a few moments, Mr. Pridore said:—</p>
                  <p>"You have, something important to communicate, I understand."</p>
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5993-00000088"/>
                  <p>"I am informed," replied Peleg, "that Mr. Hanks is desirous of finding some one who will purchase his interest in the store."</p>
                  <p>"Such is "the fact," said Mr. Pridore, "and I wish that I knew of some man acquainted with our business who could take his place since it is forbidden me to give it to my son, for whom I had intended it. Pridore &amp; Son, I should have rejoiced to see that name in gilt letters over the door of our store, but—but, it is past. I speak freely to you, sir. You respect my feelings."</p>
                  <p>"For that reason I have called upon you. I have had some intention of making Mr. Hanks a proposition, and before doing so, I wished to consult you," replied Peleg.</p>
                  <p>"You," exclaimed Mr. Pridore. "<emph>You</emph>, make Mr. Hanks a proposition. Where in the name of Heaven did you get money enough to talk of buying an interest in the business of Pridore and company?"</p>
                  <p>"When my mother died the cottage and lot was mine, sir, I sold them for fifteen hundred dollars. I invested the money in property on the Creek, which has more than doubled in value—and besides, sir, I have saved nearly two thousand dollars out of my wages since I have been in your employ."</p>
                  <p>"Yes! yes!" said Mr. Pridore. "I had forgotten. You <emph>have</emph> been a saving boy—but I'll think of this. It is unexpected. I'll see Mr. Hanks. Leave me now."</p>
                  <p>When Peleg was gone, Mr. Pridore had sorrowful reflections. He reviewed his life. He thought of the time when he and John Brown, Peleg's father, drank wine together—he thought of Peleg the little wood-sawyer—of John Brown's awful death—then he thought of his own habits, and the gradual encroachments upon his independence, of the love for what had made his boy—whom he had regarded in his youth with so much pride—a reproach to his family—and when he thought of<emph>his</emph> boy, then Peleg the drunkard's son came up in contrast, and with that contrast, a source of most poignant reproach, haunting him, he threw himself upon a couch, and conjured to himself the remarks of his correspondents in business, when they learned that little Brown was the junior partner of the firm of Pridore &amp; Co.</p>
                  <p>The "<hi rend="i"/>fates" had decreed. Peleg Brown took Mr. Hank's place in the firm of Pridore &amp; Co. He and Jane Pridore had been distant acquaintances during the whole period of his clerkship, but as he was now a frequent visitor at the Pridore mansion, on terms that were humiliating to neither party, the intimate friendship of youth was renewed between the little wood-sawyer and the little girl whose kind heart had secured him a situation of trust and profit.</p>
                  <p>Peleg had been a partner but a few months, when Frank Pridore was one morning found dead in his bed. He had been intoxicated for several days. The physicians gave the "<hi rend="i"/>cause" of his death, and it was announced in the newspapers:</p>
                  <p>"DIED.—Frank Pridore, aged twenty-seven years, only son of H. Pridore, Esq., of the firm of Pridore &amp; Co., of <hi rend="i"/>apoplexy, on the — day of —."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Pridore was a changed man after this death. He knew that the physicians were guilty of a professional libel when they said his son had died of "<hi rend="i"/>apoplexy." Wine was banished from his table—the flush left his cheek—he became melancholy—absent-minded. The business of the firm of Pridore and Co., devolved mainly on little Brown. He discharged his duties with excellent judgment, and the credit of the firm was re-established. Mr. Pridore treated Peleg not only with kindness, but with deference.</p>
                  <p>When the mother and sister of Frank Pridore had left off mourning apparel in memory of the "early lost," and Jane<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5993-00000089"/> Pridore again went into company, Peleg Brown was her constant attendant.</p>
                  <p>One evening they walked across the Common towards the site of the cottage in which Jane first saw Peleg's mother. A handsome mansion stood in the place of the cottage: it was the property of Peleg Brown. Jane and Peleg entered this mansion. Jane admired the style in which it was furnished; she complimented Peleg warmly upon his taste, and Peleg said to her:</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow it will be our home, and your father and mother will live with us. Come—I will show you their apartments."</p>
                  <p>The little wood-sawer and the rich merchant's daughter had been married nearly three months.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Pridore put all of his property into the hands of his son-in-law, and Peleg purchased the interest of the second member of the firm; and if Mr. Pridore did not see the name of Pridore &amp; Son, over the door of the store, he saw that of "PRIDORE &amp; BROWN," and he felt that Peleg was a son to him.</p>
                  <p>The little wood-sawer—frugal, industrious and temperate—was the wealthy husband of the girl who spoke kindly to him in his severe Christmas labor. Now, he was the support and protection of him who had warned his children to shun the society of the drunkard's son; and the youth who, at a father's prompting, had ridiculed his simple desires—taunted him with his early misfortunes—and abused him as an enemy to social habits, because he would not join in a "spree"—had met a drunkard's reward in that sphere where none know the right, and "still the wrong pursue."</p>

               <p>"COMFORT" is one of those significant and precious words that are apt to be much abused. It is so comprehensive that people try to make it mean every thing, just as "religion" has been stretched to cover the burning of heretics, and "justice" the gratification of vindictive feeling or the devices of envy. It is so good a word, in its true character, that none but honest and true people can use it with propriety. It is, by tacit consent, banished from the vocabulary of Fashion, and if Ambition should make a dictionary, Comfort would find no place in it. The French, who are lovers of <hi rend="i"/>pleasure, have been obliged to transplant our word <hi rend="i"/>comfort bodily into their language, as they had before naturalized a correlative word—<hi rend="i"/>home, after they had adopted the idea. Strange that we, proud as we are of our right to it, should ever misuse it!</p>
               <p>But, as we were saying, it has, like some other good things, been sometimes sadly misunderstood or perverted. The most general as well as fatal mistake is that which supposes it to dignify present gratification at all hazards. This is as if a man whose fingers were cold should make a fire of his chairs or split up his piano, for comfort. Or like a young lady who should take so much comfort in reading a novel that when the twilight grew too deep she could not resist setting the curtains a-blaze rather than wait for candles. (We see people risking ophthalmia in this cause every day.) Let none accuse us of extravagance in our illustrations. What we have imagined would be as much less foolish than some kinds of self-indulgence but too common, as matter is less precious than mind, body than soul; and it is only because the consequences of such absurdities would be immediate and obvious, while those of the more fatal sacrifices to present enjoyment are deferred in proportion to the dignity of the powers they ruin, that we do not recoil in horror from tempting pleasures which lead to certain misery.</p>
               <p>We are all more or less disposed to self-indulgence, and as some amount of it is proper enough, it is not always easy to determine where the right ends and the wrong begins. In some very familiar and but too frequent cases this is peculiarly difficult; and in the matter of intoxicating drinks experience shows us how prone some natures are to self-delusion, as to the limit of lawful indulgence. It is on this ground that moralists recommend total abstinence as alone safe. "Abstinence," says Johnson, "is easy, it is temperance that is difficult," and the fact is well known. Is it not strange, then, that a principle sanctioned by the highest authority should arouse<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5993-00000091"/> angry opposition? One would think it must command respect at least, even from those who yet were not disposed to adopt it practically. But whatever touches our private and personal practice comes so near, and calls in question such sensitive and delicate points, that it is perhaps to be expected that self-love should make us unjust. We do not love people who interfere with our "comfort."</p>
               <p>If it were possible, in all cases of intemperance, to go down to the very roots of the habit, and ascertain and put one's finger upon the very first motion towards evil, we should doubtless be astonished to see how entirely among the things innocent or indifferent the seeds of destruction appear, in their undeveloped state. Nay—should we not find temptation lying in wait even among the virtues? That of good housekeeping, for instance, on which our present illustration turns. Can there be any bounds to the attention which a woman ought to pay to the comfort of her family?</p>
               <p>There was our old acquaintance, Jacob Zieber, a German farmer in — county, who used to sit soaking with cider, or something stronger, for two hours every evening before he went to bed. He had a prodigious European constitution, and you might as well have talked to one of the great logs it was his pride to take to the sawmill, as speak to him of the injuriousness of the practice. It had never hurt <emph>him</emph>, he said! He was of a cubical build, with a great jolter head of his own, set right on his shoulders, dispensing with neck for the greater firmness and security of carriage. His large light eyes had little speculation in them, and all the good cider and other good things he had faithfully imbibed had done little towards imparting a genial tinge to his complexion. Flesh he had, in abundance; his hands were like bunches of sausages, and when he walked his feet planted themselves, like those of the tramping statue in Don Giovanni. In strict accordance with this bodily configuration, his life was one of the dullest routine, diversified by going once every Sunday to church, when the text always put him to sleep. Comfort, wherever you can get it, was his creed.</p>
               <p>His ordinary behavior was pretty good, considering the cider and other stimulants which might have fired a less phlegmatic temper into insufferableness. He never used to beat his wife, who was a smart-spoken dame that held her own in the family, though she had come late into it and brought with her a son, the only one the house ever knew. She stood on strong ground; and she knew it. Jacob Zieber was a confirmed old bachelor when the tricksy Fates threw him into the way of the widow Ferris, who established herself in his good graces by her excellent knack at making apple-toddy at a wedding where Jacob happened to be present. Then her nephew returned from a voyage round the world, and could think of no more appropriate present to his aunt than a carved pipe-head, which the good lady at once transferred to her excellent neighbor, Mr. Zieber, with some very choice tobacco, which her nephew was able to furnish. "I know you know what's good, Mr. Zieber," said the widow, "and I like to see every body taking comfort,"—and the cubical bachelor looked kindly upon her as she softly enunciated his favorite word. It is not to be wondered at that after this, whenever he sat smoking by the fire, in that state of mental dissolution which it is the peculiar province of tobacco to produce, the image of the comfortable widow Ferris was associated with the gentle fumes, until she came in time to be part and parcel of Mr. Zieber's floating idea of the only true happiness.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Ferris became Mrs. Zieber, which she did in due season, she was far from deserving the reproach of unfaithfulness<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5993-00000092"/> faithfulness with regard to the "comfort" of her husband and his household. Her difficulty lay rather in the other direction. She made him <emph>too</emph> comfortable. From his coffee in the morning to his apple-toddy or mulled cider at bed-time, there was hardly an hour in the day that she was not baking or boiling, stewing, brewing, or concocting somewhat for the consolation of Jacob's mortal frame. She had an old receipt-book of her mother's, yellow with age, worn almost to undecipherable tatters by ceaseless consultation, and marked all over with tastes or specimens of every article that had been made by its instructions in fifty years. This was her <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vade-mecum</foreign>—her oracle—her almanac—we had almost said her Bible. She was emphatically a woman of one book, and she spent the more time over it because, although very bulky, it possessed no table of contents; so that in order to find a rule for salting down hams, one might be obliged to plough through plum-cakes, soar with puffs, wallow in washes, stick fast in plasters, take the shade of dye-stuffs, and put up with all kind of sauces. All the eye-waters in the book were not sufficient to make it intelligible to any but the initiated. To Mrs. Zieber, however, who had been brought up upon it, it had a beauty such as the earliest folio Shakspeare had in the eyes of Charles Lamb—viz., the beauty of sentiment, or <q>
                     <l>"Something than beauty dearer"—</l>
                  </q> a tender interest, in short, not to be argued about or meddled with. We should like to have seen the individual bold enough to offer in exchange for it the most elegant and voluminous copy of Ude or Soyer. Its very idea was embalmed in butter, sugar, eggs, and spice, to say nothing of medicaments, charms, and lovelifying lotions. To read it always gave her an appetite, sharpened her ingenuity, and sent her at once to the kitchen, and the result was that her husband and her son grew to be as fastidious tasters and as great connoisseurs as herself</p>
               <p>Nor did Mrs. Zieber confine her cares to the comforting of the inner man. The condition, temperature, light, arrangement, and availableness of the house were equally objects of her solicitude. She was conscientious in stopping draughts, regulating fires, stuffing cushions, placing chairs, so that no possible inconvenience could occur, no possible advantage be lost. All the rocking-chairs, and they were many, were made to rock just right—not too suddenly, nor yet with difficulty, as far from pitching backward as forward, and without a particle of squeak in their motion, let that be as vehement as it might. Not that vehement motion was much the habit of the family; but the little boy, Tommy Ferris, preferred rocking to any other mode of exercise, and his mother had a chair made and quilted on purpose for him, which no one else was allowed ever to occupy.</p>
               <p>Not to dwell too long on particulars, Mrs. Zieber was what is called an excellent wife, that being the term which is usually applied to a woman who takes good care of the physical comfort of her household. Further than this she never aspired. No book was ever permitted in the parlor, except an old family Bible, which was carefully placed on a stand in the corner, and only removed once a week, on Sunday evening, when Mr. Zieber read a chapter, in course, with a good deal of ceremony. What few school-books little Tommy Ferris brought home were put out of sight as soon as possible, for Mrs. Zieber would as soon have seen a toad on the table as a book.</p>
               <p>Tommy grew up under these auspices, and imbibed, to his heart's core, the family notion of "comfort." He never did any thing he didn't want to; never learned a lesson when he<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5993-00000093"/> preferred flying his kite, or went to school when he chose to have a headache and go fishing. He had a sip or a bit of every thing nice that came from his mother's skilful hands, and would have felt much injured if he had not shared Mr. Zieber's bed-time beverage, be it what it might. That worthy person grew more and more quiet as his years increased, till at last he did not rise out of the great chair which he filled so well, except to exchange it for the "comfortable" feather-bed, which was duly visited by the warming-pan when the thermometer stood below 60°. There he sat and smoked, or dozed, or sipped some potent comforter, or lingered lovingly over some dainty placed before him on a little stand, which had gradually become consecrated to that use. Tommy's comings and goings became less and less the object of his care, and that ingenious youth tried many youthful follies, which his mother took care should never reach her husband's ears. She said she thought boys must have a little comfort, as well as grown people!</p>
               <p>By-and-by Mr. Zieber died rather suddenly, although he had been ailing for some time. He had several troublesome diseases, but would not allow a physician to be called because of the miserable ideas of diet which that class of persons are supposed to entertain. Mr. Zieber was "determined not to be starved to death, at any rate." On his last morning, his wife had prepared an egg, beaten up with a spoonful of brandy, which she gave him before he rose, to strengthen him. He then ate a tolerable breakfast of sausages, muffins, buckwheat cakes, and coffee, finishing off with a small glass of old, hard cider, that made even his eyes water, that being, as he declared, an excellent thing for the stomach. Feeling rather faint at lunch-time, he had a veal cutlet and a little brandy and water. When dinner-time came, he complained of feeble appetite, so Mrs. Zieber kindly procured some venison-steaks, which she served up with a sauce of her own, redolent of wine and piquant with spices. This Mr. Zieber pronounced excellent, and having dispatched an apple-dumpling or two, he took his siesta with unusual satisfaction. Tea was never, with him, much of a meal, but he managed two or three cups of good green tea, with plenty of cream and sugar, and as many rounds of buttered toast, made as nobody but Mrs. Zieber could make it, as he often triumphantly declared. After this he felt, he said, uncommon comfortable, and dozed most of the evening, only once asking for a drink of cider, which he imbibed after putting in a little brandy to correct the acid.</p>
               <p>Tommy had been out all day, and came home late and rather cross, upon which his tender mother thought she would get him something good to eat to make him feel comfortable. This occupied some time, and detained her in the kitchen, where, when all was ready, Tommy sat down to his supper, with a returning gleam of good humor at sight of the variety of dainties which his mother had brought together for his refreshment. He had hardly tasted any thing, however, when he was startled by a loud scream in the adjoining room. Mrs. Zieber, on attempting to raise her husband to ask what he would have for supper, had found him quite dead. This occasioned such a shock and commotion in the family, that Tommy did not get back to his supper till it was cold, at which he grumbled a good deal, for he loved comfort dearly.</p>
               <p>The coroner said nothing of murder or suicide, but concluded Mr. Zieber to have died "by the visitation of God," and everybody praised Mrs. Zieber for the excellent care she had taken of her husband. So she continued to take equally good care of her son, and he grew up a connoisseur in good<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5993-00000094"/> living, and an infallible judge of cigars, and indeed of tobacco in every form. He tried various kinds of business, but found some fault with each, and his mother, thinking his objections very natural and reasonable, remarked that it was a comfort, after all, that Tommy was not <emph>obliged</emph> to do any thing, if he didn't choose. He made pretty good use of his gun and his fishing-rod, and occasionally brought in some contribution to the dinner, which again, as his mother observed, was a great comfort.</p>
               <p>But unhappily comforts of this description did not always satisfy the youth who had so long been accustomed to exercise his ingenuity principally upon the means of personal enjoyment. He wearied of his mother's watchful and solicitous eye, and, in the ingratitude of a heart hardened by too much mistaken kindness, learned to despise her for the sacrifices she made to his unreasonable whims. As for her, poor woman! she had so narrowed her mind to one poor, mean set of ideas, that it was incapable of receiving new ones; and when her darling son contemned her dainty dishes, or any of the various devices for his gratification that were always revolving in her brain, she was at her wit's end, and would go away and weep in sad foreboding of coming ills, she knew not what. Time showed the justice of her presentiments, for Tommy was hardly one-and-twenty, when he had formed some very unhappy connections with dissolute young men of the neighborhood, who, for their own bad ends, flattered his weak pride by an outward show of deference which he felt to be a homage to his wealth. Unmistakable marks of the evil tendency of a self-indulgent life very soon began to appear upon the once good-looking youth, and his poor mother, always mistaken in her modes of attempting to do good, worried at him incessantly on the subject until he declared his home intolerable, and justified tified his own misconduct by the assertion that he could have no "comfort" anywhere but at the tavern.</p>
               <p>This state of things came on gradually, but not so gradually that the unhappy mother was not conscious of each step in the downward path which the successive changes in her son's domestic habits served sufficiently to mark. When at length he was absent from home the greater part of the time, and would sit smoking in moody silence while he was there, either deaf to his mother's remonstrances and complaints, or roused to fierce and defiant replies when she pushed them too vehemently; the desperation of the case drove Mrs. Zieber to a special effort for his recall before it should be forever too late. In this case, as ever, she was unconscious of her own selfishness, and considered herself as acting "all for the best," though no sacrifice to Moloch was ever more cruel. She bethought her of an orphan niece of hers, a gentle and pretty girl, who was living in an uncle's family at some distance; and her bright thought was to send for this young woman, in the hope that so agreeable an inmate would prove at least some counterbalance to the attractions of the tavern. What was to become of the decoy-duck in this ease, concerned her no more than if Mary Turner had been made of wood: Tommy was to be saved—saved, that is, from disgracing himself, wasting his money, and annoying his mother, and in order to this, any thing was lawful; and Mrs. Zieber, in her heart, thought herself an excellent mother, as indeed so she was, as far as certain qualities of a good mother went. Want of knowledge is sometimes as fatal as want of virtue.</p>
               <p>Mary Turner came, and the good effects of her presence were very soon evident at Mrs. Zieber's. Her cousin's dress began to improve; his hair and whiskers assumed a tamer aspect, and the general rowdyism of costume which had marked<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5993-00000095"/> him for some time past, gradually softened into something approaching gentlemanliness. The visits to the public house, too, were shorter and less frequent, his manner to his mother kinder, and his treatment of pretty Mary Turner almost gallant. She, on her part, bore herself with native modesty; assisted her aunt in household affairs, cultivated some acquaintance with the young people of the neighborhood, and treated her dissipated cousin in that simple and familiar way which puts farthest off the idea of particular attention. This did not, however, prevent his falling or fancying himself in love with her, and, in the devotion of time and thoughts which ensued, evil habits and companions were put off, and the desired reformation seemed complete. The young man spent his evenings at home or attended his fair cousin to village merry-makings; treated his mother with abundant respect, restrained, as far as possible, his natural and customary selfishness, and seemed for the first time in his life to find "comfort" in pleasing other people. Whether he was in reality less selfish than usual, we shall see.</p>
               <p>Mary Turner was by no means insensible to the agreeable change in her aunt's family, or indifferent to the effect of her charms upon the wayward heart of the spoiled child. She was young and easily fascinated, and soon yielded up her whole wealth of innocent affection in return, nothing doubting. Ferris declared himself and was accepted, and nothing now remained but to obtain his mother's consent. This, to his great surprise, was not so readily granted as he expected. Mrs. Zieber loved her son, but she loved money too, and now that she considered Tom as entirely reclaimed from bad courses, she had no idea of letting him marry a girl without a shilling. She was even ready to accuse Mary of having artfully enticed her cousin into offering himself, and said such unkind and unbecoming things on this point, that the poor girl insisted on leaving the house and returning home at once. To this Mrs. Zieber gladly consented, thinking that absence would soon cure her son's sudden folly, and bring him once more under her own exclusive influence. But in this she was quite mistaken. Her knowledge of human nature was not very great, and of Tom's particular share of it, wonderfully small. The habits of self-indulgence in which she had herself trained him, were all against her. He had, as he said, found more "comfort" in Mary's society than anywhere else, and the thought of relinquishing it never entered his thoughts for a moment. So he very soon followed her to her uncle's, and now his mother saw even less of him than before his reformation. Many unpleasant scenes of altercation and recrimination occurred when they did meet, and the poor woman had bitter proof the hardening effect of making present gratification the first object of pursuit. Her passionate remonstrances fell on Tom's ear like cold water on the flinty rock; they did not even make him waver. He was of age, and chose to marry his cousin; his mind would hold no ideas but these. Opposition had aroused his temper, and made that a passion which might otherwise have proved but a passing fancy. If he had been let alone, he would very likely have changed his mind, but now a marriage with Mary Turner became the settled purpose of his soul.</p>
               <p>It may seem strange that one who could pursue his own inclinations with so little regard to any body else, should have shown even such an amount of deference for his mother's wishes as was implied in delay. But Tom's dutifulness was exactly in proportion to the amount of property in his mother's power; and although he felt little fear as to her ultimate disposal of it. still, in so important a matter, he did not<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5993-00000096"/> like to run any risk. So at last he fairly worried her into a consent, or the form of it, and in a short time after this Mary Turner was married and brought home as Mrs. Thomas Ferris.</p>
               <p>Oh how amiable was the devotee of "comfort" in those days! Mrs. Zieber was a trifle sullen at first, but the real sweetness of Mary's disposition was too much for her prejudices; and the magic power of love diffused such a glory through the house, that old things were forgotten, or remembered only as heighteners of present satisfaction. With mother and Mary both devoted to his comfort, Ferris felt himself at the pinnacle of human felicity, and he would not have changed places even with that Hottentot sovereign whose two esquires of the mouth found their sole employment in cramming him with delicacies on the right hand and on the left.</p>
               <p>And here, according to the practice of the modern novel, our story ought to conclude, leaving our characters in the condition described by the severe poet, as "cursed with every granted prayer,"—but truth forbids, and the world's history would contradict ours if we should represent a happiness founded mainly upon the senses, as proving any more permanent than it is exalted. Ennui is usually the first enemy in such cases,—that negative torment, whose very vagueness makes it unendurable. Satiety is the most hopeless of mortal ills.</p>
               <q>
                  <lg type="quotation">
                     <l>It is the constant iteration, stale</l>
                     <l>And tasteless, of the same repeated joys,</l>
                     <l>That palls and satiates, and makes languid life</l>
                     <l>A pedler's pack, that bows the bearer down.</l>
                     <l>Health suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heart</l>
                     <l>Recoils from its own choice; at the full feast</l>
                     <l>Is famished; finds no music in the song,</l>
                     <l>No smartness in the jest, and wonders why!</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>The next stage is ill health—the revenge of insulted nature; stealthy, but sure and terrible. Ferris had naturally a robust constitution, and it was slow in confessing the sapping and mining process that had been going on ever since he was born, so that he had had many of what he called "singular attacks" before he felt permanently the worse for them. In due time, however, they began to tell upon his whole being, and then that other avenger, ill-temper, took the field. Seasons of terrible irritation alternated with the usual indulgences, and Mary's voice, once so potent in charming down the evil spirit, lost its magic. And now the old habit of wild and reckless companionship resumed its reign. Wife and children were as nothing, or only tedious and importunate clogs upon pleasure. Their expenditures seemed unreasonable because so much was drawn off in unlawful directions. Disputes about money, between Mrs. Zieber and the son she had so idolized and ruined, were fierce and frequent; Mary was appealed to as umpire, and thus often incurred the wrath of both. She did what she could to stem the tide of evil, but its sources were far beyond her reach. She had been educated in economy and self-denial, and would fain have brought up her children in the same way, but every perceptible effort in that direction was felt as a personal affront by Mrs. Zieber, who was never tired of sneering at "people who think themselves so much wiser than their neighbors!" She, poor old lady, was very infirm, and had a terribly red nose, for which she was continually trying various lotions and potions from her mother's receipt-book, but with very little success, though she sometimes took the skin off the offending feature by mistaken or too heroic practice, which did not at all tend to the mollification of her temper. Her dutiful son, whose excesses had not yet centralized the over-heated blood so as to give a volcanic aspect to his countenance, made his mother's misfortune<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5993-00000097"/> fortune the subject of many a jibe, which she resented with a degree of acrimony that highly amused him, producing in this way scenes from which Mary was used to draw off her children on any or no pretence, lest all respect for both father and grandmother should be utterly destroyed.</p>
               <p>It was on her return, after one of these short absences, that she found her husband, who had been drinking a good deal, still storming at his mother and all the world, while the old lady, for a wonder, sat mute, not offering to interrupt him by one of those well-put observations with which human or diabolic ingenuity is wont to add fuel to the unhallowed fire already too hot. A second glance at Mrs. Zieber showed her the reason of this passiveness. A shocking change had taken place in her face, which was all awry, and though her eyes still showed consciousness, she was evidently deprived of the power of speech and motion—smitten with palsy. Her son, sobered at least in part by Mary's exclamation of horror, rushed to her side and tried to recall her fading senses by his expressions of grief and contrition, but in vain. The doctor came, remedies such as his skill suggested were anxiously applied, but Mrs. Zieber never spoke again. Repeated shocks confirmed the first, and in three days she breathed her last.</p>
               <p>Tom was some thousands of dollars richer for his mother's demise, but there was in his secret soul a thought which effectually prevented the enjoyment of this accession to his property. He believed himself, whether justly or not, to be the cause of his mother's death. Conscience told him he had wantonly provoked and irritated her, and her dying look was always before his eyes, giving him a new excuse to himself for flying to temporary madness or oblivion for relief. A life on this principle led of course to various kinds of misery, including at length the disorder of affairs. A man who lives on stimulants makes foolish bargains, as a matter of course; and a man who is known to be in the habit of making foolish bargains, will soon be a mark for sharpers. Hardly a month passed that some of Tom's tavern friends had not some fascinating scheme to propose which only wanted a small capital at the beginning to insure the most incredible profits. If this larger trap did not take, there was a fine horse to be had at a bargain, or a famous trotter to bet upon. Mortgages became necessary, and these ate like cormorants; so that Tom Ferris was not very far from absolute and irretrievable ruin when, happily for all concerned, he came to a sudden end, by means of a wonderful horse just purchased of his dearest friend, which he happened to ride on a very dark night, after a tavern supper. He was brought home insensible, and scarcely spoke or noticed his family afterwards, but bled inwardly for twenty-four hours, and so died, leaving wife and children in a poor condition enough.</p>
               <p>But Mary had been learning deep lessons all this time. She was young when she came into the family, and naturally pleased with the change from poverty and neglect to abundance and affection. But she soon began to see the errors of her mother-in-law's system, and to deplore their effect upon the character of her husband. She saw how powerless is even affection to combat a habit of self-indulgence, for it was not very long before occasional harshness and disregard of her feelings alternated with Ferris's demonstrations of attachment. As years wore on, he had grown more and more exacting, and, between his requisitions and those of Mrs. Zieber, Mary had become a sort of drudge, outwardly, while her moral nature had much ripened, as is often the case, where we are wise enough to accept in the best spirit evils evidently unavoidable. She had a kind and gentle nature, and a goodly habit in respect to the soft answer that turneth away wrath, and the opportune silence that gives time for unreason to recollect<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5993-00000098"/> and be ashamed of itself. Her habits of self-denial, too, had grown with the occasion for their exercise, and in proportion to the wretchedness produced by the want of it in others. She had the consolation of feeling always that she was an element of blessing in the house, and that her husband and his mother, even in their most unhappy and perverse moments, did her justice in their hearts. Her children looked up to her with peculiar respect, from the instinctive reverence for the right which the young always feel when they see it contrasted with the wrong. Public esteem was hers, too, and when her affairs were to be settled, some of the best men in the neighborhood took care that the widow had her rights, and that every thing was disposed to the best advantage, so as to leave what might with prudence and economy serve to educate the children and keep the family in decent comfort. It is to the honor of the community that the family of the unhappy devotee of dissipation always attract an extra amount of tender regard, if they preserve their virtue and self-respect under all the disadvantages of ill-example and depressing circumstances.</p>
               <p>Let none think that we have drawn on imagination for a tragic conclusion to our life-sketch. The necessity is on the other side; the consummation of such careers is generally such as to oblige the narrator rather to soften than to exaggerate the truth. And perhaps the most tragic of all are those whose climax is never disclosed to the world, but concealed amid agonies of pride.</p>
               <p>Strange secrets are let out by Death! and the revelations which occur when the affairs of the profligate and the inebriate are necessarily laid open to the world, give us some faint idea of the sufferings of those concerned, while the mask is still worn. If warnings were all that is needed, real life affords such almost daily. Fiction can, in this as in other cases, only follow in the footsteps of Truth.</p>

               <head>THE SCULPTOR OF FLORENCE AND THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.</head>
               <head type="sub">(Translated from the Italian.)</head>
               <p>THE leaves which shaded the window of Julio's workshop were tinged with gold by the rays of the setting sun. The most promising sculptor of Florence was there, studying the principles of the art by means of which he hoped to obtain that slow reward of genius—the admiration of posterity. The valleys by which Florence is surrounded, illumined by that splendid light, presented a scene so picturesque and so beautiful, that it diverted for a moment the attention of Julio from the model he was endeavoring to finish, and his thoughts from their darling object—his beloved Berta.</p>
               <p>While he stood contemplating with all the ardor of an artist the surrounding landscape and the distant mountains, the hum of the busy city, the soft murmur of the Arno, and the sound of the evening bells, threw him by degrees into a deep reverie. At length he said to himself: "Truly, this spectacle is very beautiful, and yet it makes me sad: something oppresses me; an unaccountable feeling of bitterness rises out of that vast field of beauty, and weighs upon my heart like lead. How strange! that the contemplation of such grandeur should at the same time charm the eye, and cloud the soul by the gloomy thoughts that it awakens. But away with this folly! I will go to Berta: if she should lose her walk on my account, I will return without having enjoyed her smile, which is a thousand times sweeter to me than the fairest view in Italy." And he was proceeding to leave the shop, when the door opened, and a stranger stood before him.</p>
               <p>He was a man whose noble aspect and dignified deportment impressed the beholder with a sense of his superiority. He was dressed in the deepest mourning; his features bespoke a calm resignation to the ills of humanity, and bore an undefinable expression, calculated to excite at the same time fear and respect.</p>
               <p>The stranger commenced the conversation. "Signor Arnolfo," said he, "although I have never known you personally, still I have formed an intimate acquaintance with you through your works, and I have discovered in them the traces of an accomplished artist. (Arnolfo bowed.) I have accordingly selected you to execute a group for a tomb. <emph>It must</emph> be executed by you!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>It must! it must!</emph>" said Arnolfo to himself; "these two words were hardly necessary, if my labor is to be rewarded by fame and fortune."</p>
               <p>But the stranger continued:</p>
               <p>"The subject is to be a young man weeping over the body of his betrothed. I give you 5,000 crowns, and twelve months from this day to finish it. Make whatever terms you please, except as to the time—this cannot be changed. Within a year it <emph>must</emph> be completed."</p>
               <p>"A plague upon your <hi rend="i"/>must," thought Arnolfo; and addressing the stranger—"Signor," said he, "although proud of the task you have intrusted to me, I am far from supposing that I deserve this mark of your confidence. I shall try, however, to prove my gratitude by my zeal and punctuality."</p>
               <p>"I doubt it not, Signor Arnolfo. But as I am about to quit Florence, and shall not return until the twelve months shall<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5993-00000101"/> have expired, will you be so good as to give me your ideas respecting the work which I have ordered?"</p>
               <p>"Willingly: and first, if you will agree with me, I would prefer for the subject a lover watching his expiring mistress. It is an object as touching as that which you mentioned, and I like it better for this reason, that it has in it nothing of the horrible. But I hazard a conjecture which does not, perhaps, accord with the purpose you intend it for. May I ask what is to be its destination?"</p>
               <p>"Time shall explain this. There is little difference between the glassy eyes of the dying and the closed eyes of the dead; yet, slight though that difference be, it marks the transition from one state to another, and between these states there is an abyss. As to the arrangement of the figures, I will endeavor to describe what I desire."</p>
               <p>He took up a piece of chalk, and drew upon the wall a sketch, hasty, yet exhibiting all the perfection of art. As the chalk followed the outline, animation seemed to spring up beneath it: but the young artist was astonished to see that he omitted the heads of both the figures.</p>
               <p>"Signor," said he, "I fear that my performance will not surpass the expectations of so great an artist. I feel that in carrying out your idea, I shall produce a great work, indeed."</p>
               <p>"I feel flattered," replied the stranger; "but my intention was to assist you, and not to dictate."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," continued Julio, whose admiration increased the more attentively he examined the sketch. "Pardon me, but I cannot conceal my surprise that so great a master as you should have omitted the heads of these figures. Surely you have some other reason than an apprehension of failing in the attempt?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, there are plenty of reasons, and good ones too. Here is one: I admire the judgment of that Greek artist who used to veil the face of his statues because he despaired of ever painting their passions with truth, and wished rather to leave them to the imagination of the spectator. But it grows late. The sum I have offered—do you think it sufficient?"</p>
               <p>Julio, amazed at the stranger's liberality, expressed his lively gratitude.</p>
               <p>"Here then is your money, Signor Arnolfo; but remember, it <emph>must</emph> be all completed in twelve months. Farewell!"</p>
               <p>He laid upon the table a purse filled with gold, and departed."</p>
               <p>Julio again applied himself to the examination of the design upon the wall; the beauty and truth of its execution threw him into an ecstasy. The more closely he observed it, the more his surprise increased. But when he recollected the solemnity with which his new patron had insisted on having the group completed within the appointed time—when he thought of his mysterious arrival, and of his refusal to tell the destination of the work, he felt a deep repugnance to the undertaking; and if the stranger had not gone away, he would probably have declined it altogether.</p>
               <p>But Julio was not of a character to give way to vain apprehension. Having put his workshop in order, and arranged his toilet like an amorous artist, as he was, he set out for the residence of Berta; and scarcely had he reached her door, when all these clouds disappeared, and with the pleasure of a child he told her what had occurred.</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant interview that evening between the lovers, for it was the first time they saw happiness within their reach. The tender heart of Berta showed itself in the tears which she shed in abundance; while Julio, with his usual ardor, narrated his plans, and drew lively pictures of future enjoyment. At<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5993-00000102"/> one time he would buy a villa on the banks of the Arno, where the presence of Berta would lend a charm to his labors: again, he resolved on remaining at Florence, and enjoying, together with his beloved, the sweets of that society into which his talents would soon introduce him. The fire of his looks, the rapidity of his utterance, the high tone of his voice, were indications of that superhuman joy which is believed to be the infallible mark of future woe.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Some months had passed away, and the work was not as yet commenced, nor did it appear likely that it would be finished within the appointed time.</p>
               <p>Berta, who had inherited from her mother a delicate constitution, began about this time to exhibit alarming symptoms of consumption. The circumstance was fatal to the studies of Julio; for it told him he would not long enjoy the presence of his beloved. He spent his whole time in endeavoring to divert and soothe her, anticipating from her gestures and looks her most trifling wants.</p>
               <p>Towards the close of a day in spring Berta was slumbering, while the unhappy Julio sat watching by her side. A little lamp, lighted before the image of the Virgin, cast a feeble light through the apartment. The cool breezes of evening played amongst the white curtains of the window before which she sat, and invited that repose which the oppressive heat of the day had not permitted her to enjoy. Julio fixed his look upon those pale and faded cheeks which a short while before were clothed with so many charms; and coldness fell upon his heart when he thought how rapidly all those charms had disappeared, and how all his dreams of happiness had passed away.</p>
               <p>These thoughts filled his soul with bitterness—his eyelids were wet with tears, but they would not flow—his heart was bursting, yet he could not sigh. With the anxious care of a nurse and the ardent affection of a husband, he leaned over the wasted body of Berta, whose mind was recalling in sleep the memory of departed joy. She was wandering on the flowery banks of the Arno with Julio by her side—a stream of tender pleasure stole softly round her heart, and with the energy of deep love she cried aloud, "Julio! Julio! wilt thou be always mine?"</p>
               <p>Ah! who can tell what Julio felt when he heard these words? The madness of love and the coldness of despair met within his bleeding heart. But his hour of trial had not yet passed—he was doomed to drink the cup of grief to the dregs.</p>
               <p>Stunned and motionless beneath the weight of his affliction, he allowed his eyes to wander unconsciously about the room. Suddenly he is seized with horror. The wall, on which his shadow and that of Berta are reflected, presents the most fearful resemblance to the sketch of the stranger. He saw at once, in the events of the few last months, the hand of a mysterious Providence, and the thought of approaching death fell heavily upon his heart; he felt his strength by degrees forsaking him, and he sunk down senseless upon the floor.</p>
               <p>The noise of his fall brought Giacomo, the brother of Berta, together with the nurse-tender, into the chamber; it also awakened Berta, and brought on such alarming symptoms, that Julio lay altogether neglected. To her all their care was directed, but the crisis was fatal. Her lungs were completely worn away, and the bursting of a blood-vessel put her forever beyond the reach of the sufferings of this world.</p>
               <p>How mysterious are the ways of Providence! Julio, whose grief had known no bounds, and who, on recovering his senses, had found so much fresh cause for sorrow, bore this cruel loss<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5993-00000103"/> without a tear. A little before, and he would not be consoled: now, he was able to administer consolation to others. So true is it that God, who visits us with afflictions, gives us strength to bear them, even as "He tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."</p>
               <p>While the young maidens, arrayed in robes of white, were carrying the mourned remains of Berta to the tomb—while they strewed flowers upon her coffin, they said—"Death has taken from Florence its fairest flower."</p>
               <p>Giacomo, overwhelmed with grief, was obliged to lean for support upon the arm of Julio, who, with calm demeanor and a tearless eye, approached the tomb in which they were about to lay the remains of his beloved. The bystanders beheld him with amazement: no one attributed his resignation to a want of feeling, yet they knew not its cause.</p>
               <p>The ceremony being concluded, Julio returned to his workshop to banish by labor the sad recollection of his sorrows He resumed with ardor the work he had so long neglected, allowing no one to see him at his task, and never leaving it unless when compelled by the solicitations of a few friends. A quiet melancholy took possession of him; and when his friends saw in his emaciated looks the indications of rapid decay, they expressed their profound regret at seeing him persevering with so much obstinacy in his unremitting labors. Night and day he was eagerly engaged in his mysterious task; he rose before the sun, and when midnight came his lamp was lighted still.</p>
               <p>But this could not last. One day Giacomo, who was a painter, wished to consult Julio on a question relating to his art. The signal which he used to make at the door received no reply. Giacomo, somewhat surprised, repeated it, but without success. This silence alarmed him—" Arnolfo, my beloved friend," he cried, "I wish to see you—speak to me, I pray you—if you are engaged, tell me at what hour I shall call again." The protracted silence excited in his mind a terrible suspicion: he applied his shoulder to the door and forced it open—and what was his amazement when he beheld Arnolfo seated before a group of the most sublime expression, his head leaning upon his hand, and apparently asleep. He tried to awaken him, but the icy coldness of his hands told too plainly that the sculptor's sleep was the sleep of death.</p>
               <p>At the foot of the group a small book lay open, and on the first page the following words were written: <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>
                           <div type="letter">
                              <head>"TO MY DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER, GIACOMO.</head>
                              <p>"By the love which I bore your sister, and by the friendship which has existed between us, I conjure you to fulfil the last request of a dying man. Let my body be laid in the same tomb with that of Berta, and let this monument be placed upon it, which, thanks to the Virgin, I have lived to finish. As to the gold which I have earned by my death, employ it in works of charity and in masses for the repose of our souls. Be not afraid that any one will ever come to claim it. He from whom I received it belongs not to this world. Adieu!"</p>
                           </div>
                        </body>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Giacomo was performing the last sad offices for his friend, when a man, wrapped in a large travelling-cloak, knocked loudly at the door. Provoked by what he conceived to be a rude intrusion into the house of mourning, he came forth to rebuke the untimely visitor; but he soon discovered, by the questions which the stranger asked, that he was the same mystic being whose former visit had been followed by such fatal results. He explained to him in a few words what had<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5993-00000104"/> occurred; and wishing to dispose of the statues according to the request of the artist, he offered to restore the money which Julio had received. But the stranger, though apparently disappointed, refused to take back his gold. Bidding adieu to Giacomo, he departed, and was heard of no more.</p>
               <p>The tomb of the lovers was long an object of curiosity, as well for the perfection of the figures that adorned it, as for the story with which it was connected. About the middle of the last century, the church in which it stood was consumed by fire, and this magnificent work was mingled with the dust of its ruins. These lines are now the only memorial of the <hi rend="i"/>Sculptor of Florence and the Mysterious Stranger.</p>

               <head>ROSE MAY, THE NEW SCHOOL-MISTRESS.</head>
               <head type="sub">A REMINISCENCE OF A NAMELESS VILLAGE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY F. H. STAUFFER.</head>
               <p>THE village schoolmaster, in olden times, was as much consulted as the oracle of Delphi; and though his answers were as mysteriously and as adroitly chosen as those that issued from the temple of Apollo, the questioner always rendered them tangible, or deduced some omen, either for or against himself. The domine, the parson, and the churchwarden of our village, as well as those of other villages, were as much respected and looked up to, as those who composed the famous Amphictyonic assembly which once guided Greece. They felt that they were entitled to the homage paid, and were piqued when the superiority of the "lords of the manor" over them was attested by the low bows and raised caps, when they chanced to come down among their tenants.</p>
               <p>But the sweetest recollection of my schoolboy-days, is the introduction of the first female teacher into our village. The proposal was received with joy by some, and with surprise and disdain by others. The domine raised his hands from astonishment and a want of words to express it, and seemed, at the moment, with his lugubrious visage still further elongated, a fit applicant as a mute to some undertaker. The parson burst out into a tirade of invectives, and the churchwarden, having no ideas of his own, and considering none necessary in the presence of two such illustrious personages, in his denunciations of enmity against the new measure,<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5993-00000105"/> adopted the invectives of one and the gestures of the other, thereby still further securing the friendship of both. He considered it an honor to be factotum to the domine and the parson, which was exhibited by the proud manner in which he strutted up the broad church aisle, on Sabbath-days, arrayed in his drab trowsers, starched dickey, and dark camlet jerkin.</p>
               <p>Public meetings were called in reference to the adoption of a female teacher, and almost as much commotion was created as, years before, the first outbreak of war at Lexington had occasioned. The public mind swayed to and fro like the waves of the ocean; now on one side, and then, beneath the desperate recoil, reaching far upon the beach of the other. The domine's uneasiness soon vanished, for he felt it impossible for anybody to misplace him in the eyes of the public. A young man, who appeared as though he had just made his debut from Bond-street, tried it once, but he signally failed. He was handsome, secured the good graces of the fair sex, and was just upon the point of stepping upon the highest pinnacle of his ambition, when a circumstance occurred that dashed him to the earth. A farmer's wife lodged complaint with the chief burgess, and stated that the same identical young man had been a seed and nick-nack peddler. She affirmed that he sold her an article which he called the "famous Glimiskarvie cabbage-seed," with the precaution that it was first to be raised in crocks or boxes; and the additional one, that she should be careful and not stand them upon the window-still, as the plants would increase so large and so rapidly, that they might push out the window! Under such circumstances, the parishioners could remain no longer unconvinced, and the new applicant was therefore dismissed. The domine was elated beyond measure, and did not fail to make the favorable decision the object of showing off his own <hi rend="i"/>superior self.</p>
               <p>But to return. It was concluded to decide the matter by ballot at the last meeting. The old sticklers for the long-continued regimen were defeated. Upon the night in question, some mischievous wag, to the dismay of the sexton, had stolen the clapper of the town bell, and folks were not reminded of the appointment. The parson had discovered a huge rent in his cassock, and during the time his "gude wife" was engaged in repairing it, the hour of meeting slipped by. He, like Cæsar, "would rather have been the first man in a village than the second one in Rome;" and, as he could not be there in time to become the president of the meeting (and never debasing himself so much as to play second fiddle to anybody), he did not go at all. The domine had "to go and bury his father," a duty he considered paramount to the subject <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in esse</foreign>. The churchwarden, in his humility, felt he was a mere cipher, as void and out of place as an incidental clause divested of its two extent-limiting parentheses. He absented himself. And the young voters, who ever loved the smiles and approving nods of the fair sex, and abhorred "cross purposes," repaired to the schoolhouse, humming the then popular air of <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"To ladies' eyes around, boys,</l>

               <p>Domines of all ages have been noted for their sternness, and also for occasional exhibitions of puerileness. Seneca, even while penning his essays on tranquillity of mind, gave evidence that he did not apply them to himself, by his pettish remark<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5993-00000106"/> upon the frequent intrusion into his studio. And Basil, even while endeavoring to beat his own beautiful homilies into the brains of thick-headed Ganymedes, revealed perturbating spirits. The domine was thunderstruck at the decision, and was as much depressed as he had before been elated at the downfall of the seed-peddler. He could hardly believe that, by being weighed in a balance with a "woman," he had been found wanting.</p>
               <p>What a time there was when the old-fashioned stage-coach, in which Rose May was expected to arrive, came lumbering up the old dusty city road! All the folks were on the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign>. The little town was alive, and all the ladies seemed to have chosen that day to do their marketing and shopping; and the beau-ideal clerks of the village stores were at a loss to what to attribute the sudden rush. The old gossips and satellites of Madam Rumor sat under their door-ways, plying their needles or circulating scandal to the humming of their spinning-wheels. Ragged urchins threw away their hawkies, and stopped short in their games of chuck-farthing. The blacksmith threw off his smutty apron, and laid his sledge across the anvil; and the joiner let the glue cool that he had been so long waiting to arrive at the true point for use. The boot-black, with a grin that revealed his white teeth, and put a body forcibly in mind of a steel trap, ready set, rubbed vigorously at a boot, that was far from being a Wellington, without the hostelry. The barber and his customer, the one with razor in hand and the other minus one whisker, hurried to the door.</p>
               <p>When the stage drew up at the Red Lion, there crowded around such an assemblage of bar-room loafers and urchins as was never chronicled in the annals of any village. The arms and limbs of some stuck out of their clothing as though, in their hurry, they had put on that of a younger brother. Then again there were some arrayed in the other extreme, with coats on that were decidedly <hi rend="i"/>overalls. Many were barefooted, and many had a shoe on one foot badly mated with the boot on the other. They were noisy and clamorous, and like the wiseacres whom they copied after, had taken to betting upon the probable appearance of the expected teacher. When the driver sprang down from the box and threw open the stage door, there stepped out a portly gentleman of immense rotundity, who would have been capable of acting Falstaff without stuffing. The fat man came puffing and rolling up the steps, like a hogshead of sugar unloaded from a dray, and by a series of manœuvres in which he presented himself sideways, like a corporal's <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chapeau bras</foreign> braced sharp up against the wind, gained admittance into the bar-room. The spectators stood aghast. The young'uns tumbled over one another in their efforts to make room for such a moving mountain of flesh, and the old'uns began to conjecture upon the number of pounds he would weigh. The driver unharnessed the horses, watered them with water and himself with brandy, and took them into the stable and himself into the hotel. There was a disappointment all round. The crowd scattered: a few remaining urchins swung upon the tongue of the stage, or blew several <emph>un</emph>official blasts upon the horn, to the dismay of the fat man, who had but <emph>commenced</emph> his set-to at the table. Several of the older persons lingered by, probably to see what his bill of fare would be; and the waiter, with a face as white as his neat pinafore, strode ever and anon into the bar-room to acquaint the host of the disappearance of a <emph>host</emph> of victuals and viands.</p>
               <p>But a slight circumstance, and yet the one that had been the principal object of their look-out, escaped the notice of all.<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5993-00000107"/> Nobody expected that the stage could possibly have contained another person besides the fat man, even if that person had been a Lilliputian; and during the controversy and distracted attention, a beautiful young lady, habited in a black silk pelisse, a festucine dress, and an envious little straw bonnet, stepped out of the opposite side of the coach.</p>
               <p>The latter was the next day again beset, and would have been for a week to come, had it not got noised abroad that the new school-mistress had already arrived. When that fact became fully established, almost everybody had seen her pass down the street. Discussions and acclamations ran high. Some said that she was tall; others, short. Some, homely; some, beautiful. Some that she had on a black mantilla; others, a green one. Some said her bonnet was straw, and some that it was silk; some that it was white, some that it was black, and many that it was neither white nor black, but an orient pink.</p>
               <p>Other improvements followed the entrance of the schoolteacher: the district-school measure came into operation, and such a change over the state of affairs, and that so quickly, that the domine could not help thinking that he must have been taking a nap for a score of years, like the famous Rip Van Winkle. The <emph>old</emph> New England Primer was discarded for one not a whit better. The English Reader was thrown aside for somebody's series, that led the pupil up grade by degrees, while at the same time and with the same ratio, sank a shaft deep into the pocket of his sponsor. A grammar by one of the redoubtable <emph>Smiths</emph> superseded that of Lindley Murray; and Bonnycastle had to pass the palm for the best algebra over to Davies.</p>
               <p>How beautiful our new teacher appeared when she was ensconced in the new school-house built after the first levying of taxes. She was young and joyous, without any of the dark, disagreeable expressions that made our young hearts recoil like at the sight of a basilisk. She won our young hearts by her winning manners, and we would have fought for her with desperation. No bunches of supple whangers or birchen rods hung, as in days of yore, over the old arm-chair, as a terror to all evil-doers and delinquents. No ferule, with the spoon polished by frequent usage, came in contact with, or drew blood from our tender palms. No rulers, with a whirring noise, buried themselves in the plaster of the wall behind us, or landed with a terrible clatter upon the desk before us, demolishing our structures of slate-pencils, spools, and pins, upon the examination of which, the greatest philosophers would have been at a loss to know whether they were intended for miniature cabins or instruments by which to tell the brightest stars in the galaxy. No stentorian voice, that caused the little urchins on the low front benches to shake in their trowsers, and the older ones in the background to appear sober and thoughtful, followed the flight of the missile through the air, commanding the <emph>walking</emph> target to bring it up to the stand. A pleasant look from Rose May was worth a dozen scowls from the domine, and was more implicitly obeyed. At first there were several outbreaks while she had her face down behind the high desk to put the head-lines on the copies. A bombardment with wet paper balls would be carried on by different factions, and sometimes a tattered spelling-book, apple-core, or other contraband missile, in representation of a "forty-six pounder," made its advent through the air. Bartering and pilfering were carried on with a high hand, and effigies of Don Quixote and his inimitable squire could be seen dangling by wet "papier mache" from the ceiling. At such times she would make no remark, but greet us with such<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5993-00000108"/> a sad look, that the misgivings at our hearts overbalanced by far the momentary pleasure we experienced. There was one stubborn lad among us, Pat Malowny, who declared that he would succumb to no woman. He had been hard to manage by the male teachers, and they would have to, after chastising him, apply lotions and brown salve to sore shins and sundry bites about their persons. Rose May heard him bragging, and as she more fully studied his character, she matured plans by which to conquer him.</p>
               <p>A few weeks after Rose May's administration, May-day arrived. She had promised us a holiday, and we had held meetings upon the subject prior; in one of which Rose May stated that there ought to be some one to assist her in keeping order and piloting the troop to the chosen grounds. The choice was left to us by vote, and what a glorious time that voting was! The like had never been heard of before, and we all watched with increasing delight the developing of every "new-fangled notion." Rose May privately instructed us to vote for Pat Malowny, and he was unanimously elected. The astonishment depicted upon his features at the announcement cannot be portrayed. He who, like Howitt's Jack-o'-the-Mill, could twist himself into a bee-knot, or clamber up the spouting upon the roofs of the houses and drop bits of brick and plaster down the chimney into the porridge-pot, to the dismay of the good folks below; <emph>he</emph>, a dirty, contemptible Irish boy, whom nobody loved and everybody despised, to be made and freely elected assistant chaperon to the party! Why it was astounding, and he could hardly believe his own senses! Other bright, thoughtful boys, who loved their teacher, and considered it the greatest boon to administer to her happiness, and whom she loved in return; who were ever at their respective posts, yielding and submissive; who marked their going out and their coming in with a low, graceful bow, and deposited regularly every morning during their season, a red-cheeked apple, bell-pear, or a plump, delicious peach, upon her desk, to be rejected, and <emph>he</emph>, a numskull, chosen! He bent his head, as if the wand of a fairy enchantress had been passed before his vision. There was, in truth, a fairy hand at work, and the spell that was rising like incense, emanated from the censer of kindness; yet the coals of its fire were not heaped upon his head, but a wooing sweetness interwoven with the whole. He appeared with a clean and smiling face upon the day in question, revealing a prepossessing appearance that never before could be observed beneath the constant coating of dirt. During the excursion he was as kind and confiding as could have been wished. He helped those carefully over ditches whom it once would have been his greatest pleasure, by a show of accident, to lodge in the centre. Pat Malowny was a great climber, and he was useful to the party in that point. There was not a boy for miles around could match him at <emph>that</emph>. He would often climb rocks to a height that made much hardier folks tremble. No bird's-nests were safe from his depredations, even if they were as high and inaccessible as a magpie's or a stork's. He would climb trees as straight and taller than the main-mast of the Pennsylvania line-of-battle ship, and by holding on with one hand by a wild gooseberry bush, that had grown out of the black mould where once had been a bough, search out with the other the hole or some tomtit or woodpecker. One time, by means of the quoin-stones and spouting, he ascended the old church-tower and gave a long and additional peal to the bell after it had passed the hands of the sexton. This trick occasioned more consternation than the extra peal in the beautiful story of "the Thirteenth Chime," and the sexton, who was naturally superstitious<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5993-00000109"/> stitious, could not help thinking that the great spirit of Notre Dame had taken up his quarters in our quiet village kirk. A crowd gathered, and at last a formidable troop were drummed up to examine the cause of the strange phenomenon. They marched slowly and cautiously up the long winding stairs of the tower. The clapper still rang out several faint and dying peals, but no living thing was visible. Those below, however, who had not mustered courage enough to join in the ascent, beheld, first the curly head and then the breech of Pat Malowny, appear through the narrow belfry window, and in a moment more he was standing at an immense height upon the brass ball, sustaining himself by one hand at the slender rod of the spire, and with the other directing the gilded vane in a direction opposite to which it had pointed prior.</p>
               <p>Pat Malowny gathered flowers for the party from the most inaccessible rocks, and fashioned swings for the girls from the dangling grape-vines. There was no fighting, no quarrelling; all went on as by the hand of magic. He evinced judgment and foresight plausible, and those who voted for him from compulsion or request, were surprised, and attended to his mildly-uttered commands with joy and alacrity. Bright-eyed girls smiled sweetly upon him, and the beaming glances which they cast upon him revealed that they saw traits and beauty that they did not know he possessed, and amply repaid him for his trouble. From that day Pat Malowny was an altered boy. Those that said he would be an hostler at some inn, were surprised to find him, years after, a great and eminent lawyer and statesman, and those who prophesied that he would stretch a hempen cord, found him, finally, a judge of the Supreme Court. He was killed by kindness, and in this fact there lies a moral; but I will not dissert upon it, for words are more indelibly impressed when they are drawn out by the thoughtful themselves. No school ever prospered greater, and parents were astonished at the wisdom exhibited by their protegés. There was no skulking about in the morning, or time wasted by doing "chores," that run the school hours on to noon and made it useless then to go. No. We were all up betimes, and sped to our places in a straight line like the bee, and not in the devious course of the butterfly. We went with the song of the lark on our lips, and not the wail of the whippoorwill. There was an attraction at school that was irresistible. We were not doing penance <emph>then!</emph> no indeed! the hours flitted by too fast for <emph>that!</emph> Prizes, premiums, spelling on sides, and themes for thought and action without number, were brought into play by the new school-mistress. She was joyous and happy, and the same feeling was by proximity instilled into us. Her Christian name was short and quaint, yet still had one letter more than our first female parent, Eve. Her whole name was a beautiful couplet, designating her beauty and character, and there was something fluttering like an imprisoned dove in the bosoms of the young men of the village when they were happy enough to secure a smile from her, or a momentary glance from her dark bewitching eyes. The statue of Memnon sang when the morning sun first stooped to kiss it, but Rose May sang whether it <emph>rose</emph> or set. She was as happy in shade as in sunshine, in cloudy weather as in clear. No opportunity escaped her by which she could impart to us knowledge. By almost every simple plaything we possessed, she revealed to us principles of some grand law or other that astonished us and made us feel awed at her superior wisdom. By the sling she explained the centrifugal and centripetal forces, and which was overpowered when the stone passed through the air; in our leather suckers, by which we hoisted large stones, she explained the atmospheric<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5993-00000110"/> spheric pressure and delivered to us an agreeable lecture on pneumatics, and in the bounding of a gum-elastic ball she explained the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. Rose May was the same "<hi rend="i"/>rose" in "<hi rend="i"/>May" as in December, and though she bowed her head in humility, like a rose upon its stem, it was not because the people did not look upon her with joy and pride. The day of the domine's dynasty was over. He sighed like the last of the Mohicans, and was incensed when our voices rang out into the air as we passed by his domicile. <emph>We</emph> to laugh! why we had not even dared to <emph>think</emph> during his reign, that is, if those thoughts were beyond his own comprehension. If we could have had the elements within us that burst out in their fulness from Sir Isaac Newton or "Cripple Wattie" (Sir Walter Scott), they would not even have <emph>dawned</emph> there! We, however, treated our old master kindly, and with pretty Rose May as our prompter, often thrust bouquets and small baskets of nuts or fruit under his window. The villagers ever afterwards paused at the introduction of a new thing into the village ere they crushed it to the earth unheard. So much good had been wrought, and such a lesson taught them, that it was not easily forgotten. The young voters of the village, who greeted the new mistress with one voice, did not lose their ardor for improvements as they advanced in years.</p>
               <p>From <emph>that</emph> nameless little village, like from other little villages, there arose some bright stars, and not a few of those who were taught by the domine and then by Rose May, which seemed like a change from the hot and glaring sun to the sweet, pare rays of the moon, took their stations among the leaders of the people. Sublime thought, which is beautiful, is nursed in the lap of sorrow and indigence, and many of those who have inscribed their names upon the temple of fame as far above the reach of aspiring followers as that of the noble George Washington's on the huge bastions of the Natural Bridge, were born in a rustic village and breathed the free air of mountain and of valley. In a few years Rose May left us, and then there were as many crowded around the stage as at her arrival; but with a different emotion—and that emotion was not of joy. She was of high birth; her parents were wealthy, and she had by no means taught school to obtain a livelihood. Some altercation with a lover whom she adored, had caused the movement. She afterwards learnt and discovered beyond a doubt, that she had been in the wrong, and, determined to make all the reparation in her power, she returned to her native home. Her discarded lover had endeavored to drown his grief in wine, and was pressing hard upon the road to ruin. There was none could save but her, and she did save. She entered the house to which he so often bent his steps, and found him with his stiff, neglected beard pressing the goblet's rim. A veil was drawn closely over her face, and her absence had improved her beyond recognition without a glimpse at her features. She put her hand upon his shoulder and beckoned to him to follow her. He stood astonished. His own, and the tankards of his companions, were brought down to the table, not with a shout and a ring, but slowly and in silence. He appeared as thunderstruck as the rough-featured Amphimedon when the lovely Penelope discarded Æsculanus, the Roman god of riches, and breathed joy and hope into his own ears. Rose May's lover followed his unknown yet angelic guide, and never afterwards did the filthy air of a bar-room taint his lips. He and Rose May were married, and with them life seemed without a thorn, and every month in the year smiling, beautiful, enchanting <hi rend="i"/>May.</p>

                  <l>The breath a loving sister breathes, fell not</l>

                  <l>No brother's own might touch, grew chill as ice</l>
                  <l>Within a grasp it never felt before.</l>
                  <l>A dull, deep voice, as of a distant flood,</l>

                  <l>His only couch was the dark native floor;</l>
                  <l>No pillow bore his head; and on his limbs,</l>
                  <l>All shivering as the waves of Death dashed in</l>
                  <l>Upon his soul, no covering was spread.</l>

                  <l>Where mirrors flashed their lights, and music charmed</l>
                  <l>The hearth; where gorgeous tapestries were hung</l>

                  <l>Reeling and staggering from his native land,</l>
                  <l>Plunged in the perils of a foreign shore,</l>
                  <l>Bounding for joy, he sank in early woe—</l>

               <head>A TALE.</head>
               <head type="sub">FROM THE FRENCH OF S. H. BERTHOND.</head>
               <p>No one in France has forgotten the name of the ferocious Blucher, that Prussian field-marshal so often beaten by our generals, and fairly conquered at the battles of Jena and Auërstadt; who escaped from General Klein by a wretched evasion at the capitulation of Preuzlau; a coward at Lubeck, where he was made prisoner at the head of thirty thousand men; whose defeats have been witnessed by Bautzen, Lutzen, Vauchamp, and St. Amand; and who, through the obstinate error of Napoleon, gained for the English the bloody field of Waterloo. His brutal conduct when as conqueror he appeared in Paris, is also well remembered; to hear him, one would have thought France was to be hewn to pieces, and her capital consumed to ashes. It has been known how unsparingly he pillaged, not only the museums, but even the royal palaces. St. Cloud can testify to his ignoble rapacity: thirty carriages loaded with costly furniture, pictures, and other valuable articles of which he had plundered it, were dispatched by him to Germany as part of his private spoil; it was thus he became possessed of the celebrated <title>Passage of the Alps</title>, by David. He desired, moreover, that the property of those whom he regarded as the promoters of the contest should be confiscated; and the energetic will of the Emperor Alexander alone prevented his requiring the disarmament of the Paris National Guards; he even wished that they should surrender as prisoners of war. Not one of the chiefs of the allied army approved the conduct of Blucher, and his king himself tried in vain to humanize his cruel nature. Often obliged to countermand<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5993-00000114"/> termand his savage orders, that prince was forced continually to appease the barbarian by new benefits; he even honored him with an order created expressly for him, the badge of which was an iron cross encircled with rays of gold.</p>
               <p>Blucher quitted France in the autumn, dissatisfied with every one, execrated not only by the French, but by their enemies. Chagrined at being reduced to a state of inaction and obscurity, he retired to his estates, where he sunk into a profound melancholy, and was soon after attacked by dropsy on the chest, with an inflammation, of which his apprehensions increased the danger. Thenceforth a strange alteration was visible on his brutal character. The rough soldier became timid and fearful; he could no longer endure to remain in darkness; one moment of darkness would throw him into a singular degree of agitation; and such was the uneasiness excited by his condition, that the king of Prussia prepared to set out for Krieblowitz the instant he was apprised that the old general had several times expressed a desire to see him once more before his death.</p>
               <p>It was night when the monarch arrived at the chateau, and desired to be immediately conducted to Blucher. The veteran, then in his seventy-fourth year, was seated in an ancient hall, dim and vast, the antique furniture of which, dating at latest from the fifteenth century, added indescribably to its gloomy aspect. The walls were covered with suits of armor and trophies of the chase, partially lighted by the flame of an immense hearth, which cast its fitful and sombre gleam upon the grim features of the old man, wrapped in bear-skins, and half reclining in a great armchair of black oak. On the approach of the sovereign he would have risen to receive him, but the latter forbid him by an imperative gesture, and taking his hand, sat down beside him. Blucher abruptly motioned the attendants ants to leave him alone with the king. All at once obeyed. Then, raising himself painfully in his chair, he was silent for a few moments. "Sire," said he at length, "I have prayed you to undertake this journey to Krieblowitz. I knew that you would be present at the reviews which are to be held in this district during the autumn. But I feel that I could not wait for that occasion; and were you at Berlin—were you even at the farthest extremity of Europe—rather than not to see you, I would have set out, dying as I am; I would have sought your presence, for I have a terrible reason to know that my days are numbered and few. This reason I will reveal to you; and before I do so, sire, look well upon me; scrutinize the expression of my features, of my eyes, the tone of my voice, the order of my ideas. Assure yourself that I am in the full possession of my senses, and that I have not grown insane; for there are moments when I ask myself if I am not a madman, who takes for memories of the past the visions of yester'eve. But no," added he, drawing a gold bracelet from his bosom, "no, all this is true; it is real and certain. I cannot doubt it in any particular—therefore hear me, sire. When the seven years' war broke out in 1756, my father, who was living on his estates of Gross-Renzow, sent my brother and me to one of our relations, the princess of Kraswick, in the island of Rugen. I was then fourteen; and after spending some time in the old fortress without receiving any tidings of my family since Gross-Renzow and the surrounding country had become the theatre of war, I entered the service of Sweden in a regiment of hussars. I was taken prisoner at the affair of Suckow, and the Prussian commanders pressed me to accept a post in their service. I resisted their persuasions during an entire year, and obtained my liberty at length, only on condition of being enrolled as a cornet in the famous black<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5993-00000115"/> hussars. I reserved, however, a right of leave for some months, since during sixteen years I had never heard the least intelligence of my friends, and my mind was filled with a well-grounded anxiety for the fate of my mother and sisters. Therefore, the first use I made of my freedom, was to proceed towards Gross-Renzow. On my way I found all that part of Mecklenburgh-Schwerin horribly ravaged; and becoming more uneasy at every step, while my coach made but tardy progress along the steep and neglected road which led to my ancestral domain, I quitted it for a horse, and pressed forward at full speed, followed by a single servant. It was forty-four years ago to the very day, the twelfth of August, and almost the same hour indicated by that antique timepiece—half past eleven—for a frightful tempest was roaring through the woods, the thunder pealed, the lightning flashed, the rain fell in torrents, and I had wandered long in the gloomy forest before I found my way to the gate of the chateau. I then perceived that I was alone, and that my attendant, confused, no doubt, by the darkness and the storm, had failed to keep pace with my impatient speed.</p>
               <p>Without alighting, I knocked with the handle of my whip on the massive door, heavily plated with iron and bristling with great nails. No person answered the summons. I repeated it three times, and still no one replied. At last, losing patience, I sprang to the ground, and the gate immediately opened before me, yet no one appeared to have rendered me that service. Without particularly noticing the strangeness of the incident at the time, I left my horse, and, after traversing the avenue, I ascended the steps, and easily penetrated into the interior of the dwelling. There all was darkness and profound silence. I will own it, my heart sank, and a thrill of involuntary fear ran through my frame, but I soon shook it off.</p>
               <p>"What folly," said I, "to expect that I should find the chateau inhabited! No doubt my family quitted it at the same time I did, and have not returned since our general departure, as the country was so disturbed. No matter! having come to this deserted spot, I must only try to pass the night in it as well as I can."</p>
               <p>So saying, I made my way through several of the old rooms, till I reached my father's bed-chamber. Here, to my surprise, a half-extinguished fire was glimmering among the ashes of the hearth, and by its dubious and imperfect light, I beheld my father, my mother, and my four sisters, seated sadly by the expiring embers. They rose as I entered. I advanced to throw myself into my father's arms: he repressed my advance with a solemn gesture. I stretched my arms towards my mother: she withdrew mournfully. I called on each of my sisters by name: they only clasped each other's hands in silence—then all slowly resumed their seats.</p>
               <p>"Do you not remember me?" cried I in an agony of grief and disappointment. "Is it thus that a family should receive a son and brother after so many years of separation? Have you already heard of my entering the Prussian service?—but I could not do otherwise. My liberty, the happiness of seeing you, were set at this price! Think that during sixteen years I have never been able to learn whether or not you still existed. Parted from you by incessant wars, in the service of Sweden for many years, and then a prisoner, I had no opportunity of relieving my anxiety and my doubts. You see that the first use I have made of my freedom has been to seek you here, where I could scarcely hope to find you, but where, at least, I believed it possible that I might obtain some traces to guide me in my search. And now, my father, you will not embrace me! My mother, you are silent! My sisters, have<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5993-00000116"/> you forgotten the tenderness of our infancy, and our happy plays, so often witnessed by these very scenes?"</p>
               <p>At these words my sisters appeared to be moved—they whispered together for a while, then rose, motioning me to approach, and one of them knelt down before my mother, hiding her head in her lap, as children do in some of their games. Surprised at this strange fantasy, in a moment of such solemnity, I touched her hand lightly with the whip I held. As I did so, I know not why, an irresistible force impelled me to join their game. It was my turn to kneel, and as I laid my head in my mother's lap, oh, terror, beneath the heavy silk of her robe, I felt a cold and rugged form—I heard a dull noise like that of dry bones striking together, and the hand which I had clasped remained in mine—it was that of a skeleton! I started up with a cry of horror; all had disappeared, and nothing remained of this fearful vision but the bones of a hand strained convulsively in my grasp. I flung it from me in affright, and, maddened, senseless, half-distracted, I fled from this horrible place. Rushing into the court, I found my horse, and flinging myself into the saddle instinctively, I set off at full gallop, without either knowing or caring whither I went, but chance directed my course towards the forest. At break of day my horse, exhausted by fatigue, fell dead, and in his fall threw me so violently to the ground that I was stunned by the shock. My people, uneasy at my prolonged absence, came to seek me, and after some hours discovered me lying under the dead horse at the foot of a tree, with a deep wound in my head. They long despaired of my life, and it was only when my reason returned, after three weeks of burning fever, agony, and delirium, that they conceived a hope of my recovery. I then learned, for the first time, that all my family had fallen victims to the pitiless war which had wasted Mecklenburgh, and that the Chateau of Gross-Renzow in particular, had been repeatedly sacked and pillaged. When scarcely convalescent, I repaired a second time to the place, to have the last duties paid to the mortal remains of my family, but the most scrupulous researches failed to discover the smallest vestige of them. One hand alone, a woman's hand, encircled by a golden chain, was lying in the chamber where the fatal vision had appeared to me; I took the bracelet, which I have always worn, as you see, in my breast, and placed the human relics in the oratory of the castle.</p>
               <p>Many long years rolled by. Alone in the world, I devoted myself to your majesty's armies, and but for this chain would have entirely forgotten the events which I have related to you. However, one night about two months ago, I was asleep in this armchair, when a slight noise aroused me. My father, my mother, and my four sisters were again before me as formerly in the castle of Gross-Renzow. Again the four prepared to repeat their shadowy game; again they signed me to advance, but the horrors of that night rushed vividly upon my memory. "No!" cried I: "no, never!" The phantoms turned their dim eyes on me with a faint smile, and then all taking hands moved slowly round my chair.</p>
               <p>"Justice!" whispered my father, as he passed me.</p>
               <p>"Penitence!" murmured my mother, bending towards me her mournful head.</p>
               <p>"Prayer!" uttered my eldest sister, in an earnest voice.</p>
               <p>"Destiny!" sighed the next, who had been my favorite.</p>
               <p>Then the third exclaimed sadly, "The twelfth of August!" And the youngest scarce audibly breathed the words: "At midnight!" Three times they moved past me, repeating the same words, and then their funereal voices joined as they<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5993-00000117"/> slowly said, "We shall meet again!" So they faded from my view; I then comprehended that my destiny was about to be fulfilled, and that there remained nothing more for me to do on earth but to recommend my soul to God, and my household to your majesty—to see you once more, and pray you to remember a faithful servant." "My dear marshal," said the king, "what you tell me is certainly very strange! Do you not think that fever and delirium may have had some share in those two visions? Come, you must have courage; struggle against these fancies, and be of good cheer. You will soon recover, and perhaps live many years yet. Will you not believe me? Come, come, give me your hand, my friend."</p>
               <p>As Blucher did not reply, the King of Prussia took the old man's hand in his own.</p>
               <p>It was icy cold, and as the monarch started from his seat midnight sounded from the antique time-piece of the hall.</p>
               <p>Field-Marshal Gerhart Lebrecht Von Blucher was dead!</p>

               <head>MY EARLY FRIEND.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY FRANCISC. WOODWORTH.</head>
               <p>I was born, and, until I had begun to look upon myself as almost a man, was brought up in the country. My father was a farmer, and lived in one of the rural agricultural districts of Connecticut. Aye, I was a country boy, and my heart throbs with new life now, as I think of the pleasures of those early days—pleasures of which the boy who is pent up in a city knows nothing. I never think of the country, wild, secluded, rude, almost solitary, though it may be—I never come in contact, so to speak, with the electrical current of rural life, without feeling a warm of enthusiasm thrilling through my soul. At once, if my judgment will allow such liberties, the genius of memory brings up before the mind a thousand charms peculiar to country life. Troops of pleasant associations come, crowding each other along; memories of the sweet birds and flowers; of birds and flowers, for the two can never be dissociated; of miniature wind-mills and water-mills; of long rambles, hand in hand with a sister, now in heaven, by the side of the beautiful brook, running laughingly over its stony bed, near the old farmhouse; of sassafras and sweet flag; of hickory nuts and striped squirrels; of skating and of building snow-forts.</p>
               <p>But I must not let these memories run away with my readers, whatever license I may accord to them with respect to myself.</p>
               <p>One of the companions of my boyhood whom I most esteemed, was Edwin Sherwood. That he was a better boy than most of his fellows at the village school, I think it not unlikely I should find it difficult now to demonstrate. Perhaps I could not have demonstrated it then, technically. I was not, how ever, the less sure that I loved Edwin better than most of my young acquaintances. The heart, if it needs demonstration at all, does not care for that kind of demonstration which is constructed of accurate syllogisms. Edwin was one of my favorites; I liked him. The precise reason why, inasmuch as we were very unlike, in most respects, might have puzzled me as much as it puzzled one quite as philosophically inclined as myself, to tell why he did <emph>not</emph> like Doctor Fell. Fortunately, however, the key of that enigma is not very essential to the chapter; it is my purpose to sketch from the history of Edwin Sherwood.</p>
               <p>Omitting the incidents of his earlier life, when we were schoolboys together—his passage through the ordeal of a country store, his promotion to a clerkship in a mercantile house of greater note, in a neighboring village—we come to a more important era in his history. He is to leave his native State for a home in the City of New York. Aye, young man, it is an important era; it is one of thrilling and solemn interest in the history of every youth, when he breaks away from all the restraints of the quiet home of his childhood in the country, and becomes a citizen of this great metropolis. By thousands accustomed only to the routine of mercantile life in the country, and who sigh to move in a more extended sphere, it is not so regarded Nay, <emph>you</emph> do not so regard it, and are disposed to smile at this remark. But it is nevertheless true, and you may one day find it so, possibly to your cost. I must not be understood as condemning, indiscriminately, the desire, so common, among young men educated in the country, to remove to the city; still less as expressing, however indirectly, the notion that such a removal, in a moral, or in any other respect, is necessarily for the worse. This only do I affirm, that that point<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5993-00000119"/> in a young man's path, at which he exchanges the country for the city, is a most solemn and momentous one.</p>
               <p>The parents of my friend felt that it was so, when they acceded to the request of their son, and made the arrangements for his removal. He had enjoyed the advantages of judicious, well-directed discipline. So far, all was favorable. The moral and religious principles which those excellent parents inculcated in their family, and, what is better, enforced by a uniformly exemplary life, it was hoped, were thoroughly engrafted into his constitution. What a power there is in these principles, where they are allowed to germinate in early childhood, and are faithfully and devoutly fostered by parental care, in succeeding years. Had they penetrated the heart of Edwin Sherwood, and taken such deep root there as to exclude those faults which poison the affections, and render the soul a moral desert? Those parental precepts and examples; those prayers and tears; the kind influence of that loving sister; all the precious associations connected with home; are they all united and entwined as they must be, around the young man's heart, of sufficient strength to hold him securely, when new and different influences are brought to bear upon him?</p>
               <p>That question came up in the minds of those parents, though neither dared to utter it audibly, as they gave Edwin their parting blessing. They each had fears as well as hopes. But their hopes were stronger than their fears.</p>
               <p>Edwin commenced his career in New York as a clerk in a wholesale mercantile house in Pearl Street. He was competent, efficient, faithful. Moreover, there fell to his lot a generous share of that shrewdness so frequently ascribed—I will not stop to inquire with how much justice—to New Englanders generally, and the people of Connecticut in particular. "That Sherwood," it was a common remark of the senior partner, "can see a great way into a mill-stone." As may be supposed, Edwin was not, on this account, less esteemed by his employers, who, before he had been with them six months, gave him a token, more substantial and tangible than words, that they were well disposed to him.</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" and what was that token?" Nothing more, nothing less, than a complete suit of clothes, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la mode</foreign>. Aye, and they did well in so doing. They acted wisely; and what is better, humanely and generously. I know there are many, and I am inclined to think the number is not few, who will not agree with me in this verdict. They would pay their <hi rend="i"/>employees a stipulated sum, which, by mutual agreement, should be a fair equivalent for the services rendered, and with that payment they would stop; beyond that they would not advance an inch. They disapprove of all perquisites, as calculated to establish mischievous precedents, and to produce evil results in many ways. How many men—merchants, farmers, mechanics—there are, well disposed, wise and judicious, in the main, who consider their part performed to those in their employ, when they have treated them well, and paid them all they agreed to pay them.</p>
               <p>But is it so? Is it the part either of sagacity or humanity, either of worldly wisdom or true Christianity, to bind no other than a legal bond between the employer and the employed? To create and sustain such rules of commerce between the two classes, as to transform the latter into a Shylock, clamoring for literal conformity to the terms of his bond, and which shall absolve the former, morally, as well as in a legal sense, when he has conformed to those terms? Is it good policy, to say nothing of any higher consideration, for the employer so to suppress the feelings of his better nature, as to measure his kind words and acts towards those in his employ, as a despicable miser doles<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5993-00000120"/> out his long-hoarded gold and silver? I cannot believe it possible.</p>
               <p>Edwin's employers were of the same opinion. They encouraged their clerks, when they were faithful, by kind words and deeds. And, I repeat it, they did well in so doing. But they might have done more. They ought to have done more, methinks. They were deficient precisely where, it is to be feared, a great majority of merchants and master mechanics in our cities are deficient in their duty, to their apprentices and clerks. The estimable gentlemen composing the firm to which Edwin was attached, were utterly ignorant of the manner in which their clerks spent that portion of their time—more than three-fourths—not devoted directly to the interests of the establishment; how they were occupied at night; how on the Sabbath. Neither of these men were ever known to have inquired as to the habits of these young men during this time, much less to have endeavored, wisely and modestly, to weave around them such a net-work of healthful, moral and religious influences as would have a powerful tendency to shield them from those other influences, to yield to which, is to pierce the heart with wretched anguish, and to pave the road to ruin. Most, or all these young men, instead of enjoying the benefits of the family circle, lived at different hotels, where it is almost impossible to secure the restraints and charms, and endearments of home.</p>
               <p>"But these clerks were not boys," I hear some one reply. "They were men, and capable of taking care of themselves. It is no part of a merchant's business to play the spy with his clerks."</p>
               <p>There is quite as much error as truth in these statements. Some of these clerks were youths, under the age of twenty-one. But grant that they were men. They were <emph>young</emph> men, and for the most part, from the country, entirely ignorant of the thousand snares which are set for them by fiends and fiendish men and women in a large city. Besides, suppose a young man is old enough to be discreet, and to be capable of taking care of himself, does it then follow that he <emph>will</emph> take care of himself, and that those upon whom he has some claim for sympathy and care, are relieved from all responsibility in relation to his moral and spiritual interests?</p>
               <p>Edwin found companions, of a reputable and virtuous character; and he found other companions too; young men, who, under the guise of real friendship, aimed at his downfall. They sought means to betray their victim as Judas betrayed his divine Master—with a kiss. O had some voice of warning from the lips of one whom he loved, and in whose judgment he confided, fallen upon his ear, when that tempter was beginning to entangle the unsuspecting youth in his wiles, with what ease might he have been saved? But no such voice was heard.</p>
               <p>"Will you walk with me to-night?" With what a friendly and affectionate tone was that question asked Edwin, one day, perhaps some eight months after his removal to the city. Who asked the question, with such a pleasing air? One who, although but a few years Edwin's senior, was an accomplished libertine, with art sufficient not only to conceal his real character, but to win the love of his innocent and virtuous associates. "Will you walk with me to-night?" Edwin was in his room, reading a long and fond letter from his sister, when that question was propounded. Feelings of delight, slightly mingled with sadness, as the associations of home crowded into his mind, brought a tear or two to his eyes, and he furtively brushed them away, at the same time that his guest entered, with all the familiarity of an old friend, and gave the invitation.</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Maynard, not to-night," said Edwin. "I have<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5993-00000121"/> a letter to write." It was the reply to that tender communication from his sister.</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind that, write to-morrow," said Maynard, as he advanced to Edwin, and laid his hand upon his shoulder. "Our club meets to-night, and I want to introduce you. Come along. You will never regret it, I promise you. If your correspondent cannot wait one day," he added, with a meaning smile, "she is very unreasonable, and does not deserve to be humored."</p>
               <p>There was something in the lightness of Maynard which struck Edwin unpleasantly. It contrasted strongly with the seriousness of his own mind at the time, and increased his disinclination to leave home that evening. Still he was overpersuaded, and went.</p>
               <p>I could not tell my readers all that was said and done at this club, if I would; and very possibly I should not choose to tell them, if I could. It may suffice to say, in general, that it was a school of which virtue was not the sole schoolmistress. There was much of good connected with it, and more of evil. I say this, without any intention of condemning indiscriminately all associations of young men in the city, that are called by the same general name as that which this one bears. Doubtless there is a vast difference in them, as respects their moral character and tendency. I design to characterize only the club to which young Maynard belonged.</p>
               <p>Was Edwin pleased with his associates, and the manner in which they spent their time at the club? Not altogether. Their mirth was somewhat too boisterous for him. They carried their jokes rather too far. He did not like their drinking. Though no one of them became technically and ridiculously intoxicated, they all drank, and some, he thought, rather freely. Of course he did not drink himself. He had been educated in a family that discarded alcoholic stimulants as unnecessary, and withal too dangerous to be meddled with. He was asked to drink, but no one pressed him.</p>
               <p>As he laid his head upon his pillow that night, his mind was uneasy. His reflections were sad and painful. "I will go no more," he said, as he retired, after repeating a prayer—the same, perhaps, that his mother taught him in his childhood, when he kneeled before her, with his hands folded upon her knee, (for those prayers, simple and childish as they are, cling to us till the age of manhood, even.) "I will go no more." His resolution was equally strong the next day; and so it remained, until he saw his friend Maynard again—<emph>his friend!</emph> Alas! what a misnomer!—who came to ask Edwin to join the club as a member, and then his mind began to waver. A great deal of persuasion was used on one side, a great many objections were urged on the other. Edwin was frank, his companion was artful. It will seem strange to many, that that young man, though against the dictates of his own conscience, in the face of the teachings of his better judgment, and contrary to a previous decision, made intelligently and voluntarily, should have yielded. But he did yield, more, probably, to oblige his companion, than from any expectation or hope that the evenings he might pass with the club—and those were to be very few and far between, he thought—would add either to his pleasure or profit.</p>
               <p>Edwin was proposed and received as a member of the club. He attended another meeting. This time the contents of the glass were urged upon him. <emph>He yielded</emph>—not without resistance, yet he yielded. He took the glass in his hand. He raised it to his lips. He tasted—tasted, not drank—but his merry companions were satisfied. They had triumphed. They knew how great a triumph had been achieved, though their victim dreamed not of it.</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5993-00000122"/>
               <p>Edwin had entered a dangerous path. Something whispered this to him, as he returned to his lodgings, after the excitement of the second night at the club. He had entered a dangerous path. It would not have been as easy to effect a retreat at that point, as it would have been to resist the temptations to enter it. Still he could have escaped with very little difficulty, had he resolutely set himself about the task. The will had not then surrendered to the appetites and passions. He made an effort to escape. But it was a feeble one. He <emph>failed</emph>.</p>
               <p>Let us now draw a veil over the history of this young man. To detail the experience of this cherished companion of my childhood—of the friend whom I loved almost with a brother's affection—would be too painful a task, even were such a detail desirable for other considerations, as it is not. The syren soon threw around him a spell, to break which all the virtuous influences which were exerted upon him were powerless. He fell, and my heart is sick when I reflect into what an abyss of degradation and guilt he had plunged himself, in two brief years from the period of his introduction to that circle, where he first tasted the wine cup.</p>
               <p>I met Edwin in the autumn of 1835. It was our first meeting since he left home for the city. I saw at a glance the sad change which had taken place. Rumors of his intemperate habits had reached me before; but I was not prepared for such a spectacle. Intemperance, with its attendant vices, had undermined his constitution. He was but the wreck of a man—so rapidly had he run his dissolute career. I addressed him, cordially, affectionately, frankly, as in former days. He admitted his degradation. He did not attempt to conceal from me the fact that he had abandoned himself to the imperious dictation of a perverted appetite. "But," he added, with an emphasis which I shall never forget, and which sent a thrill of terror to my inmost soul, "I shall die a drunkard! No power on earth can stop me! It is too late!"</p>
               <p>It <emph>was</emph> too late. He was already a common vagabond. When the terrible truth burst upon the minds of his parents and sister, that Edwin had fallen, they flew to his relief. They wept with him, encouraged him, prayed with him. They persuaded him to return to the parental roof, where they watched over him with unwearied solicitude and tenderness. But it was too late. Moral restraint, patient watchfulness, the kind counsels of a father and mother, the loving embrace and sweet words of one of the fondest of sisters, "charming never so wisely," all failed to raise that poor youth from his prostrate condition. He was lost. The remorseless serpent of Intemperance had him within its folds, and was crushing him to death in its embrace.</p>
               <p>A year had scarcely elapsed since Edwin's return, when I revisited that place endeared to me by so many pleasing associations, as the home of my childhood. But my early friend was no longer there. Not even the sad wreck of his former self upon which I had gazed with so much of sadness when we last met, remained. The village graveyard told the tale of his exit. He was dead.</p>
               <p>Alas, my brother!—for thou wast my brother, though fallen—alas, my brother! I pity thy weakness and thy woes, while I blame thy errors and thy vices. My tears have flowed like rain for thee, as I bent over thy grave, and thought of thy childhood, thy early love, thy misfortunes—thy untimely end. They call thee a suicide, Edwin; but thou wast rather the victim of a murderer, methinks. Alas, my brother!</p>

               <head>THE AUCTION, OR THE WEDDING-COAT.</head>
               <head type="sub">A TALE OF TRUTH.</head>
               <p>"WHAT'S the hour, Mr. Collins?" said Harry Moore to a rather elderly man, as they stood lounging together at the counter of a country store. "Isn't it almost time for the auction? They tell me that old Philip Merton's clothes are to be sold among his other effects, and I want to see the exhibition, for it must be something of a curiosity. It's strange, though, that his relations would do such a thing."</p>
               <p>"Why, you see his brother-in-law has the ordering," answered Collins, "and he is a strange man, and so covetous that he is afraid of losing a penny of what comes to his wife. Phil shares the common fate of old bachelors—nobody cares much for their memory after they are dead. They are put under ground, and those who can get the most of what they leave behind are considered the most fortunate, but as for Philip's clothes, I don't think the <hi rend="i"/>skin-flints who sell them will make much out of them. They may perhaps find his <hi rend="i"/>wedding-coat, if it is not eaten up by the moths. I never saw him wear it after that night when he was disappointed. Poor Phil! he was one of the best-hearted fellows in the world; and not an old man, either—only about my age. It's a pity he should have sacrificed his life to a boyish fancy."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Harry; "you are not credulous enough to believe that he died of a broken heart?"</p>
               <p>"No, not exactly. He died, at last, of a broken constitution tion, the effect of intemperance in his youth. Ah! there were no temperance lectures then, nor pledges given to abstain from liquor. If there had been he might have married Fanny Ross, and had something to live for. But he must needs get intoxicated on his wedding-day; and so the match was broken off, and that completed his ruin. He was never the same man afterwards; but it was poor Fanny who died of the broken heart."</p>
               <p>"Do tell me that story, Mr. Collins. I never heard the whole of it, for you know we are new settlers at Mapleton, and the affair had blown over before we came."</p>
               <p>"Well, no one can tell more about it than I can; for Phil and I were school-cronies, and I knew it all, from beginning to end. It wants an hour yet to the auction, and its just an idle time; so let us cross over to the buttonwood-trees and sit down in the shade."</p>
               <p>It was a broad street, with a great deal of grass in it, which even sprung up and covered the ridges between the ruts made by the teamsters' carts; for it was seldom, in those days, that any other vehicle was driven through the little village of Mapleton. Foot-paths were trodden down between the houses, which stood at a considerable distance apart; and opposite the single store, comprising in its wares drygoods. groceries, and crockery, was a row of buttonwood-trees, where a rude bench had been constructed by some old smokers, who left an occasional sign, in a broken pipe, that they had occupied it. This seat was now appropriated by the two above-mentioned, when Collins, the elder, began his story of Philip Merton.</p>
               <p>"When I was a young man," said he, "Fanny Ross was the beauty of our town; and, though I have been married now for many a year, and have daughters grown up and married<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5993-00000125"/> also, I have never seen a handsomer girl. Her complexion was a clear red and white, and her glossy brown hair was parted over a forehead as smooth as marble. I could never tell exactly the color of her eyes, for they were like the chameleon, always changing: sometimes they appeared to be a dark gray, then a hazel, and at other times I could almost have sworn they were a deep violet blue. Her lips were like coral, her teeth without a blemish, and her person might have been a model for a sculptor, it was so perfect in its proportions. But Fanny was a silent beauty. She never talked much; and Phil was a lively, light-hearted fellow, and just suited her; for you know we always like the opposite of ourselves. He had just what she wanted—a word always ready upon occasion; and she got in the habit of depending on him to speak for her when she was at a loss. His wit was quick as a flash of lightning; and, when I have seen them in company together, I used to think of the old saying, that 'some people's thoughts go beforehand and some follow after.' They knew each other from children, and learned to read and write and cipher (which is all the learning we need in this place) at the same school. After they grew up he began to wait on her to the country balls and parties, and soon got the name of being her beau. There were no distinctions between rich and poor at Mapleton. All were on an equality, and one was as good as another, as long as their conduct was proper. Philip was an only son, and his father had some property; and Fanny's father was a mechanic. But she was industrious and amiable, and handsome enough for anybody; and his relations had no objection to his falling in love with her. In fact the objection all lay with her family; for Phil was rather wild and would drink a little too much, occasionally, when out at a merrymaking. At such times, Fanny would shrink from his attentions tions, and declare she would have nothing more to do with him; but, somehow or other, he always contrived to get into her good graces again, and persuade her to believe in his promises of reformation. A woman will believe almost any thing from the man she loves; and, though he break his promise ninety-nine times, she will still believe that he will keep it the hundredth. Drunkenness was unfortunately at that time the vice of Mapleton; and Phil could not resist temptation, yet he did not lose his station in society. His undeviating good-humor and irrepressible flow of spirits made him a general favorite; and everybody knew it was his generosity which helped to ruin him. His lapses from temperance were not very frequent then, and his companions could not do without him for his presence was always the herald of fun and frolic. There was an ease about his manners, too, and a sort of natural grace about his actions which took mightily with the girls. His eyes seemed to be always laughing to keep company with the smiles on his lips; and his tall figure and curly hair gave him rather a stylish appearance.</p>
               <p>As I told you at first, he and I were cronies, and I often tried to keep him from drinking. I used to tell him he would lose Fanny and break her heart, unless he would first break his glass and resolve never to take another.</p>
               <p>"Poh! Ned," said he one day, in answer to my remonstrances, "you would take all the high spirit out of me and make me appear as niggardly as old Deacon Wharton, who, you know very well, has got no soul at all. Come, take a glass with me; that's a good fellow. It'll make you feel lively, and your Mary will like you all the better, for she's as gay as a lark. Fanny and she ought to change characters; or else you and I ought to change girls."</p>
               <p>"What," said I, "do you want to give up Fanny?"</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5993-00000126"/>
               <p>"Give her up!" he exclaimed. "no, not for the value of all the whales in the Pacific; and I'm pretty sure she wouldn't give me up, either: but my wit is always thrown away on you, Ned, for you haven't got enough yourself to understand it."</p>
               <p>"Well, you are in a fair way now of bringing your own to a level with mine," said I, "for, when the wine is in, the wit is out, Phil."</p>
               <p>He laughed out loud, as he replied, "The shaft didn't hit, Ned. I'm as sober as a judge, and you know it. You are only jealous."</p>
               <p>"No, I should be as loth to change girls as you would," said I, "though I own that Fanny is the handsomest; but I'm satisfied with Mary, and I'll bet you a pair of wedding-gloves that I'll be married first, unless you quit drinking brandy."</p>
               <p>"Done," said Philip, "and you may go and buy them as soon as you please, for I am going to ask you to my wedding next Saturday."</p>
               <p>"Tell that to the marines, Phil," said I," for the sailors won't believe it. No, no—you don't come over me in that way; you are not going to get any of my property on false pretences."</p>
               <p>"But I say it's a fact, Ned," said he, laughing, "so you see you are caught in your own trap. We have been engaged these two years, and next Saturday evening we are to be married. I have promised Fanny to be the steadiest husband in Mapleton; and so I will, though I won't be so mean beforehand as not to drink a glass to her health."</p>
               <p>"Beware, Philip," said I, "take the advice of a friend for once, and let it alone."</p>
               <p>I didn't believe him, for he had already drank several times, and the liquor was beginning to take effect; and, with some trouble, I got his arm linked through mine and took him home without his situation being noticed in the street. I spent the whole afternoon with him and got him pretty well sobered down by evening, for I was sorry for him, and still more sorry for Fanny, if he had told me the truth. Well, sure enough, the Saturday came and I found it was even so. It was to be his wedding-day. I was invited, but before I went to Mr. Ross's I concluded to look in just before night upon Phil; for I couldn't help feeling a little uneasy. They told me he was in his chamber, and I went up; and what do you think I found him doing? Why, standing before a small table, with a decanter of brandy in one hand and a tumbler in the other, just ready to pour out a drink. I made one step from the door and caught his arm.</p>
               <p>"Philip Merton," I exclaimed, "are you crazy? On this day, of all others, to drink brandy!"</p>
               <p>"Let go my arm, Ned," said he, "this is my last glass, and I won't be disappointed for any one."</p>
               <p>I saw that he was intoxicated then, and, with a little adroitness, I got the decanter from his hand and pitched it out of the window.</p>
               <p>"You shall pay for that, Edward Collins," said he, and his face flushed to a bright scarlet. But he sat down; and, after the excitement went off, he became stupefied with what he had taken before my entrance. His wedding-coat hung over the back of a chair, and his white vest and gloves were laid on the bed. I think I never felt more distressed in my life. It was almost dark, and he was no more fit to be married than an idiot would have been. But I got some cold water and soaked his head and bathed his face, till at last he began to realize partly what he was going to do. He had forgotten all about my breaking the decanter, and asked me to help him<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5993-00000127"/> dress, for he was really incapable of doing it alone. Poor Fanny, thought I to myself, it will be a sad fate for her to be a drunkard's wife. Two or three times I was on the point of going and telling her of Philip's situation: but I knew the messenger of ill-tidings seldom got either thanks or good will; and so I determined not to meddle with the match. She knew his habits beforehand, said I, and if she chooses to run the risk it is none of my business. I left him just before the hour; for, to tell the truth, I was ashamed to go to Mr. Ross's in his company, and so went on by myself, for being well acquainted with Fanny and her sisters, I did not mind being early. Emily Brown, a sister of Mary, who is now my wife, saw me coming and came out to meet me; for there was no formality among the young people at that time.</p>
               <p>"Where's Philip?" said she. "We thought you and he would come together; and everybody is wondering that he is so late."</p>
               <p>"Em," said I (for I found it impossible to keep the secret entirely to myself), "don't say any thing about it—but Phil is waiting to get sober."</p>
               <p>"Good gracious, Edward!" exclaimed she; "you don't say he's been drinking! Why, what's to be done? Fanny ought to know it."</p>
               <p>"Well, wait a little," said I; "perhaps he will be quite himself by the time he gets here; and, for the future, we must hope for the best."</p>
               <p>"Edward," said Emily seriously, "can you tell me a single man in Mapleton, who was known to love liquor in his youth, who is not now a confirmed drunkard? I have no faith that Philip will prove an exception. But here comes the minister. Do you go in, while I run back to Fanny."</p>
               <p>A few of the village girls were assembled, in their white dresses and blue or pink ribbons, according to the taste of the wearer; and Mr. Waters, the clergyman, walked in and took his seat among them. The father and mother of the bride were unusually taciturn. They looked anxious and unhappy, as if they felt a presentiment that something was going wrong. Fanny was not present; and the suspense of waiting was becoming painful. Mr. Ross rose and whispered to me:</p>
               <p>"Edward, something must be the matter with Philip. Hadn't you better go and see what it is?"</p>
               <p>I could have told him without going to see: but I didn't speak; and just at that moment the door opened, and poor Phil staggered into the room. There was a silly smile on his face, as he sat down on the nearest chair and asked, in a thick voice, if Fanny was ready.</p>
               <p>Not a word was spoken, for everybody seemed to be struck dumb. Mrs. Ross rose. She was a stern woman; and we were always a little afraid of her when we went to see the girls. But she just gave Philip one look, as if she would have crushed him through the floor, and then hurried out of the room. Emily Brown and one of Fanny's sisters were with her up stairs, and when her mother came in and told her in plain words, that Philip had come <emph>drunk</emph> to be married, Em said that every bit of color left Fanny's face. She was as white as marble and seemed almost as stony: for she showed no outward sign of emotion; she only said, "Don't let him come here, mother—I won't see him. Tell him to go home, for I'll never have him, now!"</p>
               <p>"You never shall with my consent, Fanny," said her mother; "and you ought to be thankful that he has shown himself out, beforehand."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ross did not know how to soothe and comfort her. Just think of telling her, at such a time, that she ought to be<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5993-00000128"/>
                  <emph>thankful!</emph> How could she be thankful for any thing, with such a blow upon her heart? What was the unknown misery of the future, to what she was now enduring? But her mother meant well. She did not understand the difference between her own feelings and Fanny's.</p>
               <p>Well, all this while the company were silently waiting for Mrs. Ross's return. It was a strange scene for a wedding and it seems as if I could see it all before me now. Everybody had a sort of frightened, or horror-struck look, excepting Philip, who appeared to be quite unconscious that any thing was the matter, and sat still, with the same silly expression on his face; for liquor always makes men fools.</p>
               <p>At last Mrs. Ross came to the door, and said in a loud, harsh voice: "Mr. Waters, there will be no marriage here tonight; and <emph>you</emph>, Philip Merton, the sooner you leave the house the better. Your company is not wanted."</p>
               <p>"I—I came to be married," said Phil; "and I won't go till I have seen Fanny—I won't, I say."</p>
               <p>Mr. Waters then got up, and said with a very solemn manner: "It is useless for you to remain, Mr. Merton, for I cannot marry you to-night. I am sorry to say that you are not in a fit state to perform your part in the ceremony; and your disappointment and disgrace are the bitter fruits of intemperance, which you are now so sadly reaping. Let it be a warning to you for the future; and I trust that not only you, but your young friends here present, will remember that 'Whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.'"</p>
               <p>With these words he bowed to the company, and walked straight out of the door. The girls all got up and went to put on their bonnets, but Phil never moved. I thought he was trying to realize what it all meant; and I pitied him from the bottom of my heart. Old Mr. Ross leaned his head down between tween his hands, and never spoke a single word. He was a man of few words at all times. Fanny was like her father, and had always been his favorite child; and he knew, better than her mother, how to feel for her. He knew that she had loved Philip with all the power of a still, silent love, which strengthens more and more in the depths of the heart, because it cannot vent itself from the lips. People may laugh at <hi rend="i"/>first love, Harry, but you may depend on it, it is never entirely forgotten nor overcome. Something of it is left, which neither time, nor absence, nor even <emph>death</emph> can destroy in the heart of the living. But I am going astray from my story. I went up to Philip after the minister had gone, and said: "Come, Philip, it's time for us to be getting home. You see they have all left us."</p>
               <p>He was beginning to get sobered by the shock; and the smile on his face was exchanged for a sort of helpless expression, like that of a man led to the gallows. He yielded, because there was no reprieve to the necessity; and I took him home, and helped him to undress and go to bed; and the coat which he took off that night I don't think he ever put on afterwards."</p>
               <p>"And what happened to Fanny?" asked Harry Moore, who was much interested in his companion's recital.</p>
               <p>"Ah," said Collins, "that is the most melancholy part of the story. She went into a sort of melancholy derangement, and was never seen to smile after that night; and, what is still more wonderful, the color never came back to her face. Before that time she had the most lovely complexion you ever saw: but always afterwards she looked as white and cold as a marble statue. She refused to see Philip, or to have any thing more to do with him, and went nowhere excepting to church, where she was sure to be found in all kinds of weather.<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5993-00000129"/> She would keep her eyes fixed on the minister until he had done preaching, and then get up and go home, before the congregation were dismissed. I met her once on Sunday, and spoke to her. "How do you do, Fanny?" said I. She raised her eyes, and they looked <emph>blue</emph>, then—I shall never forget it, for I had a strange fancy that they were exactly the color of Philip's wedding-coat. I don't know what put such a queer comparison in my head, but I was so possessed with the notion, that I kept staring at her till she said: "What do you look at me so steady for, Edward? I know I don't look as I used to; but it's because I always have a pain in my heart, now."</p>
               <p>"You ought not to be walking alone then, Fanny," said I. "Let me go home with you."</p>
               <p>"No," she replied, "I don't want you—I can take care of myself—I'm not crazy, Edward, though I suppose you think I am; but I've got all the reason I ever had, and that was too little to do me any good when I stood most in need of it. There, go away now, for I shan't say any more."</p>
               <p>She crossed over to the other side of the street, and walked very fast till she got out of sight. Mr. Waters visited her constantly and endeavored to direct her thoughts to religion; and he said it was his belief that the light of the Gospel broke in on her mind before she died, and gave her that peace which the world can neither give nor take away. It was just a year from the day that was to have been her wedding-day, that we went to her funeral; and, if ever any one died of a broken heart, it's my belief that Fanny Ross did."</p>
               <p>Collins was silent, and seemed to have finished his story; when Harry said, "You've forgotten Philip. You have not told me any thing further about him, since you took him home that night."</p>
               <p>"True enough!" answered Collins; "I had forgotten him in talking of poor Fanny. If you had ever seen her in her bloom, you would have said her equal was not to be found for beauty. But Phil never got over the disappointment and mortification of that affair; and, to keep from thinking of it, he went to the bottle. He knew that he had lost Fanny forever, and so he gave up all female society. He never was much of a ladies' man, and I don't believe he ever saw any other girl that he would have been willing to marry. He used to skulk about the streets, and keep out of everybody's way as much as he could, only when he was about drunk. At Fanny's funeral he cried like a child; and after that he tried to do better for some time; but, as they say "the ruling passion is strong in death," so with him it was strong in life. His habits became confirmed; and, though sometimes months would pass away without his drinking to excess, he still drank enough to scatter the seeds of disease through his system. I often spoke to him about it, but he used to stop me with, "It's too late now, Ned. I've nothing to live for; and if I did not sometimes lose my senses in liquor, I should lose them altogether, and be sent to a mad-house. You couldn't persuade me when I had every thing at stake; and what's the use of trying now?"</p>
               <p>"But you won't live out half your days," said I, "if you go on in this way."</p>
               <p>"Well, and what of that?" he answered, "I shan't be missed. An old bachelor is only in the way, and most people are willing to let them have a short life and a merry one if it's their own choice."</p>
               <p>And so he took his own course, until about six years ago there came a temperance lecturer to Mapleton. It was a novelty, and everybody went to hear him. At first they<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5993-00000130"/> were all carried away with his eloquence, and listened as though all he said was fiction—like the plays at the theatre. But after hearing him two or three times they began to realize the truth of his words; and, one after another, our townsmen all went forward and signed the pledge, which has been the saving of many of them from ruin. Nobody thought that Phil Merton would be persuaded to do it; but he was; and it made him a changed man. He found he had broken down his constitution, and tried hard enough afterwards to build it up; for, when a man really thinks he is going to die he is apt to grow very anxious to live, and is quite willing to make up his quarrels with the world and take it as it is, provided he can renew his lease of the mortal tenement. But, as Phil had so often said himself, "it was too late." He never got quite well, though he continued to be a sober man, and his long course of intemperance killed him in the end. He was only fifty-three years old when he died. My story is finished, Harry, and the hour is up also. So come, it's time for the auction."</p>
               <p>An auction was a rare occurrence in the quiet village of Mapleton. The inhabitants seldom changed either houses or furniture, which descended from generation to generation, with but little alteration or improvement. But Philip Merton had been an old bachelor, and left no successor to his worldly goods, over which the auctioneer's hammer was then about to be raised.</p>
               <p>Collins and Moore arrived just in time to see the exhibition of the wedding-coat, which had been set up on a bid of three dollars.</p>
               <p>"That's it," said Collins to his companion; "a blue coat with brass buttons. I remember the fashion of it thirty years ago. Come, Harry, you're fond of antiquities, why don't you bid?"</p>
               <p>"Going," cried the auctioneer, "going at three dollars: not a quarter of its value. Who'll bid another dollar? Can't throw it away—it's disgraceful!"</p>
               <p>"Why don't you buy it yourself, for the sake of old acquaintance?" said Harry in reply to Collins, while the crier still kept on.</p>
               <p>"Who says four dollars? There aint such another coat nowhere. It'll fit any man on the ground."</p>
               <p>Collins had turned to Harry and exclaimed, "<emph>I</emph>, Harry Moore? Why I wouldn't have Phil's wedding-coat for a gift."</p>
               <p>"Four dollars bid," cried the auctioneer—"going at four dollars—four—four"—and the hammer went half-way down and was raised again. "Blame it! the hammer won't strike at that—look at the cloth—it's superfine—none of your home-spun—going at only four—"</p>
               <p>"You wouldn't have it! why not?" asked Harry of Collins, looking at the same time at the auctioneer, and giving him a nod.</p>
               <p>"Five dollars—I have it," cried the seller. "Mr. Moore bids five dollars. Will nobody bid over him? See these buttons, as bright as gold, and they be gold, for aught I know—going at five dollars—going—going—gone!"</p>
               <p>"I'm glad you bought it," said Collins, "and now I'll tell you why I wouldn't have it. It was too full of old memories; and I never want to rake them up again, as I have done to day. But it's different with you. You didn't see it all, as I did; and it will do you no harm to remember it. So just keep the coat for the sake of its history and the moral; and, if you ever have a friend in danger of being wrecked on the shoals of intemperance, show it to him, and tell him the story of Philip Merton."</p>

               <p>"EVELYN," said Mr. Sargent to his orphan niece, on the morning of her marriage-day; "Evelyn, I trust you will have sufficient influence with Frank Rivers, to induce him to leave those gay, wine-drinking associates of his. I hope his attendance on convivial parties will now be less frequent; for, Evy," added the fond but cautious uncle, "had habits are sometimes formed in this agreeable way."</p>
               <p>Young Evelyn Sargent thought of her lover's devoted attachment, smiled incredulously, and said: "He only takes wine occasionally, dear uncle; besides, it would be hard to fancy Frank Rivers an inebriate, with all his good sense."</p>
               <p>"Be not <emph>too</emph> confident; I would not grieve your gentle nature, Evelyn, yet it is well to be warned of danger. I trust, indeed, that Rivers will always possess the same self-command as now. It would be a fearful thing for you, my child, should he, after all, turn a charmed ear to the voice of that Syren, the end of whose song is destruction."</p>
               <p>A slight quiver came over the curved lips of the young girl—there was a tremulous flutter of the white lids over the tender eyes. Save this, she stood silent before her uncle, as pale certainly, and as beautiful as the most exquisite statue.</p>
               <p>Her uncle looked on her pityingly. "Forgive me, darling," he said, taking her hand. "If I probe the wound, God knows I would heal it. O Evelyn! when your sainted mother placed you, a little infant, in my arms, and bade me love you well—when, with her dying breath, she charged me to watch over your tender youth, and guard you from all evil—in that solemn hour, Evelyn, I folded you closer to my aching bosom, and vowed to fulfil the sacred trust reposed in me. It was no hard task to perform a parent's duty towards you, Evelyn; you became what your mother before you had been—the dearest object of my heart (though she left me for my adopted brother), and my care for you has been truly a 'labor of love.' And well have the gifts and graces of your youth rewarded my care. You have brought joys to my lonely hearth, unknown to it since my—my first and last great sorrow. You have ever been as a most dutiful and affectionate daughter unto me: but you are a woman now—you have chosen for yourself another protector, and, O Evelyn! God grant <emph>he</emph> may wear the priceless pearl of thy affections worthily, and be to thy future all thou so fondly hopest. But should the time ever arrive, that thou needest other help or guidance, remember my house and heart are alike open to thee—and thou wilt not say me nay. Promise me, Evelyn, that in such emergency thou wilt come to me—thy second father."</p>
               <p>And Evelyn promised unhesitatingly—her future <emph>seemed so</emph> bright. For the last time she flung herself into the arms that opened to clasp her to a heart, which, on this eventful morning, dared not examine itself too closely. Had Evelyn known <emph>all</emph> that was struggling in the noble and generous soul of her benefactor, Frank Rivers had been less lovingly received in Philip Sargent's presence.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Sargent gave away the bride—for Evelyn did become the wife of Rivers. Her uncle marked the bridegroom's smile of conscious triumph and exulting love deepen to a<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5993-00000133"/> solemn awe, as he uttered the trothplight that made him her husband and protector. How trusting and entire was the confidence with which she gave her hand to him, with whom she had chosen to tread life's crowded paths! And there was a deeper regret than the mere occasion required, in the sorrowful and earnest tones of Philip Sargent's voice, as he consigned his darling Evelyn to an untried guardianship. There was a quiver on the lips that pronounced a fond and farewell blessing on the young bride, now leaving the shelter of his roof forever. Turning a last time to Rivers, he wrung his hand and said: "I have committed a precious charge to your keeping, Mr. Rivers. As you hope for God's blessing, obey my solemn injunction—deal truly and tenderly by Evelyn, and," he added in a lower tone, "by yourself, too, deal faithfully!"</p>
               <p>When the young, lovely, and confiding Evelyn said that Frank Rivers possessed too much good sense ever to become intemperate, she spoke but what she thought. In her heart she could not believe that he, whose nature was so noble and generous, who evinced so many correct feelings and principles—Frank Rivers, gay, gallant, high-spirited, possessing, in an eminent degree, all manly qualifications—how could she believe that he, by any possible temptation, would ever yield to the baneful influences of the arch-destroyer?</p>
               <p>Beautiful Evelyn! how clearly now, through the dim mist of years, does the perfect loveliness of that sweet face dawn upon me! I can see her, as she was wont when beside her husband, shake the golden ringlets back from her white forehead, till they fell in bright clusters upon her shoulders. It was pleasing to look upon Evelyn in those days of her hope and happiness. The chords of her heart responded ever to the touch of love, and sent forth tones of peculiar sweetness. Left an orphan in early childhood, with none but her uncle to love, her hitherto buried affections were now poured forth on one object. Freely, fondly, and undoubtingly did she bestow her heart on one who gratefully accepted and loyally vowed to cherish it, till death should them part!</p>
               <p>During the first year after their marriage, Mr. Rivers was all devotion to his beautiful wife; and every attention that love or duty could suggest was lavishly bestowed on her. About this time they removed to a large and populous city. Evelyn was mistress of a noble mansion, surrounded by all the splendor and luxury that love could bestow or wealth command. Basking in the sunshine of prosperity; caressed, admired, and flattered, in the gay and brilliant circles she frequented, the beautiful and accomplished Mrs. Rivers (as she was called) swam along the stream of pleasure so gently, that one might well deem no thorns grew in her pathway of roses.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"Will you not pass <emph>this</emph> evening with me, dear Frank?" asked Evelyn Rivers, as she saw her husband, after an absence of three successive nights, again prepare to go out. "Come," she continued, playfully putting her slender arm within his own—"come, Frank; you did not always think the evening lost which you gave to me." And she gazed upon him with the earnestness of a woman's pleading. But there was sorrow, as well as anxiety, in her look.</p>
               <p>"You are a sweet beggar, Evelyn," said Rivers, after looking at her a moment; "but it won't do. I've pledged my word to Tom Arundel—a gentleman's party you know—I will be back before eleven;" and, as if anxious to be gone, he hastily kissed her, and went his way.</p>
               <p>Heavily did his departing footsteps reverberate on the heart of his disappointed wife; and she thought time never moved<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5993-00000134"/> so tardily. A sort of misgiving, for the first time, crossed her mind; not that it shaped itself into any thing tangible, but a vague, undefined apprehension of some impending calamity. Silently Evelyn Rivers knelt down, and imploringly she repeated the intercession: "Lead him not into temptation; deliver him from evil!"</p>
               <p>It were too sad a thing to trace Frank Rivers along his erring path of folly and dissipation: too sad a tale to tell, how he gradually, and almost imperceptibly, estranged himself from his gentle and trusting Evelyn; how, the more he neglected her, the farther he strayed from virtue and honor; and how the habit of drinking "wine occasionally" led him, at last, to bow down his high spirit at the unholy shrine of intemperance! It is a thrice-told tale; too familiar, alas! to many of our readers.</p>
               <p>For a long time, Evelyn parried the censures and harsh judgments of the world, the secret regrets of friends, and open attacks of foes. Clothed in its mantle of devotion, her heart clung with increased tenacity to its object; and the image was only shrined the deeper. In the trusting earnestness of her heart, Evelyn had thrown all on the venture of his vow; and thus it was that she yet sustained herself.</p>
               <p>But the <emph>truth</emph> came at last! That which Evelyn Rivers had deemed it even a sin to think on, now stood before her a lamentable and sure reality—her husband was an irreclaimable <emph>drunkard!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Painful rumors reached the ears of Philip Sargent, and he hastened to learn the truth. He came alone and unannounced, to find his worst fears realized. One glance at Mrs. Rivers' pale, dejected countenance, told the story of "wine occasionally," and its effects, more eloquently than words! Indeed, few words were spoken. Mr. Sargent announced his determination mination to take Evelyn home with him: the physician had prescribed her native air, and she consented to go. One who knew her husband's accustomed haunts sought him out, with a message that Mrs. Rivers wished to see him—him, round whom her affections still lingered, though changed indeed from the high-placed love and confiding trust of the wife, to the pitying care of a friend for a misguided and lost companion.</p>
               <p>He came at length, with a flushed face, a restless eye, and unsteady step. Oh, might these but grow out of his intense anxiety for her dying condition! No! she turns away from the bloated visage, and the thick tongue, attempting to mutter words of inebriate and disgusting fondness. Has <emph>that</emph> man ever been her blessing and delight? * * * Every trace of emotion had vanished from her face; and, when she again lifted her languid head, she had schooled her heart to such perfect self-control, that, to the careless eye now fixed upon her, she seemed not to suffer. You will readily believe, dear reader, that no word of censure, no tones save those of pity, for the author of all this misery, passed her lips. No! but in this their last interview on this side of eternity, she entreated him for <emph>his own sake</emph> to pause in his downward career.</p>
               <p>She said it was the last kindness she should ever require of him;—that she could add nothing to what she had already and frequently before said; and now she entreated him again, because she could not forget the time when he was her good and honored husband. She could but pray, as she had long done, that a merciful God would have that pity on him which he would not have upon himself.</p>
               <p>A momentary remorse struggled with the dim perceptions of the inebriate; and, reeling, he flung himself beside her couch, and wept aloud! What further passed at their parting hour we know not, save that the last words of counsel had<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5993-00000135"/> been spoken by the faithful wife,—her last admonition fallen on the husband's dull ear, and she was gone! As the last sound of the carriage-wheels, which conveyed Mrs. Rivers from the home of her wedded life, died away, Frank Rivers went forth to his wonted resort, and spent the night, as usual, in degrading the dignity of manhood below the brutes that perish. Woe! that one so formed to excel, so gifted in every thing, possessing an intellect so noble, so elevated—woe! that, through the insidious advances of "wine occasionally," he should yield to the fascinations of vice and its deceitful allurements!</p>
               <p>Evelyn died early! but not before the last ray of hope was quenched in her soul, and a death-like withering had come over her heart; not until the flower of conjugal feeling had faded quite away, and the bruised vine of her affections had no pillar whereon to lean! Yes! beneath the roof which she had left three years before, in all the splendid <foreign xml:lang="FRA">éclat</foreign> of a prosperous bridal, Evelyn Rivers—still young and beautiful—lay dying! Surely Philip Sargent had spoken with a prophetic spirit, when he offered the fair bride his protection through all her future life! Three short years! <emph>Then</emph> he had foreseen the consequences of taking "wine occasionally." Poor Evelyn <emph>felt</emph> them later! And oh! how many burning tears and blasted hopes would have been spared her! But the blow had come from the hand of one for whom she was sacrificing life itself; and she bore her terrible calamity with uncomplaining sorrow to the end.</p>
               <p>"I know," said she to Mr. Sargent, the evening before her death, "I know, dear Philip (she seldom called him uncle, as she was an adopted niece), that I have been burdensome to you; but God, in his infinite mercy, will soon relieve you, and release me from this prison-house of clay. You were ever most kind to your poor orphan girl, Philip, but truly so in this heavy time of trial. My years, though few, have been evil, my friend; and my days of darkness, have they not been many? Oh, Philip! <emph>could</emph> I dream that a glass of 'wine occasionally' would work such woe to me? Dear uncle—" "Don't ever call me uncle again," interrupted Mr. Sargent, with an indescribable expression in his large black eyes. "Oh, Evelyn!" he murmured, "I have dearly bought the happiness of watching over you <unclear>till</unclear> the end! Call me Philip, dearest Evelyn," he said, turning again towards her; "during the short remnant of your days, my poor Evelyn, let me be nothing but Philip to you!" And Philip's heart was wrung as he thought of the young girl's past and present. "Dear Philip, you feel for me too deeply," faltered Evelyn, remarking the great grief that sat on his manly features; and she pressed his trembling fingers in her own little hand; and Philip Sargent shook in every limb of his well-knit frame, as if he had been a child! "Be calm, my friend, my only earthly friend, and listen to me. When I am no more," she continued, in a low voice, "there is <emph>one</emph> office of kindness I could wish you to perform." "Name it," returned Philip: "whatever is in my power to compass shall be done."</p>
               <p>"Bless you for these words. Philip, when I am dead, and gone, you must find out Frank's haunts, and try to reclaim him. God did not will that that great blessing should be mine. The work of reformation must be done by one who never even drinks wine occasionally. I did sometimes join Frank in a glass, in the early days of our union; and the remembrance is like molten lead in my throat now! Oh, Philip! could I live my life over again, no one that I loved should touch, taste, or handle the accursed thing! But seek <emph>him</emph>, dear Philip; tell him that if he but leads a <emph>sober</emph> life, I shall not have died in<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5993-00000136"/> vain! Tell him that, with my latest breath, I forgave and blessed him; that I loved and prayed for him till my life's end! Will you do this, Philip?"</p>
               <p>"I will, indeed," he replied, in a broken voice—"Oh, Evelyn!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>With a faltering footstep Philip Sargent followed Evelyn Rivers' remains to their last home. But he shed no tear as he performed his last mournful duty over her grave; for he knew that the sorrowing spirit of that lovely and broken-hearted one had reached the haven of its everlasting rest.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Sargent religiously fulfilled Evelyn's last wishes He <emph>did</emph> try, long and faithfully, to save Frank Rivers; but a his efforts were vain—vainer, alas! than water spilled upon the ground. The man was an <emph>irreclaimable drunkard!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, Heaven was kind! for Evelyn did not live through long years of watching and weeping, of trembling hope and unutterable despair. God gave the broken lily a kinder doom.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Let woman, lovely, devoted, confiding woman, avoid even the appearance of evil. Let her beware of the glass of "wine occasionally," at the revel, and the feast! Let her remember that, in uniting her destiny with an "occasional drinker" even, she is drawing upon herself a fearful doom, and is incurring one of the heaviest of curses! It is like linking truth with perfidy,—the dove with the vulture. It is the wedlock of purity and pollution—beauty and the beast. Let woman beware of the <emph>temperate</emph> as well as of the confirmed drunkard.</p>

               <head>UNEQUAL YOKING: A WARNING TO YOUNG WOMEN.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY LEROY M. LEE, D.D.,</head>
               <p>"THOU shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together," is one of the singular prescripts of the Jewish law. But strange as it may seem, it was founded on good reasons, and is replete with valuable suggestions. The one, in its relations to the Mosaic ritual, was clean; the other unclean. Besides, the differences of form, habit and character of the two animals would seem to interdict such a combination of labor; and it was the belief of an ancient writer that its conception must have been instigated by the father of the whole fraternity of mischief and contradiction. As a corroboration of the unnaturalness of the suggestion it may be stated, that when Ulysses would have it believed that he was mad, he resorted to the device of joining a horse and an ass to plow. One can hardly think that men, unhelped of Satan, would join together, in the same yoke, two animals so entirely dissimilar in their tempers and motions. But the main object of the prohibition, it is quite certain, was to oppose a supposition then prevalent among the surrounding nations—that their fields would be more productive if cultivated by this process of plowing. Idolatry held and taught that the<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5993-00000137"/> gods were propitiated by unnatural contrasts of this kind,—such as sowing divers kinds of seed together, mixing woollen and linen in the texture of their clothing, and plowing with an odd assortment of animals in the yoke. The folly of such arts was augmented by the feelings that prompted them. The prescript, therefore, was intended at once to connect the superstition, and to show the wisdom of the universal law that like cleaves to its like.</p>
               <p>Beyond this, it is not improbable that this law lends a forcible illustration, if not a presumptive authority to the doctrine of the apostle, respecting the qualities that constitute fitness for the marriage relation. An ill-assorted marriage is as unseemly a piece of yoke-bearing as that prohibited by Moses; and, if deliberately entered upon, deserves to be regarded as a proof of the malady assumed by Ulysses when he brought the noble horse and the stupid ass into the associations of the yoke. A quaint old writer has depicted the inequalities of such a union with a remarkable felicity of language and illustration: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Ill fares the hapless family that shows</l>
                        <l>A cock that's silent, and a hen that crows;</l>
                        <l>I know not which live most unnatural lives:</l>
                        <l>Obeying husbands, or commanding wives.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Without staying to settle the difficulty of the poet, it may be assumed that such "husbands" and "wives" are far more numerous than, for the dignity of the Divine law, and the peace of human society, they ought to be; and "hapless families," therefore, are neither few nor far between. "A hen that crows" is a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">rara avis</foreign>, far more so than the corresponding clause in the poet's figure. With all of the religious propensities of their nature, the greatest barrier in the progress of womankind to the perfection of their social state lies in the repugnance with which, as by one consent, they regard the law that brings "commanding wives" and "unnatural lives" into juxtaposition. But we are treading on the great battle-field of life to saint, to savage, and to sage, and, therefore, for the present, assume the counterpart of "a hen that crows."</p>
               <p>But if, in the entire history of that kind of yoking which of twain makes one flesh, there is a marked and horrid inequality that chafes until the soul is sore, it is when one half of this one flesh is addicted to drunkenness! A drunken wife!—let her name be written on the sand, to be washed out by the rain, or blown away by the winds of heaven. As a mere theoretical speculation, she is the least of the two evils of married drunkenness. But, to the honor of the sex, they are so scarce that we may not stop to study or depict that last, worst, and meanest of all moral subjects—a drunken woman. Some one has said that the most forlorn and pitiable object in life is "a widow in her weeds of woe." But we think, desolate as may be her lot, she has a sister whose lot is desolation augmented by despair. Her sadness is sunshine, her sorrow, a daily rapture compared with the unmixed misery of a drunkard's wife. And this misery in its keenness, intensity and duration will be always proportioned to the virtue, intelligence and refinement of the sufferer. As these have breadth and power her days will be a sigh, her life the long drawn agony of a crushed and bleeding heart.</p>
               <p>That such a woman should be deceived into an alliance with drunkenness is one of the misfortunes of life. But to enter it deliberately is a crime well meriting the whole catalogue of suffering that usually follows in the wake of the vice. The fact of a young friend, rich in all the adornments of maidenly attraction and excellence, accepting the proposals of a dissolute young man, whom she had seen intoxicated, is one of the first and profoundest horrors that remains in the writer's recollections<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5993-00000138"/> of early life. Love is changed with blindness. The allegation would seem to be true; or else, without rhyme or reason, many a woman enters into covenant with misery, and foredooms herself to a long and hopeless companionship with shame and sorrow, crime and suffering. To such as are draining this cup of bitterness, acidulated by the consciousness of having mixed it for themselves, very little can be said, beside the utterance of a sincere sympathy. But for those not yet yoked, a word of warning, against such unequal yoking, may not be out of place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>To marry is the first verb in the grammar of female language, as it is the first article in their creed of social life. It is to hope and happiness what action is to eloquence,—everything. It is the territory of bliss on earth; and we are not sure that the pathway to heaven does not, in the estimation of some, lead directly through it. At least it is the maternal state of grown up people; and women are no more to be blamed for desiring it than the sterner sex, upon whom the laws of civilized life imposes the obligation of courting. But desire must be reduced to its last shift, or be utterly reckless when it consents to a life's-alliance with drunkenness, or with that common use of liquor that as surely leads to intemperance as consumption does to death. The history of one such marriage may illustrate a thousand; and will, if rightly considered, serve as a warning to every woman who contemplates an entrance into the holy estate of matrimony. For this purpose we offer a few pages from the life of one who richly merited a better fate—a sister of JOHN WESLEY, the world-known founder of Methodism.</p>
               <p>MEHATABEL WESLEY, commonly called HETTY, in her childhood gave such remarkable indications of mental strength as led her parents to cultivate them with great care and diligence. Her proficiency in the learned languages was such that at the early age of eight years she could read the Greek Testament. Poetry was common to her family, yet it shone forth in her with a peculiar brilliancy. She was of a gay and sprightly disposition, full of mirth and good humor, and of a keen and polished wit. These qualities of mind, set off by a handsome person and pleasing manners, attracted many aspirants for her hand. In the crowd of her admirers there was one whose addresses she accepted, and for whom she felt a strong affection. But in this case, as in a thousand others, "the course of true love did not run smooth." Her father interposed, refused his consent to the consummation of the engagement, and compelled her either to abandon her lover, or marry without the parental blessing on her union. Either offered a severe trial to duty on the one hand, and inclination on the other. She sought to comply with the demands of filial duty, without relinquishing her betrothed; hoping, by patient endurance, ultimately to secure her father's sanction, and his blessing upon her union with the man of her choice. But for some cause the gentlemen, whether from the opposition he met with, or from fickleness of character, or some worse motive, ceased his attentions, and abandoned a woman who, at any sacrifice, would have proved a jewel of priceless value. Her disappointment was keen; and under the influence of mortified feelings she seems to have resolved never to marry. But even that vow was not proof against parental authority. A Mr. Wright, a plumber, poor, but probably of respectable connexions, soon sought her in marriage; and his suit was strongly sustained by her father. She found him utterly unsuited to her in mind, education and manners. They were unlike in every respect. She declared her strong disapprobation of the proposal, and begged that parental authority might not be used to induce her to adopt a measure that promised no comfort to her, and might prove her ruin. She pleaded in vain. Her father was inexorable<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5993-00000139"/> orable. Except her sister Mary, afterwards Mrs. Whitelamb, all her family seem to have united against her; at least no other one took sides with her. She advised resistance to what she was satisfied would produce misery through life. It was in allusion to this fact that, when that sister <choice>

                  </choice> to the grave so earnestly covetted by herself, she poured forth her soul in lines of deepest sorrow: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"When deep immersed in griefs beyond redress,</l>
                        <l>And friends and kindred heightened my distress;</l>
                        <l>And by relentless efforts made me prove</l>
                        <l>Pain, grief, despair, and wedlock without love;</l>
                        <l>My soft Maria could alone dissent,</l>
                        <l>Oerlook'd the fatal vow, and mourn'd the punishment."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the victim was decorated in bridal clothes, and offered a weeping sacrifice upon the altar of domestic unhappiness. A more ill-assorted marriage was, perhaps, never perpetrated. It was not long after the prize was gained, before the casket that contained it was rudely spurned. In a letter to her father, written not long after her marriage, and in answer to questions as to her married happiness, she lifts the veil from a picture of connubial wretchedness, and after holding it for a moment to his gaze, suddenly drops it, with the words: "I could say much more; but would rather eternally stifle my sentiments than have the torment of thinking they agree not with yours." There spoke the <emph>daughter</emph>, true as steel, to her father; and what treasures of affection were hidden in such a heart. But how was she as <emph>wife?</emph> Let us first see what she could have said if she might have leaned her heart against her father's, and poured into his bosom the swelling flood of her griefs. What was her husband? Ignorant, ill-mannered, fond of low dissolute company, spending his evenings from home, and, last in the black register of crime, a drunkard. Of the daily agony such a companion could inflict on an intelligent, virtuous and forbearing woman, no language is adequate to portray. At any period of such protracted barbarity the repose of the grave might have been welcomed as a joyful refuge. But it came not: weeks ran into months, months into years; and still her husband preferred any place to home, loved any company better than hers. With an uncomplaining, but consuming grief, she bore it all; concealing, with the instinctive delicacy of true womanly feeling, the vices that were gnawing, like grave-worms, at the vitals of her happiness.</p>

               <head>THE BASKET-MAKER.</head>
               <head type="sub">DEDICATED TO THE ARISTOCRACY.</head>
               <p>IN the middle of the vast ocean commonly called the South Sea, there is a large cluster of islands, little visited by Europeans, though inhabited by a people nowise inferior to them in knowledge and civilization. An ancestor of the prince who now reigns over them, was so celebrated for the wisdom of his government, that he was surnamed the Solomon of his age, and the territories under his sway have ever since retained the name of the Islands of Solomon.</p>
               <p>A descendant of one of the great men of king Solomon's time, became a gentleman to so improved a degree as to despise the good qualities which originally ennobled his family. He had a house on the sea-side, where he spent great part of his time in hunting and fishing; but found himself impeded in the pursuit of these important diversions by a long slip of marsh land overgrown with high reeds, that lay between his house and the sea. The owner of this slip was a poor but honest basket-maker, who gained his livelihood by working up the flags of these reeds in a manner peculiar to himself; and be had resisted every effort to make him yield up possession. His gentleman neighbor resolving at length that it became not a man of his quality to submit to any restraint on his pleasures for the ease and convenience of a vulgar mechanic, took advantage of a very high wind, and commanded his servants to burn down the barrier.</p>
               <p>The basket-maker, who saw himself undone, complained of the oppression, in terms more suited to his sense of the injury<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5993-00000144"/> than the respect due to the rank of the offender; and the reward this imprudence procured him, was the additional injustice of blows and reproaches, and all kinds of insult and indignity.</p>
               <p>There was but one way to obtain remedy, and he took it for, going to the capital, with the marks of his hard usage upon him, he threw himself at the feet of the king, and procured a citation for the oppressor's appearance; who confessing the charge, proceeded to justify his behavior, by the poor man's unmindfulness of the submission due from the vulgar to gentlemen of rank and distinction.</p>
               <p>"But, pray," replied the king, "what distinction of rank had the grandfather of your father, when, being a cleaver of wood in the palace of my ancestors, he was raised from among those vulgar you speak of with so much contempt, in reward of an instance he gave of his courage and loyalty in defence of his master? Yet, his distinction was nobler than yours. It was the distinction of soul, not of birth; the superiority of worth, not of fortune! I am sorry I have a gentleman who is base enough to be ignorant that ease and distinction of fortune were bestowed on him but to this end, that being at rest from all cares of providing for himself, he might apply his heart, head, and hand for the public advantage of others."</p>
               <p>Here the king, discontinuing his speech, fixed an eye of indignation on a sullen resentment of mien which he observed in the haughty offender, who muttered out his dislike of the encouragement this way of thinking must give the commonalty; who, he said, were to be considered as persons of no consequence, in comparison of men who were born to be honored. "Where reflection is wanting," replied the king, with a smile of disdain, "men must find their defects in the pain of their sufferings. Tanhumo," added he, turning to a captain of his galleys, "strip the injured and the injurer; convey them to one of the most barbarous and remote of the islands; set them on shore in the night, and leave them both to their fortune."</p>
               <p>The place in which they were landed was a marsh, under cover of whose flags the gentleman was in hopes to conceal himself, and give the slip to a companion whom he considered it a disgrace to be found with. But the lights in the galley having given an alarm to the savages, a considerable body of them came down, and discovered in the morning the two strangers in their hiding-place. Setting up a dismal yell, they surrounded them; and, advancing nearer and nearer with their clubs, seemed determined to dispatch them without sense of hospitality or mercy.</p>
               <p>Here the gentleman began to discover that the superiority of blood was imaginary, for between a consciousness of shame and cold, under the nakedness he had never been used to, a fear of the event from the fierceness of the savages, and the want of an idea whereby to soften or divert their asperity, he fell behind the poor sharer of his calamity, and with an unsinewed, apprehensive, unmanly, sneakingness of mien, gave up the post of honor, and made a leader of the very man whom he had thought it a disgrace to consider as a companion.</p>
               <p>The basket-maker, on the contrary, to whom the poverty of his condition had made nakedness habitual; to whom a life of pain and mortification represented death as not dreadful; and whose remembrance of his skill and art, of which these savages were ignorant, gave him hopes of procuring safety from demonstrating that he could be useful, moved with bolder and more open freedom, and, having plucked a handful of the flags, sat down without emotion; and making signs that he would show them something worthy of their attention, fell to<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5993-00000145"/> work with smiles and noddings; while the savages drew near and gazed in expectation of the consequence.</p>
               <p>It was not long before he had weaved a kind of coronet of pretty workmanship, and, rising with respect and fearlessness, approached the savage, who appeared the chief, and placed it gently on his head. The figure of the sable warrior, under this new ornament, so charmed and struck the followers, that they threw down their clubs, and formed a dance of welcome and congratulation round the author of so prized a favor.</p>
               <p>There was not one but showed marks of impatience to be made as fine as his captain; so the poor basket-maker had his hands full of employment; and the savages observing the one quite idle, while the other was busy in their service, took up arms in behalf of natural justice, and began to lay on arguments in favor of their purpose.</p>
               <p>The basket-maker's pity now effaced the remembrance of his sufferings; so he rose and rescued his oppressor by making signs that he was ignorant of the art, but might, if they thought fit, be usefully employed in waiting on the work, and fetching flags for his supply as fast as he should want them.</p>
               <p>This proposition luckily fell in with a desire the savages expressed, to keep themselves at leisure, that they might crowd round and mark the progress of a work they took such pleasure in. They left the gentleman therefore to his duty in the basket-maker's service; and considered him from that time forward, as one who was, and ought to be treated as inferior to their benefactor.</p>
               <p>Men, wives, and children, from all corners of the island, came in droves for coronets, and setting the uninstructed gentleman to work to gather boughs and poles, made a fine hut to lodge the basket-maker, and brought down daily from the country such provisions as they lived upon themselves taking care to offer the imagined servant nothing till the master was done eating.</p>
               <p>Three months' reflection in this mortified condition, gave a new and juster turn to our gentleman's improved ideas; insomuch that, lying weeping, and awake, one night, he thus confessed his sentiments in the ear of the basket-maker.</p>
               <p>"I have been to blame, and wanted judgment to distinguish between accident and excellence; when I should have measured nature, I but looked to vanity. The preference which fortune gives is empty and imaginary; and I perceive too late, that only things of use are naturally honorable. I am ashamed when I compare my malice, to remember your humanity: but if the gods should please to call me to a repossession of my rank and happiness, I will divide all with you, in atonement of my justly punished arrogance."</p>
               <p>He promised and performed his promise; for the king soon after sent the captain, who had landed them, with presents to the savages, and ordered him to bring both back again. And it continues a custom in the island, to degrade all gentlemen who cannot give a better reason for their pride, than that they were born to do nothing, and the word for this just punishment is, "<hi rend="i"/>Send him to the basket maker's".</p>

               <head>LIGHTS AND SHADOWS.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY ANGELA OF GLEN COTTAGE.</head>
               <p>IT was at the close of a warm day in summer, that a man with battered hat, and tattered clothes, with a poor forlorn-looking woman and three little girls, called at the mansion of Judge Blanchard, to solicit lodgings in his barn, on the new-made hay, for the night. The barn was open, and there, in the dusk of evening, they grouped together to eat the crusts of charity, and to rest their weary limbs after the day's travel in the hot sun. Poor creatures! what has brought them to this miserable state of things? Dear reader, I am obliged to tell you, it is the common cause of the misery and wretchedness of this life,—Intemperance!</p>
               <p>To cure an evil, it must be known. And what is there <emph>greater</emph>, or what has more power to destroy social and domestic happiness, than this alarming vice!</p>
               <p>We see these poor creatures, beggars as they are, but they have not always been thus; and what has brought them to this destitute and deplorable condition, without a shelter for their defenceless heads?</p>
               <p>Away back in the past, there stands a lowly but pleasant cottage, covered with creepers and surrounded with roses, and there sits by the door a beautiful young girl with her sewing, at the close of a lovely day. Ever and anon she raises her anxious eyes toward the street, and leans forward, as if she expects to see something. There are several trees that partly obscure the<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5993-00000147"/> road, but there is a form just appearing in sight, that causes her young warm heart to pause in its beatings, and then it goes again faster than ever.</p>
               <p>Henry Melville, surely—and who would not be pleased to see so fine-looking a young man?</p>
               <p>Many and frequent were the evenings thus passed, and no foreboding of evil had ever crossed her inexperienced mind. No thought but that of complete, and perfect happiness, lay in the bright future, for she had never heard that he had any bad habit, and her unsuspecting heart, could never have formed so unkind a thought of one so beloved.</p>
               <p>Oh, if she had known the truth, "what darts of agony had missed her heart," but she lived in days when drinking habits were kept concealed, and out of sight, till the vice of inebriety glared through the blood-shot eyes, and revealed the loathsome story, when remedy was too late!</p>
               <p>That was, indeed, a sad day; and how many "bowed their hearts and heads" in death, worn out with the anguish of a drunkard's wife! for what can bring such torturing woe, such scalding tears, such deep-rooted sorrow?</p>
               <p>Poor Mary Mansfield—how innocent and lovely she busies herself about the house, moving around like a lightfooted sylph, and her heart full of the delicious vision of domestic happiness.</p>
               <p>She looks forward to the time, when she and Henry, will have a house of their own, and what a sweet thought to have his care and company, and herself ministering to his wants.</p>
               <p>That day came at length, and how brightly passed those hours. Every little comfort was nicely arranged, in due order, and those dear visions were no longer shadowy fiction, but blissful <emph>reality</emph>.</p>
               <p>Their little tea-table was neatly spread in their own "sweet home;" and that first meal together, was one long to be remembered membered—and why should anything have come to mar or cloud their joy?</p>
               <p>Henry had long been in the habit of taking his glass, but no one thought, in those days, that moderate drinking would lead to <emph>Intemperance!</emph> or that so likely a young man, could become a drunkard, and no word of <emph>caution</emph> had ever been breathed in his ear.</p>
               <p>There were then no Temperance Societies—no strong public opinion, to frown on such practices; and on he went, till his chains were fetters of iron, binding him hand and foot!</p>
               <p>Oh, what a night was that, when Henry was first brought home in the arms of men, reasonless, and helpless as the dead! What desolation, and despair, filled the lonely heart of the young wife and mother, as she laid down her infant, to gaze on the features of her lost husband; yes, lost he was, indeed; and life, ever after, wore the sombre hues of the grave, for nothing could ever erase from her memory, the terrible visions of that night!</p>
               <p>To trace him all the way downward, would be but a gloomy task. But there were entreaties, and promises, hopes and fears, disappointment and sorrow, in the recurrence of every mournful day, and at that time no one put forth an effort to prevent the infatuated <emph>inebriate</emph> in his course of ruin, and disgrace, and self immolation; and there was then no kind Son or friend of Temperance to lift him up, and surround him with a hearty influence. The maxims of that time were, "Let them <emph>alone</emph>, if they want to drink let them drink." "It will be abridging their <emph>liberties</emph>, and this is a free country."</p>
               <p>Weary years filled with the sorrowful details of want and misery, passed on in gloom, poverty and sorrow, until all their little comforts were sold, for debts incurred at the bar-room and grocery, and this incited their landlord to eject them, ragged and<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5993-00000148"/> penniless, from the poor hovel in which they had long been sheltered.</p>
               <p>Countless were the sorrows of those woeful years—but a <emph>home</emph> was some recompense—a place where poor Mary could pillow her weary heart and head; and to hide her sufferings in the deep sepulchre of her own desolate bosom was some alleviation. But oh, how bitter the hour, when taking the two youngest by the hand, she led them forth into a bleak world, and wept as she looked back, as if it had been her paradise. Thus will the heart of women cling to whatever has given it rest or support, even in its bitterness and agony!</p>
               <p>How strongly this scene contrasted with the bright visions of her early years, and had she not reason to feel that no woe is like that of being the wretched wife of a miserable drunkard, when her eyes fell, for the last time, on the dim outline of her lowly hovel retreating in the distance, and she felt herself homeless for ever.</p>
               <p>She looked at her husband—literally clothed in rags of various colors—every lineament of his face disfigured, and changed, and his dull bleared eyes showing the imbecility of his weakened intellect, and thought of Henry Melville as he used to be, in days that were past, and such a sigh as only comes from the <emph>depths of a broken-hearted wife</emph>, was breathed to the moaning winds, at the same time looking up to Heaven for protection and mercy in this hour of need and trial!</p>
               <p>It was only this, that gave her strength to go forward, for she had long since learned to put her trust in God as her only friend and helper.</p>
               <p>The two youngest girls were old enough to travel slowly, and knew not the bitter thoughts that were in their poor mother's heart. They loved her and each other, and were happy, they knew not why. They could laugh and pick the flowers, and while the cravings of hunger were satisfied, they could lie down by the road-side, and sleep as sweetly as if on a bed of down.</p>
               <p>Ally the oldest was nine, and had learned to be useful from her earliest years. She exercised a kind of motherly care of the little ones on their weary errand of beggary, and would sometimes ask her father to get a home again, as night reminded her of rest and slumber.</p>
               <p>Away on the hill stands a lofty dwelling of imposing appearance, that attracts the eyes of the poor travellers. It betokens abundance and wealth, and a kind of instinctive feeling drew them in their want where it seemed most easy that their wants should be supplied. This, at the time, appeared a mere matter of chance, but He who "feeds the ravens" and clothes the lily of the valley, directed every step of their aimless way. His pitying eye was upon His child, as she silently implored aid from Heaven for herself and destitute family.</p>
               <p>They little thought, as thus nightfall brought them to the hospitable mansion of Judge Blanchard, that so many blessings were wrapped up in that one little event, showing in so marked a way, the care of an over-ruling Providence around those who confidingly put their trust in Him.</p>
               <p>Weary and glad of a place to rest, they quietly slept on the new hay, while the mother's wakeful thoughts, were ascending on high, with earnest prayer, that God would aid them.</p>
               <p>Oh, what a beautiful morning dawned! the rosy east was slightly veiled with delicate clouds that disappeared as the sun in splendor sent his radiant beams over the waking earth. The children were early astir, and as they saw the cows standing around the barn, began their clamors for milk. They saw them come from the house with pails, and watched them as they filled them high with the rich foam, and the poor mother could<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5993-00000149"/> not satisfy the little one till she promised to send to the house for a cup for her. Little Ally was promptly out, wending her way to the mansion, over the dewy grass with her little bare feet, and, in respectful words, was asking for the creamy beverage and a pittance for their breakfasts. Oh, the poor beggar, <emph>who is so from necessity</emph>, may you fare as well!</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanchard was one of those women who live for some purpose. Not satisfied with merely passing the days and living in ease and idleness, dreaming away the hours on the sofa, or bed, she felt that life had duties, and she shrank not from any effort that could in any way promote the interests of her family, or those of her <emph>fellow-beings</emph>.</p>
               <p>It was a pleasure to her to minister to the wants of those who needed aid, and when she saw the figure of the little girl, she required no importunity, but welcomed her in, asking her if she wanted anything to eat. This took away the burden from Ally's heart, for <emph>she had been often denied</emph>, and almost feared that she might be again.</p>
               <p>Her sweet accent, and respectful manner, won the heart of kind Mrs. Blanchard, and when she examined, with some scrutiny, her intelligent face, her dark eyes, and still darker hair, and beheld her in the faded, soiled garb of poverty, she thought of the fulness and overflowing abundance of her own house, and the voice of God was in her ear, and in her heart. How fast the words of Scripture came to her mind: "He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord." "He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack, but he that <emph>hideth</emph> his eyes shall have many a <emph>curse</emph>," &amp;c.; and a pan was well filled with provisions, with a pitcher of milk. Little Ally had to go and come several times to carry all the food and dishes in her small hands.</p>
               <p>When their full repast was over, Ally returned the dishes, and meanwhile Mrs. Blanchard had time to consider her duty and her inclination, in behalf of the little girl. Her own daughters were married, and richly supplied, and no one could possibly suffer in thought or reality by an arrangement she had it in her heart to make.</p>
               <p>With many thanks from her mother, Ally gave the dishes into Mrs. Blanchard's hands, and as she looked the child in the face, she kindly asked her if she would like to stay with her. She had seen, as if in a vision, what power she held in her own heart to change that poor child's destiny, and she dare not refuse to do so manifest a duty. The thought, it is true, had come ever her with force, that her own cares and anxieties would be increased, but still could she not make some sacrifice for the good of others? Why had God made her to differ from them, unless to give room for the exercise of one of his own highest attributes, that of <emph>benevolence</emph>, and her own selfish thoughts were banished, when she made the enquiry.</p>
               <p>Poor little Ally had never thought of leaving her mother, and although she knew her poverty, yet she hardly knew what to answer, but told her she thought she should like to stay, if her parents thought best to have her; but little she knew what an entire change in her character and life those few words were likely to produce.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanchard sent Ally to call her parents, that she might talk the matter over with them. The father did not care, and chose not to go; but the mother felt that perhaps her prayer was about to be answered, and seemed to see the kind hand of her Heavenly Father pointing the way. She left the little ones with the husband, and followed Ally into the residence of wealth and luxury.</p>
               <p>The poor woman's face showed that cankering sorrow had been lying at her heart-strings, for it has its own peculiar expression in the eye and about the mouth; and then her<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5993-00000150"/> voice was keyed to its low and spiritual tones in a mournful cadence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanchard touched upon the subject with as much delicacy as if she was desiring a favor, knowing that even the lowest poverty cannot destroy a mother's love.</p>
               <p>They seemed to be each under the same directing influence, and it required but a few words to come to a decision, and make all suitable arrangements, and Ally was to be left at the elegant mansion on the hill.</p>
               <p>The mother only can know, what fearful sufferings and corroding anguish of heart, must be long and bitterly felt before she could be induced to give to a stranger the first dear child of her love at so tender an age!</p>
               <p>This step made room for another, and a new desire was awakened in the heart of the mother to remain near her child.</p>
               <p>With aid and encouragement an old house was found, and among the ancient stores of Mrs. Blanchard, put away as useless lumber, was furnished articles amply enough to supply their scanty need, and to make them as a small household, quite comfortable, which was, to this poor family, as if a fortune had suddenly fallen to them.</p>
               <p>The miserable father having been by necessity compelled to do without his inebriating draught began to feel a spark of <emph>humanity</emph> kindling in his callous breast, for he actually put up the bedstead, and gathered fuel for a fire on the old wide hearth, and was heard humming snatches of old tunes he had known in earlier days.</p>
               <p>It was in the suffering mother's heart a warm ray of comfort shining down from the throne of Heaven, and devout gratitude arose like a cloud of sweet incense, from the altar of her thoughts.</p>
               <p>She would once have looked upon such a home with horror, but it seemed to her now as a sweet place of repose and shelter, from the wandering, uncertain life of sometimes abused beggary, to which her delicate nature had been forced to submit, by the overmastering power of Intemperance.</p>
               <p>But as opportunities of labor occurred, and scanty means were obtained, a large part of it was daily expended at a neighboring <emph>bar</emph>, whose owner seemed to have lost all conscience, as he took the very pence his poor family needed for bread, in exchange for the destructive potions of inebriety.</p>
               <p>This was no <hi rend="i"/>new disappointment, but had become a part of her dreary history; and she meekly, and with broken spirit, assumed the extra labor of daily toil, in families, to eke out subsistence for her family at her desolate hearth-side.</p>
               <p>Years are soon told, and nature—abused nature—will not always last. Clear as a sunbeam, and true to the Eternal record, "half his days" were not numbered, when disease attacked the brain with the drunkard's delirium. The ravings and howlings of despair were only a parallel, a faint foretaste of an endless future of mental anguish, which held him bound to its Promethean Rock of torture for an almost endless week!</p>
               <p>This penalty, which will come at times, makes terrible havoc with the citadel of life, and through its broken door, the already condemned spirit, is often called from its walls, to obey the summons of its Creator. But not yet, was the mandate given to him; he must live a little longer, as a distinct warning to the living, "to shun the paths of the Destroyer!"</p>
               <p>So enfeebled had he become, that he could no longer work, and so unmanageable at home, that his wife could not endure his brutal conduct, made doubly ferocious by words of anger, blasphemy and profaneness, and could not leave him, to labor for their daily wants. This compelled her to the <emph>last step</emph> of human necessity, to report her case to the "Overseer of the<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5993-00000151"/> Poor," who removed them to the general receptacle of want and woe, where, in a few wretched months, he ended his earthly career. And here, unwept, unloved, the loathsome remains of the drunkard were borne to the grave by a few miserable Paupers, made so by the same unhappy cause.</p>
               <p>There is a <emph>loneliness</emph> even for an Inebriate's widow, and now she thinks of him as when she first knew him, and in her happier days, and realizes the sadness of a heart bereaved, strange as it seems! We wonder at these things, only to confess their truth. It is so natural for the mind to feed itself with affectionate thoughts, and cherish the memory of those we ever loved! Once more she went forth as poverty and want will do, to find places among strangers for her children, and one for herself, but first of all, to see her dear Ally.</p>
               <p>The home of wealth and comfort will not always supply happiness; many a sorrowful heart and tearful eye may be found amid the elegancies of luxurious abodes; and at first, poor little Ally <emph>wept</emph> as she felt herself surrounded only by strangers, separated as she now was from her little playmate sisters, and her affectionate mother, but not long did such feelings control the little one's thoughts.</p>
               <p>She continued to feel a little strange for awhile, undergoing so much of a change in her habits and life, but a thorough <hi rend="i"/>bath, clean new <hi rend="i"/>clothes, and nice combed <hi rend="i"/>hair, produced as much of a revolution in her <hi rend="i"/>feelings as they did in her appearance, and she felt herself no longer a beggar girl. She soon became attached to her new home, and no day passed without marked improvement in attainments, which made Mrs. Blanchard feel that her labors and efforts were meeting a full recompense in the satisfaction of doing good to others, and strongly securing the grateful affections of the child, which seemed to warm her own heart like a sunbeam, and gave to her childless home something of its former aspect, when her own, were about her in their innocent joy.</p>
               <p>What changes a few years will produce in that period when light hearted, thoughtless childhood is passing away, it seems almost like a new existence in some, and Ally at this time seemed to be undergoing a blossoming process in the very spring time of womanhood. The very heart of the rose was on her cheek, while the delicate lily was on her brow. Thought sparkled in her dark eye, and her laugh was no longer that of careless mirth, but the real smile of intelligence and rational happiness dimpling in her face. The developing period is sometimes slow, but in others rapid and peculiar. The <hi rend="i"/>oldest, and one <hi rend="i"/>alone in a family are soonest to mature, they are sooner thrown upon their own resources, and gather strength by every personal effort, as the weakened limb will by use. The influences of Mrs. Blanchard's home training, and the acquirements of school, were weaving for her character and mind a beautiful fabric, and adorning her heart and life with the brightest ornaments.</p>
               <p>Gentleness, benevolence, sincerity, and their attendant sister graces, were beautifully manifest in her daily deportment, and although she was very often made to feel the cold and bitter scorn of contempt as it curled on the lip, and the sly wink and smile, and whisper of malice, or envy, yet it only served to heighten and ripen all the rarest richest flowers of female character, and gave a more distinct reality to her real goodness and worth. It was the very discipline of heaven to unfold in her young heart the meekness and forbearance and forgiveness of the precious Saviour, and to make her cling the closer to His love, and the shadow of his wing. And was she not strengthened, and comforted, and enlightened by these very trials, that in her pathway seemed only like sharp and piercing thorns?</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5993-00000152"/>
               <p>When her poor mother and young sisters dragging their weary weight of poverty and sorrow came, she did not turn her eye coldly upon them, ashamed of their wretchedness, but her eyes filled with genuine tears of pitying emotions and natural affection for those she loved, and the death of her father seemed like a cruel blow from the <emph>monster Intemperance</emph>, and from that time her eyes were fully opened to the small beginnings of his deadly influence; and oh, how it pained her to see the fatal wine-cup passing in the social circle, for she knew it was the first link in the strong chain that binds the drunkard, and she saw its first bright links reaching on to those dark corroded ones that lie around the inebriate in the street gutter.</p>
               <p>Good Mrs. Blanchard did what she could to soothe and comfort her homeless visitors, and soon found places for both the children, where they could be <emph>useful</emph> and <emph>benefitted</emph>, and their morals and education should form a part of the arrangement. And the mother early found herself in a pleasant home, as nurse and friend, where she was both loved and respected for her kindness and real worth.</p>
               <p>A few more years, and what a change has come to Ally, the poor little girl that slept on the hay! In one of our largest cities you may see her presiding over an elegant mansion, occupying the same rooms that were recently occupied by the family of one of our most distinguished ambassadors to a foreign court. <emph>These are life's pictures in some of their strongest contrasts of light and shade!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Clifton is a happy woman, and knows well how to appreciate every blessing. When little Charlie lay in his luxurious cradle, and the delicate light came through the damask curtains to mingle with the odor of a fresh vase of newly-blossomed flowers, and the light step of the nurse was scarce an audible sound in that chamber of wealth, the young mother's heart was filled even to tears, with a deep, full sense of gratitude and joy. She thought of her own blessings in contrast with those of her own dear mother's, and words of loving praise went up to her Father in Heaven!</p>
               <p>A few more years, and as the evening lamps were lighting up the large parlor revealing statues and pictures, and costly books, flowers, birds, &amp;c., a happy group were eagerly listening to Mr. Clifton as he relates the news of the day. That elderly lady in the plain neat cap, sitting in the sofa-chair, is Mrs. Clifton's mother, and those young ladies are her married sisters, who, in separate homes, are living in the same city, accomplished in all the arts of housekeeping, and intelligent, affectionate companions of honorable men; and the three husbands, as Temperance days came on, were strong friends of the cause, faithfully encouraged and aided, by the co-operations of their families, exerting by their position, example, and personal efforts, a wide-spread influence.</p>
               <p>The whole group are looking greatly surprised, and their eyes sparkle with wonder and astonishment, as Mr. Clifton relates something that seems to interest, as well as to pain them.</p>
               <p>He stood in his store, and heard an unusual noise, and saw a whole troup of boys chasing after a man in tattered clothes, who was evidently in a state of deep intoxication, and they were making themselves merry with his debasement. He stepped out and dispersed them, and to his own utter astonishment found it to be James Gardiner, whom they had all known when he was a promising clerk in a neighboring city near where they lived, and whose parents were friends of Judge Blanchard in the same place.</p>
               <p>Ah, yes! and Mrs. Clifton had now full reason to know that she had done wisely when she discarded him in early life, solely for the reason that she knew him to be a <emph>wine drinker</emph>,<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5993-00000153"/> and that his inclinations led him often to places of <hi rend="i"/>social excitement; and knew, too, that he was a gay, unwary young man, who sacrificed <emph>principle</emph> at the <emph>shrine of pleasure</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Can we not do something for him?" asked Mrs. Clifton; "do ask him to spend the night with us, and don't let him refuse to come: tell him we wish to see him."</p>
               <p>James Gardiner felt at first very reluctant to see his old friends, and Mrs. Clifton in particular, for he had not lost his <hi rend="i"/>memory; and pride, and shame, were evidently striving for the mastery.</p>
               <p>A denial could not be taken, and Mr. Clifton, with the poor miserable outcast by his side, was soon at the door of his own elegant mansion. It was an affecting, painful meeting to all, as they all knew too well the cause of poor James's ruin, degradation and poverty.</p>
               <p>The pledge—the heaven-sent pledge—has done wonders; and many a poor, lost, wretched, infatuated being has been brought under its influence; and before he left the city, he was again a sober man, and through their influence was aided and encouraged, till he went back to his old employer, and was again restored to himself and society, and from that time saw that the only safety for <emph>man is total abstinence!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanchard lived to see most of these changes, and in them she thankfully acknowledged the goodness of her Father in Heaven! And, dear reader, were they not clearly the result of her own fully rewarded efforts for the good of others? It is indeed the sweet blending of human agency with an Overruling Providence, who manifestly adds His benignant smile and blessing to <emph>benevolent actions</emph>, and a warm-hearted <emph>Philanthropy!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Ought we to be satisfied to live in a world of mutual dependencies without doing some deed to benefit our fellow-creatures tures? There is something heroic and noble in the acts of benevolence and kindness that seem to raise, and elevate and dignify human nature.</p>
               <p>Who would be one that no one can love—that no one can thank? It is when we kindle the fire of gratitude in some bosom, that the flame of love and happiness, <emph>burns brightest in our own</emph>.</p>

               <head>IDELLA PEMBERTON.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY REV. PHILIP P. NEELY.</head>
               <p>"I am glad you have come, William," said Idella Pemberton to her husband, as he entered the room late one evening in November; "I feel so lonely as the night winds beat against the walls, and Agnes has been worse all the evening. William, I know your business in town demands much of your time, yet will you not try and spare yourself from it, so that you can spend your evenings with me until our babe is beyond the danger of another paroxysm? It frightens me so much when you are away. When she has recovered, I will endeavor to resign myself to your necessary absence."</p>
               <p>Her kind words and pleading eyes went directly to the heart of William Pemberton, who, drawing his young wife affectionately to his bosom, replied—</p>
               <p>"Yes, Idella, I have neglected you and our little Agnes too long. I promise you to watch with you until she is quite well. To-morrow evening I will bring out a collection of books, so that our hours of watching may pass pleasantly and profitably away."</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5993-00000154"/>
               <p>"You are very kind to me," said Idella, while tears, such as she had not shed for weeks, gathered in her eyes.</p>
               <p>William Pemberton was a young man of ardent and generous feelings. Having received a liberal education under the direction of his uncle, and <choice>
                     <sic>possesing</sic>
                     <corr>possessing</corr>
                  </choice> a handsome patrimony, he embarked in the mercantile business in the loveliest village of the South. It was there he saw Idella Chandler. She was just seventeen, and such was the gentleness and amiability of her disposition, that a few months' association was sufficient to win his affections. He wooed her, and was successful. They were as happy a pair as ever knelt before the bridal altar; and none that gazed upon him, as he stood in the manliness of youth, or on her, as she trembled beneath a robe of purest white—beautiful emblem of a spotless heart—and were united in the most hallowed relation on earth, would have dreamed that shadows would ever darken the path on whose flowery threshold they were then standing.</p>
               <p>At the time our story opens, they were living in a retired cottage house, a short distance from town. Two years had glided by since their marriage, and the morn of their wedded love had been unclouded. The frank, ingenuous nature of William Pemberton made him the easy subject of temptation, and unfortunately his resistance was but too unsuccessful. For some weeks he had returned home late at night, maintaining throughout the evening a silent and morose manner. He gave as his excuse, that the opening of his fall stock of goods required his unceasing attention, and the confiding Idella, with a credulity inseparable from true affection, doubted it not. Perhaps, if she had marked closely the expression of his eye, or had narrowly watched his step, the wildness of one and the unsteadiness of the other would have revealed, with a too dreadful certainty, the fearful peril to which he was exposed. She knew that he was not as he once was, but the voice of affection whispered an excuse for him, in the worldly cares with which he was surrounded. Of his absence she had not yet complained; but when her babe sickened, she ventured to plead for the company of her husband, and prevailed. The recovery of Agnes was rapid. During the evenings which William passed at home, it seemed as if he and Idella had entered upon a new existence. All his former tenderness returned. He read to his wife, and hung around the couch of the little invalid; administered needful restoratives with a husband's kindness and a father's love. When the child recovered entirely, William still spent his evenings with his family, in reading or rambling. It was a season of quietude and peace. Gradually he returned to his former habits—drank deeper and deeper of the wine-cup, until it cast off the bonds of moral restraint, and bound him in its damning vassalage. Idella—the gentle, the devoted Idella—was the last to believe William Pemberton a drunkard.</p>
               <p>It was a stormy night in the winter of 1840. The wind blew in fitful gusts, and the snow fell through the clap-board roof of a miserable hovel in one of the miserable streets of —, Gathered around a handful of wasting embers in that wretched hut, was a pale woman and two children; one a daughter about fourteen, the other a son, seemingly about six years old. The mother was sewing by the feeble light of an old lamp fastened to the wall, while the daughter read to her the experience of a reformed drunkard, which had been slipped under a crazy door-shutter by some unknown friend. This was the once happy Idella Pemberton, and her worse than orphan children. Her husband had drank till he was a sot—nay, more, a <emph>pauper</emph>.</p>
               <p>His property was gone, his kindness was gone, and upon the feeble Idella and her daughter fell the support of the family. She was a frail creature, and the sufferings of the mind, combined<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5993-00000155"/> bined with those of the body, were wasting her away. It was apparent that without a change she would soon be beyond the griefs that were preying upon her bosom. Yet she murmured not. Amid the want that poured upon her, and the <unclear>reproaches</unclear> of her husband, she was uncomplaining.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother, what <emph>shall</emph> we do? Is there no hope for my dear father?" said Agnes, laying down the book, and sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child, there is hope in God. He has said, 'Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you.' In Him have I confided, and in Him do I still hope. He has never forsaken us altogether, nor will He while we trust in Him."</p>
               <p>"Dear mother, how can I bear it? You are dying every day, and when you are gone, what will become of me and my poor little brother Willie? Oh, mother, can't we get father to sign the pledge?"</p>
               <p>"Be calm, my child. The Lord is good, and should He take me, He will provide for you and your brother. You must go before Him with your wants. Take your mother's wants before Him through Jesus Christ. Remember that the promise is, that if you ask, you shall receive. Cast your burden on Him and He will sustain you."</p>
               <p>"My dear mother, let us go to Him <emph>now</emph>. Now let us kneel before Him here. I feel as if He would answer our prayers. I <emph>know</emph> He will. O, mother, let us try and prove Him now."</p>
               <p>And in that lonely hour, while the wild wind was moaning piteously without, and coldness was pinching the sufferers within, did that girl and her mother bow before God, to test His faithfulness. And never did purer aspirations ascend to Heaven than the pleading of that suffering band. Never did angel-watchers assist by their mysterious ministrations in a holier cause. It was the agony of a breaking heart as it groaned under the accumulated lated wrongs of years. The vision of the past swept before the wretched Idella, and her soul seemed to embody all its hopes into one.</p>
               <p>She wrestled, struggled, and wept, as if her heart was rumbling beneath the intensity of her agony. She prayed for he reformation of her husband—for it to begin then—<emph>that moment</emph>, wherever he might be. Her words seemed to be the raising of faith far above unbelief—the sundering of its fetters—the laying of the torn, bleeding heart before God. "O, Thou righteous Being!" she exclaimed, "who hast promised help in need, hear from Thy holy habitation the wretched inmates of a cold hovel. Thou who hast in Thy mysterious dispensations banished me from the protection of parental love, and who hast for Thine own wise purposes, left me and my little ones to struggle on in misfortune and want; O, look upon us in our misery, and answer our supplications. O, reclaim him around whom my heart still clings, even in his degradation, and save him from eternal woe. O, righteous God! I <emph>do</emph> believe,—help Thou my unbelief! Bring him back to the path wherein we once walked happily together, and"—</p>
               <p>At that moment the door opened, and William Pemberton rushed into the arms of his kneeling wife, exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"O, my suffering angel, Idella, your prayer is answered. I have this night joined the Washingtonians, and if there is grace in heaven to aid a poor suffering worm, my pledge shall be kept."</p>
               <p>"Amen," fervently responded the bewildered, weeping wife.</p>
               <p>"O, Idella! can you, will you forgive all—my unkindness, my cruelty? Then from this night forward, God being my helper, I will be a sober man, and will seek to make you happy."</p>
               <p>"Dear husband! let the past be forgotten," replied the<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5993-00000156"/> happy wife, while she cried aloud in the delirium of her joy; "let us trust in God for the future."</p>
               <p>"Agnes, my daughter, will you forgive your father's unkindness, and pray that I may never depart from my resolution?"</p>
               <p>"O, my dear father, I will love you more than I ever did, and will always pray for you," said the sobbing girl, and she threw her arms about her father's neck and kissed away his tears.</p>
               <p>"And, father," said Willie, who stood by weeping at the strange scene, "you will let me love you, and kiss you, as I do mother, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son, and strive to be worthy of it too," said the father, as he pressed him to his bosom.</p>
               <p>The wind, in its wild careerings that night, swept not over a happier house than the lonely hovel of William Pemberton.</p>
               <p>Five years have passed away, and William Pemberton, by sobriety and industry, has regained his cottage home, and there, with his pious Idella, to whose cheek the bloom of health has returned, and their children, he is spending his days in quietude and devotion.</p>
               <p>Is your husband a drunkard? Be gentle with him and pray for him. Are you a drunkard, or a moderate drinker? Remember the wife of your bosom, the children of your love, and the soul you possess, which is of incalulable worth. May God bless this narrative to your good.</p>

               <head>THE LOVE OF ZEPHYR AND THE VIOLET.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY JOHN WESLEY WHITFELD.</head>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>A MODEST little violet once rear'd her head on high</l>
                  <l>To catch the music of the breeze, as it went humming by;</l>
                  <l>But Zephyr's heart was full of joy, he sped in haste along,</l>
                  <l>And saw not that sweet violet—absorb'd in his own song,</l>
                  <l>The slighted beauty bow'd her head, and heav'd a plaintive sigh</l>
                  <l>And as she bow'd a trembling tear stole from her glist'ning eye</l>
                  <l>He lov'd me once, she sighing said, and can he break his vow?</l>
                  <l>Ah! he has found some fairer one, to share his pleasures now!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>And I am left alone, alas! alone alas to die,</l>
                  <l>With none to kiss my burning cheek or fan me with a sigh,</l>
                  <l>O cruel Zephyr, didst thou know I only live for thee,</l>
                  <l>And only smile when thou art nigh, thou couldst not faithless be,</l>
                  <l>Or is it true, as I have heard, thou lovest but an hour,</l>
                  <l>And then art off, to woo and win some seeming fairer flower?</l>
                  <l>Adieu to love, adieu to life! my heart, my heart will break!</l>
                  <l>O Zephyr take me to thy arms, I'm dying for thy sake!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>She wept aloud—her plaintive tone flew o'er the blossom'd plain,</l>
                  <l>And Zephyr heard his true love's voice, and turn'd him back again</l>
                  <l>"Is that my lov'd one's voice?" he cried. "Is that the sound of woe?"</l>
                  <l>Fly quick my wings and bear me on! why do you move so slow;</l>
                  <l>Impatient, and with trembling heart he gained the well known spot</l>
                  <l>And gazed upon the drooping fair—He raised her—She was not!</l>
                  <l>He wildly clasped her fragile form and kissed her pallid cheek,</l>
                  <l>And craved a word, a look or smile, but ah, she could not speak?</l>
               </lg>

               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>He gazed around with frantic stare, he saw a Blue-bell by,</l>
                  <l>And bade her tell him when, and how his true-love came to die;</l>
                  <l>The haughty creature curl'd her lip and answer'd with a sneer,</l>
                  <l>"You, broke my sister's trusting heart; she thought your love sincere;</l>
                  <l>But when she found that you were false, and pass'd her proudly by.</l>
                  <l>Her cup of bliss was broken then—what could she do, but die?"</l>
                  <l>Poor Zephyr toss'd his arms on high and wildly tore his hair,</l>
                  <l>And smote his breast in agony—then yielded to despair.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>And ever since that fatal day in which his true-love died,</l>
                  <l>He's wander'd frantic o'er the earth, and rav'd and wept, and sigh'd:</l>
                  <l>He sings the songs she used to love; he sings them o'er again</l>
                  <l>Until his heart is fill'd with grief, and fury turns his brain,</l>
                  <l>And then he rushes madly forth and scatters fear around,</l>
                  <l>And seizes on the giant oaks and hurls them to the ground.</l>
                  <l>He often broods above the deep and murmurs out his woe,</l>
                  <l>And kisses every weeping wave, that lifts its head of snow.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Then like a spoil'd and wayward child, he flies in wrath again,</l>
                  <l>And wildly rocks the sailor's bark, and lashes all the main.</l>
                  <l>He loves to roam through shady groves where dancing streams rejoice,</l>
                  <l>For in the music of their fall, he thinks he hears her voice.</l>
                  <l>He wildly howls through all the North, and sighs on Southern shores,</l>
                  <l>Until o'ercome, he sleeps, and dreams of her he still adores.</l>
                  <l>'Tis often thus with human love! Some tender hearted fair</l>
                  <l>Too quickly doubts her dear one's truth—too quickly courts despair;</l>
               </lg>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Some little word falls on her ear, some slight—perchance a jest,</l>
                  <l>It enters to her inmost soul and robs her of her rest,</l>
                  <l>And when he turns to woo again, he finds a stricken flower;</l>
                  <l>A blossom crushed unthinkingly—She withers from that hour,</l>
                  <l>And never more can lift her head and sweetly smile on all,</l>
                  <l>For disappointment chills the soul, and fills the heart with gall</l>
                  <l>And thus together both are slain, or if they live, 'tis worse,</l>
                  <l>For doubting those we once have lov'd, life soon becomes a curse.</l>

               <head>FEMALE PIONEERS OF THE WEST;</head>
               <head type="sub">BY MRS. E. T. ELLET</head>
               <head type="sub">MRS. McMILLAN.</head>
               <p>THE Female Pioneers of our north-western Territory, like the heroines of the Revolution, were formed by early training in habits of energetic industry, and familiarity with danger and privation, to take a prominent part in subduing the wild forest to the advance of civilization. Such a race will probably never again live in this country; the progress of improvement, art and luxury having produced a change in the character of American women, tending to effeminacy and soft indulgence. Not even a return of the perils of war and the necessity for exertion, could make a "Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother," out of the votary of pleasure, or even one whose life has been devoted to self-denying duties more gentle than those which fell to the lot of woman in more primitive days. She has now assimilated herself to her sisters in older lands by education and habit, losing the sterner features which belonged to the matrons who nursed the Republic's infancy. Yet those noble women, now passing away, are the pride and boast of their descendants; we love to dwell on their heroic deeds, their patriotic endurance of hardship, and to compare their homely but honest exterior with the delicacy and grace of the sex in modern days. It will be a pleasant task, therefore, to call up recollections of one among the many whose services, never likely to be rewarded by mention in history, claim our acknowledgement.</p>
               <p>Mrs. McMillan was among the early settlers of the eastern portion of Michigan. Her removal with husband and children from a more populous and cultivated region, was a laborious journey, performed in the same manner with other emigrants, in a small wagon, laden with a few necessary articles of comfort for their new home; by slow and toilsome stages—their nights being passed under some temporary shelter, insufficiently protected from the attacks of wild beasts, and subject to inconvenience from night dews, cold winds, and troublesome insects. Their establishment was attended with the same circumstances of labor and hardship, which have been described in numerous other cases. We pass to some incidents that may serve to illustrate the state of the times, as well as to show the courage and energy of this high-hearted matron.</p>
               <p>In 1813 she was living on the Canada side, in a small house on the banks of the Thames, a beautiful little river whose bright waters were often skimmed by canoes of savages intent on plunder or slaughter. The shrill war-whoop often sounded from the depths of the woods, causing much alarm to the inhabitants. Mr. McMillan had left his family to enter into active military service, and their home was two miles distant from the nearest neighbor. The country had been kept in a continual state of alarm by marauding parties of Indians, who did not hesitate to kill and capture, as well as rob, the defenceless settlers. Mrs. McMillan suffered the more from anxiety at this critical period, as in the absence of her husband the care of their young children devolved entirely upon her, and her sole protection was her own prudence and energy. One day having heard rumors of the approach of a hostile party, and being apprehensive of a sudden attack, she took her infant and walked to the nearest house in search of information. There she was startled with the intelligence that the savages had been seen in the vicinity, and that they had gone in the direction of her dwelling, where<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5993-00000160"/> they would probably stop during the day. The matron thought of the little ones she had left at home unprotected, and a sickening terror entered her heart. She stayed to hear no more, but hastened homeward, bearing in her arms the unconscious babe who might now be all that remained to her. As she came near, her eyes were eagerly strained for a sight of those beloved ones who were accustomed to run to meet her; all was silence; and when she dashed open the door and stood within the dwelling a scene of desolation met her view! Every article of furniture had disappeared; the floor was dusty with the track of strange footsteps, and not one of her children was any where on the premises.</p>
               <p>The alarm and anguish of the mother may be better imagined than described. The fatal idea had flashed at once on her mind, that her little ones had been either murdered or carried away captive by the merciless Indians. What was she to do? In this terrible emergency she lost none of her self possession, nor her usual sagacity of judgment. The savages could not have gone far, and her only course was to cross the river and seek aid immediately. But how was this to be done? there was no canoe, nor mode of conveyance; she could not swim, nor could she leave her helpless infant behind her. She was not long in discovering a way to overcome the difficulty. Hastily rolling some logs into the water, she placed two boards across them, forming a kind of raft, on which she stepped cautiously, carrying her babe, and managing to hold the frail craft together, while she guided its course, and reached the opposite shore in safety. Here her terror and anguish were suddenly changed into joy, the children had heard of the near approach of Indians immediately after their mother's departure, and, having taken the precaution to put the furniture in the cellar, out of the intruders' way, they had crossed the river to seek protection from the neighbors bors on the other side. The enemy had visited the house, but had done no mischief.</p>
               <p>On another occasion Mrs. McMillan suffered from Indian depredation. A large party from the different tribes was on the way to Toronto, and in the course of a single day some two hundred of them stopped at her house, plundering it of all it contained. McMillan was still absent, and the mother did not dare to interfere for the rescue of any portion of her property, lest she should draw down vengeance upon herself and her innocent children. The work of spoiling went on, therefore, while they stood quietly aloof. A fine flock of geese, which she had raised with care, was on the grass before the door, and the Indians soon commenced execution among them. Mrs. McMillan started forward to save her favorites; but a gun was instantly leveled at her, with the threat of shooting, if she ventured to interrupt the sport. Like many other matrons of that day, she prided herself on a handsome set of pewter dishes and plates, which her industrious scouring kept as bright as silver. Their polish and beauty pleased the Indians, who tried them by biting, to ascertain if they were real silver, and the whole stock speedily passed into the possession of the depredators, who left only a knife and a tin cup in the house. When the last of the enemy had passed over the river, the terrified family found themselves in safety, but exhausted with hunger, while nothing in the shape of food was left about the place. They were compelled to fast till supplies could be brought from a distance of several miles.</p>
               <p>When the war was over, and comparative quiet established, McMillan and his family, with two or three others, removed to Detroit, ascending the river on a large raft. The trials of the wife were not ended. Straggling bands of savages were still lurking in the neighborhood of the city, ready for any deed of robbery or bloodshed. One evening when McMillan had left<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5993-00000161"/> his home for a short time, the silence was broken by the report of a gun, which caused some alarm to his wife and children, though they were far from anticipating the extent of their calamity. The father's prolonged absence caused apprehension, which was terminated by fatal certainty; during the night his lifeless body was brought home. This blow was severely felt by the bereaved wife, but a sense of duty to the loved ones dependent on her, prevented her from being utterly overwhelmed. It may be imagined, after this sad tragedy, how anxiously passed the nights in her lonely dwelling. In the middle of one dark night, the roar of the alarm guns was again heard. The affrighted mother sprang up, gathered her children hastily together, and knowing well there was no safety within doors, hurried with them from the house. The house of a friend at a considerable distance, offered shelter, but the darkness was intense; the fugitives lost their way, and ere long found themselves in the midst of the deep mire for which the roads of Detroit were formerly so celebrated. More urgent peril, however, was behind them; they struggled on, leaving their shoes in the mud, and managed to escape to the house of their friend, where they were received with kindness. The mother's quick eye, scanning her rescued group, now discovered that her son, eleven years of age, was missing! The alarm was given, and the next day men were sent in every direction about the country to search for him; but all in vain. It was too certain that he had been captured, and the distracted mother feared he had been murdered by the relentless savages. For four long months she endured the tortures of suspense. She then learned that her boy had been taken prisoner, and was still held in captivity at some distance from the city. The sum demanded for his ransom was speedily sent, and he was restored to the arms of his mother. During his captivity he had fared hardly, subsisting chiefly on buds and roots, and never having even a piece of bread. This son is now living at Jackson, Michigan.</p>
               <p>After the termination of the Indian troubles, Mrs. McMillan maintained her family by her exertions, giving each of her children a substantial education, with such training as to fit them for every duty and vicissitude of life. She made enough to purchase a valuable piece of land near the Presbyterian church, with a large framed house, which is now known as the Temperance or Purdy's Hotel. The matron resides in the city with one of her sons, and is often solicited by those who have heard something of her romantic history, to relate her adventures in detail, and describe the life led by many, who like her, encountered the perils of war in a new country.</p>
               <p>Another matron numbered among the pioneers, and belonging to the olden time, is MRS. MORGAN, still a resident of Detroit. It was after the season of danger and disaster had passed that she removed from New York, her youth being spent in New England; yet her home and affections are in the West, and she is claimed by its inhabitants, so many of whom she has entertained with her youthful reminiscences. She was a child in the Revolutionary struggle, and lived with her parents in New London, Connecticut. When the news came that the war had actually begun, her father, like the brave Stark, was occupied in woodcutting; he unharnessed his team, exchanged the axe for the gun, and departed immediately to join the volunteers, leaving the children in the care of their mother. One characteristic incident is remembered. A neighbor who had been in the habit of stopping at the house, being suspected of carrying on a trade clandestinely in British goods, was at length arrested and imprisoned. Escaping from prison, he fled, but was pursued, fired upon, and severely wounded. The family,<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5993-00000162"/> after one of his visits, were alarmed by the discovery of a handkerchief striped red and white! This contraband article, which bore the stamp of its British origin, might involve them in trouble, and it was accordingly hid; it was supposed to have been left intentionally by the neighbor, who wished to get rid of so dangerous a possession. After peace was declared, the handkerchief, which had become a curious relic, was presented to one of the brothers of Mrs. Morgan. Her recollections of the home-made tea, sugar and chocolate, were amusing enough. The leaves of a plant called the "teaweed" were dried, and sugar was obtained by boiling corn-stalks, from which a thick juice was formed. Coffee was made from baked acorns, ground fine; the chocolate from a plant called saladine, which somewhat resembled the genuine article. These substitutes for prohibited luxuries were peddled about the town by an old African named Juaco, who was quite a conspicuous character in that day, and assumed not a little of a military air, aspiring to be like Washington in his carriage.</p>
               <p>The alarm of the family when startled one day by a fearful cannonading, and the sight of an American vessel towing a captured privateer, was often described. The prize was a Portuguese vessel, and the captain, who was richly dressed, and the crew, were lodged in the jails at Hartford, Norwich and New London.</p>
               <p>Some time after the war, the subject of this notice was married to Mr. Morgan, and settled in the State of New York. She now lives in Detroit with her daughter, Mrs. C. Brown. Although seventy-seven years of age, she is still erect in stature, is able to sew and read without difficulty by the aid of glasses, and is often heard to declare she "knows too much of the British ever to like them."</p>

               <p>"That's a secret yet; but I know."</p>

               <p>"A little won't satisfy me, that I assure you. I intend to become rich."</p>
               <p>Henry Welby was the son of a poor widow. His mother had early instilled into his mind judicious and valuable precepts. From childhood he was taught that a good name and spotless character were invaluable to an individual—more precious than gold. A strict regard for truth, and a tender sympathy for the unfortunate and suffering, had ever characterized the boy. Mrs. Welby had the satisfaction of seeing her son practise upon the instructions he had received from his mother. No oath polluted his lips—no falsehood marred his character, and no vice leprosied his heart. Kind and generous, faithful and industrious, he won the encomiums of his neighbors, and when of a suitable age, was solicited by Mr. Haler, a wholesale grocer, to enter his store.</p>
               <p>Charles Ingalls was the reverse of Henry in almost everything. He was brought up by indulgent parents, who were in easy circumstances, and suffered too often to follow the bent of his inclination without being checked. His father did not believe it to be his duty to severely correct his son, when guilty of a wrong act, and would often suffer him to pursue his own course without a word of advice. The parents of Charles were of that class who look more to the appearance than at the heart. If a boy conducts well in company, is particular in his dress, and is constantly aping the foolish fashions of the day, with such all is well: the lad must make a smart and active man. Thus Charles was suffered to grow up, following the bent of his perverse nature, till he was of a suitable age to do something towards his own support. His father was anxious to put him in a lawyer's office, deeming the profession of the law the height of respectability. No opportunity presenting, he finally secured a place for his boy at the store of Mr. Haler.</p>
               <p>The wholesale merchant was a gentleman of middle age, who did an extensive business, and was reputed to be rich. He had one or two older clerks in his employ, when Henry and Charles entered his store. These lads generally lived on good terms with each other; but occasionally a dispute would arise between them on account of the overbearing disposition of Charles. He was determined at times to have his own way, no matter how much it interfered with his companions. But as Henry was kind and yielding, and seldom manifested angry or revengeful feelings, the lads on the whole lived on pleasant terms.</p>
               <p>The young men had been in the employ of Mr. Haler several years, when the conversation at the beginning of our story took place. They had often conversed on the business they would pursue in after life, and while Henry insisted that small gains and a safe business were to be preferred, his companion declared that nothing would satisfy him but large profits and an extensive trade. It was seldom that Charles spent an evening at home with his parents, or at the house of his master. In the summer season he would walk the streets with his companions, engaged in idle conversation, while in winter he would resort to some shop, where he passed his time in profitless amusements, if not vicious pursuits. On the contrary, Henry improved his leisure hours in reading and study. His evenings were generally passed at home, reading some useful book or paper, or in drawing or writing. His companions were chosen from those who were industrious, and thought more of the improvement of the mind and heart, than the decoration of person, or the gratification of the appetite.</p>
               <p>It was not unfrequently that Henry inquired of his companion, on returning at night, where he had passed the evening. "Oh, I have had a fine time," would be his reply.</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5993-00000166"/>
               <p>"Why don't you read more?" once said Henry to him.</p>
               <p>"I don't love to read; and besides, I get but little time you know."</p>
               <p>"You have as much time as I do, and in the course of a few months past, I have read a dozen volumes, besides various periodicals."</p>
               <p>"But you read evenings, while I am enjoying myself."</p>
               <p>"If you would take my advice, Charles—and I think it is good advice, and in the end you will find it so—I would say, don't go into the society of the idle and frivolous. There bad habits are contracted which lead to everything that is bad."</p>
               <p>"No, Harry, you know nothing about it, If you could go with us and enter into your sports, you would be happy.</p>
               <p>"That is what I have no desire to do."</p>
               <p>All the persuasion of the virtuous youth could not produce the desired effect. Charles spent his time in idleness and folly, made a fine appearance in society, and took pride in his dress and exterior deportment.</p>
               <p>A few years passed, and the young men had completed their clerkships. Welby, by the earnest solicitations of the merchant, was persuaded to remain in his employ another year for a specified salary, while Ingalls commenced business for himself. The father of Charles had proposed, and now put a capital in his son's hands to commence with. He engaged a large store, and had it filled with groceries of the first quality, not forgetting to parade his casks of rum, brandy, gin, &amp;c. He also erected a bar in his store for the retail of spirits. So here was the secret of his money making. Day by day the shop of Ingalls was crowded by purchasers and loafers—for the latter tribe are the necessary result of a bar. Pass by his store at any hour of the day, and you will hear the rattling of glasses and decanters, and the impure conversation attendant upon such business. If you have taken a look within, you would have seen Charles or his clerk behind the counter, dealing out to the miserable and poor as well as to the decent and well dressed, what has not inappropriately been called "distilled damnation." Early and late was the shop open to visitors. Passing one day, Henry entered the store, and inquired of his friend, "what success he met with in his business."</p>
               <p>"I do finely," said he.</p>
               <p>"I regret," said Henry, "that you have erected that bar—because I believe it will have an injurious tendency."</p>
               <p>"I could not get along without it," said Charles, "I realize more profit from the sale of spirits than from all my other business."</p>
               <p>"But only consider how much misery you are instrumental of producing. Doubtless many a poor wife and mother is suffering, because, for a little gain, you put the intoxicating glass to the lips of the husband and father."</p>
               <p>"If I didn't sell to them somebody else would, and I should lose the profit."</p>
               <p>"That you don't know, and if it were so, that is no excuse for you."</p>
               <p>"I don't care, I will sell spirits so long as I can get purchasers."</p>
               <p>"You will regret it at some future day, I have no question."</p>
               <p>"But I shall sell, and it's nobody's business. I do wish our community was rid of the confounded meddlers. I have a right to dispose of what I please. This is a free country, and the first man that insults me for selling liquor, I will order from my shop."</p>
               <p>"Don't get angry, friend Ingalls, I am only speaking for your good."</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5993-00000167"/>
               <p>"Well, I don't thank you for it. There is a set of men about now-a-days, that do nothing but interfere with other men's business. They are determined to compel us to give up selling spirits; but their efforts shall be in vain. They talk about prosecution and the like, thinking that we are fools enough to pay attention to what they say and do. No, we have more manliness about us."</p>
               <p>"But, friend, don't you think it would be for your interest not to retail rum? You know there are a great many people in this community, who look upon your business as not respectable, and on that account will not enter your store to purchase a single article. If you should relinquish the sale, or even empty your casks into the street, I think it would be greatly for your interest in the end—I am certain it will be so."</p>
               <p>"I know better than that. No inducement whatever would prevail upon me now. Since so much has been said, I will sell and risk the consequences."</p>
               <p>"I know you will regret it," and just as he spoke, a half dozen poor and miserable beings entered the shop and called for spirit, and Henry left, grieving over the conduct of his friend.</p>
               <p>"In a year or two Ingalls had become attached to his cups, and it was said that occasionally he was seen intoxicated. However that may be, his business gradually fell off, and it was with difficulty that he sustained himself day by day. He neglected his shop, and idled away his time with unsteady companions, spending money and contracting intemperate habits. Thus inattentive to business, he soon failed and had to give up. On settling with his creditors, Ingalls could pay little more than twenty per cent.; the remainder had been sponged from him by his companions, and squandered in vicious pursuits. After idling about for five or six months, he started west in pursuit of business.</p>
               <p>Welby continued with Haler for one year. He had been so faithful to his employer while a clerk, and had behaved with so much propriety, that his master concluded to take him into equal co-partnership. This was an honor entirely unexpected to Henry, and the prospect was bright before him. Mr. Haler had been doing an extensive business, and was now quite wealthy. The responsibility of the concern was thrown upon Henry, and no man was better qualified to sustain it. Diligent and persevering, virtuous and honest, he had received the approbation and respect of all who knew him. As a citizen and neighbor Welby was of great service. He was one of the most active members of the Temperance Society, and by his exertions a large amount of good had been accomplished. He went among the poor inebriates, and persuaded them to forsake their intemperate habits, while he advised those who dealt in spirit to relinquish the sale of it. He was a friend to virtue, and a benefactor of the poor.</p>
               <p>Welby had been in business but a few years, when he led to the hymeneal altar the beautiful and accomplished daughter of his partner, Mr. Haler. From early youth he had been partial to Ellen. Her sweet disposition, her graceful manners, and her industrious habits, had won his affections. Unlike multitudes that surrounded her, she thought more of her heart than her face, the improvement of the mind than the decoration of her person; and would rather spend her time at work or in study, than at the theatre or in pacing the streets. Two more congenial spirits were seldom united. The marriage day was a happy one to their friends and neighbors, as well as to themselves. Everybody loved Ellen Haler and Henry Welby, and now they received the smiles and good wishes of all, and many<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5993-00000168"/> a prayer was offered, that the bright morning of their days might not be clouded with sorrow.</p>
               <p>Several years passed and Welby continued to prosper in business, while the influence he exerted around him was healthy and salutary. About once a year he would leave his native place and journey to the South—partly on business, and partly for pleasure. One season he travelled as far as New Orleans with his wife. One morning as they were passing the street, they noticed a crowd gathered, and on inquiring the cause or the difficulty, they learned that a poor fellow had been caught, who few a nights before had broken into a store, and robbed it of a considerable amount. While moving along, the officer of justice appeared with the prisoner, and a single glance revealed to Welby the countenance of his former companion, Charles Ingalls.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible, Ellen, that this is Charles?" said he.</p>
               <p>"I believe my heart it is," said his wife; another look convinced them.</p>
               <p>His dress was very shabby—he bore the imprint of vice and intemperance—but he was hurried on, and they lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Henry had concluded to leave New Orleans on that day, but the situation of his old friend induced him to remain, in the hope that he should have an opportunity of seeing him. After several inquiries, he learned the next day that Charles was in jail, and thither he bent his steps—he was permitted to see the prisoner—on entering the cell he found that he did not mistake the man, worn and altered as he had become; but the thief did not recognize Henry.</p>
               <p>"My friend," said Welby, "I am sorry to see you in this condition, and would that I could be of some service to you."</p>
               <p>"O, sir," said the prisoner, "intemperance has brought me here. For the last five or six years I have been miserable. I have suffered in body and mind more than I can express."</p>
               <p>"Have you no friends?"</p>
               <p>"I had friends once, but I left them. I had parents, but I have not seen or heard from them for several years. If I had performed my duty—lived as I ought to live—I should never have come to this."</p>
               <p>"Of what crime do you stand charged?"</p>
               <p>"Sir—I—am a thief!" and the tears gushed from his eyes. "I was in liquor and was persuaded to steal, by those who have left me to suffer. Oh, that I had my life to live over again! How different would be my course! Then if a friend advised me, I would hearken to him."</p>
               <p>"I sympathize with you, and if it were in my power, I would release you from prison, that you might be a better man."</p>
               <p>"Sir, who may I call you. I have no found no one to sympathize in my sorrow, and to speak a friendly word to me since I left my native place. Who may I call you?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Henry Welby."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! my old friend and companion—in truth, it is he. I know your voice—your looks," and the poor fellow could say no more for very joy.</p>
               <p>After a few minutes, Charles related all that had befallen him since he left Portland. In truth he had suffered by land and by water. Often he was deprived of all the necessaries of life, and yet he continued to drink, till he was over-persuaded by a gang of villains to steal.</p>
               <p>When Henry left the prison, he promised to exert himself to the uttermost, to obtain the release of his intemperate, but, as he now believed, penitent friend. After remaining in New Orleans a week or more, he finally had the satisfaction of<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5993-00000169"/> taking Ingalls by the arm and leading him from the prison. He was furnished with suitable clothing, and sufficient money given him to pay his passage home. When he arrived, he was taken as clerk into the store of Haler and Welby, where for years he conducted himself with the utmost propriety. A drop of spirits never again entered his lips, he became one of the most efficient members of the Temperance Society, and is now using his strongest endeavors to advance the glorious cause. He was lately united to a worthy woman. The debt he owes his friend, he often repeats, he cannot pay. "And but for you," he recently told him, I should now be a miserable outcast—a vagabond and a curse.</p>
               <p>Such is the influence of kindness! How glorious the results! Ye who have embarked in the temperance cause, be gentle and kind, persuade and entreat, and take by the hand those who err, and you will accomplish an amount of good that can only be rewarded in eternity.</p>

               <head>A TALE OF THE DESTROYER.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY J. W. FIELD.</head>
               <p>DURING a residence of some years in Europe, I became acquainted with the history of one of those unfortunate beings which the demon Intemperance delights to make his prey. One of that class at which he has ever hurled his death-dealing darts; delighting to soil, with his desolating touch, the laurels that would otherwise be green and glorious—I allude to the "Sons of Genius."</p>
               <p>Albert Kent, is a name unknown to fame; not because its possessor had not talent sufficient to enable him to do things worthy of being remembered, and written on the imperishable pages of history, but rather because while one hand was building up his reputation as a genius, the other was equally active in establishing his claim to the title of a drunken profligate. The first time his name attracted my attention, was when, on passing through one of the manufacturing towns of England, I saw a group of people gazing at something in the window of a picture-dealer; and my curiosity being excited, I joined the crowd, and beheld a painting of very superior merit; one indeed, that gave me the highest opinion of the artist as a man of genius.</p>
               <p>On asking one of the gentlemen if he knew by whom the picture was painted, the whole crowd turned and looked at me in mute astonishment; as if to express their wonder that any one should be ignorant of the author of <emph>that</emph> picture. But on discovering from my general appearance that it was a stranger who made the inquiry, they at once informed me that "Poor Kent" was the artist. "Poor Kent," thought I to myself; and can the producer of such a gem as that be poor? The unsatisfied expression that my countenance wore on receiving this short reply, made the gentleman whom I addressed, comprehend the state of my feelings; and looking me in the face with a kind and yet pitiful smile, he remarked, "You seem to be unacquainted with Mr. Kent, sir."</p>
               <p>"Indeed I am," I replied, "but should like to become acquainted with him, if it is in your power to afford me that pleasure, sir."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said my friend, with a sorrowful countenance, "that I cannot do; but if you will accompany me to my home, I will give you something of his history;" and, putting his arm in mine, we turned away from the window.</p>
               <p>"I have felt much interest in that poor man," he added, as we wended our way in the direction of his dwelling, "and as you seem anxious to know something of him, it will afford me pleasure to gratify you, though the tale is a sorrowful one."</p>
               <p>On arriving at our destination I was shown into the parlor, which was furnished in the true English style, snug and neat; tastefully and elegantly adorned, it seemed to speak to my very soul, whispering, this is home.</p>
               <p>"That sir," said my friend, pointing to a painting enclosed in a frame, beautifully ornamented with scroll work and flowers of burnished gold, "that sir, is one of the productions of poor Kent, which I learned was in the possession of the tavern-keeper, where our unfortunate friend was in the habit of spending much of his time.

               <p>The subject of the picture to which my attention was called, was taken from the "Tempest," and represented Miranda at the moment when she replies to Ferdinand's inquiry of "wherefore weep you?" she answers him <q>

               <p>The trembling, weeping beauty, blushing through her tears, and yet half confiding, stands before the noble youth her heart is doating on, with that maiden innocence and loveliness that the great poet has given her; and a better rendering of the passage I never beheld, though the subject has been a favorite one with many of our best artists.</p>
               <p>Another of his productions which much interested me, was "A Mother teaching her Child his Evening Prayer." Bowed by her side with clasped hands, his eyes are fixed in a dreamy gaze upon the features of a sleeping babe lying in his mother's lap; the kneeling boy is evidently thinking more of his little brother, than of what his mother is saying. We fancy we hear him repeating, mechanically, the words which are uttered for him, while his thoughts and youthful imagination are in that land of which he has heard, and where his parent has told him his little sister has gone; and, looking upon the sleeping babe, he wonders if he too will go and be an angel. I could not look upon that little dreaming face without shedding tears for the days of innocence gone by in my own life; and without weeping, that the heart that had conceived, and the hand that had embodied so much of innocence and sweetness should ever be contaminated by sin, and that sin intemperance.</p>
               <p>"Kent," remarked my friend, breaking in upon the train of melancholy musing that had begun to flood my soul, "in his early days, was the pride of his parents. His talents were early discovered, and he was placed by his father under the instruction of a competent teacher; his progress was rapid and cheering, and he soon found himself in possession of an excellent studio, with commissions for portraits from his most distinguished townsmen. But finding his taste for a more extended field of art increasing, he resolved to visit London, and perfect his knowledge of the human figure, and then devote himself to historical subjects rather than to portraiture. While in London, he became acquainted with the late and lamented Sir David Wilkie. The works of that artist pleased him more than anything he had yet seen, and had a great influence upon his style, and rural scenes and cottage life became the subjects of his pencil.</p>
               <p>While he was in London his father died, and he prepared to return and settle again in his native village. But, alas! in that great city of sin, he had contracted that fatal habit, which has proved the destruction of so many thousands of the noblest of earth's children. On his return he was met by the companions of his youth, who came to congratulate him on the success which had crowned his new attempts, as well as to console him for the loss of his parent; but in a few months, many of these very companions were his constant attendants. They had found out his weak points, and while they came professing admiration for his works, they in reality thought a great deal more of his cheerful company, and the wine which his purse could, and did afford them, than they did of his talented productions; the former they could appreciate because more congenial with their already established habits: it was not long<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5993-00000173"/> before most of his time was consumed by these vampyres. Frequently he tried to cast off this habit, which he found was chaining him with its links of agony; but after every calm came a storm, more fearful and desolating than the one which had preceded it. His mother, mortified and heart-broken, soon followed her companion to the grave, and Kent, freed from every tie which had bound him at all to society, now gave himself up to the most abandoned dissipation.</p>
               <p>"I have seen him," continued my friend, "drunken, ragged and filthy, standing at the corner of the street, and railing at and cursing the passers by, so that the police in pity have taken and shut him up until he should become sober. I have seen him, sir, followed by crowds of boys, hooting at him and making sport of his wretchedness, and I have wept to see the temple of the soul so basely defiled! But for him there was no hope, he felt it; he knew it; and yielded to the chain that he had suffered to be coiled around him in his unthinking moments, when he took the first glass! Unprincipled and unfeeling men have made large sums of money, by getting him to paint pieces for them for little more than the drink he consumed while employed upon them. Thus was he enticed onward to his ruin!"</p>
               <p>"And how," I eagerly inquired, "did he terminate his unhappy existence?" feeling, at the same time, an instinctive horror creep through my nerves, for I had pictured him dying, neglected and alone, in the very depths of poverty and wretchedness.</p>
               <p>"His death, sir, was a fearful one, and such as I never wish to hear of again. He had been for nearly four weeks employed on a work, which it was confidently believed would be the best thing he had ever produced, as he was offered a very good price by one of our wealthy and benevolent gentlemen, if he would but abandon his cups and paint him a picture representing a ship-wrecked mariner, a scene in the life of the gentleman himself, and the one we were so late admiring.</p>
               <p>Kent accomplished his work to the satisfaction of all; and promising his friend, in the most solemn manner, that he would never again touch the destroyer, he was paid the sum agreed upon. He purchased himself new clothing, and appeared like a man again. Hope, once more, revived in the hearts of those who were his sincere friends and well wishers. But in an evil hour he drank again, and then gave himself up to revel and to riot. Many endeavored to save him, but it was too late—too late; the chords of the fiery fiend had bound him on the altar of sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Maddened and goaded on by the demon Rum, he struck, in his drunken revel, one of those who had been instrumental in bringing him to that fearful precipice, and who was then as drunk as himself. A fight ensued; the keeper of that 'mantrap' ordered them out, and fighting their way to the door, Kent was thrown; when his fiendish antagonist seized him by the feet and dragged him down the steps—Poor Kent was killed!"</p>

               <head type="sub">BY REV. J. T. CRANE</head>
               <p>To most people there is something pleasant in a fall of snow. In our earliest recollections, it is associated with merriment and lightness of heart. We all remember the wonder with which we beheld, for the first time, the whole air filled with soft noiseless flakes, coming down in swift succession, hiding the surface of the earth, and the roofs of the houses beneath a fleecy covering, and quietly loading the trees and shrubbery, till every twig became a white graceful plume. Light hearts still hail the snow as the boon of heaven. When the clouds have passed away, and the sun-beams light up the earth with dazzling radiance, as they smile upon the architecture of the storm, the whole community is roused to noise and bustle. Then the modest country beaux, after many a vain effort to summon up courage for the perilous feat, invite the young ladies to accompany them in an excursion. Then the streets are in a ferment with sleighs swiftly gliding past; and school boys pelting each other with snow-balls, and the cold bracing atmosphere vibrates with joyous shouts, and merry peals of laughter, mingled with the jingling sound of myriads of bells.</p>
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC5993-00000176"/>
               <p>During the winter of 1848-9, when I was a resident of the town of Orange, N. J., there occurred one of those snows, which gladden the hearts of the young and the gay, and cause even gray heads to remember, more vividly, the innocent pleasures of their own early days. The broad main street of the beautiful village was soon polished by the gliding runners, so that its smooth surface shone like glass. And during the long bright evenings, when the snow glittered in the soft radiance of the moonlight, the number of vehicles increased, the merry voices of the votaries of pleasure rung more loudly, and the whole scene became more full of life and joy.</p>
               <p>The evening of the third of January was such as I have just described. The next morning, as I was passing down the street, and had proceeded only some two hundred yards from my door, my attention was called to certain strange marks in the snow, on the margin of the footpath. There were many prints as of struggling hands, for several yards, along the little declivity; and near a post, there was a large red spot, as of blood. On my asking the meaning of these things, I was pointed to the cellar of a house near by. I went to the place and descended the steps. It was a cheerless apartment, apparently given up to the wind and the snow which came driving in at the open windows. In the middle of the floor lay the corpse of a man. He was clothed in coarse garments, soiled and ragged; and outside the door, in the snow, lay an old battered hat. The lower part of the face seemed to bear the brutalized expression of one who had fallen into degrading habits, and had been given up to the sway of debased appetites; but the broad high forehead, surrounded with thick clusters of dark hair, was such as we usually associate with intellectual power. The body was unattended. No relative, no friend was there; and no one seemed to be making preparations for the burial. As I stood alone with the dead, musing upon the sad spectacle, a person or two came down the steps, looked a moment, and passed away; and I thought of the touching salutation of the Arabs, as they pass each other in their wanderings in the desert.—"May you die among your kindred."</p>
               <p>After much inquiry, of all whom I supposed to have any knowledge of the deceased, I learned the main facts in his history, an outline of which I give, as a warning to all whom it may concern.</p>
               <p>J— B— was born in England, about the year 1810. Of his parentage, and early life, I could ascertain nothing. It may be that a christian father guarded his youth, and sought to impart lessons of wisdom and virtue. It may be that a pious mother watched over his childhood, and taught him to fold his infant hands in prayer. He grew up, and in mind, and in energy of character, as well as in stature, became a man. He chose him a wife, and loved, and was loved, as fervently, probably, as other men. He possessed considerable property too, and his earthly prospects were, doubtless, deemed very flattering.</p>
               <p>He emigrated to the United States, and settled in the city of Philadelphia, where he became the keeper, perhaps the proprietor, also, of what is termed, in phrase polite, a "respectable hotel." But while he placed the cup of death in the hands of others, he learned to taste it himself. While he <unclear>smiled blandly upon his victims, and taught them specious apologies for their sin, the habit of drinking grew strong upon him, and after a time, those who loved him began to <choice>
                        <sic>b</sic>
                        <corr>be</corr>
                     </choice> alarmed. Nothing could induce him to pause in his career. The friends of temperance sought to reason with him; but he scorned their interference, and called their earnestness weakness and fanaticism. Drunkards were perishing around him. The<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5993-00000177"/> reeling forms, and the bloated faces which he so well knew one by one disappeared; but he spoke of them, as dealers in alcohol now speak of him, with a sort of contemptuous pity.</unclear>
               </p>
               <p>His course worked out its natural results. He was a fallen man. His now reputable companions deserted him; his property wasted away till all was gone. His sorrowing wife sickened and died. His child, too, was taken from the evil to come, and was laid in the earth beside its mother. J— B— was alone in the world, a friendless, hopeless victim of despotic appetite. He became a mere wreck. Sometimes, in his sober moments, a fitful gleam of intellect would shine forth; but the strength of the manly frame was gone, and his sad countenance betrayed the heaviness of his despairing heart. The man of forty years tottered along with faltering steps, and all the weakness of four score.</p>
               <p>In the summer of 1848, he came to Orange, seeking employment in the simpler parts of the hatter's vocation, for he must needs do something to enable him to meet the demands of his master passion. The chains of evil habit were riveted upon him, and he spent his scanty earnings either at the bar of the licensed tavern, or in the den of the lawless dealer in alcohol. 'On Wednesday evening, January 3d, he came up into town, a distance of a mile and a half, to drown his sorrows in the lethe of rum. He went to the house of a lawless seller of the poison; but <emph>she</emph> (for the vender was a woman,) makes oath that he did not obtain any alcohol there that evening. He then went to the tavern and asked for liquor, but according to the oath of the attendants there, he was refused, and went out. This was about nine o'clock in the evening. Whither he next directed his steps is a secret, hidden, perhaps, in silence only; but more probably in perjury. One thing is certain, he obtained rum, he drank, and became intoxicated; and about midnight, as near as can be conjectured, he was turned out of doors to find his way home.</p>
               <p>All was still in our peaceful village. The moon shone bright upon the snow. The wind blew from the north, and the night was intensely cold. The poor man began his weary journey; but the misdeeds of years had rendered him decrepid, he was now intoxicated and benumbed, and his palsied feet were placed upon an uncertain, icy path. He slowly labored on a little way, but soon he slipped and fell. In his efforts to rise, he rolled from the sidewalk, down a little declivity of a foot or so, towards the street. Again he attempted to rise, but he was weak, and chilled by the intense cold, and he failed. He tried to draw himself up the bank, by laying hold upon the snow with his hands: but the frozen crust broke in his grasp, leaving the bloody prints of his fingers, as tokens of the earnestness of his struggle. He tried it long, for it seemed his only hope. As the marks of bloody hands bore witness, he dragged himself along to a post, and tried to raise himself by its means. He battled hard with death, in vain. The cold was curdling his blood, and life was fast departing. At last he gave up, and stretched himself out to die. Perhaps he called for help; but his feeble cry was lost in the whistling winds. Perhaps he thought of the loved ones he had lost, and wept an icy tear. Perhaps he thought on his God, and prayed.</p>
               <p>At early dawn, a young man, passing down the street, saw the prostrate form, and gave the alarm. Speechless, but still alive, he was lying with his eyes wide open, gazing upwards as if into the world to come. He was carried into a house, at whose very door he had lain all this time. As those who bore him, brought him towards a fire, he groaned, made a feeble effort to stretch out his hand toward it, and died. His pocket contained THREE CENTS, AND A BOTTLE OF RUM.</p>
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC5993-00000178"/>
               <p>The coroner called together his jury, and made inquisition in the case. The rum-sellers, legal and illegal, who were suspected of knowing anything of the matter, were summoned to the inquest, and strictly interrogated; but they were all as <unclear>innocent</unclear> as lambs! None would admit, even when under <unclear>oath</unclear>, that they had sold him liquor the previous evening; and it was with great difficulty that some could be made to recollect that they had even seen him for some days. The verdict, of course, could not go beyond the facts legally elicited.</p>
               <p>The community in general expressed much pity for the friendless stranger, and they gave his remains decent burial. Quite a number assembled in the Methodist church, at his funeral, and a sermon was preached from the words:—"<hi rend="i"/>By it, being dead, he yet speaketh." A few men followed the body to the cemetery, where a cold grave had been dug in the snow, and the icy ground. The coffin was lowered, the frozen earth was replaced; thanks were returned, in the name of our common humanity, to those who had thus shown their sympathy for the stranger; and we left him to await that morn when "they that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"By it, being dead, he yet speaketh."</p>
               </q>
               <p>Every man's faith, or his unbelief, has a voice; and the result of his course, whatever that course may be, speaks lessons of wisdom. Unlike as pious Abel and poor J— B— were, there are yet certain points of resemblance.</p>
               <p>1. J— B—, like Abel, was <emph>murdered</emph>. His death was caused by certain means, which were employed by himself and others, <emph>knowing</emph> that untimely death would result. He knew that his evil habits were killing him. The venders who sold him alcohol knew it; yet for paltry coppers they helped him on in his wanton sacrifice of life, and thus became accessory to virtual murder.</p>
               <p>2. He was slain by a <emph>brother's</emph> hand. The ocean-storm did not engulf him; the flame did not devour, nor the beast of prey rend. The icy wind merely extinguished the taper which a destructive life had already caused to wax dim. Alcohol was the real instrument of his death; and that instrument was placed at his lips by his brother man, amid smiles, and pleasant words, and ringing laughter.</p>
               <p>3. Those guilty of the murder <emph>denied all knowledge of it</emph>.</p>
               <p>When the question was put to the first murderer—"Where is thy brother?" he answered "I know not," and then indignantly added—"Am I my brother's keeper?" Point the vender of alcohol to the wide-spread ruin which his own hand has scattered around and ask him, who did this? and he answers, "I know not." Point him to the prisons and the alms-houses which he has filled, and the untimely graves which he has dug; and he replies, sometimes with coward rage, sometimes with a cold sneer, "Am I my brother's keeper?"</p>
               <p>4. The blood of the slain <emph>cries unto God from the ground</emph>.</p>
               <p>That bloody spot which J— B— left on the snow, long remained. I often stopped to look at it, and pondered till my zeal for the glorious temperance cause was fired afresh. There the red witness of murder lay, in the bright sunshine, or in the paler beams of the moon, crying unto God and man, till the descending rain, the tear-drops of pitying heaven, fell upon it, and wept it away.</p>
               <p>5. <emph>A mark was set upon the murderer</emph>. The cry of the slain reaches Heaven, and the wrath of Him who is the Judge of all men, rests upon all the agents in the bloody deed. The curse of the Almighty is pronounced against them; the disapprobation of all good and honorable men rests upon them; the orphan's<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC5993-00000179"/> eye, dim with weeping, follows them with bitter reproach. In the view of truth and justice, and every right and honorable principle, a mark as dark, and as withering as that which branded the first murderer, is fixed upon them. And if they repent not, there let it rest, evermore.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF A NEIGHBORHOOD.</head>
               <head type="sub">A TRUE TALE.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY HON. NEAL DOW</head>
               <p>"IT always amuses me to hear you temperance men talk of Temperance and Intemperance; one would think in listening to you, that there is no virtue but the one, and no sin or evil but the other."</p>
               <p>Such was a remark made at a tea-table, one fine evening, last summer, by a young lady, who had been listening to an animated discussion, upon the evils of intemperance, and the sin and shame of the Traffic in Intoxicating Drinks.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the host, "we'll postpone the matter till after tea, when we will take a walk, if you please, and I shall be able to give you some illustrations of the Evils of Intemperance."</p>
               <p>As they stepped out of the door upon the platform, the sun was sinking in the west, and the sky was adorned with a gorgeous drapery of clouds, brilliant with every color of the rainbow; the extensive landscape which lay outspread before them, with the White Hills distinctly projected against the sky in the distance, was one of great beauty. "O," exclaimed the lady alluded to, "what a superb sunset, what a charming landscape!" after a pause, she archly added, "why don't you say, what a glorious world this would be to live in, but for Intemperance?"</p>
               <p>"Well," rejoined the host, "I adopt the sentiment, and say this would be indeed a glorious world for us to live in, but for Intemperance, its causes and consequences. Now observe, nothing meets the eye, as we gaze upon this beautiful scene, but objects of loveliness; everything is peaceful, and one would suppose; that where there is so much to make men happy, they should be so. Observe that house nearly opposite; it was built and owned by an industrious man and good citizen, who fell into habits of intemperance, and at last died in consequence of them; the house was subsequently occupied by two families successively, both of which were ruined by the intemperance of the fathers and the sons.</p>
               <p>"This next house upon the right, a widow lives there; her husband hung himself in the attic, in a paroxysm of delirium tremens. The next house was occupied by a widower and two sons: the former committed suicide while in a fit of intoxication; both of the latter were miserable inebriates, and one of them died of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">mania à potu</foreign>."</p>
               <p>As they proceeded upon their proposed walk, the host remarked, that he would describe to them some of the mischiefs arising from Intemperance, from which they could judge, whether temperance men could be fairly charged with exaggerating<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC5993-00000182"/> gerating the evils of that terrible vice—or the benefits of the virtue of Temperance.</p>
               <p>A few steps brought them to a broad street adorned with fine houses, and a double row of trees upon each side. No city in the country can show a more beautiful street, if taken in connection with its ample width, its extent, the palaces, almost upon either hand, and particularly its multitude of noble trees, which stretch nearly across it, and afford a refreshing shade during the heat of summer. They all paused; "here," continued the host, "you will say, intemperance surely must be unknown; none but the rich, refined and educated, can dwell here, and they will not, to any great extent, be addicted to intemperance."</p>
               <p>Now let us see; this first house was built and owned by a man who fell into habits of intemperance, and died of delirum tremens: and several of his family perished miserably from the same cause. Observe that house just across the way, could it speak, what a fearful tale it could unfold; I have known it from the beginning, and am acquainted with its history. It was built by a very worthy and industrious man, who fell into habits of intemperance, and committed suicide; he had a wife and two daughters, all of whom were addicted to strong drink, the mother being a miserable inebriate. After they moved from the house, it was occupied by another family, who were intemperate, and I saw there one day, the wife lying dead, stabbed to the heart by the husband in a fit of madness induced by intemperance, while he also was lying upon the floor in the agonies of death, having also stabbed himself. The house was subsequently occupied by a family consisting of husband, wife, mother and four or five children; they were thrifty and industrious, but fell into habits of intemperance; the aged mother was frozen to death one cold Sunday night in the attic, while intoxicated, and the family after remaining there a year or two, growing worse all the while, moved out west, and were lost on board the Steamer Erie, when she was burned on Lake Erie, a few years ago; so much for the ravages of intemperance beneath one rooftree; these were all persons in humble circumstances. Now let us pass down this noble street; the first house, or palace, I should say, was owned originally, by a family which has passed away within a few years; it was high in official and social position, and several of its members had a widely extended literary reputation. The mother was a drunkard, and died a sot; the sons died miserably, and one of them was taken to potter's field in New York, on a wheel barrow, without one friend to follow that humble bier; he was buried in a shallow hole without a mark to designate the spot; while his father, a man of high character, lies beneath a marble mausoleum, erected by his fellow citizens as a testimony of their regard for his memory. There were two daughters in that family who married men of high standing, both of whom after a few years of wedded life, became miserable drunkards and died of delirium tremens.</p>
               <p>The next house, also a splendid residence, was owned by a man in high official position, who was intemperate; he had one son and one daughter; the former died young from intemperance the latter married a man who became intemperate, and also died in early life. The next house, also of the first class, was built and owned by an active merchant, who through intemperance, lost all, and died in the Alms House. A wealthy merchant next owned and occupied the house; he had two children only a son and daughter. The father fell gradually into habits o gross intemperance, and in a fit of delirium tremens threw himself out of an upper window, and broke a leg, and died of the inflammation which ensued; the son was a grossly intemperate youth, and was destroyed by brandy at the early age of twenty-two<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC5993-00000183"/> two. The daughter was also addicted to strong drink, married a drunkard and died young.</p>
               <p>The next house was built and occupied by a gentleman who had one son of brilliant parts, who became a degraded drunkard, and was in his latter years in the habit of infesting the liquor-shops and drinking without leave or payment; he has been known to take a vessel used for lamp-oil, draw brandy into it, and drink it raw. He was at one time the most popular young man in town, but at last died like a dog, with none to regret his departure, while many mourned his fate.</p>
               <p>"Now, as we just turn this corner, observe that magnificent house opposite us: the home of wealth, of taste and refinement. But there is at this moment a 'skeleton' in that house. If we should enter, we should behold on every hand, all the appliances of luxury, all the adornments which cultivated taste can devise, or wealth procure; magnificent furniture, books, pictures, and various works of art which crowd its lofty and spacious apartments. But there is no joy in that house; the hearts of all its inmates are heavy with unspeakable sorrow; the only son of that house is a wretched drunkard, and an exile from the home of his boyhood. He is yet a youth—having not attained his majority—but is old in profligacy and sin; in a word, he is a confirmed inebriate, and will steal or lie, which he has often done, to gratify his appetite. He has appropriated mementoes of affection, sent by him from a distant daughter to a mother; he has stolen and pawned his mother's jewelry and watch, to procure the means of gratifying his thirst for strong drink. All affection for parents and home, all regard for a good name, all fear of shame, are blotted out from his heart; he has one controlling desire, which is, for strong drink, and he sacrifices all to that. This boy has been ruined by an appetite generated and strengthened by the wine which he has habitually taken at his father's table. Although his father knew the danger to his children, of his habit of having wine upon his board, and of offering it to his friends, yet he had not manly courage enough to break away from a custom, which weak people seem to think necessary in a genteel establishment. Although the father was every way qualified to lead public opinion, and to give the law to custom, yet he has in this case sacrificed his domestic happiness to one which he felt to be wrong, and knew to be dangerous.</p>
               <p>"Observe that man who is crossing the street just below us; mark his feeble gait, his squalid dress; everything about him indicates wretchedness and want; he is a degraded drunkard; a few years ago, he was one of our most active, respectable and thrifty merchants. He is of a family of three brothers, and most respectably connected; both of his brothers were ship masters of high standing, but all have fallen victims to strong drink. The oldest brother was a noble and chivalrous man as God made him; but he was ruined by intemperance, and in a fit of delirium, while at sea, he leaped upon the rail by the main rigging, and imagining his death was necessary to the safety of the ship and crew, he jumped into the sea, and was lost.</p>
               <p>"The second brother became a common drunkard and inmate of the almshouse; and this man—you see what he is—and can hardly believe it, when I tell you, that a few years ago, he was one of our most respectable young men, standing at the head of his profession as a merchant, and a welcome visitor in the most respectable families in town. He sleeps in barns, or sheds on the wharves, and goes down to the steamboat landing regularly, where the Steamboat Company keeps a large number of hogs, and feeds from the barrels of refuse which comes from the tables and scullery of the steamers.</p>
               <p>"You may think I have over-drawn or over-colored the picture which I have given you here, of the evils of intemperance<pb n="368-369 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC5993-00000184"/> ance but I assure you it is all true that I have told you, and more might be said even of these particular cases.</p>
               <p>"I know not, but a similar history might be given of every old street in this town, and of almost every house which has been standing thirty years. The history of one street, or of one town, will be found to be very nearly that of all; for the causes of intemperance were operating everywhere alike, and with the same results.</p>
               <p>"And now Miss A. I have to ask you, if the temperance men are to be laughed at as fanatics, for the great exertions which they have made to remove the terrible sin of intemperance, as a general evil from the land?"</p>
               <p>You will hardly find an instance of degradation, of pauperism, or of great crime, which has not its origin more or less directly in Intemperance; and the effort to remove this prolific source of human misery and degradation, is worthy the highest efforts which good men can put forth.</p>
