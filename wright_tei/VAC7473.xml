POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
THE title of our little pamphlet has a far deeper, sadder meaning than&#xD;
the mere use of the words imply. Poor Mary Pomeroy ! Her moulderimg&#xD;
dust now slumbers peacefully enough in the churchyard in Jersey, where,&#xD;
after her short and stormy life, her brother and kind friends laid her&#xD;
down      teafs in their eyes, und gloom and poignant sorrow in their&#xD;
hearts. It Nuas not only the death of the dear sister and friend that&#xD;
caused this -sad display, but it was the breaking of her heart and the&#xD;
destruction -of her hitherto pure character by the man, who above all&#xD;
others should have defended hei, ere Death caie and took her away to,&#xD;
that happy home above. Poor Mary's last words Were:&#xD;
"God forgive him for his wrong to me. I loved hii. I trusted him&#xD;
foolishly: God have mercy on me; I have told the truth.&#xD;
They held her baby over her ; but being too weakto raise her arms to&#xD;
clasp it, she could only kiss it, and then she expired.&#xD;
Would it be possible for a young woman like Mary Pomeroy, who had&#xD;
all her life enjoyed such a sterling reputation for virtue and goodness to&#xD;
thus deliberately lie and perjure herself on her death bed ? We do not&#xD;
thini( the most hardened human being couldbelieve she would.&#xD;
Therefore, the plain, simple, st ory of wrong she narrated with her&#xD;
dying lips stands like an accusation written in blood against her deceiver,&#xD;
never to be erased; butto remain against him till God's angel of justice&#xD;
and retribution shall drag him to the eternal bar to be confronted with&#xD;
his victim and to receive his punishment.&#xD;
In Jersey City, on Prospect Avenue, on the Heights stands a Presby-&#xD;
terian Chureb.  It is the most fashionable church in the town, and&#xD;
among its worshippers were the wealthiest and most respectable families&#xD;
of the place. The pastor of this tabernacle was the Rev. John S Glen-&#xD;
dennng, a young man of about twenty eight or thirty. Beig unmarried,&#xD;
be lived with his mother and sister on Bergen Avenue. He was quite&#xD;
popular on account of his talents nd winning manners, and, of course,&#xD;

&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
knot only freely admitted to, but courted in the houses of his parish-&#xD;
Prominent among these was Mr. J. S. Miller, himself a most&#xD;
lat and respected citizen. Mr. Miller fully eighteen years ago had&#xD;
$ed into his family circle as his own daughter, a little orphan girl,&#xD;
amnine years old, named Mary E. Pomeroy. The child thus adopted,&#xD;
up and became as much beloved by her new parents as their own&#xD;
ren.&#xD;
ers rolled on, and the orphan child expanded into a handsome,&#xD;
easing and most accomplished woman. Her greatest accomplishment&#xD;
WI music; and.'consequently, she was ever the recipient of invitations&#xD;
i it the homes of her friends and acquaintances. Everybody loved&#xD;
and every one was delighted to have her grace their entertainments,&#xD;
gi'eat was the pleasure she afforded all. To pass her time away pro-&#xD;
y, and also that she might not be a burden upon her foster parents&#xD;
44hough this she did really against their desires-she gave lessons in&#xD;
c. Beside, she assumed the duties of organist in the Prospect&#xD;
denue Church of which, as we have said, Glendenning was pastor.&#xD;
n this position she was, of course, thrown into almost constant com-&#xD;
if cation and intercourse with the minister. From  mere social and&#xD;
dibial affairs. the two soon came to speak on more tender subjects.&#xD;
ers progressed in this way, the affection at least on Mary's part&#xD;
0wing into true love. Her friends claim that the pastor proposed mar-&#xD;
ge to Miss Pomeroy and was accepted. This alleged courtship con-&#xD;
7,  -  ..                                  .&#xD;
nued three years, Mr. Glendenning often visiting several times a&#xD;
!tye-ek.&#xD;
KH also, it is alleged, gave her handsome presents, at one time a gold&#xD;
tih-and chain, at another earrings, and sleeve buttons. Also most&#xD;
gnificant of all a wedding ring. This Mr..Glendenning denies.'&#xD;
long list of most highly respectable witnesses under oath, as ad-&#xD;
Winistered to them in the most solemn manner known to their religious&#xD;
elief, all testified unreserved and unanimously to the high opinion they&#xD;
i  of Mary Pomeroy's purity of life and christian'character.&#xD;
Not only this, but, in order to show to the community in general, that&#xD;
reallyy believed what they said and made oath to, all these people&#xD;
4de it a point to attend the funeral of the victim.&#xD;
Mary Pomeroy's name has been added to the long list of unfortuates,&#xD;
bjose trusting love and belief in the promises of a scoundrel, a lying,&#xD;
Lecherous coward worked their ruin. If there is a human wretch more&#xD;
esn and contemptible than the veriest reptile, it is that man who gains&#xD;
W6e 1oVe a woman, and then, through the most solemn vows and pro-&#xD;
iises, effects her ruin, and then deserting her throws the blame upon&#xD;
herself. Pshaw ! such a thing is too utterly mean even, to be turned out&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
No one wilt ever know the agonies of poor Mary Pomeroy's mind du,&#xD;
the last dreary, horrible months of her once happy life. Her awful so&#xD;
could not long be coticealeid, and yet with her bleeding heart and I&#xD;
throbbing of that other life within her own, she was obliged to be meI"&#xD;
and gleesome. How she must have suffered, as sabbath after sabog&#xD;
she sat at her organ, and, with trembling fingers, caused its great pip&#xD;
to peal forth, in unequalled sublimity and grandure, anthems of praiseto&#xD;
God.   It had no longer any haiymony to her. . It was the frigIt&#xD;
thunder of doom in her ears. Unable to endure it longer, she would shi1&#xD;
off the large pipes, and, drawing the softest stops, she made such tended&#xD;
plaintive, strains float out over the congregation, that the people he&#xD;
their breaths for fear of interrupting the Heavenly melody. Yet a&#xD;
seemed to Mary like the wailings and sobbings of unhappy spirits, ad-"&#xD;
with eyes blinded by bitter tears, she turned toward the altar to catchil&#xD;
possible a hopeful, encouraging glance upon the minister's face. It w1&#xD;
the face of him she loved, the face that had so often been bent over het&#xD;
own, the face that so often had beaired on her fondly, as the lips spoh&#xD;
the unredeemed, promise.&#xD;
But on that face there was no comfort for her. Poor girl! plo9;1&#xD;
trusting, deceived, broken-hearted girl! Henceforth she had no face t&#xD;
look up to but God's; henceforth no ear in to which to pour her an&#xD;
guish but God's; henceforth no hand to guide and support her bu0&#xD;
God's! But'God did not desert her, praise be to His Holy nnme; He di&#xD;
not leave her in her desolation, and her pangs of dissolution ; hut sei&#xD;
His angels to bring her over the dark river and through the dark valley&#xD;
safely home.&#xD;
Several persons have, since Miss Pomeroy's death, spoken abput t4&#xD;
manner in which the unfortunate young lady performed on the last oc.&#xD;
casion of her playing the organ at Glendenning's church. After thi&#xD;
rehearsal she sat down at the instrument, and, after playing a favorite&#xD;
voluntary, she striek into Come Ye Disconsolate. This she follow&#xD;
with:&#xD;
Rock of ages cleft for me&#xD;
Let me hide myself in Thee."&#xD;
&#xD;
And then, after a pause, she rendered the hymn:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Just as I am&#xD;
Without one plea&#xD;
But that the Savior died for me&#xD;
Oh Lamb of God I aome."&#xD;
Said one lady.&#xD;
"I never was so deeply affected in all my life. I little thought at tb&#xD;
time, as the sweet and solemn sounds made me weep with emotion ith&#xD;
Mary was thus, like the swan, singing her last and best strains befi&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7473-00000004"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
The agony of mind which she endured at that time must have&#xD;
n horrible. But who knows? it might have been consoling and hea-&#xD;
g,6 her tortured spirit."&#xD;
As she closed up the key board of the organ that evening, she crossed&#xD;
W_ hands on her lap in a tired, odd kind of way; and looking up at theo&#xD;
2ided instrument, she said:&#xD;
"Well, well, how strange it would be, if I should never play upon you&#xD;
V. in. If I thought I would not, I would bid you.good bye. But no, I&#xD;
6will n6t do that."&#xD;
Then, turning to one of her companions, she said:&#xD;
Annie, if ever I die would you come to see my grave once in awhile.&#xD;
d put a few flowers on it?"&#xD;
Oh, Mary, how you do talk!" exclaimed her friend. "What ails you&#xD;
01night,'any way? You seem to be melancholly."&#xD;
Never mind, dear," she, hastily replied with a merry laugh, "I was&#xD;
Ny trying to frighten you."&#xD;
oon after the party left the church, and, in passing out, Mary lingered&#xD;
ind the rest in order that she might pause a moment at the altar and&#xD;
s its sacred marble. God knows; perhaps she felt that, in that act she&#xD;
h and found forgiveness for her own part of the sin; or perhapsshe&#xD;
enprayed the Great Judge not to punish her seducer. For every body&#xD;
~s Mary would forgive her worst enemy.&#xD;
,-A the next Sabbath a stranger was at the organ in Glendenning's&#xD;
0rch; and, when the members wondered, they were told Mary was.&#xD;
sick. Mary Pomeroy had done with the organ, poor girl. In the&#xD;
I ravail that the Creator in anger sent upon Eve, she was struggling.&#xD;
02om ithe bed on which she tossed in despair and agony, she was destined&#xD;
4 evr to rise until her wasted, pulseless form was carried forth to the&#xD;
ae yard.&#xD;
Of course, when it was impossible for her to longer conceal her tnis-&#xD;
rtune, poor Mary confessed all to her mother by adoption Mrs. Miller.&#xD;
hat lady was naturally exceedingly grieved and shocked at such an un-&#xD;
zpected and awful disclosure, most especially on account of the asso&#xD;
eiation of Mr. Glendenning's name with the affair. No one had better op-&#xD;
Wrtumities of knowing this as the minister of course used to come to her&#xD;
kt-use to see Mary, and courted her there. She knew also that Mary was&#xD;
a good girl, and, with the exception of her mistaken confidence in her&#xD;
4 ilucer, as pure as an angel of light.&#xD;
Mrs. Miller at once communicated the state of affairs to her husband&#xD;
was so enraged that he felt tempted to take summary vengeance&#xD;
upon Glendenning, But cooller second thoughts prevailed with him,&#xD;
anistead of- following his first inclination, Mr. Miller determined to&#xD;
rce a marriage. So the necessary steps were taken, the first of which&#xD;
eisthe following charge laid before Justice Aldridge.&#xD;

HUDSON COUNTY. The voluntary examination of Mary E. Pom&#xD;
eroy, of Jersey City, in said County, single woman, taken on oath be&#xD;
Tore me, Thomas Aldridge, one of the Justices of the Peace, in and foi the&#xD;
said County, this 15th day- of July 1874 A. D., who saith that she is now&#xD;
with child, and that the said child is likely to be born a bastard, and W&#xD;
be chargeable to the city of Jersey City, and that John S. Glendenning,&#xD;
of said city, a minister of the Presbyterian Church, is the father of said&#xD;
child.&#xD;
MARY E. POMERQY.&#xD;
Taken and signed the day and year above written before me.&#xD;
THOMAS ALDRIDGE,&#xD;
Justice of the Peace.,,&#xD;
The next step was the arrest of Glendenning which was at once accom&#xD;
plished with the utmost despatch; and the' prisoner was brought 14efore&#xD;
Justice Aldridge for a hearing. After the first part of the excitemot&#xD;
Glendenning became quite cool and methodical.&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy's friends perseveringly insisted that Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
should marry her, using all their powers of persuasion to induce such a&#xD;
settlement of the affair.&#xD;
That was no part of his plan, however; and he declined to do so. In&#xD;
consequence the law was allowed to take its course, and Glendenning&#xD;
was bound over in heavy bail to stand his trial for the alleged offense,&#xD;
Mr. John Gordon became his surety to appear and he was released..-"&#xD;
There were three charges, one for the support of the child, which was&#xD;
laid against him by the Overseer of the Poor, one for \seduction, and-one&#xD;
for breach of promise of marriage.&#xD;
As soon as he was free, G-lendenning began to lay out his defence. V&#xD;
He relied upon a mysterious paper, which he alleged Miss Pomeroy had&#xD;
givpn him acknowledging that she had sinned with others than himself.&#xD;
While all this was gokig on, poor Mary, the victim, was taken sick and-i&#xD;
the child was born a little girl.&#xD;
The shock to Miss Pomeroy's system was too much; and, after ap.&#xD;
parently rallying, she began to droop; and finally sank more and more&#xD;
rapidly, until, at length, on August 18th, she succumbed to what Doctor&#xD;
Burnett truly called "a broken heart." During the last night she suffered"&#xD;
great agony of body and equallysevere torture of mind. In her moments&#xD;
of mental darkness and debrium, she called on him most pitifully to come&#xD;
to her, and, at least rescue her good name and reputation from blight and&#xD;
destruction.&#xD;
At length day light came,, and, with it came the conviction to all tbe&#xD;
mourning friends of t'he unfortunates,, as they stood round her bed and&#xD;
watched her countenance, that the end was rapidly approaching. Early&#xD;
in the morning Mr. Dudley the Overseer called at the house, and being&#xD;
,admitted to the sick room, he at once perceived that Mary was dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7473-00000005"/>&#xD;
POOR 'MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
e immediately sent for Justice Aldridge to take her ante mortem state-.&#xD;
na ent. But the latter gentleman refused to come ercept the victim her-&#xD;
.f f should express a desire to see him. After some objection and delay&#xD;
is was obtained.&#xD;
"I bear him no malice," she groaned, "but I must vindicate ny good&#xD;
.name."&#xD;
When Mr. /Aldridge came, which was about eleven o'clock, he ap-&#xD;
proached her bed side, and taking her hand gently, inquired if she knew&#xD;
him.&#xD;
She promptly replied:&#xD;
"Oh, yes, Sir, I know all of your here."&#xD;
"You are quite ill, Miss Pomeroy; do you wish to make any state&#xD;
2ment?"&#xD;
"Yes, Sir,'I would like to do so. I feel as though I have not long to&#xD;
ve. There have been a great many things said about me. I now-in&#xD;
he sight of God tell the truth-that John S. Glendenning is the father&#xD;
omy child. He has denied it and still denies it; but he, and no one else&#xD;
a the father of'that child. He has said things against me. I watafraid&#xD;
of him; but now I am not. He may have papers but that does not clear&#xD;
hiin."&#xD;
Ir. Aldridge wrote down this statement in lead pencil and then took&#xD;
away to his office where he rewrote it in ink. With this ink copy he&#xD;
returned to Mr. Miller's house that Miss Pomeroy might sign it. But he&#xD;
bad scarcely entered the dwelling when the unfortunate girl breathed her&#xD;
last, passing away finally as quietly, as peacefully as an infant falling&#xD;
asleep. All, therefore, that he could now do was to attest the document&#xD;
n legal form, which he did as follows:'&#xD;
B&amp;amp;ate of New Jersey s. s. This is to certify that the above is a true&#xD;
Statement, as the same was made by Mary E. Pomeroy on her death-bed&#xD;
ito ie this 18th day of August 1874.&#xD;
THOMAS ALDRIDGE, JUSTICE OP THE PEACE.&#xD;
After Mr. Aldridge had first left, Mary clasped her hands together and&#xD;
Qfered up a most fervent, touching prayer for the destroyer of her hap.&#xD;
piness and her life. She then prayed for her own poor; unfortunate self.&#xD;
 tit with the words of supplication quivering on her lips she died, amidst&#xD;
he tears and sobs of those who stood found her bed.&#xD;
By her death the only witness on which the two maig charges against&#xD;
SGlendenning could be substantiated was effectually silenced. And it&#xD;
ven became a matter of great doubt whether he could be held to answet&#xD;
the only other one that remained.&#xD;
Ais soon as the news spread through the city that Miss Pomeroy was-&#xD;
-dead, there was the wildest public excitement. Groups of men, and even&#xD;
eomnen, collected in the streets and discussed the awful affair with much&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
When the -tolling requiem bell warns us that some one we love is about&#xD;
to be consigned to the final resting place, its mournful tones bring tear;&#xD;
to our eyes. Yet to comfort us under ordinary circumstances we have&#xD;
the assurance that no pang of conscience, no suffering of the soul, added&#xD;
anything to the physical pains of the departed. But sometimes-G'od&#xD;
help our loved and lost-the soul itself endures the torture of dissolution&#xD;
as well as the body. Ah ! then, indeed, the solemn, mournful bell makes&#xD;
not our eyes alone, but also our hearts to bleed with something more&#xD;
than sorrow, something more than pity.&#xD;
Poor Mary Pomeroy! Had her contemptible deceiver been possessed of&#xD;
the tithe of a man's bravery or honor, he would have, at least, plickeaL&#xD;
the thorn from that wretched girl's pillow by the mairiage ceremony.&#xD;
But the only panacea which could heal her breaking, despairing heart,&#xD;
was ruthlessly denied her. Like a wounded bird; forsaken by the flock,&#xD;
stricken, fainting, perishing, she was doomed to tread the dark valley&#xD;
alone, uncomforted, unsbriven. She had been taught by lips she loved&#xD;
to "pray for her enemies," and now all her dying breath was spent in&#xD;
praying for her worst foe, and when att least she thought of herself, and&#xD;
to ask God to forgiveher, she had'no strength to do so. Her lips forgot'&#xD;
their art and with no word of prayer for herself, Mary Pomeroy, was&#xD;
ushered into the presence of God to plead at His bar. Yet there was&#xD;
for her advocate that saviour who on earth once said:&#xD;
"Neither do I condemn thee."&#xD;
Those who stood around Mary's death-bed were melted, as they&#xD;
watched her white, trembling, clasped hands; and heard her tongue&#xD;
pleading that he might be forgiven. And they said they had never bei.&#xD;
fore in all their experience witnessed such a scene. Most pathetic off all",&#xD;
was the climax. At the dying girl's request Mrs. Miller held the baby&#xD;
down to her face till its lips touched hers. She made a superhuman&#xD;
effort to raise her arms and get them around the little creature, but could&#xD;
not. One last, fond look of love, agony, joy, despair, hope, and resig.&#xD;
nation, flitted across Mary's face for a moment or so; and then, the un..&#xD;
seen hand of Death drew over her features the blank veil which divides,&#xD;
mortality from immortality. Mary was gone, the baby was a branded,&#xD;
orphan waif, and the case against him who had caused all this misr&#xD;
and ihurder was secure from man's puny vengeance. But not from God's&#xD;
will it preserve the wretch. There was one thorn in Mary Pomeroy'a&#xD;
dying pillow; but his will be filled with thorns.&#xD;
&#xD;
intensity of feeling; and it is certain that there were men filledwith&#xD;
rage and determination enough to have taken the accused man's life "&#xD;
right or wrong.&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
l    The tragedy was over, so far as the victim was concerned, and naught&#xD;
remained for the relatives and few staunch friends, who still loved the&#xD;
nory of the, unfortunate Mary, but to lay her wasted body away to&#xD;
#umber in its dusty bed under the green grass and innocent flowers.&#xD;
With tenderest care the corpse was wrapped and coffined in a magnifi-&#xD;
cent rosewood burial casket. In order to prevent any demonstration the&#xD;
funeral was not made public, except to a few intimate friends 6f the def&#xD;
ceased. Yet when the hour for the services arrived-which was 2 o'clock&#xD;
in the afternoon there was an enormous mass of people who had been&#xD;
assembling since early in the morning, attracted as much by pity at the&#xD;
sad fate of the unfortunate girl, as by curiosity to behold her funeral&#xD;
cort6ge.&#xD;
The most conspicuous feature of the whole affair was the great number&#xD;
of highly respectable gentlemen and their wives and daughters, who had&#xD;
made it a special duty to be at the obsequies, in order that their presence&#xD;
might show their sincere belief in the virtue, and purity, and sterling worth&#xD;
of lAiss Pomeroy. \They were particularly desirous to do this because&#xD;
certain interested parties had officiously and with diabolical malice set&#xD;
afloat rupnors to the effect that the poor dead victim of a villain had been&#xD;
of unchaste habits. This was the meanest, most cowardly trick of which&#xD;
the betraying seducer could have been guilty; because Mary's mouth&#xD;
was closed in the tomb and she could not deny the vile lies heaped&#xD;
Upon the grave clods that hid her from the' world's sight. And ~here let&#xD;
us remark that the dead girl's brother must be of a most perfect christian&#xD;
disposition, and a firm believer in the admonition--" Vengeance is mine;&#xD;
I will repay, saith the Lord."  If not, how could he stand by that&#xD;
sister's corpse, and, knowing what calumies her betrayer was circulating&#xD;
about her, not seize his revolver,' and bury every bullet of its six chambers&#xD;
in the heart of the ruining wretch?&#xD;
Among these distinguished ladies and gentlemen who had thus come,&#xD;
to testify their appreciation of .Mary Pomeroy were the 'following-&#xD;
Ex Mayor Sawyer and wife, Charles L. Northrup, Alderman Toffey&#xD;
Geo. P. Howell-who is an elder in Glendenning's church, William E.&#xD;
Dudley, Albert Metz, H. A. Hellerman, J. H. Bedell, C. W. Congar,&#xD;
Edward L. Kimberly, Geo. E. Randall, Chas. W. Perveil, S. H. Demotti.&#xD;
6hn Allen, and Gilbert E. Dudley.&#xD;
In the course of conversation, Mayor Sawyer remarked:&#xD;
"I determined I would come here at all hazards. As a man of family, v*&#xD;
I wish to show my appreciation of the sterling character of that Young&#xD;
woman. She visited some of our very best families, and, from what 1&#xD;
know of her, I can assert positively that, except this piece of misplaced&#xD;
confidence and devotional love, there never was a purer; moree virtuous&#xD;
girl than Mary Pomeroy."&#xD;

&#xD;
Doctor Burdett called, and while endeavoring to console Ms. Miller,&#xD;
whose grief had brought on an attack of acute nervousness, said:&#xD;
"Ahi madam, you ought, after all, to feel happy that poor,  loved Mary&#xD;
has been taken by God to Himself-; for had she lived she must have been&#xD;
placed in the Lunatic Asylum."&#xD;
Mary's brother Alfred who lived in Michigan having been telegraphed&#xD;
for arrived while the funeral was gathering; and the scene, as he ad-&#xD;
vanced and gazed down upon the white, emaciated face of his sister.&#xD;
That face was wonderfully calm, after such a storm, so calm that no one&#xD;
there but felt its owner had made her peace with God and was now rest-&#xD;
ing peacefully on his bosom.&#xD;
The body was dressed in rich black tarletan, but it could scarcely be&#xD;
seen for, from the neck to the feet kinsl hands, moved by fond hearts had&#xD;
heaped upon it pure white flowers-in profusion. Wreaths, crosses, bou-&#xD;
quets, anchors and hand bunches were laid there, while a magnificent&#xD;
crown was passed round the head. Most touching and most suggestive&#xD;
of all however was a memento that some unknown hand had placed di-&#xD;
rectly upon the still, bosom of the dead one. It was in the form of a&#xD;
broken heart and was constructed of opening white roses to each of which&#xD;
a hot iron had been skilfully touched so as to sear and brown the topof&#xD;
the flower while leaving the other part fresh and undiscolored.&#xD;
Oh! could that bad, bad man have only looked upon this memento it&#xD;
would have haunted him to his dying day, and be ever telling him of his&#xD;
awful crime.&#xD;
When the final moment arrived and the undertaker screwed down the&#xD;
coffin lid over the mortal from of the dead, people saw the silver plate on&#xD;
which were engraved the lines:&#xD;
MARY E. POMEROY,&#xD;
DIED AUGUST 18, 1874.&#xD;
Aged 26 years and 3 Months.&#xD;
It had been desired to have a clergyman of the Presbyterian church&#xD;
present to perform the burial services; but as will be seen it was im-&#xD;
possible to have one, and so the Rev. Mr. Tunison of the Simpson Meth.&#xD;
odist church performed the sad and trying duty. The first act he per-&#xD;
formed was to baptize the baby, and as he did so, he could not be heard&#xD;
for the sobs and weeping of those who were touched to the soul by the&#xD;
rite, under such circumstances. This over, he 'took the book and in&#xD;
measured accents read that sublime service commencing "Man that is&#xD;
born of a woman, hath but a short time to live."&#xD;
When he had finished he delivered his sermon. He appreciated the&#xD;
fact that he was placed in a position of exceeding delicacy. A follow&#xD;
worker ia God's vineyard had been accused in the most sOlemnl fork&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7473-00000007"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY 'POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
V nown to mankind, by the now silent lips of Mary Pomei oy, of the vilest&#xD;
r'ime with which he could have been charged.&#xD;
Technically, in the eyes of the law at least, the accused must be con-&#xD;
Bidered innocent. His position also in the community as a shepherd, a&#xD;
guardian of morality, was in his favor, independently of his character as&#xD;
a mpan. ' Yet in the opposite scale to weight the frightful accusation were&#xD;
the facts that Miss Pomeroy's personal character was certainly held in&#xD;
As much esteen as that of the accused, and that her original charge had&#xD;
been most emphatically repeated by her upon her her death-bed, in her&#xD;
full senses.&#xD;
The following is a synopsis of Mr. Tunison's discourse:&#xD;
"Something more than a quarter of a century, I have mingled as a&#xD;
minister with christian people. I have buried fathers and mothers, sons&#xD;
and daughters. I have been called upon to consign to the silence of the&#xD;
tomb, those who had been called away iii a moment. But the most pain-&#xD;
ful duty I have been called upon as a christian pastor I realize this hour.&#xD;
It is not only painful l4ut delicate. I am not willing to say a word that&#xD;
would reflect unjustly on any human being, yet I must speak boldly,&#xD;
those sentiments which will promote your morals and secure your wel..&#xD;
fare. I have prayed to God anxiously and earnestly this morning that&#xD;
be may guide me through this painful ordeal. In all cities, towns and&#xD;
nations there are, and there will be, deserters, despite the enactment of&#xD;
the best and wisest laws.&#xD;
"The point that I desire to make in this connectionis, that there are&#xD;
men who will commit crime despite the fact that God lives and reigns.&#xD;
God governs the ways of beings who are constantly rebelling against him.&#xD;
This world to day is not the same as when God made it. The soul and&#xD;
mind of a man are not as they were when God made- them. Earth-&#xD;
quakes, whirlwinds, famine and pestilence, are things that may exist in&#xD;
connection'with a people who may have rebelled against God's authority.&#xD;
If there were no virtues there would be no vice. How is it that some of&#xD;
those who are the purest and best suffer the most while those who are&#xD;
the vilest and the worst suffer the least? If I take poison, no matter&#xD;
whether I am a good man or a bad man, whether I have followed God's&#xD;
law or rebelled against it, I will die ; because as I have said, God governs&#xD;
the world by general laws. The good suffer, yet God loves righteousness&#xD;
and hates evil. If I could believe there would be no hereafter-that&#xD;
when man dies there would be an end to manR, body-and soul, that there&#xD;
would be no rewards or punishments, I would discard the existence of&#xD;
God, I would be an atheist. I say this deliberately in presence of this&#xD;
vast assemblage. The thought suggested by these points are that we&#xD;
ar'e constantly surrounded by dangers, sickness, losses, and, worst of all&#xD;
by sin. No matter how near we live to God, how much grace we have,&#xD;
we are in constant danger till our dying hour. What are we to learn&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
IOU&#xD;
&#xD;
.i&#xD;
&#xD;
from this ? - We must be always vigilant and on our guard against the&#xD;
enemy. Does it not become a navigator to watch anxiously lest he may&#xD;
strike upon a rock&#xD;
"The sad event which called us here to day teaches the importance of&#xD;
guarding against evil in all its forms. A little matter kindles a great&#xD;
fire. A little drop of poison quenches out a life. Bear with me if I speak&#xD;
of the experience of our -departed friend. One, single mistake broke a&#xD;
beart that was full of joy, and destroyed a life. One, single mistake on&#xD;
the part of her seducer made him a murderer. I stand here to repeat it,&#xD;
and am ready to answer for it at the bar of man. I am a father, and I&#xD;
speak to fathers and mothers. I would rather see the mangled and life-&#xD;
less remains of my daughter striken down by the hand of the midnight&#xD;
assassin, brought to my door, than to see her robbed of her honor and&#xD;
her virtue. If a man that robs another of life deserves death on the scaf-&#xD;
fold, the man that robs a woman of what is dearer to her than life, de-&#xD;
serves a thousand deaths on the scaffold., Oh ! young men and young&#xD;
women, who hear me, pause, before you make one step toward the nar-&#xD;
row way. A great shadow has been cast upon this household. Poor&#xD;
Mary Pomeroy, when she fell, realized that all the beauties had departed&#xD;
out of this life. What a fearful mass of human beings who have made a&#xD;
similar false step, have robbed themselves and sometimes their innocent&#xD;
ones of life. Poor Mary Pomeroy ! She raised her soul to God and&#xD;
prepared herself to pass to a world where she hoped there would be no&#xD;
suffering.&#xD;
"'I have made up my mind,' said she, fthat(ITmust make a, great effort&#xD;
if I will be saved. When I had fallen, I felt that I was estranged from&#xD;
God, and that I must make a great effort to be restored to his friendship.&#xD;
I would like to live longer; but I must go. I am content."&#xD;
"Oh, it is well for poor Mary Pomeroy that God has taken her from a&#xD;
world of woe to a world of gladness!"&#xD;
Very frequently, during the delivery of this sermon, the minister was&#xD;
interrupted with long-continued bursts of grief and sobbing from the&#xD;
assembled mourning friends.&#xD;
Within a short time after the conclusion of the funeral ce emonies, the&#xD;
body of the unfortunate girl was lowered into the grave, e clods of&#xD;
earth heaped in upoa her coffin until the mound was finished an rounded&#xD;
vff into shape. So ended the mortal career of Mary Pomeroy.&#xD;

14:                   POOR MIARY POMEROY.&#xD;
THE SUBSEQUENT MOVEMENTS.&#xD;
Of course, after the decease of the alleged victim all sorts of surmises&#xD;
were set afloat as to what would be done in the case. The friends of&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy scarcely knew what to do in the affair as without herself&#xD;
t-here could be no decided testimony against the accused. The friends of&#xD;
the latter were as well pleased with the turn matters had taken, though&#xD;
had they had real, judicious discretion, they should have been sorry that&#xD;
there was not a full opportunity of proving \to the satisfaction of the&#xD;
community the innocence of their accused friend.&#xD;
Soon after the funeral Mrs. Miller took a trip over to New York to&#xD;
ascertain if possible of some institution in which the baby might be&#xD;
placed to be raised, as it was in an exceedingly delicate state of health&#xD;
and she wished it to have, therefore the very best of medical treatment.&#xD;
This under the circumstances it could not receive at her house.&#xD;
On this occasion, quite by accident, she happened to stop in at the&#xD;
Clinton Place Nursery. There she learned in the course of conversation&#xD;
that a man answering the description of the accused had been about six&#xD;
weeks previously, to inquire whether they had accommodations for a lady.&#xD;
When Mrs. Miller stated this fact, there was a fierce denial of it, and a&#xD;
challenge to prove. So at an indignation meeting which was presided&#xD;
over by Ex Mayor Sawyer,. we believe, the following affidavit, made by&#xD;
Mrs. Miller was read.&#xD;
Mrs. J. P. Miller, being duly sworn, upon her oath says that on Thurs-&#xD;
day, the 13th day of August, 1874, deponent went to the city of New&#xD;
York for the purpose of making some arrangement for a nurse for the&#xD;
child of the late Miss Mary E. Poineroy and Rev. John S. Glendenning,&#xD;
and first called at a foundling asylum near Sixty-eighth street, and after&#xD;
some conversation at that institution it was suggested to her'to return&#xD;
on the following Saturday, the 15th of August inst., and make the final&#xD;
arrangements, and such was deponent's intention; but my aunt,,Mrs.&#xD;
Miller, suggested that we go to the Presbyterian Home of the Friendless,&#xD;
on Twenty-ninth street, and I then concluded I would do so on the fol-&#xD;
lowing day, the 14th of August inst. I did call upon them and they re-&#xD;
fused to receive the baby unless given to them, which I declined to do,&#xD;
and they recommended me to go to another institution on Fiftieth street,&#xD;
which I did. They informed me that they could not receive it just then.&#xD;
They advised. me to go to an institution known as an infant asylum, in&#xD;
Clinton place, and on the same day I called at that institution and stated&#xD;
the case to some of the attendants, and they recommended me to call on&#xD;
Dr. Hubbard, who was coniiected with that institution, at his house in&#xD;
Ninth street, which I did ; stated the facts to him and said my object&#xD;
was to get the child into the institution to be properly nursed, He said&#xD;
that really they had no right to take the child, as it belonged to New&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="16 (Illustration) -17" xml:id="VAC7473-00000009"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.                             4&#xD;
Jersey, and ought not to be supported by a New York institution, but&#xD;
that there would be a meeting of the Board of Managers Saturday, the&#xD;
15th of August, at which time he said he would bring the case before&#xD;
them as to whether they would take the child. He said, "By the by,&#xD;
how old is the child?" Deponent replied that it was three weeks old to-&#xD;
morrow. He (Di. Hubbard) made a few other casual remarks, when I&#xD;
remarked, "You have probably read all about the case.", He said be&#xD;
had, and offered sympathy and asked what we were going to do with the&#xD;
man. I told him that remained to be seen; that we must save the&#xD;
mother, and child; the babe must be put out to nurse. He then requested&#xD;
me to describe the gentleman (referring to the one believed to be its&#xD;
father). I commenced as follows: "He is-short, rather thick set, with a&#xD;
short thick neck."  I was somewhat confused, and hesitated a moment,&#xD;
when Dr. Hubbard said, "Rather dark hair, dark complexion, very young&#xD;
looking and pleasing in his manners ?" I replied. "Exactly," and then&#xD;
nation as this?" Said he, "I don't know about that, but a man answer-&#xD;
ing this description came here about six weeks ago, wishing to get a girl&#xD;
admitted into the institution for the purpose of confinement, and I made&#xD;
arrangements to meet the young man at the institution the next day, but&#xD;
have mot seen him since."  He told me to go back to the institution, and&#xD;
they would tell me what they knew. I did not then return to the in--&#xD;
stitution, but returned to my home, on reaching which I found Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy had experienced a change for the worse, and continued to grow&#xD;
more fe-ble until death put an end to her mental and bodily sufferings.&#xD;
The reason of my going was in consequence of her wish to have the'child&#xD;
placed in such an institution.&#xD;
On Friday, the 12th of August inst., deponent again went to the&#xD;
Clinton place institution, taking with her the brother of the late Mary E.&#xD;
Poimeroy, Alfred B. Pomeroy. We met the head nurse or matron and&#xD;
told her our business, that I wished to put a child out to nurse; we ex-&#xD;
plained what child it was; and told her Dr. Hubbard thought the gentleman&#xD;
who had called some time previous referred to tLe same girl. She said,&#xD;
"Yes, there was a. gentleman called about admitting a girl into the in-.&#xD;
stitution." Deponent said, "Would you know his picture" (photograph),&#xD;
and I handed her a photograph of Rev. John S. Glqndenning; a very&#xD;
correct. likeness. She positively said, "That is the man" (meaning the&#xD;
man ivho had some time previously called to make arrangements about a&#xD;
young girl being confined at that institution). She further added:-."I&#xD;
noticed him particularly, as he acted strangely and did not want to como&#xD;
into the parlor and was much agitated; on entering the parlor I notiegl&#xD;
be pulled his hat down overL his eyes, and it was his conduct that made&#xD;
meo notice him particularly." She also said that the doctor's would come&#xD;

over the next day (Saturday), the 22d day of August, and they would&#xD;
see what arrangements they would make about the child.&#xD;
On Saturday I went over, taking with me Mrs. Julia M. Metz, and&#xD;
both of us proceeded to the Clinton place institution, at which time Dr.&#xD;
Hubbard stated to us that they had concluded not to take it, ag it be-&#xD;
longed to New Jersey. Some other unimportant remarks were made,&#xD;
when I said:--" Well, Doctor, your nurse or matron identified the picture&#xD;
(referring to John S. Glendenning's photograph) as that of the gentleman&#xD;
who called about six weeks ago," to which he replied, "Yes, so she says,&#xD;
and I said to her she must be very careful, as she may have to swear to&#xD;
it," and he said that she then told him she could swear to it. He then&#xD;
said, "Have you the picture?"  I said "Yes."  He said, "Let me look&#xD;
at it." He then said, "I cannot say that was the man, as it was in the&#xD;
evening when I saw him." He then remarked that it would be better to&#xD;
let the Poormaster have charge of the matter and get a wet nurse, as the&#xD;
child must be delicate.&#xD;
Mrs. J. S. MILLER.&#xD;
Subscribed and sworn before me this 25th day of August, A. D. 1874.&#xD;
JOSEPH H. ALDRIDGE;&#xD;
Notary Public of the city of Jersey City:&#xD;
The above afidavit was followed by like documents from the brother&#xD;
of the dead girl and also Mrs. Metz, corroborative of it.&#xD;
On the next Sabbath after the funeral it was thought that the church&#xD;
would be crowded, by curious people, but it was not, as it had become&#xD;
known that Glendenning would not officiate in the pulpit. The most&#xD;
affee ing part of the whole service, which was conducted by Rev. Mr.&#xD;
Wiggins, was the music. Mr. Hellerman took Miss Pomeroy's place at&#xD;
the organ while around him the ladies and gentlemen of the choir ranged&#xD;
themselves. The organist took Mary's music book and opening at her&#xD;
...,favorite voluntary, drew the stops of the instrument,. and softly sent the&#xD;
weet dreamy notes floating abroad in the sacred building. There was&#xD;
not a member of the choir but was in tears, as indeed also were most, of&#xD;
the 'sparse congregation scattered throughout the building. Mr. Wig.&#xD;
gins' discourse had no point of reference whatever to the subject whiirb&#xD;
was causing such an excitement in the community.&#xD;
After the commotion attending the exposure, the whole affair seemed&#xD;
to drift away for awhile into quiet and obscurity and numbers pf people.&#xD;
in the community, believed that as most other affairs of a like character it&#xD;
would be hushed up.&#xD;
But it was not so. There were too many friends of standing and re'&#xD;
spectability in Jersey City, who had made up their minds that 'the&#xD;
character of poor, dead Mary Pomeroy should not be neadlessly and&#xD;
cruelly uillified in order that some other character might be saved.-&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
U,&#xD;
&#xD;
-  these friends moved steadily and determinedly against the ian&#xD;
wiom they alleged to be guilty of the destruction of Miss Pomeroy--&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning.&#xD;
On the other hand Glendenning had numbers of friends equally respect-&#xD;
able and wealthy who stood by im and fought the attack step by step&#xD;
as it advanced, and who no doubt firmly believed in the innocence of the&#xD;
pastor. And it is quite likely that had Miss Pomeroy's defenders been of&#xD;
less weight than they were in society the Presbyterian Church Officials,&#xD;
would never have consented to investigate the charges brought against&#xD;
Glenden.ing.  If for no other reason they would have followed this&#xD;
vourse-for fear that the mere entertainment by them of such charges&#xD;
would work ill to the cause of religion in general.&#xD;
An  we must say, that, in all denominations, this desire to prevent&#xD;
the crucial test of an accused shepherd'scharacter is ever to powerful.&#xD;
There is not the slightest doubt also that more harm is done to religion&#xD;
thereby than to bring out the whole truth, naked and without conceal,&#xD;
ment. For if the gold -is pure fire does it no damage. It shines only&#xD;
brighter than before. But if the metal is base then is it destroyed by the&#xD;
Gre and it can no longer pass muster with the unsullied, unalloyed coin.&#xD;
We hold therefore that, in all cases, when, for instance a minister of&#xD;
the gospel, or in fact any man is accused of a heinous crime against mo.&#xD;
16ality, instead of quibbling and hiding behind this legal and that legal&#xD;
privilege, he should come forward promptly, waive all quirks and queries&#xD;
and say to his fellow-men:&#xD;
"I have been thus, accused. I am not guilty. -lre I am, examine&#xD;
me as you will4 will answer."  The innocent ian could never suffer&#xD;
under these cirentstances. None but the guilty could.&#xD;
When the church officials found that they must, in defference to public&#xD;
opinion, hold an investigation they called a meeting for the purpose.&#xD;
The first meeting of the .Jersey City Presbytery took place in the&#xD;
Second Presbyterian church on October 61h.' It was composed of del-&#xD;
egates from Hudson, Essex -in1d Passaic Counties. The R ev. Mr. Wall&#xD;
vas elected Moderator, Rev. Mr. Moore permanent Clerk, Rev. Mr.&#xD;
French and Mr. Stern Assistani clerks.&#xD;
All the preliminary arrrangements and details having been settled&#xD;
upon. Rev. Mr. Booth rose and moved that the letter of the Rev. John&#xD;
S. Glendenning in the hands of the clerk be read.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Darkness objected to this.' He moved as an amendment that&#xD;
(the Presbvtery alone should listen to the reading; because, in his opinion&#xD;
this case had already received sufficient publicity. This looked so much&#xD;
like a smothering effort that Mr. Imbrie spi-ang to his feet and replied&#xD;
rather sharply to the objection of his colleague.&#xD;
A, motion was, now made and carried to appoint a committee of six,&#xD;
three clergymen and three elders, to take the matter into consideration.&#xD;

-OOR MARY POMEROT.&#xD;
&#xD;
The following named gentlemen were appointed::-Of the clergy, Rev.&#xD;
Messrs Imbrie, Magee and Riggs, and of the elders, Messrs Stewart,&#xD;
De Witt and Meigs.&#xD;
Mr. Imbrie rose and said in effect, that as this case was an exceedingly&#xD;
'important one, notice should be given through the papers of the time and&#xD;
place of the investigation, so that all concerned could come forward.&#xD;
The committee were to sit as a Grand Jury, and it would be their duty&#xD;
ii1ascertain first of all, if there were sufficient grounds for a case.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Edwards most strenously and bitterly opposed this propo-&#xD;
sition, as it would be entirely unprecedented. For his part he thought'&#xD;
that the committee should not allow more than a certain number of wit.&#xD;
nesses to testify.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Imbrie replied to this demonstration quite sharply. Ie said&#xD;
that the committee would, there and then, give notice to all persons having&#xD;
-complaints to make, to come forward, and that a committee had been ap-&#xD;
pointed. to hear them. The case was a very grave one, and demanded&#xD;
the fullest investigation, and the inquiry should be so conducted that no&#xD;
person could come forward hereafter and say, with truth, that it wa&#xD;
partial or one sided, or that any attempt was made to suppress the facts&#xD;
or shield the guilty. For his own part, as chairman of the committee&#xD;
he would take the responsibility of giving the notice, unless the Presby-&#xD;
tery should pass a resolution to the contrary.&#xD;
Thereupon the committee retired for deliberation and soon after issued&#xD;
the following notice;&#xD;
The undersigned-having been appointed by the Presbytery of Jersey&#xD;
City as a judical committee, to consider and report tothe Presbytery,&#xD;
what action if any, is to be taken by the Presbytery, in the case of the&#xD;

thorough investigation of certain charges alleged against his moral char,&#xD;
seter, and current in this community-give the public notice, that the&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.,&#xD;
&#xD;
SECOND CHARE.-Breach of promise of marriage.&#xD;
Specification.-In that about. the month of May or June, A. D. 18T,&#xD;
the Rev. John S. GYlendeuning gave to Miss Mary E. Pomeroy an en-&#xD;
gagement ring, and both before and particularly thereafter, maintained&#xD;
with her such intimate intercourse as to lead to a conviction on the park&#xD;
of-.others of the existetnce of an engagement of marriage between them,&#xD;
and led her to declare the existence of such an engagement to a number&#xD;
of parties. And that notwithstanding thi  the- Rev. John S. Glenden-&#xD;
ning did emphatically refuse, without just cause, to consummate marriage&#xD;
with her,&#xD;
To substantiate the above charge there is offered the testimony of the&#xD;
following witnesses-viz., Mr, J. S. Miller, Mrs. Clara H. Randall, Mrs.&#xD;
Lizzie J. Reeve, Miss Mary Guilfoyle, Mrs. Caroline D Wilson, Mrs.&#xD;
Sarah R. Graves, together with others, as mentioned below.&#xD;
THIRD CHARGE.-Falsehood.&#xD;
Specification.-In that the Rev. John S. Glendenning, having visited&#xD;
some time previous to the birth of the child of Miss Mary E. Pomeroy, a&#xD;
hospital in Clinton place, city of 'New York, and then and there, having&#xD;
sought to procure accommodation for a woman expecting to be delivered,&#xD;
of a child, did afterwards deny the same to be true.&#xD;
To substantiate the above charges, there is offered the testimony of&#xD;
Mrs. Miller, Julia M  Metz, together with others; also, the copy of an&#xD;
affidavit of Mr. Alfred B. Pomeroy.&#xD;
FOURTH CHARGE.-Inministerial and unchristianlike conduct.&#xD;
Specification First.-In that about eight weeks before the birth of Miss&#xD;
Mary E-Pomeroy's child the Rev. John S. Glendenning did procure from&#xD;
her by means of threats of personal violence a writing exonerating hirn&#xD;
from blame in reference to her.&#xD;
To substantiate the above specification of charge 4, there is offered the&#xD;
testimony of the following witnesses:-J. S. Miller, Mrs. Miller, Clara H.&#xD;
Randall, Lizzie G. Reeve, Caroline R. Graves and others.&#xD;
Specification Second.-In that the Rev. John S. Glendenning compro-&#xD;
mised his Christian character by making Miss E. Pomeroy so many and&#xD;
such valuable presents, visiting her so frequently and' at such unseason'-&#xD;
-.able hours, and living on such intimate terms with her as to occasion&#xD;
public suspicion of impropriety, especially as he was understood at the&#xD;
same time to declare that no more than the ordinary relations of life sub-&#xD;
sisted between th~em.&#xD;
To substantiate the above specification of charge 4 there is offered the&#xD;
testimony of the following witnesses: J. S. Miller, Clara H. Randall,&#xD;
Miss.Mary Guilfoyle, Lizzie G. Reeve and others.&#xD;
In corrobation of the above charges and specifications the testimony of&#xD;
the following witnesses are also offered as to the various parts of the same.&#xD;
(Here follows a long list of witnesses.)&#xD;
&#xD;
m&#xD;
&#xD;
me eninaittee would~ therefore recommend to the Presbytery to&#xD;
fndertake the investigation of the above charges and specifications,&#xD;
and to pY4aecute them to an issue according to the rules laid down in&#xD;
our book. They further recommend that for this purpose a prosecuting&#xD;
committee of two be \appointed, by the Presbytery (according to the&#xD;
method prescribed in the case- of charges preferred on the ground of&#xD;
common causes), whose- duty it shall be to conduct the prosecution of&#xD;
the case, and inasmuch as the book allows an accused person the aid of&#xD;
any minister or elder in the Presbytery as counsellor to assist him inL&#xD;
conducting his case, the committed recommend that a committee of such&#xD;
counsellors equal to the number of the proposed prosecuting committee,&#xD;
and selected from the members of the Presbytery by the accused, be ac-&#xD;
credited to him to aid in his- defence.&#xD;
And, further, inasmuch as the charges to be investigated have excited&#xD;
a strong and widely spread public interest and a natural desire that the&#xD;
trial should be open to the public, the committee would recommend that&#xD;
the Presbytery grant permission to any accredited reporter of the public&#xD;
press to be present to take notes; and, also, that the door should be open&#xD;
to as many other persons of the public besides as the rooma in which the&#xD;
Presbytery holds its sessions can comfortably accommodateconsisteit with&#xD;
the Presbytery's own convenience-it being understood that any such&#xD;
persons so admitted shall be subject to exclusiou after proof of abusing&#xD;
this privilege. All of which is respectfully submitted.&#xD;

Judical Committee.&#xD;
In response to the committee's invitation 'for all parties who could&#xD;
testify in the matter on hand there were a large number of persons pre-&#xD;
sented themselves for that purpose. They were accommodated with seats&#xD;
in the meeting room of the elders behind the pulpit. At the hour of four&#xD;
the meeting.duely began its inquisition. Among those present promptly&#xD;
at the time named were Mr. and Mrs. Miller, the guardians of Mary&#xD;
Pomeroy, Mr. Huyler Deniotte, Mr. J. F. Talson -and. his son, Mr, Wil-&#xD;

portant witnesses of which latter altogether, there were more than fifty&#xD;

Mrs.'Birmingham and Mrs, Walcott sat beside the 'death bed of Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy and to them it was that the poor, perishing girl unburdened&#xD;
her breaking, dying heart of its fearful load of misery and despair.&#xD;
The first witness called was Mr. J. Smith Miller. He was sworn in&#xD;
accordance with the constitution of the Presbyterian Church, no person&#xD;
being present but him and the committee. The examination of this wit.&#xD;
ness was very tedious, occupying two hours and a half. The evidence&#xD;
was written out by the Secretary of the committee, the President at the&#xD;
same time taking notes. Mr. Miller testified that Mary E. Pomeroy had&#xD;
lived in his family for eighteen years, twelve of which were passed in&#xD;
the house with himself and his wife; her father and mother were dead;&#xD;
she was- born in Seneca county, New York; two years ago she became&#xD;
acquainted with the.Rev. John S. Glepdenning, who soon became a con-&#xD;
stant visitor at his (Miller's) house ; for four or five months previous to&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy's death he called as often as three and four times a week&#xD;
kand would remain sometimes till midnight, chatting with her in the par-&#xD;
lor; witness never suspected anything wrong for he thought  it a pastor&#xD;
would be the last man to'arouse suspicion; Miss Pomeroy was always&#xD;
carefully watched and guarded, and was never allowed to be alone in the&#xD;
company of any man but Glendenning; witness was particularly watch-&#xD;
ful over her because she was an orphan; she was of most exemplary&#xD;
habits and very talented; she gave lessons in music and became organist&#xD;
in Glendenning's church; Glendenning gave her numerous presents, in-&#xD;
eluding a pair of gold earrings, a pair of gold bracelets and, an -engage-&#xD;
ment ring, on which was engraved the words-" Two HEARTS IN ONE&#xD;
this ring he afterwards took back from her on some trivial pretence a few&#xD;
months before her death. (Mr. Miller here exhibited some of the articles.&#xD;
of jewelry) On the Sunday night before Glendenning's arrest he escorted&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy home from the church after evening service. Mr. Miller&#xD;
  then detailed the circumstances of the arrest of Glendenning on the charge&#xD;
of bastardy, the proceedings in the charge of seduction, and the suit for&#xD;
breach of promise of marriage.&#xD;
Chairman.-Have you the documents in these cases in your pos-&#xD;
session?&#xD;
Witness.-Yes, all but the affidavit in the breach of promise case; it is&#xD;
Sled in the office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court at Trenton, but Mr.&#xD;
Linn, who was the counsel for the plaintiff, has written for a certified&#xD;
copysof it to Trenton; Justice Aldridge will produce th.e other papers&#xD;
when he appears before you. Mr. Miller detailed the conversations he&#xD;
had with Miss Pomeroy concerning her relations with Glendenning \and&#xD;
his own interview with the pastor when the latter was arrested and&#xD;
Brought face to face with the injured girl.&#xD;
Mrs. Miller was the next witness called. IHir testimony was a corrob-&#xD;
*ration of that offered by her husband. The most striking part of it wa&#xD;

&#xD;
Messrs. Imbrie and Riggs, were also in attendance. -Mr. Winfield, the&#xD;
legal adviser of the accused pastor, was among the spectators, as well aa&#xD;
a host of witnesses in the case ladies and gentlemen.&#xD;
Tha Moderator opened by announcing that the services of a steno-&#xD;
'grapher would cost $50 a day. A resolution was thereupon passed that,&#xD;
no stenographer be employed. The matter was afterward reconsidered&#xD;
and it was resolved to employ a stenographer at a moderate renumeration,&#xD;
if practicable.&#xD;
The Moderator said it would be necessary, now that the trial was being&#xD;
entered upon, for Mr. Glendenning to plead again. The laLter replied,&#xD;
"Mr. Moderator, before I plead again I ask that the specification as&#xD;
amended be read."&#xD;
The Moderator-The clerk will read all the charges and specifications.&#xD;
The clerk complied, and when he concluded the reading the Moderator,&#xD;
turning to Glendenning, said, "Dp you plead guilty or not guilty?" The&#xD;
latter answered, "Not guilty."&#xD;
Counsel for the defence, Rev. Mr. Dodd, then moved that the general&#xD;
principles of law adopted by the civil courts, in so far as they do not con-&#xD;
flict with the constitution of the Church or the Book of Discipline, be&#xD;
adopted by the Presbytery.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd's resolution was put and lost. The Moderator then an-&#xD;
nounced that the Court was ready to proceed with the trial. Dr. Imbrie&#xD;
thereupon arose and opened the case for the prosecution. He said:-&#xD;
Here is a pastor who had preserved a good reputation from the first time&#xD;
we knew him up to the time when he was charged with the commission&#xD;
of a foul crime. In this ease the highest, the holiest affections of the&#xD;
heart were involved in the issue. Justice is to be done to the relations&#xD;
of her who has passed from the stage of this life. The reputation of our&#xD;
Church is involved. I earnestly hope that if the accused be innocent we&#xD;
may, by the providence of God, be enables to see his innocence so clearly&#xD;
that he will come out of this trial in the eyes of the community fully vin-&#xD;
dicated. There are four charges presented against this- defendant. The&#xD;
first is for the seduction of and illicit intercourse with an unmarried&#xD;
woman. In support of the charge and specification we are going to ad.&#xD;
duce three kinds of testimony. There is an affidavit which was made be-&#xD;
fore Justice Aldridge charging bastardy; there is another affidavit charg.&#xD;
ing seduction and breach of promise of marriage. We contend that the&#xD;
holding of Glendenning to bail by Judge Bedle is a strong circumstance&#xD;
in itself to warrant a strict investigation of the charge. The prosecution&#xD;
is perfectly aware that this testimony would not be admissible in a civil&#xD;
court, because the person who made the affidavits is gone before a higher&#xD;
tribunal than any in this world. -We have next the dying statement of&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy. We are aware that under this civil law such a state-&#xD;
ment would only be admissible in cases of homicide. But when we show&#xD;

I"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
POOR 'MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
'49&#xD;
&#xD;
you under what circumstances this statement was Made you will find&#xD;
there is a moral weight in it which we cannot disregard. We shall prove&#xD;
the frequent visits at the house of Mrs. Miller, affording an opportunity&#xD;
for the situation, and will produce such a chain of circumstanceS as shall&#xD;
prove corroborative testimony of her aflidavits. In regard to the breach&#xD;
of promise of marriage we shall show that the affidavit of Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
was considered so strong by a Justice of the Supreme Court (Judge&#xD;
Bedle) that he felt justified in holding Glendenning to bail. I regret&#xD;
that the officers of the institution in Clinton place, New York, to which&#xD;
it is alleged, Glendenning paid a visit, found it necessary to prohibit the&#xD;
attendance of an important witness, whose testimony would be most valu-&#xD;
able in this case. I regret it for the sake of Mary Pomeroy's memory&#xD;
and for the sake of Mr. Glendenning himself. We shall be obliged, on&#xD;
this point, to introduce indirect testimony. Lest there should be any&#xD;
doubt as to the credibility of the testimony of Mary Pomeroy we shall&#xD;
produce a large number of witnesses who will testify to her good char-&#xD;
acter, showing that she was admitted into the best society. The com-&#xD;
munity are looking to us for a just solution of this case, and I pray God&#xD;
that He may guide us in arriving at a just conclusion. (Here the Pros-&#xD;
ecutor paused a moment, ,while a faint murmur of applause ran through&#xD;
the assemblage.) Now, Mr. Moderator, in the first place I will offer in&#xD;
evidence the affidavit of Mary Pomeroy.&#xD;
Mr. James Smith Miller was the first witness. He testyfied as fol-&#xD;
lows:-I live in Van Reipen avenue, Jersey City; have known Rev.&#xD;
John S. Glendenning for two. years; I was acquainted with Mary E.&#xD;
Pomeroy;. she, was my cousin and lived at my house about eight years;&#xD;
she lived previously with my father's family; her mother died when Mary&#xD;
was quite young; when my father and mother broke up house she came&#xD;
to live with me; she was organist in Mr. Glendenning's church and re-.&#xD;
ceived pay as such; Glendenning often visited my house; he first came&#xD;
about two years ago; he would come with hymns; while she was playing&#xD;
at the piano Glendenning would stand or sit beside her; ho came every&#xD;
Saturday night for a few months; then his visits increased; I have seen&#xD;
him at my house as often as three times in one week; I came home as&#xD;
late as twelve o'clock at night and found him in my parlor with Miqs&#xD;
Pomeroy; he gave her presents; she told me so; among them was a&#xD;
ring, a set of earrings, a watch and chain, a thimble, sleeve buttons and&#xD;
locket (the severall articles were here produced and identified); he gave&#xD;
her also a heavy hold ring, about the Inst of MAy or beginning of June,&#xD;
1873; she made a remark to my wife which I did not hear, and my wife&#xD;
replied, "Why, this looks like business."&#xD;
Counsel for defence here objected to the reception of this testimony,&#xD;
and while the discussion on this question was being carried on the Court&#xD;
adjourned.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7473-00000016"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
On the second day Mr. J. S. Miller resumed the witness stand and&#xD;
testified :-Miss Pomeroy showed me her present (the engagement ring),&#xD;
and I.said, "Why this means'business ;" she answered, "Yes, he does&#xD;
mean business."&#xD;
Counsel for the defence objected and the Moderator sustained the ob-&#xD;
jection.&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie appealed from thedecision. He said that if such a ruling&#xD;
should stand and the line of testinmony now being offered be regarded as&#xD;
merely hearsay evidence and inadmissible as direct testimony the prose-&#xD;
cution might as well stop. Miss Pomeroy was dead, and the onlytes-&#xD;
timony they could adduce would be her reported\ conversations. They&#xD;
had already decided by a solemn note that they were not to be governed&#xD;
by the rules of a civil court Yet he found that objectiQns against a certain&#xD;
class of evidence were constantly springing up. They were sitting as a&#xD;
body to get tt the truth, and they ought not to be hampered by techni-&#xD;
calities and frivolous objections.&#xD;
The Moderator's decision was sustained. Dr. Imbrie then asked the&#xD;
Moderator what constituted testimony in the case, as there was no use&#xD;
in proceeding further if all the testimony which the prosecution held to&#xD;
be relevant and of vital importance were to be rule out. The Moderator&#xD;
replied that the Court would refuse to accept Miss Pomeroy's affidavits&#xD;
as testimony, but would admit them as information.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Edwards said that the Moderator assumed to much in mak-&#xD;
ing that sweeping declaration in public. He had not the iight to declare&#xD;
what constituted testimony. The Presbytery alone had the right, and&#xD;
they were fully competent to control the matter.&#xD;
After a debate, which at one time promised to continue the whole&#xD;
afternoon, counsel for the defence withdrew their objections, and Mr.&#xD;
Miller resumed.&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy said to me, "He means business,, and he intends to see&#xD;
you in a few days ;" I was examining the ring at the time; there was&#xD;
some inscription inside the ring, but I don't know what it was; it was&#xD;
either in Latin or French; I have not the ring now; she said she gave it&#xD;
back to Mr. Glendenning for the purpose of getting something on it, or      en&#xD;
words to that effect ; three or four weeks after she showed me the ring:&#xD;
she said that Mr. Glendenning was very desirous to see me: I inferred&#xD;
it was in reference to the proposed marriage between them; they would&#xD;
sit together for a long time in the back parlor with the folding doors&#xD;
closed while we would be in the other parlor; he would address her in&#xD;
my hearing as "Mary," she called him "Glen;" I first became cognizant&#xD;
of the fact that she was pregnant on the Monday evening before Glen-&#xD;
denning's arrest; I consulted my lawyer and he advised me to go and&#xD;
see Mr. Glendenning and that perhaps he would come like a man and&#xD;
marry her, but that in case he refused we had better be prepared ; we&#xD;

&#xD;
bad him first arrested on the charge of bastardy to prevent his going&#xD;
away; when the officer arrested him he took him to my house; my wife&#xD;
was talking to him in the parlor; I asked Miss Pomeroy in his presence&#xD;
whose child that was and she replied, "Glen, I have deceived you--it is&#xD;
yours;" he replied, "Mary, you wouldn't say so if it were not for the&#xD;
present surrounding," or words to that effect; Mr. Northrup was in my&#xD;
house and he said to Mr. Glendenning that he was sorry to see him in&#xD;
such a situation; Glendenning replied, "Keep your sympathies to your-&#xD;
self, for you will need them more than I will before we get out of this&#xD;
thing;" Miss Pomeroy told me that when he attempted the seduction she&#xD;
refused, and he said it was all right, that they would soon be man and&#xD;
wife, as soon as he had all his arrangements made; on the night of the&#xD;
arrest Mr. Glendenning said that he had documents to prove his inno-&#xD;
cence; I asked Miss Pomeroy what these documents were, and she said&#xD;
that she had signed a paper to shield him from blame, but she did not&#xD;
- know what the paper contained; he came to her one evening and handed&#xD;
her a paper telling her to write as he dictated; after writing some times&#xD;
she refused to write any more saying that it was not true; he told her&#xD;
Ahe must write; when she had finished he told her to sign itand she re-&#xD;
fused; he said, "Mary, look at the position Iam placed in; there are&#xD;
e           my mother and sister, and if we are found out Iam a ruined man, I will&#xD;
be brought before the Presbytery and Synod;" she still refused and he&#xD;
drew a pistol from his pocket, held it over her head and compelled her to&#xD;
sign it; she told me that she could not remember what that paper con-&#xD;
tained, she was'so excited and confused at the time.&#xD;
Counsel for the defence asked for a recess to enable them to have a&#xD;
copy of the testimony of this witness, as they intended to object to a great&#xD;
0                             part of it. This proposition led to a long debate. Dr, Imbrie'said that&#xD;
Brother Glendenniig asked this Presbytery to investigate certain charges&#xD;
against him. How canthe-investigation take place-if he persists in ob-&#xD;
jecting to the testimony against him at every stage of the case ? He was&#xD;
now under a cloud, and if this testimony were to be excluded there would&#xD;
be an end to the case ana Mr. Glendenning would remain under the cloud&#xD;
till his dying day.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Mesereau said that if theaccused brother would not admit&#xD;
the solemn, dying statement and the affidavits of the dead girl then, no&#xD;
0'7       matter what course the.Presbytery might take, that man would be mo-&#xD;
rally dead as long as he lives. (Here there was a murmur of applause.)&#xD;
Rev. Mr..Booth said that the glory of God and the honor of the Church&#xD;
demanded that the Presbytery should probe the case to the bottom. He&#xD;
regretted, for the sake of Mr. Glendenning himself, that he should go&#xD;
forth to the world with this case undecided or decided on insufficient&#xD;
grounds, fr no Church in the country would look at him. If the civil&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7473-00000018"/>&#xD;
34&#xD;
&#xD;
courts had dealt with'the case Mr. Glandenning would have to father the&#xD;
child or otherwise. If the Presbytery were to take shelter under tfie&#xD;
technicalities which debarred the case from the civil courts then Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning would stand at the close of this case as he did at the be-&#xD;
giining.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Eddy said he felt compelled to declare that every word of&#xD;
the special pleading on the part of counsel for the 'defence fell like a ham-&#xD;
mer on the head of Mr. Glendenning. -Here the Rev. Mr. Harkness&#xD;
jumped to his feet and called Mr. Eddy to order. He became so excited&#xD;
that' the brethren burst into laughter, at which he fairly boiled with in-&#xD;
dignation.&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie hoped for Mr. Gendenning's sake that the defence would&#xD;
not persist in their course of objections, for a judgment arrived at in the&#xD;
absence of the very testimony on which the case is actually based would'&#xD;
h.be set aside by the verdict of the community. Mr. Glendenning would-&#xD;
go forth under a darker cloud than before and stand condemned before&#xD;
the public.&#xD;
Glendenning here interrupted him by saying, "Condemned on what?"&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Dodd said that if the recess he asked for till next day were'&#xD;
not granted, to give him an opportunity of consulting some prominent&#xD;
legal gentlemen regarding the admissibility or exclusion of a certain class&#xD;
of testimony, he should say firmly he would retire from the conduct of&#xD;
the defence. A motion was then offered and adopted that a recess be&#xD;
taken till half-past one o'clock.&#xD;
THIRD AND FOURTH DAY.-&#xD;
Mr. Dodd, for the defence, submitted to the Presbytery that while they&#xD;
were perfectly willing, if the Presbytery should so decide, that the trial&#xD;
should proceed and that all testimony be admitted, they declined to waive&#xD;
their legal rights in the case, and they reserved to themselves the right&#xD;
to sift all the testimony at the summing up of the case, to deniand the&#xD;
exclusion of hearsay testimony, 'and to protest against any verdict by the&#xD;
Presbytery if hearsay testimony were admitted. He said that he had&#xD;
consulted an eminent jurist, and from the advice he received he felt com-&#xD;
pelled to take this course.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Edwards submitted that Mr. Dodd violated the spirit of the&#xD;
Book of Discipline in going outside of the Presbytery to consult profes-&#xD;
sional .counsel.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd.-He is an elder of the Church.&#xD;
Mr. Edwards-That makesind difference.&#xD;
After some remarks by Dr. Magee a resolution consentinlg to the pos-&#xD;
'tion assumed by tIge defence was put and carried.&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.                        36,&#xD;
Thie cross-examination of Mr. Miller was then commen.ed:-Mary&#xD;
Pomeroy was eighteen years old when she came to live with mue; her&#xD;
father died three or four years ego;-she has only one brother living; he&#xD;
is in Michigan; the reason- she came to live with me was because when&#xD;
her father married the second time she disliked to live with her step-&#xD;
mother; Miss Pomeroy's pay, as organist of the Prospect -avenue Pres-&#xD;
byterian church, was $100 a year; she used to give it to me as custodian&#xD;
for her; 1 gave her no receipt, nor did I keep any book account; during&#xD;
the time Mr. Glendenning was visiting Nliss Pomeroy no other gentle-&#xD;
man visited her; she did not receive presents from any other gentleman;&#xD;
I presented her with a ring which contained a stone that resembled&#xD;
amethyst; there was no inscription on it; I have not the ring with me,&#xD;
but I will produce it; I think I know where the chain and locket and&#xD;
thimble and sleeve buttons presented to Miss Pomeroy by Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
ning were bought; Mr. Rochette, of Jersey City Heights, told me a week&#xD;
ago that he believed he sold them to Mr. Glendenning; my brother,&#xD;
Abijah B. Miller, and my brother-in-law, Thomas H. Jones, stopped for&#xD;
some time at my house; they were there atthe same time; Mr. Miller is&#xD;
about thirty-two years of age and Mr. Jones about twenty-six; I was&#xD;
seldom out late in the evening, certainly never out of the street; if I were&#xD;
out late my wife would not wait up for me; the conversation between&#xD;
me and Miss Pomeroy in regard to the engagement ring I have related&#xD;
correctly; I asked her who gave her the present, and she answered that&#xD;
it was Mr. Glendenining; the reason she stated for giving it back to Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning  as that she wanted to have the inscription changed; in&#xD;
regard to her m rriage with Mr. Glendenning we felt encouraged by his&#xD;
visits, and we t ought that in him she would get a good man; never&#xD;
spoke to Mr. Glen naing about marrying Miss Pomeroy, nor did I ask,&#xD;
him  his intentions on the subject, but I said to Miss Pomeroy three or&#xD;
four times in presence of my wife, that I must go down and see Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning in regard to his intentions; my wife said I had better wait&#xD;
and have a talk with Mary herself; we did have a talk with Mary, and&#xD;
she said that it was all right; my wife then said we had better let the&#xD;
thing remain so for the present; this conversation passed before Mary&#xD;
received the engagement ring; I did not remain up at night while Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning'and Miss Pomeroy would be together at a late hour because&#xD;
I always had confidence that; Mr. Glendenmning would do nothing but&#xD;
what was right;  vhen my wife -first discovered that Mary was pregnant&#xD;
she came to me and said that Mary had been committing a fearful act; I&#xD;
don't remember how long the conversation between me and my wife&#xD;
lasted on the subject just then for. we were so dumfounded we could&#xD;
hardly speak; I was overcome with indignation at the thought that such&#xD;
a thing could occur under my roof; Mary did not speak a word ; she&#xD;
lay with her head in my wife's lap; some of the neighbot-s e,ame into my)~&#xD;

&#xD;
house that evening, but I can't remember the exact language they used;&#xD;
they denounced Mr. Glendenning; I applied to counsel-in the matter and&#xD;
-he advised me to have some friends go and see Mr. Glendenning and see&#xD;
if he would come and marry the girl; I acted on this advice and Mr.&#xD;
Northrup and Mr. Randall went to Mr. Glendenning; my counsel also&#xD;
advised me that in case Mr. Glendenning refused I ought to have a war-&#xD;
rant out -for his arrest; Mr. Glendenning was out on the stoop of Mr.&#xD;
Hallowell's house in the evening and after some conversation they moved&#xD;
out and walked together to Mr. Glendenning's house;. Mr. Northrup. and&#xD;
Mr. Randall followed them; I was on the opposite side of the street in&#xD;
company with an officer; ,Mr. Glendenning and Mr. Hallowell stood talk,&#xD;
ing together so long that Mr. Northrup, and Mr. Randall became im-&#xD;
patient and remarked to me that they would stop there talking till morn-.&#xD;
ing; the officer then said, "The best thing to be done is to arrest him&#xD;
there now;'' Mr. Glendenning was thereupon arrested; my wife asked&#xD;
Mary in the presence of me and my counsel if any other person had ever&#xD;
seduced her, and she replied that no other man ever did, when Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning was brought by the officer face to face with Mary in my&#xD;
house I asked her whose child that was, and she answered it was Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning's; she used the 'words, "Glen, I have deceived you; it is&#xD;
yoursI;"  did not knom.what she meant by that, and I asked her after.&#xD;
wards for an explanation; she told me in reply that on the night Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning held the pistol over her and made her sign the paper, he&#xD;
took her hand, made her place it on the Bible that was lying on the table,&#xD;
and swear that she would never divulge what had passed, come what&#xD;
may. (Sensation.)&#xD;
Witness then proceeded to describe minutely the scene in the parlor&#xD;
when Glendenning was brought in by the officer. When Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
caught the first sight of Glendenning she staggered forward and would&#xD;
have fallen had Glendenning not caught her; the language used by wit-&#xD;
ness to Mary was, "Here is your seducer; if he be, say so to him; if&#xD;
not, say so to his face;" when witness first heard the report going around'&#xD;
that Mr..Glendenning had a document which was to shield him in the&#xD;
case, witness urged Mary to tell him what that document contained, let&#xD;
weight fall where it might'; Mr. Glendenning had given out through hit&#xD;
counsel that the.blame would come neater home.&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning.-Can I interrupt the witness?&#xD;
Counsel for defence.-No,*'no.&#xD;
Mr. Wall.-Mr. Miller, you stated that several friends collected in your&#xD;
house in reference to her seduction. Did. you not fear that publIcity,&#xD;
would defeat the object you had in view?&#xD;
Witness.-Not at all; I knew I could trust those persons who called.&#xD;
Counsel for defence then asked for a suspension of the examination in&#xD;
order that a commission might be appointed to take testimony on the&#xD;
&#xD;

part of the defence, as some witnesses for the defence are about to leave&#xD;
for a distant part of the country. A motion to that effect was agreed to,&#xD;
and the Moderator appointed Rev. Mr. Eddy and Mr. Martin.&#xD;
Several questions were put t6 Mr. Miller by members of the Presbytery.&#xD;
He stated that Mr. Glendenning's frequent visits to his house ceased&#xD;
about last January; after that he caine seldom, and he did not wear hi&#xD;
accustomed air of familiarity; Mr. Glendenning was arrested on the 15th&#xD;
of July..&#xD;
Dr. Booth.-Weie there ever any suggestions as to the purity of Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy? A. Never to my knowledge; Miss Pomeroy never went to&#xD;
Mr. Glendenuing's church after the day we found out her trouble.&#xD;
The examination of Mr. Miller here closed, and it was read froni the&#xD;
stenographer's notes to the Presbytery. The other witnesses were dis-&#xD;
missed for the day.&#xD;
The Moderator announced that the commission appointed to take tes-&#xD;
timony would meet immediately after the adjournment of the Presbytery&#xD;
in the court room. He also announced that one member who was pre-&#xD;
viously appointed on the commission was set aside on account of his opin-&#xD;
ions already expressed on the case. The Presbytery then adjourned to&#xD;
this afternoon.&#xD;
During the cross-examination of Mr. Miller he was examined very&#xD;
minutely as to the exact words-of the conversations referred to in his tes-&#xD;
timony. The Moderator at one time said to him, "How is it, Mr. Miller,&#xD;
that your memory is so fresh on times, places and conversations when&#xD;
asked by the prosedution,- but the opposite when asked by the defence ?"&#xD;
Mr. Miller rejoined sparply, " I state what I know; I won't state ni hat I&#xD;
don't know."  At another time the witness replied to a inunt from'the&#xD;
defence, "I appreciate my position, sir; I know I am under oath."&#xD;
W hen the Moderator was ap)pointing the commission to take testimony&#xD;
for the defence he named Mr. French. At the mention of this name Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Vermilyea arose and objected, saying that Mr. French was as inti.&#xD;
mate friend of Mr. Glendenning and therefore he did not think should he&#xD;
.placed on such a commission. The Moderator rapped heavily and said,&#xD;
"The brother is out of order.. He has no right to in 'ke such a remark&#xD;
before the Presbytery while the case is on trial." Mr Frenel was after-&#xD;
ward set aside.&#xD;
The defence labored strenuously to impeach the character of Mr. Jones,&#xD;
brother-in-law of=Mr. Miller, and it seemed at one time as if Jones, not&#xD;
Glendenning, was on trial. "Did Mr. Jones live with you ?" "Had he&#xD;
a night key ?" "Was he ever alone in the house with Miss Pomeroy ?"&#xD;
" Was he married ?" "What was his occupation ?" "What were his&#xD;
habitsk" "Wher is he now?" anda score of such questions were put&#xD;
ato Mr Miller, in rapid succession. The object of the defence in this was&#xD;
sufficiently apparent.&#xD;

W8                     POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
Mr. Randall was the first witness next day. He testified that he went,&#xD;
in company with Mr. Nort hrup, to Mr. Millers's house on the night of&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning's arrest; Mr. iallowell accompanied Mr. Olendenning;&#xD;
Mr. Northrup told Mr. ylendenning he was sorry to see him in such a&#xD;
position ; Mr. Glendenning laughed, and said that Mr. Noi'thrup would&#xD;
w ind it serious for himself before he got through with it; witness then&#xD;
described the scene previously detailed by Mr. Miller, and continued:&#xD;
Mr. Miller said he would not permit any questions to be asked of Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy; Mr. Hallowell asked Miss Pomeroy if she did solemnly swear&#xD;
that Mr. Glendenning was the father of her child; the question wag&#xD;
repeated three or four times without an answer. Mr. Miller asked Mr.&#xD;
94  Glendenning if he would marry the girl; he answered that he could not,&#xD;
under present circumstances; Mr. Miller then asked him what business&#xD;
he had sneaking into his house at all hours of the night; Mr. Glenden2.&#xD;
kiing rephied that lhe would explain all that at the proper time; I amfa&#xD;
member of the congregation of this church; Miss-Poineroy's character&#xD;
was unexceptionable; never heard a word against her in my life; she,&#xD;
was a frequent visitor at my house.&#xD;
Justice Aldridge was recalled. The Moderator here announced that&#xD;
no person, male or female, under twenty-one years of age would be per-&#xD;
mitted in the church during this trial. In answer to counsel for the pros-&#xD;
ecution Witness saidI :-It was my own idea that the dying statement of&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy should be sworn to, for she expressed no desire on the&#xD;
subject; Mr. Gordon asked Mr. Glende ning on the night of the arrest&#xD;
why he did not speak of this matter before ; Mr. liendenning answered&#xD;
On her account."&#xD;
On cross-examination the witness said :-The bastardysuit against Mr-,&#xD;
Glendenming was discontinued because the bondsman (Mr. Gordon)&#xD;
asked to have the case attended to or that he be released from his bond;&#xD;
the Overseer of the Poor, Mr. Dudley, came to me and'asked that the&#xD;
proceed,ings be discontinued because the child was not chargeable to the&#xD;
city, inasmuch as no application for maintenance had been made; the&#xD;
Overseer of the Poor came to me and told me that as the mother had died&#xD;
no application had been made to the city for the support of the child; he,&#xD;
therefore, had no further ground of action against Mr. Glendenning;&#xD;
when Miss Pomeroy was making her dying statement she was as calm&#xD;
and composed as Mr'. Dodd (counsel for defence) would be if he were&#xD;
going to leave this world; it seemed as if the candle were going out;&#xD;
she could not sign her name; she might have made her mark; I wanted&#xD;
to have her mark there so that'people could not question it; there was&#xD;
not the slightest appearance of excitement.&#xD;
On the next day Justice Aldridge was recalled. Counsel for the pros-&#xD;
ecution  questioned  him in regard to the statement made by. Mr&#xD;

-dlendenning in the Justice's office on the night of the arrest. - Mr. Glen&#xD;
denning said on that night, " Would'not a written confession clear me?"&#xD;
The Justice answered that it might, possibly.&#xD;
Mrs. Ethelinda Miller was then called. She went over the old story&#xD;
with minuteness'of detail and with deep 'solemnity of manner. After&#xD;
.sketching the introduction of Glendenning to the deceased the witness&#xD;
proceeded :-Her strange actionsexcited my suspicions; I communicated&#xD;
my suspicions to Mr. Miller's aunt and told her that if she knew anything&#xD;
was wrong she should tell me; it then flashed across my mind that they&#xD;
were married, but that he did not want his mother and sister to know oft&#xD;
it; on .the 13th of July, in the morning, I came down the stairs suddenly&#xD;
upon Mary, and I had only to look at her to see what was the matter; I&#xD;
turned away in horror and Mary asked what was the matter or whether&#xD;
I was sick: I said I was sick at heart; I had prepared to go to New&#xD;
York' and I became terribly excited ; I told Mr. Miller after I returned&#xD;
from New York and told him that before I stept that night I must know&#xD;
the facts of the case; I talked with Mary that night about it; she denied&#xD;
the charge most strenuously and turned very pale ; I asked her whether&#xD;
she was married and after a great deal of hesitation she gasped out "yes;"&#xD;
I then told her to go 4nd get her certificate at once; she faltered and fell&#xD;
.across my knees; "Oh, my God!" I said, "you are not married." (Here&#xD;
Mrs. Miller was overcome with emotion.) lMr. Miller happened to come&#xD;
in just then; I said to Mary, "Go for Mr. Glendenning at once;" she&#xD;
looked up and said it was too late; I told her that he was there in that&#xD;
house much later than that; I then asked her was Mr. Glendenning the&#xD;
father of that child, and she said that he was; I took her to her room and&#xD;
talked'with her, telling her that she brought this trouble upon herself,&#xD;
but that, after all, I had only myself to blame for going to bed and allow-&#xD;
ing ainy one to remain in the house, but that I had all the confidence in&#xD;
the world in her and in him, and that I thought I could trust a miniger&#xD;
of the gospel; on the night of Mr. Glendenning's arrest, when he came in,&#xD;
I said I was glad he came, that I wanted to see him on business; he&#xD;
said, "Pray,'what might that business he?" I told him I wanted him to&#xD;
be married, and he asked to whom; I told him "To Mary, that you&#xD;
ruined;" he answered, "No, indeed, mum," raising his hand and shaking&#xD;
his head in an indifferent way ; I believe I fainted that night, for the next&#xD;
-thing I recoll I was up stairs.&#xD;
Mrs. Miller then related the pistol scene as previously described-When&#xD;
Mr. Glenden      i that if he was found out he would be a ruined man,&#xD;
and she* Id to him i.astodishment, "And what would it do to me?"&#xD;
he 'told her to trust to him, that he would stand by her to the very end&#xD;
and see her all right, but that she must clear him; she then wrote as be&#xD;
Alictated, and she told me that everything seemed black before her eyes.&#xD;
Here Glendenning laughed outright, and Mrs. Miller resented it quickly,$&#xD;

&#xD;
saying, with a voice of indignation,."Sir, I don't see anything in this to-&#xD;
laugh at."&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie.-I hope the Moderator will preserve order.&#xD;
The Moderator (rapping).-Order must be preserved. (A murmur of&#xD;
disapprobation at the unseemly interruption ran through the church.)&#xD;
Mrs. Mil er continued.-The substance of the document signed by Mary&#xD;
while Glendenning held the pistol over her head was that he could im-&#xD;
plicate half a dozen members of his church.&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie.-Were any names mentioned?&#xD;
A. There were no names indt; if there were he put them there after&#xD;
she wrote it; she could not tell any more in relation to the contents of&#xD;
that document-; Mary gave me the date of her seduction by Mr. Glen.&#xD;
denning-as the 4th of July, 1873, while we were away in the country; it&#xD;
occurred in the back parlor. Mrs. Miller then rehearsed the story of her&#xD;
visit to the Institution for infants, in Clinton place, New York; tlk visit&#xD;
was suggested by-Miss Pomeroy; Dr. Hubbard, after inquiring about the&#xD;
case, described Mr. Glendenning accurately, as the man who had visited&#xD;
the institution six weeks' previously, to have a young girl admitted till&#xD;
her child should be born; the matron of the institution also described&#xD;
him and when I showed her Glendenning's picture she identified it at&#xD;
once, saying, " That is the man; " the physican told her she ought to be'&#xD;
careful as she might have to swear to it; the matron replied that she&#xD;
could swear to it; Mr. Pomeroy and Mrs. Metz came with me ; the con-&#xD;
versation took place in presence of Mrs. Metz; in a conversation with&#xD;
Mary, when I saw there was a burden on her mind I asked her what the.&#xD;
burden was; she said that he (meaning Gleidenning) was constantly&#xD;
accusing her of being intimate with -other men. (Here the witness men.-&#xD;
tioned the names of eight gentlemen, some of them being members of&#xD;
Glendenning's church.) He told her that he and Mr. Dean had watched&#xD;
her and that they saw her walk' home on one occasion with one of the,&#xD;
gentlemen referred to, and he said that he supposed they had a good time&#xD;
when they went into the house; he said he could p e she was intimate&#xD;
with these men; in explanation of that she said that Mr. - once heldl&#xD;
his umbrella over her head coming from church, but he did. not go into.&#xD;
the house; I became indignant, and asked her was it possible she took.&#xD;
all that from him, and she gave me this reply, "It was a rod of iron he,&#xD;
held over my head; I was in a condition that prevented my saying a&#xD;
word; I was wholly in his power." (Sensation.) I tried to cheer her,&#xD;
up, but it seemed as if there was a heavier burden still resting on her; I&#xD;
told her to tell me whatever was on her miffd, as she had my forgiveness?.&#xD;
and she drew up her hands and said, "How can I leave this good home,&#xD;
the best home I ever had in my life?" I told her to cheer up, that she-&#xD;
should continue to live with us and face the trouble- she replied, "No, I&#xD;
will die if I leave here and I will die if I stay.'" (Sensation.) At thia$&#xD;
&#xD;
k&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
time-she was lying in bed in a very weak condition; in the conversation&#xD;
about the father of the child she said, "I hear that Glendenning is walk-&#xD;
ing arid laughing through the streets; I wonder if he would laugh if he&#xD;
came in here to-night and looked at me on this bed from which I Ufgin&#xD;
to feel I will never rise and saw the misery that he has brought upon&#xD;
me, and not only upon me, but on you who did not deserve it; I hear&#xD;
*o, that he is boasting about the child coming nearer home, but as God.&#xD;
is my judge, John S. Glendenning and no one else is the father of that.&#xD;
child."&#xD;
In describing the deathbed scene the witness gave the following new&#xD;
points:-We wished to have some clergyman come to pray with her, but,&#xD;
none could be found; Mr. Dunne and Mr. Gordon, both elders of this&#xD;
church, came and prayed with her; she said to them, "Mr. Dunne and&#xD;
Mr. Gordon you are both good men; you have heard his story, but you&#xD;
have not heard mine; in an unguarded moment I fell and John S. Glen-&#xD;
denning fell with me; and I want to proclaim to you, before God as my&#xD;
witness, that Mr. Glendenning is the' father of my child; they say he has&#xD;
got papers, but that does not clear him;" this was said to Mr. Danne;&#xD;
I was in the room; Mr. Dunne then asked to be left alone with her for a&#xD;
moments.&#xD;
The remainder of Mrs. Miller's testimony was a corroboration of that&#xD;
already published. Regarding Mr. Glendenning's more recent visits to,&#xD;
Miss Aolurro'y the witness said:-During a part of the year be would&#xD;
come in stealthily and would be in the house without our knowing it; at&#xD;
last I heard it from the neighbors, and not liking the rumors that were&#xD;
going around among the neighbors I spoke to Mary about it and told her&#xD;
it seemed very singular and that I did not like it.&#xD;
The cross-examination of Mrs. Miller by Mr. Dodd was resumed:-&#xD;
Mary told me that when Mr. Glendenning made her swear on the Bible&#xD;
never to reveal what had happened she meant to keep that oath ; she ex-&#xD;
plained to me how he used the pistol; she said it was a short pistol and&#xD;
that he carried it in a case; when he pointed it at her she said, "You&#xD;
wouldn't shoot me ! why you'd be hung for murder;" he answered, "No&#xD;
I wouldn't i'd kill myself first;" Mary told me she thought.he would&#xD;
shoot her; when I asked her about her pregnancy I didn't threaten her;&#xD;
it took an hour to elicit the confession; I told her I would rather lose my&#xD;
right hand than have her accuse Mr. Glendenning wrongfully, and I beg-&#xD;
ged of her to tell me the-whole truth.; it was suggested to me to get&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy married without publicity; the arrest was distasteful to&#xD;
me, and it was only proposed to arrest him if lie refuse to marry Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy; Mary asked to have the child put out to nurse; she did not&#xD;
take much notice of it at first; the matron in the Clinton place ifant&#xD;
Asylum positively identified Mr. lendenning, and when she did so she&#xD;
astonished me'; Dr. Hubbard seemed to be annoyed at the nurse'&amp;amp;&#xD;

&#xD;
identification of Mr. Glendenning, and he told her that she must be care.&#xD;
ful, as she might have to swear to it; she answered sharply, "So I will&#xD;
swear to it;" the Doctor's words in reference to the visit of Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denping were, 'It strikes me that a gentleman answering that description&#xD;
was here about six weeks ago in reference to the admission of a young&#xD;
girl who, he said, was in trouble;" the child was named in baptism&#xD;
"Ella Stuart Glendenning;" it was so named at Mary's request; sie&#xD;
said to me, "Whose name should I give it but it's father's?" she lived&#xD;
about three weeks and a half after the birth of the child; when I first&#xD;
chided Mary about the frequency of Mr. Glendenning's visits and his late&#xD;
Hours she made all sorts of excuses; she said that the rain prevented him&#xD;
from going home before late hours many times; I told her to tell him it&#xD;
was not right and that he would think none the less of her for it; I said&#xD;
that if she did not tell him I would; when I heard that Glendenning re-&#xD;
ported he had a package of letters that would clear him, I asked Mary it&#xD;
she had written any letters to him, and she said she only wrote seven or&#xD;
eight in answer to notes sent by him; she destroyed all the letters he&#xD;
sent her, as she said he directed her to do so and that he would destroy&#xD;
hers; she never at any time hesitated to tell who, was the father of her&#xD;
child, but she hesitated to tell the time of the seduction; when I asked&#xD;
her about the document Mr. Glendenning compelled her to sign she said,&#xD;
"If I were to be killed for it I could not tell word for word what was in&#xD;
that paper-;" I asked her if she did not understand that his object was to&#xD;
use it against her; she said that she supposed he wanted it because he&#xD;
was afraid of getting into trouble. on account of her talking so much about&#xD;
him; she made her first confession to me of her trouble on Monday night,&#xD;
-   13th of July last.&#xD;
To Rev. Mr. Edwards.-Mr. Glendenning's mother and sister did not&#xD;
H-favor his attentions to Miss Pomeroy, but I never understood the reason&#xD;
why.,&#xD;
To the Moderator.-Their engagement was announced among our&#xD;
friends; we all talked about it, but we did not give it any further publicity;&#xD;
because I did not like any gossip, for if the old women of this church&#xD;
got talking of anybody they would pick his or her character to pieces, no&#xD;
matter how good the person might be-(laughter)-I asked Mary about&#xD;
the engagement, and she said there was no day fixed for the marriage.&#xD;
This was the conclusion of Mrs. Milller's examination.&#xD;
Mrs. Julia M. Metz examined.-I was a member of this congregation,&#xD;
and had charge of the Sabbath school, but I gave it up; knew of Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning's visits to Miss Pomeroy; I live near Mr. Miller's; I saw&#xD;
him at Mr. Miller's a number- of times; I understood he went there-to&#xD;
visit Miss Pomeroy; his hours of visiting were in the evening; was so-&#xD;
situated that I had a good opportunity to know of the frequency of his&#xD;
visits; saw Miss Pomeroy wear a-ring which I was told was given her&#xD;

POOR M'ARY POMEROY. N&#xD;
&#xD;
by Mr. Glendenning; knew Miss Pomeroy well4 but not very intimately;&#xD;
never heard anything against her character; never knew an improper aet&#xD;
on her part; I noticed that when she was at parties she was more reserved&#xD;
than usual; never knew anything against her character for truthfulness&#xD;
untill her prevarication'in this case with Mr. Glendenning; saw her eve-&#xD;
ry day from the time of Mr. Glendenning's arrest till she was taken sick;&#xD;
I had conversations with her in which I urged the importance of her tel-&#xD;
ing the truth, otherwise her friends could not help her; her reluctance to&#xD;
tell the truth I attributed 'to her strong affection for Mr. Glendenning-&#xD;
she told mc without hesitation and without being urged that Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
ning was the author of her trouble; I asked her how long this thing had&#xD;
been going on, and she saia, "Since last Thanksgiving;" she told me that&#xD;
if Mrs. Miller, and myself would go into the other room she would tell&#xD;
us all about it; she then told us, after a great effort, that the last Fourth&#xD;
of July (1873) was the date; when we spoke to her further she'gave as&#xD;
an excuse, "I loved him so;" she said that Mr. Glendenning brought&#xD;
a paper to her one evening and asked her to sign it; she said she could&#xD;
not, as everything turned black before her eyes: she told him to read it&#xD;
himself, and be did so, after which he- asked her to sign it; she said she&#xD;
could not sign that; he then took a pistol out of his pocket and compell-&#xD;
ed her to sign it; she said, "You don't know what I have suffered from&#xD;
that man for the past few months:" she distinctly mentioned John S.&#xD;
Glendenning as the father of her child; she mentioned no one'else; I&#xD;
went with Mrs. Miller to the asylum in Clinton place to have the child&#xD;
taken there to be nursed; Dr. Hubbard did not identify the picture of&#xD;
Mr. Glendanning , buL the matron did at once; she said, "That is the&#xD;
man;" the doctor cautioned her to be careful, and she said she could&#xD;
swear to it, I went a second time to the asylum, because my veracity&#xD;
had been questioned in relation to my first visit, and I wanted the matron&#xD;
to make an affidavit or sign a paper stating that our statements in regard&#xD;
to our first visit were correct, as a great deal had been said about it; she&#xD;
declined, as she said the doctors advised her to, say nothing further about&#xD;
the niatter and a great deal had been published about it in the papers;&#xD;
several persons had called in relation to it but she declined to see them&#xD;
at all; a party of gentlemen-Mr. Glendenning being one of the number&#xD;
6.-had call d also, and she said that she recognized him at once, they&#xD;
desired to ee her, but she declined, saying he did not wish to do any-&#xD;
thing contiary to the orders of the doctors; I remarked to her that that&#xD;
was ve   insular, as if she had come down to see those gentimen she&#xD;
eguld tell that Mr. Glendenning was the man arid that would have sett-&#xD;
led the question; I reminded her that she blid previously identified the&#xD;
picture and she answered," "Yes, I did, I will not take back anything I&#xD;
have said,but the officers of the institution have positively forbidden me&#xD;
to say anything about it."&#xD;

&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The cross-examination of Mrs. Metz was commenced next day. The&#xD;
first question was why she gave up the infant class in the church, and&#xD;
she replied ;-"I felt I could not consistently come to the church lest I&#xD;
should meet Mr. Glendenning; I felt that if the elders of the church al-&#xD;
lowed him to remain here after this terrible affair I would abandon the&#xD;
church; Miss Pomeroy said that Mr. Glendenning accused.her of being&#xD;
intimate with several gentlemen (here witness mentioned the names of&#xD;
six members of Glendenning's church); she said that he constantly threat-&#xD;
ened he would expose her if she should betray him; I knew Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning as a preacher, and formed a very favorable opinion of him; I&#xD;
thought if a gentleman visited a lady he ought to do it openly and in a&#xD;
gentlemanly manner and not stealthily. Rev. Dr. Eddy-Was Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy, in your opinion, a fit companion for a minister? A. She was a&#xD;
fit companion for any person; if there was any superiority on his side it&#xD;
was intellectually, not morally.&#xD;
To Rev. Mr. Edwards.-In my judgment the attentions paid by Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning to Miss Pomeroy could not with propriety take place with-&#xD;
out an actual engagement; don't know what is the general impression&#xD;
with regard to the propriety of such a course in this community, but that&#xD;
is my own judgment.&#xD;
To Rev. Mr. Booth-Never heard Miss Pomeroy deny the pistol scene,&#xD;
The witness, in answer to further questions, stated:&#xD;
"The character of the intimacy which Mr. Glendenning alleged to ex.&#xD;
ist between Miss Pomeroy and the gentleman named, I understood to be&#xD;
criminal; Mr. Glendenning did not go home with her from the meetings,&#xD;
but went there afterwards; I thought it was very unmanly on his part&#xD;
not to go home with her, but no follow her soon afterwards."&#xD;
To Dr. Imbrie-My understanding of her statement that Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
ning was constantly accusing her of criminal intimacy with other men&#xD;
was that he charged her thus in order to induce her to submit to his des-&#xD;
ires.&#xD;
When- the witness was exainined minutely as to the causes that led her&#xD;
to lose her respect for Mr. Glendenning, she said that it was very strange&#xD;
that Mr. and Mrs. Miller never spoke, of him as a visitor; when they&#xD;
would'call it the house of witness they would refer to him simply by say-&#xD;
ing "Mr. Glendenning is there,1" meaning at Mr. Miller's house.  The&#xD;
witness further stated that she thought Mr. Glendenning could not afford&#xD;
to sacrifice himself by visiting Aliss PQmeroy in such an unmanly way,&#xD;
and that she was surprised when she heard of the engagement, because&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy was not interlectually the equal of Mr. Glendenning, but&#xD;
morally she was the equal of any person.&#xD;
Mr. Willard E. Dudley examined-I had known Miss Ponieroy seven-&#xD;
teen years last spring; knew her first when she was living with Jacob&#xD;
Miller on H~ob'oken avenue in this city; knew her intimately, and can&#xD;

&#xD;
POOIR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
positively testify that I always knew her to be a truthful, virtuous girl,&#xD;
and of a very quiet disposition; she was very far from being what is&#xD;
known as a gay you1g lady; was present when she made her dying&#xD;
statement to Justice Aldridge; there were six or seven persons present;&#xD;
she called me by name and called Mr. Aldridge by name (witness here&#xD;
repeated the words of the dying statement already published, laying&#xD;
stress'on the sentence, "I was afraid of him once, but I am not now").;&#xD;
she was perfectly conscious and understood the words she spoke as clearly&#xD;
as I do now; did not discover any indication that her mind was wan-&#xD;
dering; did niot think when she made the statement that she would die&#xD;
go soon; nobody asked her any questions during the making of the state-&#xD;
ment; she seemed very anxious to make it and tell somebody; she seem-&#xD;
gd to be relieved when she hade made it.&#xD;
Cross-examined.-I went for Justice Aldridge at Miss Pomeroy's, re-&#xD;
quest.&#xD;
Mr. James Dunne examined...-I am an elder in this congregation; the&#xD;
other elder is George P. Howell; heard rumors that Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
was engaged to be married to Miss Pomeroy; I had a conversation with&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning on the subject and he denied that he was engaged; the&#xD;
conversation too place last winter'; he left the impression on my mind&#xD;
that there was no probatbility of an engagement; there was a very un-&#xD;
comfortable feeling among the elders and members of the congregation&#xD;
in consequence of his intimacy with Miss Pomeroy; the impression that&#xD;
prevailed was that Mr. Glendenning visited her much oftener than the&#xD;
facts warranted; I was sent for to see Miss Ponieroy; Mr. John Gordon&#xD;
came with me; Dr. Burdett was there; he said she was suffering' from&#xD;
nervous excitement and that she was wandering in her mind; she said&#xD;
she was glad to see us, and she recognized us distinctly; she told us that&#xD;
she desired to say to us that Mr. Glendenning and no one else was the&#xD;
father of her child; she said, "He may have some papers-I don't know&#xD;
what they are-but that don't clear him; I couldn't help it;" I asked&#xD;
her how long this had been going on, and she said about a year; I then&#xD;
prayed with her; I asked her what she wished to pray for, and she said&#xD;
that God would forgive her sins and take her to Heaven; before reading&#xD;
the chapter Qhe said, "In an unguarded moment I fell and he fell with&#xD;
me;" when she prayed that God might forgive her she, added, "And him&#xD;
too;" I had no doubt whateverthat "she" referred to Mr. Glendenning,&#xD;
for it was used in that connection; there were several ladies present up&#xD;
to this time, and I asked them if they would not leave us (Mr. Gordon&#xD;
and myself) alone with Miss Pomeroy, and they retired; I then said to&#xD;
her that it was necessary before she would be forgiven that she should&#xD;
repent, and it was necessary to her repentance that she should tell the&#xD;
truth; I then repeated the question whether John S. Glendenning was&#xD;
the father of her child, and she said "yes;" I then asked her if she ever&#xD;

&#xD;
had criminal intimacy with any other persons, and she said 'n.-ver;" I&#xD;
asked her if she ever made any statements contrary to these, and.she&#xD;
said she never did; I left and called again in the evening, in company&#xD;
with Mr. C. 0. Jewell, one of the trustees of this church; this was on&#xD;
the Sunday before she died; Rev. Mr. Tdnison had been there between&#xD;
my two visits; Mr. Jewell prayed with her; Miss Pomeroy had been a&#xD;
communicant in this church about two years and a half; never knew&#xD;
anything against her character, nor did I ever hear anything against her;&#xD;
never had any misgivings as to the propriety of herfoccupying that po-&#xD;
sition in the church; spoke to Mr. Glendennin'g about Miss Pomeroy's&#xD;
assertion to me that he was the father of her chiLd; he denied it by in&#xD;
plication, but I do not think'he did in terms.&#xD;
Q. Did you ever have a suspicion that any other than Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
ning was the father of that child ? A. (after great hesitation) I did.&#xD;
j Q. Did you ever have any conversation on the subject with the person&#xD;
you suspected ? A. (A long pause.) I cannot answer that question.&#xD;
The Moderator here ruled that the witness was not required to impli-&#xD;
cate a third person, and' the question as put by Dr. Riggs was quite&#xD;
proper.&#xD;
Witness...-L had no particular person in my mind; I believed Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning was innocent, and of ourse some one must be the father&#xD;
of the child.&#xD;
To Rev. Mr. Edwards.-Miss Pomeroy was admitted to the com-&#xD;
munion-of this church on examination; she gave reasonable evidence of&#xD;
piety and maintained a Christian deportment as far as I had on oppor-&#xD;
tunity of judging; we received" her without misgivings.&#xD;
Counsel for defence announced that Mr. Dunne would be required to&#xD;
attend again in the case.&#xD;
Mrs. Sarah R. Graves testified that she knew Miss Pomeroy intim ely&#xD;
for three years and a half; witness lived next door to Mrs. Miller, and&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy visited her house three and four times a day ; she was a&#xD;
companion to her daughter; she bore an excellent character; saw her&#xD;
and Mr. Glendenning walking arn in arm frequently in the evening; he&#xD;
visited her often ; I have seeni him there three amil four times a week; I&#xD;
only saw him go in $he afternoon three or four times; his regular hours&#xD;
of visiting were from seven to nine and after nine at night; saw hin&#xD;
come out as late as one o'clock at night; Miss Pomeroy told me she was&#xD;
engaged to be married and showed me her engagement ring; it was on&#xD;
her finger; I asked her when it was to come off and she said that there was&#xD;
nio day fixed ; she told me that Mr. Glendenning gave .it to her ; she also&#xD;
showed me the other presents which she said he gave her;. I, told her, as&#xD;
I would my own daughter, several times that she ought not to receive&#xD;
those presents.&#xD;
Mrs. Sarah Graves, on cross-examination, testified:..-When I asked&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Glendenning.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy why she allowed Mr. Glendenning to be so intimate with&#xD;
her, she answered, "I loved him so; he was a minister, and I thought he&#xD;
would not desert me; oh, God, how could he desert me so! I have-sin-&#xD;
wed fallen and suffered, and now he has deserted me;;" she said this&#xD;
distinctly; Mr. Glendenning, in my judgment, sought after Miss Porm-&#xD;
eroy rather tihan she after him, and I can prove this; on the Fourth of&#xD;
July last I went with Miss Pomeroy and others to see the fireworks in&#xD;
Blergen square; on the way home Mr. Glendenning met us, saving that&#xD;
be had been uptown on an errand and that accounted for his being out&#xD;
so }0te; I told him we.were going home and he said that if we had no&#xD;
objection he would accompany us; he walked with Miss Pomeroy, and&#xD;
-when theft got as far as my gate I asked them in, but he declined, saying&#xD;
be was going to spend that night with Mary; I saw them parting and&#xD;
he kissed her; saw him leave her at one o'clock in the morning; he&#xD;
-walked on the grass past my house.&#xD;
MIrs. Graves then recited Miss Pomeroy's account of the pistol scene,&#xD;
wh-ich was a corroboration of the testimony already given, and continued:&#xD;
When Miss Pomeroy spoke about the name she would give the baby I&#xD;
;sti(ested the name "Ella;" the child was named "Ella Stuart Glen-&#xD;
denning;" Mary said the last-name was after the father; when she showed&#xD;
me her engagement ring she told me not to say anything about it; never&#xD;
saw any other gentleman visit her during the time Mr. Glendenning was&#xD;
paying attention to her; she explained to me the meaning of her state-&#xD;
ment, "Glen., I have deceived you, it is yours," on t-he night Glenden-&#xD;
ning was arrested; she meant that she had told the secret after her solmn&#xD;
promise to keep it; she was so scared she hardly knew what she was say.&#xD;
ing: Mr. Glendenning gave her many presents' such as cuffs, collars, &amp;amp;c.,&#xD;
and had a paper regularly sent her, for which he subscribed; I felt very&#xD;
uneasy one night because Mr..Glendenning remained so long with Mary;&#xD;
I got up, looked out of the window and saw a light in Mr. Miller's par-&#xD;
lor; saw her pull down the shade and the light's were immediately put&#xD;
out; the place remained dark about twenty minutes; never knew Mary&#xD;
to keep company with other gentlemen: she told me that when Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning was giving her the presents he said that she might as well have&#xD;
the presents then, as she would get them some time.&#xD;
The witness then related the circumstances -attending the deathbed&#xD;
scene, which was a confirmation of the testimony already given, anda dd-&#xD;
ed, "After Justice Aldridge went out Mary lookeal at Mrs. Miller and&#xD;
said, 'take care of my child;'"1' she seemed anxious for Judge Aldridge's&#xD;
returtn.; I saw the light turned down a great many times in Miss Porme-&#xD;
roys parlor while Mr. Glendenning was there; spoket to my daughter&#xD;
about it, but never mentioned it to Mary.&#xD;
Mrs. Caroline D. Wilson testified.-I knew 'Miss Poreroy after she&#xD;

-50                    POOa MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
was pregnant; knew her parents well when they lived in Ovid; Mary&#xD;
went to live with Mr. Miller's family because she could not agree with&#xD;
her stepmother; her mother died in childbirth; I can speak poitively a-&#xD;
bout her danghter; she was always considered an honest, upright girl,&#xD;
just and truthful in everything; when I first discovered Mary's trouble I&#xD;
was sent for to come to Mr- Miller's house; I found Mary crying; she&#xD;
said to me, "Ohthis is dreadful, dreadful; nobody knows how bad I feel!"&#xD;
'I asked her who was the cause of her trouble, and she answered that it&#xD;
was John S. Glendenning; slie said that she had asked limin what he&#xD;
should do with the baby, and he said', "Oh we can put it in a basket and&#xD;
leave it on somebody's door stoop, Mary yielded to his wishes because&#xD;
he said, "Why, Mary, it's allright; you are my little wife;" she express-&#xD;
ed deep sorrow when she spoke to me and was deeply grieved because she&#xD;
brought Mr. Miller's family into so much trouble, I spoke to her after&#xD;
her confinement and she said she did not believe she would live long , she&#xD;
told me- that the paper -she gave to Mr. Glendenning was intended to&#xD;
exonerate him; I told her that I would not.give a paper to any man liv-&#xD;
ing if he wronged me; she answered, "Mrs. Wilson, you don't know&#xD;
what you would do if you had a pistol presented to your head;" I be-&#xD;
lieve she told the truth, she said to me, "I don't know anything about&#xD;
any other man living than John S. Glendenning," she said this very em-&#xD;
phatically and in a loud tone.&#xD;
When Mr. Dodd commenced the cross-examination she declined posi-&#xD;
tively to state -her occupation. She said she was not ashamed of her&#xD;
business, saying, "I keep a genteel boarding house.10&#xD;
Mrs. Agae Miller testified that she had known Miss Pomeroy for six-&#xD;
teen years, and never knew anything improper in her conduct; she was&#xD;
a very amiable girl; she told witness she was engaged to Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
ning; used to see Mr. Glendenning and Mary come out of the church&#xD;
together long after the congregation was dismissed.&#xD;
Q. Did Mary ever tell you who was the father of the child? A. Why&#xD;
I never doubted that Glendenning was the father of the child. (Laughter.)&#xD;
Witness further stated that on one occasion Glendenning and Mary&#xD;
remained together so long in the church after Sabbath school that Mr.&#xD;
Miller got mad, and he was going to go over to the church and kick them&#xD;
out.' (Laughter.)&#xD;
Dr. John B. Burdett examined.-I did not know4Miss Poneroy;.1 at-&#xD;
tended her during her last illness; I went there on the solicitation of two&#xD;
of the neighbors, more particularly that of Mr. Metz; I expected that-&#xD;
she would recover; she got up too soon and she got cold, but that wfas&#xD;
not the cause of her dangerous illness; anxiety of mind hastened it; she&#xD;
=  died of congestion-of the lungs; she was perfectly rational; both lungs&#xD;
were involved in the congestion; did not tell Mr. Dunne that h'er mind&#xD;
was wandering. -&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Tunison examined.-I am a minister of the Methodist Epis-&#xD;
copal Church; became acquainted with Miss Pomeroy on the Sabbath'&#xD;
before her death; never knew her before; went to see her at the solici-&#xD;
tation of Mr. Metz, wvho said that efforts had been piade to secure the at-&#xD;
tendaice of ministers of her own Church, but in vain; the excuse was&#xD;
that they were absent from the city ; she was in a sinking state, and it&#xD;
was evident that she recognized she was rapidly approaching dissolution;&#xD;
her first statement to me was that she had sadly fallen, but she expressed&#xD;
a positive confidence that she would regain hold of Christ, and I could&#xD;
not doubt her sincerity ; she made no statement as to the cause of her&#xD;
condition ; I prayed with her; she- expressed her gratitude and entreated&#xD;
me to repeat my visit ; I called on her three times; I feel it due to my-&#xD;
self to say that in all these visits I never questioned Miss Pomeroy in&#xD;
regard to this terrible affair; during my third visit, just before her death,&#xD;
she used the following words, which I wrote down lest I should forget&#xD;
them :-" I said to Mr. Dunne on Sunday, and I now say to you, that&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning, and he alone, is the father of my child; this I say in&#xD;
your presence, and I call God ,to witness that I speak the truth;" she&#xD;
was remarkably calm; she said she had made a great effort to regain&#xD;
hold of Christ, and that hold had been regained; I could not doubt her&#xD;
religious statements.&#xD;
On cross-examintation he said:-I saw Miss Pomeroy about two hours&#xD;
before her death ; her manner impressed me with the truth of her state-&#xD;
nients, especially when she knew she was about dying, and said so in so&#xD;
many words; I ,warned her especially against falsehood on this point; I&#xD;
told -her that absolute truth was indispensable if she would regain het&#xD;
hold on God.&#xD;
Q. Did you believe in the truth of her statements ?  A. I will answer&#xD;
that if it be a proper question here, I did. Q. Did you deliver an address&#xD;
at the funeral?  A. I did. Q. Did you say then that you would doubt&#xD;
the existence of a God if the villain who seduced her were not punished&#xD;
for his sin ? A.' I did, in substance; I said there must be some punish-&#xD;
ment for the seducer in this world or the next. Q. Did you say that her&#xD;
seducer when hie inade one misstep became a murderer ?  A. I did, and&#xD;
worse than a murderer, for lie not only destroyed the body ,ut the repu-&#xD;
tation as well. Q. Did you say that you hold yourself responsible before&#xD;
the bar of man for the expressions you uttered on that-occnsion?  A., I&#xD;
did. Q. Did you rely on Miss Pomeroy's statements solely ?  A. Not&#xD;
solely, but mainly. Q,. What were your other sources of information ?&#xD;
A. I decline to answer that question. Witness continued - baptized&#xD;
the child "Ella Stuart;" I had nothing ut all to do with the name Glen-&#xD;
denning; the baptism took place before the funeral service.&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY'&#xD;
fr, I had no such impression; but, perhaps, it might have r ult  from&#xD;
'y obtuseness. (Laughter.)&#xD;
'Mr. George P. Howell, an elder of the church, testified-I was aware&#xD;
,hat an impression prevailed among the congregation that Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
iting was engaged to be married to Miss Pomeroy; had a conversation&#xD;
-with Mr. Dunne, the other elder, about it; it was not a ground for un-&#xD;
,,easiness with me; my feeling was that I regarded it as unwise tIor hint&#xD;
o show attention in that direction; the first talk about it was over a year&#xD;
ago, and was pretty general; talked to Mr. Glendenning about it; he&#xD;
denied positively that he was engaged to Miss Pomeroy; he admitted&#xD;
that he had made her presents; he said that he gave'her a watch and&#xD;
"'chain; the reason he gave for presenting the watch was that she was&#xD;
Labsent on one or two occasions from the organ, and he reproved her for&#xD;
er absence-; she replied in substance that she had no watch and could&#xD;
not know the time.&#xD;
Q. Did he say that he gave her the chain on the same ground? A. I&#xD;
think he did. (Laughter.)&#xD;
Elder George P. Howell resume'U the stand on direct examination and&#xD;
gave the following testimony :-Would not like to answer any further&#xD;
,question in relation to the presents given to Miss Pomeroy by Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning, because it would .involve a breach of confidence between Mr.&#xD;
glendenning and witness and would shadow a portion of the defence.&#xD;
The Moderator ruled that a witness was not required to violate con-&#xD;
~dence.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd said that the defence had no objection to Mr. Howell's ans-&#xD;
wering all questions.&#xD;
Witness continued- Ir. Glendenning gave the chain to Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
to protect her watch; when Mr. Glendenning denied that he was engaged&#xD;
to be married he made no explanation in regard to his reasons; -he left&#xD;
the impression on my mind that he did not seek Miss Pomeroy at all.&#xD;
Mrs. Clara H. Randall testified :.-I have been a member of the con-&#xD;
gregation of this church for three years; knew Miss Pomeroy for about&#xD;
six years; lived nearly opposite Mr. Miller's house; never heard any in-&#xD;
timation against Miss Pomeroy's character; Miss Pomeroy told me she&#xD;
received valuable presents from Mr. Glendenning; I saw these presents&#xD;
-a locket, watch and chain, sleeve buttons, &amp;amp;c.; she never spoke directly&#xD;
to me about her engagement with Mr. Glendenning, but she -spoke fami-&#xD;
liarly about him and talked of her future prospects in such a way as to&#xD;
leave the impression in my mind that they were engaged; knew him- to&#xD;
visit Miss Pomeroy often; had no curiosity in the matter, but when I&#xD;
heard that Mr. Glendenning denied his intimacy with Miss Pomeroy I&#xD;
thought I would satisfy myself and watch; he stayed one night till&#xD;
twenty minutes 'before twelve, another night till ten minutes past one,&#xD;
iand another till'five minutes before twi; ~I 'pulled' out my watch to mark&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
the time each of these nights ; had a conversation with Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
about her pregnancy; she said that Mr. Glendenning was the father of&#xD;
her child.&#xD;
Q. Did she state that he and be only led her astray ? A. She did,&#xD;
emphatically; I asked her that question, whether she was ever on crim-&#xD;
inal intimacy with any other person, and she answered, never; she ex-&#xD;
pressed very great penitence- for her I)hare in the sin'; she told me it was&#xD;
her daily prayer that the Lord mig  forgive Mr. Glendenning for what&#xD;
he had done, for she could not, hough she was constantly praying she&#xD;
night be able to do so ; she heard that he.denied he was the father of&#xD;
the child; she spoke of the mainer in which she was deceived, and said,&#xD;
that she neverthought she could be deceived by one who made so many&#xD;
promises;.she sent for witness on the Wednesday before her death; found&#xD;
her very much depressed,; had a long conversation with her on the follow-.&#xD;
ing morning; she said she was suffering intensely, both physically and&#xD;
mentally'; that she did not see onebray of light in the fu'ture;'that she&#xD;
was ruined, disgraced, with a child and without any means; .she said&#xD;
that no one except Mr. Glendenning ever made improper proposals; when&#xD;
I saw her heart-broken condition that morning I resolved that, if I ever&#xD;
had an opportunity to speak in her defence I would" do so; she was a&#xD;
fallen woman, but a woman still; she said she realizedher situation fully;&#xD;
she was in full possession of her senses during this statement; she spoke&#xD;
of threats made against her by Mr. Glendenning;, she said he asked Ifer&#xD;
to help hin out of his difficulty and he told her to do as he wished her&#xD;
(witness here detailed the pistol scene); on the night he compelle'd her&#xD;
to sign the document she said he placed her hand on the Bible and she&#xD;
solemnly swore she would never reveal either her condition or implicate&#xD;
him; she intended to keep that oath; this explained her words on the&#xD;
night of Mr. Glendenning's arrest-" Glen, I have deceived you, it is&#xD;
yours;" she said she did not think she could live, and added, "If I live,&#xD;
where am I ?" she said she would like to live to see Glendenning brought&#xD;
to justice; she always spoke of her own guilt first in her conversation on&#xD;
the subject.&#xD;
Q. When Mr. Poneroy said that Mr. Glendenning promised to stand&#xD;
by her, what did you understand by that? A. That he wonld take care&#xD;
of her till the time should come for him to marry her.&#xD;
Mrs. Reeves testified :-Knew Miss Pomeroy; she was of a very good&#xD;
character; have seen Mr. Glendenning visit at Mrs. Miller's very often;&#xD;
he went to see Miss Pomeroy in particular; she told me they were en-&#xD;
gaged; I asked her when the affair was coming off, and she said she did&#xD;
unot know herself; she showed me her engagement ring; she had it on&#xD;
her finger; she mentioned uo name when she said she was engaged.&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.                     55&#xD;
&#xD;
A TELL-TALE LETTER.&#xD;
Read a note from Mr. Glendenning. to Miss Pomeroy; she received&#xD;
t on the morning of the 12th of May last; there were not more than half&#xD;
a dozen lines in it; It read in this way, as near as I can recolle t:&#xD;
DEAR MARY. I wish you would be ready by half-past seven this evening, a d&#xD;
we will go either to New York or Jersey City. I want you to look your prettiest.&#xD;
Yours,&#xD;
GLEN.&#xD;
Am not sure whether it was "Your own Glen," or Yours, Glen.'"&#xD;
Witness then described the death bed-scene and continued:-Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning and Mary were at my children's christening; he was in the&#xD;
habit of taking her to different places frequently; she used to tell me she&#xD;
was out with him in the evenings at concerts  r for a walk; was in tLe&#xD;
church when a set of silver was presented to Mr. Glendenning; Mary&#xD;
and he and I were talking and I said, fully believing they were engaged,&#xD;
"They will beso nice to clean when you get married;" Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
replied, "That's so, Mrs. Reeves."&#xD;
Mrs. Fanny S. Birmingham   examined :-I knew Miss Pomeroy m-&#xD;
tihnately; never knew anything, against her character; I was on such&#xD;
intimate terms with her that I would have heard if anything of the kind&#xD;
were said about her; I called to. see her five days before her death and&#xD;
she said she was suffering both in mind and body; she saidit was hard&#xD;
that she should suffer and that Glen should go free; I asked her was&#xD;
Glendenning the father of the child and she said yes; she turned from&#xD;
side'to side and groaned.&#xD;
Mr. Cyrus Thatcher testified to the good character of Miss Pomeroy.&#xD;
He. had ample opportunity of judging, as he had teen connected with&#xD;
Mr. Miller in business for eight years; Miss Pomeroy always moved in&#xD;
good society.&#xD;
Mrs. Alvina Grattan, who was acquainted with, Miss Pomroy fof&#xD;
twelve years, also testified in her excellent character; Miss P omerov&#xD;
told witness that Mr. Glendenning was the father of herohild ; she spoke,&#xD;
as if she.thought a great deal of him ; she said she loved him dearly, and&#xD;
would as soon have doubted her saviour as have: doubted him; she used&#xD;
these very words; she did not speak of any one else.&#xD;
A discussion here took place on the question of admitting rebutting&#xD;
evidence for the prosecution. The defence resisted the proposition. The&#xD;
subject had not been decided wh-en the hour of adjournment arrived.&#xD;
The argument oh the question of admitting rebutting testimony on the&#xD;
part of the prosecution was resumed. Rev. Mr. Edwards urged in a&#xD;
forcible argument, that the prosecution haf a right to introduce new tes-&#xD;
timony. He regretted the declaration of Mr. Dodd, some days ago. that&#xD;
unless certain points were yielded he would be obliged to withdraw.&#xD;
"Now, Mr. Moderator," continued the speaker, ''This defendant cannot&#xD;
&#xD;
withdraw. He is in the hands of this Presbytery. If he should attempt,&#xD;
to relieve himself of his attendance before tihe Presbytery during the in-&#xD;
vestigation of these charges then tie Presbytery can cite him again, and&#xD;
if he refuse to appear we can depose him."&#xD;
Mr. Dodd here explained that when he made that statement he in-&#xD;
tended to convey simply that he intended to -withdraw as counsel for the&#xD;
defence.&#xD;
Mr. Edwards rejoined that when counsel makes a declaration of that&#xD;
kind it is always understood that his client is involved and responsible&#xD;
for the declaration.&#xD;
After a long debate the resolution offered by the prosecution in favor&#xD;
of the admission of rebutting testimony was laid on the table.&#xD;
Mr. Ira K. Miller, of Yonkers, examined-Knew-Miss Pomeroy since&#xD;
she was a baby; my acquaintance with her commenced in Ovid, N. Y.;&#xD;
never heard of a blemish in her character; my personal knowledge of her&#xD;
was that she was a pure, virtuous girl; I considered 'her a fit associate&#xD;
for my daughter, with whom she was intimately acquainted ; never saw&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning till to-day; I heard her frequently spoken of in Ovid&#xD;
and always in the highest terms, never heard -anything about her but&#xD;
what was good till this affair.&#xD;
Mrs. Mary Haskins, a nurse, testified-I was with Miss Pomeroy dur-&#xD;
ing her sickness; I told her on the Sunday before Mr. Glendenning's ar-&#xD;
Test that I was at church and saw Mr. Glendenning; she asked me how&#xD;
he looked and I said he looked good; (told her I was surprised. to find&#xD;
her in such a condition and she said she was surprised herself, as Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning had promised to make her his wife; she told nie that she&#xD;
never had criminal intimacy with any man but Mr. Glendenning and he&#xD;
-was the father of her child ; I asked her the date of her seduction and&#xD;
she told me July 3, 1873; the intimacy was continuous; she said that he&#xD;
told her that he had engaged a place in New York 1to put her in during&#xD;
vacation; he said he could not marry her just then, as his mother and&#xD;
his sister, and the congregation would not permit it.&#xD;
On cross-examination witness said-Miss Pomeroy frequently wished&#xD;
to see Mr.-Glendenning, but I laughed and said I did not think he woulai&#xD;
like to see her.&#xD;
Mr. Joseph F. Talson, a venerable-looking gentleman, testified-Knew&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy fifteen or sixteen years; she went to school with my chil-&#xD;
dren and I saw her every week since then ; she played the organ in the&#xD;
West- End church ; I never heard anything against her character;. I&#xD;
would suspect almost anybody else to be guilty of anything wrong rather&#xD;
than her -I saw her and Mr. Glendenning together on the 5th July in&#xD;
Broadway, at West End; when I came near them  he walked away; I&#xD;
Thought it was very strangeT; when I came up to where she was stand-&#xD;
ing I raised my hat and bowed to her, but she never spoke to me; I&#xD;

<pb  n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7473-00000029"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
thought it very-curious, as she always before spoke to me so pleasantly:&#xD;
she seemed to ba iii great distress; she was weepiing and holding he.&#xD;
handkerchief to her face; -Glendentnig walked off towards the Bergea&#xD;
church; when they saw me coming I saw him make a motion of his hand&#xD;
to her as much as to say, "you go that way and I'll go this way;" I&#xD;
thought it was very strange etiquette for a gentleman ; ten days after-&#xD;
wards I read in the papers of Mr. Glendennsng's arrest:&#xD;
On cross-examination the witness admitted that he was chairman-of the:&#xD;
indignation meeting; he was-called to take the chair by acclamation: he&#xD;
would occupy the same position to-morrow, because he was the father of&#xD;
children; he had no animosity against Mr. Glendenning; on the contrary&#xD;
he respected the man, because as a minister he was the representative of&#xD;
his heavenly Father; he loved the man but not his acts.&#xD;
Mr. Henry A. Hellerman, Postmaster of Hudson City examined-I&#xD;
have been engaged in this uhurch as manager of their music; saw Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning and Miss Pomeroy together on the Sunday evening before&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning's arrest; after evening service I went away, leaving the&#xD;
two together in the church; no one else remained; it was about nine&#xD;
o'clock in the evening; don't know how long they remained in the church,&#xD;
as I went 'directly home.&#xD;
Mrs. Nelly Gracestock examined-I live at No. 115 Eleventh street,'&#xD;
New York; I was engaged at the Infant Asylum, No. 24 Clinton place,.&#xD;
as housekeeker or matron; one evening a gentleman called at the house&#xD;
and saidhe wanted to get a friend into the institution; I asked him if he&#xD;
lived in the city and he said he did not';I referred him to Dr. Hubbard;.&#xD;
sometime afterwards Mrs. Miller and the brother of Miss Pomeroy came&#xD;
and inquired about the man who called; I described the man, and when&#xD;
she showed me the picture I said, "that is the man;" the likeness is per--&#xD;
fectly clear ; Mr. Glen -ening and several gentlemen came afterward&#xD;
and they had an interim I with the head nurse; the doctors told me to,&#xD;
have nothing to say about it, but now that I am out of the institution I&#xD;
have been advised to come out and tell all I know; Dr. Foster, one of'&#xD;
the head physicians, said to me, in relation to the matter, "Nelly, yog&#xD;
had better be careful, you might have to swear to it;" the first time Mr..&#xD;
Glendenning called he appeared to be very much agitated; I said to Dr.-&#xD;
Nicolls and the head nurse that Mr. Glendenning and his friends were&#xD;
down stairs; no one told me who he was.&#xD;
Cross-examined-It was about the Ist of July when the gentleman&#xD;
called; it was near dusk. the second time he called I had not yet known&#xD;
his.name; Mrs. Miller had showA me the picture, but she never told me-&#xD;
his name; Dr. Foster told me to say nothing about it, as it was a house&#xD;
where they kept secrets, and they did not want to have them divulged;&#xD;
ince I left the institution one of the attending physicians, Dr. Elisha&#xD;
&#xD;
Harris, of the Board of health advised me to come over and tell what I&#xD;
knew about it.&#xD;
Dr. Eddy-Is that gentleman present? A. Yes sir; there he is (point-&#xD;
ing her sunshade directly at Glendenning,-who was sitting about twelve&#xD;
feet off facing her). The answer was follow d by applause front the spec-&#xD;
tators, continuing for several seconds.&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Imbrie )rotested against the demonstration and said the pros-&#xD;
vcution disclaimed sympathy with any such interruption.&#xD;
In answer to- another question witness stated:-"I looked over there,&#xD;
particularly when I entered the churbh, because I recognized Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning at once. I did not know that I would meet him here."&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Imbrie announced that the prosecution rested their case here.&#xD;
They might find it necessary to introduce new witnesses in the rebutting&#xD;
testimony, and he would asl the Presbytery for permission to do so when&#xD;
the time should arrive.&#xD;
THE DEFENCE.&#xD;
The defence offered their case without preface or statement by intro.&#xD;
ducing Miss Jennie Dog ett' as the first witness. She testified-I am a,&#xD;
member of the Prospect a enue church; was acquainted with Miss Pom-&#xD;
croy; had a conversation with her during the summer of 1873 about a.&#xD;
report concerning Mr. Glendenning and herself; she told me at there&#xD;
'was no more between her and Mr. Glendenning than there was ,between&#xD;
him and me;' she wore an amethyst ring.&#xD;
Cross-examined-I asked her if that was her engagement ring, And&#xD;
she said no; that it was given her by her cousin; did not notice both&#xD;
her hands; she might have had a ring on the other band without my&#xD;
seeing it.&#xD;
Miss Hannah L. Brown examined-Am a member of this church; had&#xD;
a conversation with Miss Pomeroy in regard, to her relations with Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning; in the first part of last December she showed mne an aine-&#xD;
thyst ring%; I asked her was this her engagement ring, and she said no,&#xD;
tha she never had such a thing and was not engaged.&#xD;
O   cross-examination witness, testified-The, reason I had for asking&#xD;
her whether that was her engagement ring was that there wi a )re-&#xD;
valent talk around here that she and Mr. Glendenning were engaged ;&#xD;
thought by her actions that she wanted to force herself upon Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning; he (lid not want to show her any attention.&#xD;
Q. How do vou know that?   A. (a long pause)-She used to stay in&#xD;
the church after service; this was only a conclusion in my own mind;,&#xD;
had personal knowledge of Miss Pomeroy's remaining, but had no per-&#xD;
-sonal knowledge of Mr.-Glendenning's remaining.&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Ellen Cairns testified-Ain a member of this church; Miss Pomn-&#xD;
eroy was asked by me to join a young lady's society and she joined it;&#xD;
two or three months afterward she denied that she had joined it; I in-&#xD;
trusted her with the sale of tickets for a concert and she said she sold&#xD;
Them allI, when she came to make returns she said she had sold none:&#xD;
in both these instances she was decidedly untruthful I think it was&#xD;
MIss P1oiieroy that sought Mr. Glendenning- I said on one occasion in&#xD;
Mrs. Agnes Miller's that Mary ought not to throw herself so much in&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning's way, and that if she took this advice the thing would&#xD;
1rop; I have a verv high estimate of Mr. Glendenning's character; I&#xD;
nvver thought he would push himself into the societyof young ladies-,&#xD;
he was agreable to ladies and pleasant.&#xD;
Cross-examin d- Iiss Pomeroy was a member of good standing in&#xD;
this church ; she laid herself too much in Mr. -Glendenning's way; Mr.&#xD;
Glenlenning never told me that Miss Pomeroy's attentions were unpleas-&#xD;
ant to hinm, nor did I ever hear that he intimated so to any one else ; nevet&#xD;
had any doubt about her giving in the money; we knew that what she&#xD;
collected she would give in.&#xD;
Hoiace Dean testified:-Aim a member of this church; have beop&#xD;
superintendent of theSunday school for a year; Miss Pomeroy was one&#xD;
of the teachers; there was nothing in Mr. Glendenning's conduct toward&#xD;
her more than to any other lady, but she took every opportunity to throw&#xD;
herself in his way; when he and I would be going out of the church she&#xD;
would vi4ylay us; I use the word waylay because it amounted to just&#xD;
that; my opinion of Mr. Glendenning is that I would not be afraid to&#xD;
leave him in company with my wife or daughter. (Laughter.)\ His&#xD;
conversation was as pure as that of any woman could be. (Renewed&#xD;
laughter, which was quickly.suppressed.)&#xD;
Cross-examined-Other young ladies passed out of the church, but she&#xD;
renaine(l ; I knew positively there was no engagement between them.&#xD;
Q. How did you know?    A. I knew that such a thing was not pos&#xD;
sible. (Laughter.)&#xD;
Q. Tell us why you did not think it possible. A. I would rather not&#xD;
state the reason at present; I was very intimate with Mr. Glendenning,&#xD;
yet I knaw little-or nothing of his inner life; Miss Pomeroy was not at-&#xD;
tractive in any way, either in education, manner or ability; Mr. Glen.&#xD;
donning permitted her approaches because he could not well help him-&#xD;
self. (Laughter.)  He took measures some time ago to prevent her ad-&#xD;
vances.&#xD;
Q. What were those measures? A. I do not wish to state them now,&#xD;
if you will excuse me. (Laughter.)  The witness threw out all manMier&#xD;
of insinuations and evaded direct answers to nearly every question.&#xD;
Miss Mara-aret J. Munroe examined-Am a member of this church;&#xD;
knew Miss Ponmeroy for three years; she spoke of Mr. Glendenningr as&#xD;
&#xD;
kig kimd to her ; she said that one occasion she contrived to e at the&#xD;
Post Office when he -got there for his letters; she showed me her watch&#xD;
and chain; she said she bought the chain herself; on the 5th of June&#xD;
last she told, me that the neighbors thought she was engaged, but that&#xD;
she was not; she said she was very badly treated by her cousin, and&#xD;
that she worked like a slave; I remarked that she ought not to be afraid&#xD;
of her cousin, and she answered, "Oh, you don't know; he is a very un-&#xD;
On cross-examination witness stated that she suspected Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
was throwing herself in Mr. Glendenning's way, because she used to re-&#xD;
main in the church after service;  he often remarked to her that it was&#xD;
disgraceful ion her part to be following him so.&#xD;
How did you know she was throwing herself in his way? A. Be-&#xD;
cause I was in the church and saw her remain.&#xD;
Were you, than, not suspected (laughter)? A. Well, I don't know as&#xD;
I was; I could not make a companion of her because I thought she was&#xD;
too bold; don't know what the opinion was in this community as to her&#xD;
reputation.&#xD;
Dr. Smith Bartley testified-I am a member of this church; visited&#xD;
the foundling asylum in Clinton place for the purpose of ascertaining&#xD;
whether Mr. Glendenning was the man who called there; I was ascom-&#xD;
4    panied by the Rev. Mr Moore, Mr. Glendenning and Mr. Jewell; I had&#xD;
known Dr. Hubbard a great many yetrs, and therefore I called on him at&#xD;
that institution ; I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Glendenning before,&#xD;
and he said he'had not, but he would not swear to it; we called on Mrs.&#xD;
Graystock, and Mr. Moore asked her if she had ever seen that man be--&#xD;
fore, and she said no; we supposed we were speaking to Mrs. Graystock&#xD;
but we were mistaken; we then sent for Mrs. Graystock, but she would&#xD;
not see us.&#xD;
The defence then offered in evidence a certificate signed by Dr. Hub-&#xD;
bard that he had not to his knowledge seen Mr. Glendenning previous to&#xD;
his visit with the foregoing witness.&#xD;
Mr. C. C. Jewell, examined-Called on Dr. Hubbard in reference to a&#xD;
statement in an evening paper concerning Mr. Glendenning's visit to the&#xD;
asylum in Clinton place; he pronounced the statement to be a mass of&#xD;
inaccuracies, and he drew his pencil through several passages.&#xD;
Dr. Dodd proceeded to read the mutilated article remarking as he went&#xD;
along what particular passages were scored. Dr. Imbrie asked how much&#xD;
of what was read was scored. Dr. Dodd said that it made no sense and&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie quickly rejoined: "Oh, but it makes very good sense."&#xD;
(Laughter.)&#xD;
The witness simply rehearsed the interview with Dr. Hybbard and the&#xD;
nurse at the asylum.&#xD;

&#xD;
lev. W. L. Moore testified:-I visited the foundling Asylum in Clin-&#xD;
ton place for the purpose of ascertaining from Dr. Hubbard whether an&#xD;
article published in regard to Mr. Vilendenning's visit there wArs true; the&#xD;
Doctor made a correction on two pieces of paper-furnished by Mr. Jewell;&#xD;
I saw the nurse and showed her the article, asking her if she was the&#xD;
person referred to in it; she ansverred no; that it referred to the matron;&#xD;
we sent for the matron, but she sent word that she declined to see us;&#xD;
Dr. Hubbard was not distinctly asked if he could identify Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
Uing; his answer was, "I never saw that man before."&#xD;
Dr. Dodd here stated that the defence had very great difficulty in pro-&#xD;
euring the attendance of witnesses.  One gentleman, whose business&#xD;
presses upon him in? New York, stated that he could attend only in the,&#xD;
evening. A young lady, whose testimony was important, refused to&#xD;
come at all.&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Edwards-Is she a member of the church ?&#xD;
Dr. Dodd-Yes.&#xD;
Dr. Edwards-Then our duty is plain.&#xD;
The Moderator-It would be very hard to turn a modest, diffident girl&#xD;
out of the church because she refuses to come here and testify.&#xD;
Dr. Edwards-It is a clear case of conscience, sir, to which we cannot&#xD;
yiell                                                          L&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Edwards stated that 'the young lady whose testimony was&#xD;
so eagerly sought by the defence had disappeared and refused to testify.&#xD;
Rev. Dr. 'Riggs proceeded to cross-examine the Rev. Mr. Moore  The&#xD;
witness was also placed in the crucible by Mr. Edwards. In answer to&#xD;
the questiou how he came to meet Mr. Glendenning in New York when&#xD;
they were going to the infant Asylum he answered that. he knew where&#xD;
to find him in New York, as he had visited him there before.&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Imbrie, one of the prosecuting committee, was the next wit..&#xD;
ness called for the defence. He testified that he visited the asylum in&#xD;
Clinton place for the purpose of securing the attendance of the nurse as&#xD;
a witness; he thought he could induce the officers of the institution to&#xD;
permit the nurse to come without infringing on any of their rules; Mrs.&#xD;
Wetmore told him that the nurse was gone from the institution and that&#xD;
she was a very gossipy woman ; he made a strong appeal to the phy-,&#xD;
sicians in view of the great importance of the issues involved in the case,&#xD;
but they were inflexible. stating that the rules of the institution must be&#xD;
preserved ; the witness further asked Mrs. Wetmore if she would have&#xD;
any objection to.come over and testify to the character of the nurse, as it&#xD;
was of the greatest importance that the question should be settled;- she&#xD;
answered, however, that she did not like publicity, and she knew her&#xD;
name would get into the papers if she- did so. The physicians infornied&#xD;
him that the nurse was not sent away on account of this matter. -During&#xD;
the progress of the trial the prosecuring committee obtained information 2&#xD;
&#xD;
61&#xD;
&#xD;
as to her whereabouts in New York and they brought her forward. She&#xD;
volunteered to come and testify in the case. They told her that they&#xD;
wanted her simply to tell the truth. The prosecuting committee never&#xD;
saw her till within two hours before she came on the stand to testify.&#xD;
She came directly from Mr. Metz's house, just at the time when the pros-&#xD;
ecuting committee were about giving up all hope of seeing her.&#xD;
Mrs. Glendenning, mother of the accused pastor, was the next witness.&#xD;
She walked into the church leaning on the arm of the Rev. Mr..Wall.&#xD;
She appeared very weak and nervous, having just recovered from illness.&#xD;
She testified:-My son was born in Western Pennsylvania, seven miles&#xD;
from Pittsburg, in 1849; he is not accustomed to be out in the evenings&#xD;
my daughter was accustomed to accompany him to and from the church;&#xD;
he was out as late as teen or eleven, but not often; my daughter or my-&#xD;
self invariably waited up for him; never knew hinr to be out alone as&#xD;
late as one or two o'clock; he was out late with my daughter at parties;&#xD;
knew that he called on Miss Pomeroy sometimes; his salary is $2000;&#xD;
be keeps hous nd supports his family; he has many other expenses,&#xD;
such as purch sing books, so that his means, are limited; he did not&#xD;
have much idea of the value of money; he was too free ; did not think&#xD;
much of his giving presents to Miss Pomeroy, as she was our organist&#xD;
4and a poor girl.&#xD;
What is your opinion regarding his insight into female character?,&#xD;
A. I think he don't know much about it. (Laughter.) The witness ac-&#xD;
counted for his whereabouts on last New Year's Day, Thanksgiving,&#xD;
and at other times important to the defence. She-said that on the 4th&#xD;
of July 1814,-he was at home 'Most of.the day; that he went out in the&#xD;
afternoon and soon came back and took his sister to the fireworks.&#xD;
Witness continued-They returned home about nine o'clock; he after-&#xD;
wards took a walk up the street on an errand for us, but did not stay&#xD;
long; he has a pistol, but he did not often carry it ;_ he did not carry it&#xD;
June 1, anid July 16 of this year; at night he wouldlay it on a chair be.&#xD;
side his bed to frighten anyone who might come in; I saw it on the chair&#xD;
and it was pointed to his head, some clothes having been thrown on the&#xD;
chir; I got frightened and took the pistol and locked it up; I kept it in&#xD;
my possession.&#xD;
The witness here detailed a conversation with Miss Clinton, which&#xD;
was simply impugning the character of the Miller family and Miss Pom-&#xD;
eroy, but she would relate no specific charge. The prosecution objected&#xD;
on the' ground ' that in a matter involving the reputation of the Miller&#xD;
family they should have Miss Clinton herself examined. As she had&#xD;
refused to appear and testify in the church a commission should be ap..&#xD;
pointed to take her testimony:-.Messrs. Eddy Marshall, Booth, Fisher,&#xD;
Waterbury' and Halsey were appointed.&#xD;
Cross-examined--...Don't think my son ever complainedd to me about&#xD;

62                   POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy endeavoring to attract his attention ; never knew him to&#xD;
make any presents to Miss Mary Pomeroy except the locket; if he went&#xD;
often to see her I would know it, as I always found him a truthful boy;&#xD;
believe I know hQw he spent all his money; did not think there was any&#xD;
imprudence on the part of a minister making presents to a members of his&#xD;
congregation; heard a rumor of my son's being engaged to Miss Pom-&#xD;
eroy; did-not believe it to be true; he told my they were not engaged.&#xD;
Q. Will you state from your own knowledge whether he was never -&#xD;
out late without your knowing it, or, in other words, can you recall every&#xD;
evening from the 1st of January last? A. I can say positively he was&#xD;
not out alone a single hight during that time; did not know anything&#xD;
about Miss Pomeroy's character; but I thought she was a very bold girl;&#xD;
saw her walk with gentlemen; I knew two of them; heard other things&#xD;
about.her that I did not like; thought she was very impudent to young&#xD;
gentlemen.&#xD;
Dr. Riggs' two-edged querry. Q. How is it, then, that you did not&#xD;
think it improper foryour son to make her presents? A. (with hesitation)&#xD;
I did not-well,1I did not see much about it; often told him that if he&#xD;
could not come out of the church without being subjected to annoyance&#xD;
by her I did not see how he could get along at all.&#xD;
Miss Agnes N. Clinton testiled:-Mr. Glendenning visited me one&#xD;
Saturday evening at the house of, my cousin, Mrs. Agnes Miller; while&#xD;
he was talking to me in the parlor Miss Pomeroy was standing outside&#xD;
on the stoop; Mr. Miller went to the door and saw her at the window&#xD;
looking in through the blinds; she showed me her watch and she said&#xD;
she bought it herself in New York; she told me there was no connection&#xD;
between her and Mr. Glendenning; she said this in presence of Mrs.&#xD;
Agnes Miller; Miss Pomeroy was not pretty; she had not many gentle-&#xD;
men admiirers; don't think she ever kept company with any one but Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning.&#xD;
Q. Did you ever state to Mrs. Glendenning that the Miller family was&#xD;
a bad family ? A. I never did.&#xD;
Q. Did you ever say that Miss Pomeroy was as bad as any of them&#xD;
A. Never. (Movement among the audience.)    The prosecuting com-&#xD;
mittee smiled at this valuable piece of information furnished so mag-&#xD;
nanimously by a fitness for the defence.&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie:-Miss Clinton, did you evei find TMr. Glendenning and&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy alone in the church ? A. Yes, sir, I came into the church&#xD;
one Sabbath after. the Sabbath school had been dismissed, and while I&#xD;
was talking yith Miss Poneroy Mr. Glendenning came out of the-parlor&#xD;
and said he had been asleep; I said it must have been a short nap, bur&#xD;
I doubted it.; he said he did not know so many people had left the church&#xD;
en the following day be told me he did know, so I found him out in a lie&#xD;
(laughter); I went away from the church, leaving Mr. Glendenning and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="64 (Illustration) -65" xml:id="VAC7473-00000033"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.                      65&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy alone; I saw him go into Mr. Miller's one evening;.he&#xD;
Aid not know I saw him; next day he told me, he was not there at all;&#xD;
I told him I saw 1iin, so I found him out again (laughter).&#xD;
Q. What was your opinion of Mr. Glendenning? A. \I loved him~as&#xD;
my pastor.&#xD;
And what of Miss Ponieroy? A. She was a perfect lady.&#xD;
Q. Did it ever, appear to you that Miss Pomeroy was obtruding her-&#xD;
self on Mr. Glendenning? A. Well, at first I kind of thought so, but&#xD;
when I saw him wait on her in the parlor and walk through the street&#xD;
with her then I began to think that Mr. Glendenning wanted to see her&#xD;
as much as she wanted to see him. (Laughter.)&#xD;
Q, Do you attend this church ? A. No, sir; I thought I would stay&#xD;
away till this thing was settled up; I would not come to testify here, nor&#xD;
have anything to say in the case only for the testimony Mrs. Glendenning&#xD;
gave to-day; heard that Mr. Glendenning and Miss Pomeroy used to be&#xD;
together in ice cream saloons. (Laughter.)&#xD;
The witness was subjected to a severe'eross-examination.&#xD;
Mrs. Caroline Wetmore testified :-I an head of several committees in&#xD;
charge of thej Clinton Place Nursery, New York; there has been no&#xD;
matron in the asylum; Mrs. Greystock was a servant there; she was a&#xD;
poor, friendless woman, who was taken in as an inmate; when her child&#xD;
died she was employed as a wet -nurse at $8 per month; she filled that&#xD;
position about six months; she attended the door and did the errands; I&#xD;
-enjoined silence on her with regard to the transactions occurring in the&#xD;
establishment. The remainder of her testimony was devoted to the con-&#xD;
tradiction of "Nelly's" statements, as witness styled the nurse. The&#xD;
witness said that she was very careful in her conversation with Mrs.&#xD;
Metz, as there were so many mis-statements in the papers about the case&#xD;
she was very cautious what she would say to Jersey City people.&#xD;
(Laughter.)  She cautioned "Nelly" not to see any Jersey City people,&#xD;
and not to come over to testify on either side of the case; but, though&#xD;
she cautioned her repeatedly, she knew she would come. (Laughter.)&#xD;
She was satisfied that "Nelly " knew nothing at all about this case, but&#xD;
manufactured her statements. (Laughter.) "Nelly" was a pure vir-&#xD;
tuous woman, but very untruthful. . (Laughter.) The witness protested&#xD;
:so much and rattled off her testimony so volubly that there were repeated&#xD;
manifestations of merriment among the audience. One(sentence was par-&#xD;
ticularly relished:. "I could tell you from here till to-morrow (stretching&#xD;
out her arms in a gesture of astonishment) of the story telling of that&#xD;
woman."   B ut when she was relating her experiences of the three classes&#xD;
of females with whom she came in contact at the asylum and the state-&#xD;
mnents of such persons .regarding the authors of their ruin, she dropped .&#xD;
one sentence which elicted a loud expression of horror from the audiene&#xD;
.56&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7473-00000034"/>&#xD;
$8- .                 POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
as the object and venom were too palpable. "My experience is that in'&#xD;
cases where a woman takes an oath as to the father of her illegitimate&#xD;
child that must be her second child." This reply seemed to astound even&#xD;
the committee for the defence, and Dr. Dodd announced that he had no&#xD;
more questions to ask. The witness, however, was not to be disposed,&#xD;
of so easily, for she followed with thi explanation: "I*once knew a girl&#xD;
who told me on her dying bed that she was going into eternity with a&#xD;
lie on  her lips; that she would rather lie and lose her soul than betray&#xD;
her friend; and I know she did so die, for she had an object in view, and&#xD;
when a woman has an object in view'she-well, she generally accom-&#xD;
plishes it." (Sensation.)  "Nelly " told her that when Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
called at the asylum he had his hat pulled down on his eyes, but she did&#xD;
not.believe her. (Laughter.) The witness pointed at Glendenning with&#xD;
her umbrella and said that she recognized him the moment he entered&#xD;
the church from a photograph which the Rev. Mr. Moore showed her at&#xD;
the Clinton place institution. This was followed by anothe- movement&#xD;
among the audience, and it began to appear as if the- defence could not,&#xD;
prevent her from telling a little too much. The most humorous state-&#xD;
ment was that "Nelly," when she went out, alwayssaid she had been&#xD;
to Mrs. Wetmore's, and the girls said I must have been bored to death..&#xD;
Mrs. Morford, another of the ladies in. the Clinton place institution,&#xD;
testified that Mrs. Greystock was very unreliable and untruthful; she&#xD;
told witness about a gentleman calling at the institution with reference&#xD;
to the admission of a young girl; he had his hat over his face; Mrs.&#xD;
Greystock never told witness, however, about it till after Mrs. Miller&#xD;
had called. On cross-examination she was asked what was Mrs. Wet-&#xD;
more's estimate of "Nelly's" character, and the witness replied. "Why,'&#xD;
she thought 'Nelly' was perfect." (Laughter.) Here was a direct con-&#xD;
tradiction of the previous witness.&#xD;
Dr. Dodd asked for )the appointment of a commission to take the tes.&#xD;
tinony of Mrs. Middleton, No. 313 West Thirty fifth street. The, Rev.&#xD;
Dr. Eddy, Rev. Mr. Egbert and Rev. Mr. Martin were appointed. The'&#xD;
defence had expected other witnesses, and as they were not in attendance,&#xD;
the Presbytery adjourned.&#xD;
Dr. Hubbard, of the Clinton place Asylum testified that a young man&#xD;
made application for the admission of a young girl who, he said, was in&#xD;
trouble; he told the man to call next day, but he did not come; he ad-&#xD;
mitted that he said a man bearing the description given by Mrs. Miller&#xD;
the man was dark, but now that he had come to think he would say he&#xD;
was of a light complexion; the man who called did not state where he or&#xD;
the young girl lived.&#xD;
Mr. Seth Wilbur Payne, editor of the Daily Press, of Jersey City, tes'&#xD;
tified :-I called on Myr. J. S. Miller to obtain information in regard to&#xD;
this case; Mrs. Miller stated to me that Mr. Glendenning was the&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.                      67&#xD;
author of Miss Pomeroy's trouble, and that Miss Pomeroy was forced by&#xD;
extreme means to tell who brought her into trouble; Mrs. Miller said she&#xD;
threatened to lock her up if she did not tell; she said that Miss Pomerov&#xD;
repeatedly denied afterwards that Mr. Glendenning was the father of her&#xD;
child; this conversation took place the evening after Miss Pomeroy's&#xD;
death;MiMrs. Miller spoke about thepistol scene; sie said that Mary had&#xD;
denied it; in telling the story Mrs. Miller acted it pretty well.&#xD;
Cross-examined.--I came away from the house with the impression&#xD;
that Mr. Miller did not believe the story of the pistol scene; had a con--&#xD;
versation with Mr. Glendenning in regard to the affair; he said he had&#xD;
nothing to give to the public just then about it; could not swear to Mrs.&#xD;
Miller's exact language.&#xD;
Miss Mary Glendenning, sister of the accused pastor, testified:--I have&#xD;
always resided with my brother; he is accustomed generally to spend his&#xD;
evenings at home and to escort me to and from church; knew that he&#xD;
was out one night with a college friend till after one o'clock; have been&#xD;
vut vith him as late as one o'clock; one of us generally sat up for him&#xD;
till be came home; on the evening of July 4, 1873, be was at home. till&#xD;
the afternoon. The witness was interrogated as to the whereabouts of&#xD;
her brother on certain days and the kind of clothing he wore during last&#xD;
summer.&#xD;
Cross-examination....-Don't know how many evenings in the week my&#xD;
brother would be at home; he was usually out four evenings in the week;&#xD;
he attended the choir meetings; he visited much during the winter, and&#xD;
I understood he visited as a pastor; his visits were mostly in the evien-&#xD;
ing; lately he has not made any pastoral calls and very few social calls;&#xD;
heard reports among the congregation that my brother was engaged to&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy; always felt confident that he was not; he said he was&#xD;
not; think that he avoided her as she was annoying him; never knew..&#xD;
that he made presents to her, but heard that be did so; when I spoke to&#xD;
him about his intimacy with her he said that he did not think she meant&#xD;
any harm; she forced herself, in my opinion, on his notice so that he&#xD;
could scarcely avoid her.&#xD;
During the cross-examination Rev. Mr. Harkness undertook to call&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie to order, but the latter gentleman retorted promptly and Mr.&#xD;
Hlarkness subsided.&#xD;
Mr. Robert Wells testified to the ability, assiduity and general good&#xD;
character of Mr. Glendenning 'at a pastor; he considered him superior&#xD;
to many pastors. Great inducements ivere held out for him to go to&#xD;
other congregations at a larger salary than he received here; the feeling&#xD;
among the congregation was that he was entirely innocent ot the charges&#xD;
against him; the trustees, elders and deacons held meetings, on two or&#xD;
-three occasions, and took a vote, when Mr. Glendenning was pronounced&#xD;
innocent of all these charges.-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7473-00000035"/>&#xD;
68.-POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
Cross-examinod.-Never investigated the charges against Mr. Glen,-&#xD;
xenning; pronounced him innocent without hearing any of the testimony,&#xD;
on the other side; knew very little of his habits of visiting; he might&#xD;
have been escorted from church by a person without my knowing it.,&#xD;
The defence asked, for the appointment of a commission to take the&#xD;
testimony of Mr. William S. Purdy, of Fairmount avenue, and Messrs.&#xD;
Goodman, French and iflsey were appointed.&#xD;
Ar. James Dunne, one of the elders of the church, was recalled. He&#xD;
testified to the same points as Mr. Wells. Dr. Burdett told him that&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy was wandering in her mind. This contradictory testimony&#xD;
created a stir; for it will the remembered that Dr. .Burdett denied this&#xD;
most emphatically, under oath, in an early stage of the case. This wit-&#xD;
ness was a firm believer in Mr. Glendenning's innocence, and would on&#xD;
no account credit the engagement-of-marriage story.&#xD;
A policeman was stationed outside the church during the session at&#xD;
the request of the elders of the church.&#xD;
The proceedings on the 17th day were opened with prayer by the Rev.&#xD;
Mr.sGoodman. Mr. James Dunne, one of the elders of the church, was&#xD;
tben 'cross-examined by the Rev. Mr. Riggs, who was styled by the Mo.&#xD;
derator the "Methaphysician of court."  The witness testified :--.Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning made some pastoral calls on other than Monday rights;&#xD;
have been with him on some occasions; a large proportion of the com-&#xD;
munity think Mr. Glendenning guilty; at the joint meeting of trustees&#xD;
and deacons Miss Pomeroy's statement was not considered; the subject&#xD;
was discussed altogether probably on his; think all took part in that&#xD;
discussion; there was no difference of opinion; never saw Glendenning&#xD;
and Miss Pomeroy together alone; don't know that he visited her; 1&#xD;
called there once with him on Sunday school business; I do not know&#xD;
whether he made any pastoral calls on .her; I do not know positively that~&#xD;
h did.not visit her; last Thanksgiving evening I left him at half-past&#xD;
ine o'clock; I don't know his movetie its after that; there is no un-&#xD;
certainly in my mind that Dr. Burdett'used the word wandering instead&#xD;
of worriment as he testified; he spoke in an ordinary conversational tone,&#xD;
not subdued in the least; when I first heard of this transaction I was&#xD;
surprised that Mr. Glendenning was so charged; I know nothing against&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy; she was a member of the church in good standing; I was&#xD;
more surprised that Mr -Glendenning should be- so charged because I&#xD;
knew him better that I did Miss Pomeroy.&#xD;
To Mr. Marshall-I think Mr. Glendenning visited Miss Pomeroy to&#xD;
converse with her on religious subjects previous to her admission to the&#xD;
church; the rumor of the intimacy between Mr. Glendenning and Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy began after her admission to the church.&#xD;
To Mr. Wall-I should not have been surprised to see Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
iome out of, the Bible class room; should not be surprised if he took a&#xD;
short nap if the weather was warm.&#xD;
To Mr. Riggs-I can't say that Mr. Glendenning was in the habit -of&#xD;
taking naps;. I never knew him to take any.&#xD;
Mr. Marshall asked the witness if Mr. Glendenning made a statement&#xD;
to him that he knew of Miss Pomeroy's condition before it was divulged&#xD;
and had talked with her obout it.&#xD;
Counsel for both sides objected to the question, because that testimony&#xD;
would be secured from Mr. Glendenning himself.&#xD;
/The witness, after having been subjected to a severe cross-examination,&#xD;
was allowed to retire. Mr. J. Smith Miller applied for warrants for the&#xD;
arrest of some of the witnesses for the defence on the eharge of perjury.&#xD;
In consequence of the death of a relative of the Rev. Mr. Dodd the&#xD;
session was adjourned till the next Wednesday.- The testimony of Miss&#xD;
Agnes Clinton is not yet complete, and she wil be called to give rebdt-&#xD;
ting testimony. Her knowledge of the case will throw light on many&#xD;
points which now remain in doubt. It is very singular that.Mr. Jones,&#xD;
a brother of Mrs. Miller, has not been called by the defence, though'be&#xD;
i in daily attendance. He expresses his determination to vindicate his&#xD;
character from the aspersions cast upon it before the case closes.&#xD;
A. H. Demotte testified that Glendenning was at his residence on the&#xD;
4th of July, 1873, and that he saw him afterward play croquet at Mr.,&#xD;
Miller's.&#xD;
A report of the proceedings at the indignation meeting was offered ii&#xD;
evidence. Letters from professors'and classmates in the colleges where&#xD;
Glendenning studied were also offered. They bore testimony to his godd&#xD;
character. One of these stated that it would take nothing liss than re-&#xD;
velation to convince the writer of Glendenning's guilt. A letter, vindi--&#xD;
cating the character of Mrs. Wetmore for truthfulness, was objected to&#xD;
by Dr. Edwards on the ground that her veracity had not beei assailed&#xD;
in the Presbytery. The Moderator and Mr. Dodd conteided that she&#xD;
had been attacked in the newspapers.&#xD;
The letter was finally withdrawn.&#xD;
The testimony of -William B. Purdy, taken before a commission, was&#xD;
read. It set forth that he saw Mary Pomeroy wear a ring and she said&#xD;
it was not her engagement ring; the witness knew her in Ovid, N. Y.;&#xD;
her character was very good; he never knew her to tell a lie.&#xD;
Samuel B.:Brown's testimony was read. It impeached the testimony&#xD;
of Mr. Randall, with whom Mr. Brown had a co versation regarding the&#xD;
indignation meeting. Mr. Randall showed a deci d feeling against Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning, saying Miss Pomeroy's friends had plen ,of' money to get&#xD;
justice. Witness replied that Mr. Glendenning had a fe friends left yet,&#xD;
and they would not let him be crowded down&#xD;
Mr. Wall for the defence stated that they had endeavored to procure&#xD;

I0                    POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
the attendance of Mrs. Middleton, a most important witness, but her hus-&#xD;
oand refused to permit her presence, as so many comments had been&#xD;
made about witnesses in the newspapers. Her testimony would contra-&#xD;
dict that of Nelly Greystock in regard to the visit of Mr. Glendenning to&#xD;
the asylum. Mr. Wall was then allowed to take the stand to testify to&#xD;
the statements Mrs. Middleton made to him at No. 119 Lexitigton ave-,&#xD;
iie, She said that she came'to the asylum on the evening of the 6th of&#xD;
July; it was her custom to spend the evening after tea in the front par-&#xD;
1Mr with Nelly Greystock; no young man called at that time, nor any-&#xD;
thing near that time; it was impossible that the bell could be rung with,.&#xD;
opt her knowing it.  On cross-examination Mr. Wall said that Mrs.&#xD;
Middleton was not under oath when she made those statements.&#xD;
Glendenning took the stand and there was a breeze among the audience.&#xD;
Ile testified:-My name is John Stuart Glendenning; I am pastor of this&#xD;
church and am the person involved in this charge; was born near Pitts-&#xD;
burg, Pa ; moved from there to Cannonsburg, in the same State, for the&#xD;
purpose of attending college; remained there five years; came thence to&#xD;
Princeton for the purpose of attending the theological school at the col-&#xD;
lege; remained there three years; removed to Jersey City; lived all the&#xD;
time with my mother aind sister; knew Miss Pomeroy; my acquaintance'&#xD;
with her commenced as a member of this church; visited her at Mr. Mil-&#xD;
ler's; there was no particular evening; my first visits were on Saturday&#xD;
evenings; stayed usually half an hour; my acquaintance began in the&#xD;
-spring of 1872; could not say how late I stayed when I visited her; some-&#xD;
times long and sometimes short; can't tell the date when my visits be-&#xD;
came more frequent than on Saturday evenings; have been there as late&#xD;
as eleven o'clock, but never was there as late as one o'clock; when Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy was about joining the church; she was a long time in doubt as&#xD;
to that step;' that doubt was based on her relations with the family -with&#xD;
whom she lived; I encouraged her and told her as long as I was con-.&#xD;
nected with the church she should never want a friend; she was in doubt&#xD;
about two months; made her presents, a locket, earrings, sleeve buttons,&#xD;
locket, chain and others that I don't remember; they were given in returD&#xD;
for presents she made-to me; the first she gave me was a shaving case,*&#xD;
never gave her a plain gold ring; never saw her wear one,&#xD;
Q. Did you ever give her a gold watch ? A. hesitatingg) No, sir, I&#xD;
never made her a present of a watch; I paid $45 for it; she paid me $15&#xD;
on account; she said she expected money from her cousin to pay the ba-&#xD;
huce; never was engaged to marry Miss Pomeroy; never had criminal&#xD;
intercourse with her; 'never solicited her. He then proceeded to account&#xD;
for his whereabouts last New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day, 4th of July,'&#xD;
1873; on the latter day left Mr. Miller's house about seven o'clock; went&#xD;
home and remained there.&#xD;
Q When did you first hear of Miss Pomeroy's condition? A. On the&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
.4&#xD;
&#xD;
.71&#xD;
&#xD;
5th of July; she was standing at the organ when she handed me a letter;&#xD;
I asked her the meaning of it; she said "keep it, ydu may need it; there&#xD;
is something awful at the back of this;1" she said if I would call next&#xD;
,evening (Monday) she would explain it; she said she would go away on&#xD;
the morning after that (Thuesday), and she had written the letter in an-&#xD;
ticipation of her going away; first showed her note to a gentleman on&#xD;
the morning after my arrest.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd then produced the mysterious letter, so long expected in the&#xD;
-community, stating that he would not offer it in evidence till a later stagel&#xD;
of the case. It runs as follows:&#xD;
JULY 7, 1874.&#xD;
Mir DEAR COUsTN.-I wish to say to you in this note I would not&#xD;
tell you while talking to you for fear you would get angry with me.&#xD;
I have deceived you all along in regard to Mr. Glendenning. telling&#xD;
you things that never had any ground of truth in them, in order to&#xD;
satisfy your curiosity when you questioned me and prevent any dif-&#xD;
ficulty between us; and this is the reason I never wished you to go&#xD;
to him in regard to the matter. He made a friend of me for no evil&#xD;
purpose, but because he thought I was trying to lead a good life and&#xD;
needed sympathy; and never has he by word or deed showed him-&#xD;
self other than a true Christiangentleman, which he is. Even when&#xD;
I could bear it no longer and tld him how bad I was and how I de-&#xD;
ceived him, though surprised and grieved at, my story, he did not&#xD;
scorn me, but tried again; and now I ask you to forgive me for de-&#xD;
ceiving you as I did, and hope you will show him in some way that&#xD;
you know the true state of the case.              MARY.&#xD;
Between the words "tried" and "again," toward the close of this letter-,&#xD;
there is plainly a portion omitted.&#xD;
Glendenning admitted that a part. of the sheet was detached in the&#xD;
lawyer's office. When it falls into the hands of the "Methaphysician of&#xD;
the Court " it will be made the subject of the minutest investigation. If&#xD;
the testimony for the prosecution be true this is the paper which Mary&#xD;
Pomeroy signed when a pistol was placed to her head, and to which she&#xD;
alluded in her dying statement.&#xD;
Witness continued-I handed the letter back to her and she returned&#xD;
it to me; she made a confession to me four or five weeks before; the ex-&#xD;
pression in the letter that she could bear it no longer explained that con-&#xD;
'ession; she had deceived me regarding her mode of life; I had received&#xD;
several anonymous communications from persons concerning her, and as&#xD;
her pastor I called on her for explanation ; first knew that she accused&#xD;
me on the evening of the 15th of last July, from a friend here at the&#xD;
church; he told me that an affidavit had been made at Justice Aldridge's&#xD;
charging me with bastardy, and that arrangements had been made to ar-&#xD;
Test me that night; I told him that I could not believe Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
would ever sign such an affidavit as that; Officer Benson came 'to me&#xD;
'that night and in private conversation told me that there was a young&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
lady up the street in trouble, and that I had better go and marry her or&#xD;
settle up the matter fn some way; I told him that was impossible; he&#xD;
then told me he had a warrant for ie; I went with him to Mr. Miller's&#xD;
house; -Mrs. Miller met me at the door, remarking, "We need you here;"*&#xD;
she gave me a chair and she sat down opposite me; Mr. Northrup and&#xD;
Mr. Randall came in; Mrs. Miller said, "We want you to marry Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy;" I asked to whom, and she said, "To you, who has ruined'&#xD;
her;" I told her I never had and that if she had taken proper care of the&#xD;
girl she never would be in that condition; Mrs. Miller fainted; Mr. Miller&#xD;
told Miss Pomeroy not to answer Mr. Hallowell any questions; Mr.&#xD;
Miller said, "We mean business;1" he brought Miss Pomeroy into the&#xD;
roomo;- she was 'going to fall, and I caught her by theshoulders and&#xD;
placed her on a stool; Mr. Miller stood over her and asked her this very&#xD;
strange question, which I shall never forget, "Is this child yours or is it&#xD;
his?" the, answer was equivalent to the question, "It is "-(laughter);&#xD;
I told her she never would inake that statement if she were not sur-&#xD;
rounded by such influences; she never said, "Glen, I-have deceived you;''&#xD;
was taken to Justice Aldridge's office; never went to the Clinton Place&#xD;
Asylum to procnre the admission of a young girl; visited it to see if Mrs.&#xD;
Greystock would recognize me as the man she said she saw there before;&#xD;
did not see her.&#xD;
Q. Did you ever threaten Miss Pomeroy with a pistol? A. Never ;&#xD;
never asked her for a paper; never had any occasion for that.&#xD;
This closed the direct examination, and the cross-examination was de.&#xD;
ferred to give Mr. John Hallowell, a trustee of the church, an opportunity&#xD;
of testifying. He testified to the whereabouts of Mr. Glendenning on&#xD;
Thanksgiving Day and the facts connected with the arrest, all of which&#xD;
has already been shown by several witnesses. He advised Mr. Glenden&#xD;
ning on thg night of the arrest to go out by the back door and avoid ar-&#xD;
rest till the next morning, but he refused. The witness contradicted&#xD;
Glendenning point blank in regard to the scene in Mr. Miller's house.&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy said, "Oh, Mr. Glendenning, I have deceived you; it Ia&#xD;
yours." Witness asked her if Mr. Glendenning was the father of her&#xD;
child. She sat looking at him as if stupefied and made no answer. Mr.&#xD;
chiller directed her not to answer any questions. She looked the picture&#xD;
of despair.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd put the query-Did you ask her the question more then onceI&#xD;
No, sir. (Another contradiction.)&#xD;
'The cross-examination brought out further contradictions. Mr. Glen-&#xD;
denning stated, in the hearing of the witness, that he presented Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy with a watch and chain. Dr. Riggs put one of his usual two-&#xD;
edged queries in this fashion :-Mr. Hallowell, how did you knoir that&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning was to be arrested on that evening ? The only swer-&#xD;
the witness made was that he had heard it from a friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.                    is&#xD;
&#xD;
Glendenning took the stand next day for cross-examination. Dr..Im-&#xD;
brie opened the examination and was answered as follows:-I visited&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy once and twice a week, perhaps three or four times a week&#xD;
rarely; have not often stayed as late as eleven o'clock; usually went&#xD;
after tea, but sometimes went as late as nine o'clock; was usually alone&#xD;
with her; visited her more frequently than I did any other young ladies;&#xD;
the only reason I had was on account of her peculiar situation.&#xD;
Q. What was the peculiar situation?  A. Well, as I stated before,&#xD;
that she had no christian sympathy at home,; used to read for her such&#xD;
works as Scott, Tennyson and Burns; was not in the habit of reading&#xD;
my sermons to her; was installed pastor in the fall of 1871, and com-&#xD;
menced visiting Miss Pomeroy in May, 1872; increased my visits be.-&#xD;
cause she. seemed to desire my company; her case was a special one;&#xD;
never remember taking her to a concert, but took her home from one in&#xD;
Jersey City; never went to any place by appointment with her; said&#xD;
to my mother and sister that other people were making themselves more&#xD;
busy than they ought to in regard to the relations between me and Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy; told them she meant .no harm; neither Mr. Howell nor Mr.&#xD;
Dunn (the elder) warned me about it; my mother and sister were not&#xD;
cognizant of all my attentions to her nor was there ever any understand,-&#xD;
ing to that effect.&#xD;
Q. As you have stated that you visited her and read with her oftener&#xD;
than you did with other young ladies, and made her presents when you&#xD;
did not make them to others, were not those grounds of suspicion that&#xD;
you were engaged to her? A. I did nothing which would give any&#xD;
ground for 'suspicion that I was engaged to Miss Pomeroy; heard from&#xD;
others that she was encouraging the idea that we were engaged; spoke&#xD;
to her about. it, but cannot say that I insisted on her denying it; address-&#xD;
ed her as Miss Pomeroy, as Miss Mary and sometimes as Mary; she&#xD;
called me Glendenning and sometimes "Glen;" other ladies are not in&#xD;
the habit of calling me "Glen."&#xD;
Q. Was Miss Pomeroy allowed to address you in more intimate terms&#xD;
than other young ladies ? A. I don't know that I ought to answer that&#xD;
question; wrote letter to Miss Pomeroy; addressed her as "Dear Mary-;",&#xD;
signed myself "Glen ;" don't remember signing myself "Yours, Glen;"&#xD;
sometimes signed my full name;, never called her my dear little vife;&#xD;
never parted with her by a kiss, though I have kissed her, but did n t&#xD;
make it a habit-(presents exhibited)-think that the locket and chain&#xD;
and sleeve buttons are those I gave her; can't identify the earrings and&#xD;
thimble nor the watch and chain; never received presents from ladies in&#xD;
the congregation ; Miss Pomeroy presented me with a shaving case made&#xD;
of paper; can't describe it, because I am not good at description; she&#xD;
gave other small presents; never had any conversation with her about a&#xD;
ring with an inscription: on it; never took a ring away from her ; sh&#xD;
&#xD;

POoo MARY POMEBOY.                  75&#xD;
&#xD;
wore_ three rings, one of which was given her by a young man in the&#xD;
family ; the letters "T" and "K" were inscribed on it; the only reason&#xD;
I had for giving her presents and not to other young-ladies was that she&#xD;
gave presents to me; she manifested a special desire for my company;&#xD;
she was a lady who always desired to be noticed by others; sometimes&#xD;
felt annoyed by her attentions; don't know that I called the attention of&#xD;
others to this annoyance.,&#xD;
Q. If you were so annoyed by her why did you make her presents?&#xD;
A. Because, as I said, she made me presents; did not try to put a stop&#xD;
to her annoyance because I did not want to be rude to her; never visited&#xD;
any institution to procure accommodation for a child about to be born,&#xD;
nor did I commission any person to do so.&#xD;
Q. Do you- then solemnly under oath deny this charge ? A. I do;&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy never asked me to do so; she asked me to write to her&#xD;
aunt in Perrysville with a view to her removal there. I told her that&#xD;
the person who ruined her was the proper one to do that; I deny posi-&#xD;
tively, under oath, that I ever had criminal intercourse with Miss Pom-&#xD;
eroy; I deny solemnly that I am the father of her child; she told me in&#xD;
the second week of June that she had criminal intercourse with another;&#xD;
she told me that while living in her uncle Jacob Miller's house, in Beach&#xD;
street, New York, she was seduced' at an early age by a young man in&#xD;
the family; I did not disbelieve it; received three or four anonymous&#xD;
notes charging her with unladylike conduct; cannot produce those notes;&#xD;
there was no charge of want of chastity except in the last one; it men-&#xD;
tioned the names of three or four gentlemen with whom I "was acquainted&#xD;
and who, it stated, were following her up for. what purpose I could easily&#xD;
judge; called her attention to it; she said the charge was false; she&#xD;
acknowledged one act of unchastity; I never spoke of it to any person&#xD;
till this affair arose; on the night of my arrest I positively refused to&#xD;
marry Miss Pomeroy; the question was asked by Officer Benson.&#xD;
Q. Did she continue to play the organ'in the church after you knew of&#xD;
her pregnancy?. A. She did; I did not prohibit her; at the time of her&#xD;
death she owed me a balance of $50, which I paid for the chain; I re-&#xD;
imitted the $30 she owed me on the watch; she never gave me a memo-&#xD;
randum of this indebtedness; have no written evidence of this transr&#xD;
action.&#xD;
Q. Did you not tell Mr. Howell (the elder) that you gave her a watch!f&#xD;
A. I don't remember; I may have done so; never told him that I gave&#xD;
her a chain, because she wanted a chain for a.watch.&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie (looking intently at elder Howell)-Mr. Howell swore very&#xD;
distinctly to that., A. He swore to his impressions, I swear to facts;&#xD;
when Miss Clinton asked me if I had been asleep in the church parlor I&#xD;
told her I had; I had been np late the night before preparing my anni-&#xD;
versa-y sermon; when Miss Pomeroy banded 'me the note in church I&#xD;
&#xD;
was surprised, was not afraid of being implicated after receiving such a&#xD;
strange note.&#xD;
Q. What inference did you draw when she told you there was some.&#xD;
thing awful behind it? A. I drew no inference at all; showed the note&#xD;
to Dr. Dean after my arrest.&#xD;
Q. Why did you not show so strange a note as that to some of the&#xD;
elders or trustees earlier? A. My session was all away at the time; on&#xD;
the night of my arrest Miss Pomeroy said,-"I have deceived you."&#xD;
Q. Why did you say that she would not have stated so if she were&#xD;
not surrounded by such influences? A. If I said so it was in answer to&#xD;
her remark.&#xD;
The defendant then fell into the hands of Dr. Riggs. The metaphy-&#xD;
0    sician of the court, in answer to whom he testified:-I don't know whether&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy wrote .such a letter to her cousin as she handed me; she&#xD;
made me her confidant in this and other matters; she never explained&#xD;
the meaning of that note, though she promised to do so; I asked her&#xD;
%bout it; the contents were mysterious to me till she made this late rev-&#xD;
elation ; on the evening of the 7th of July I called on her to get an ex-&#xD;
planation, but she gave none except to relate her past history; I called&#xD;
on her on the evening of the 9th of July, but I asked her nothing about&#xD;
it; I called there unawares; my visit was made on the stoop; I remained&#xD;
an hour and a half.&#xD;
. Q. When Miss Pomeroy handed you the note and said you might need&#xD;
it what did she mean?   A. I don't know sir; never asked her why;&#xD;
don't know what occasion I gave for suspicion to be directed to me.&#xD;
Q. Why did you not produce this note then she charged you on the&#xD;
night of your arrest?  A. Well, this was a new experience to me and I&#xD;
did not give it much thought; the charge, "Glen, Ihave deceived you,&#xD;
it is yours," was a positive one against me.&#xD;
Q. Can you explain why you did not deny it when Miss Pomerpy made&#xD;
the charge against you?  A. I cannot give any explanation; I did not&#xD;
think the case was of such importance as it has since assumed; I had the&#xD;
note Miss Pomeroy gave me ten days before in my pocket at that time,&#xD;
but I did not produce it; did not walk publicly in the street with Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy after I knew of hei- condition; read her dying statement; it sur-&#xD;
prised me; part of the note she gave me was detached by my legal ad-&#xD;
viser; the note is now precisely word for word as when it *was handed&#xD;
to me by her; Miss Pomeroy told me after she gave me the letter who&#xD;
was the father Of her child.&#xD;
Q. Did Miss Pomeroy ever ask you to give back that note? A. She&#xD;
did, but I did not; I had not it with me; can't explain what she meant&#xD;
by the words "tried again;" there are several words left out; qon't&#xD;
know what she meant by the expression that she had deceived the&#xD;
Millers in regard to me; I would like to have visited her between the&#xD;

15th of July and her death, but by the advice of my counsel I remained&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Q. Did it never occur to you that if you called on her and showed her&#xD;
this note that the matter might be satisfactorily explained and your char.-&#xD;
acter vindicated? A. I did not, because I thought she was forced to the&#xD;
course she took by those around her.&#xD;
Q. How did you fix the various dates of your whereabouts as you have&#xD;
given them in your minud? A. They were mostly public holidays; the'&#xD;
memoranda I produced were made out some weeks ago; don't keep a di.&#xD;
ary; I once kept one, but having forgot to enter the transactions of two&#xD;
or three days. I cast it aside-(laughter)-saw Miss Pomeroy at the or-&#xD;
gan on the sabbath of the  2th July-; told her I did not expect to see her&#xD;
here after what she had tolme; After receiving the anonymous letters I&#xD;
preached sermons directed to the case.&#xD;
Q. On what subject did you preach?  A. I preached a sermon on&#xD;
scandal once; I also preached on "Fallen Women ;" this, however was&#xD;
given in a lecture in the evening, and a*t was addressed to the young ii&#xD;
necessarily came in-(laughter); I preached according to my idea of the-&#xD;
wants of the community. (Renewed laughter.)&#xD;
Q. Did Miss Pomeroy, after you became aware of her condition, mani-&#xD;
fest angry or esentful feelings toward you? A. She did on the evening&#xD;
vf the 9th of July.&#xD;
Q. Did she attempt to, connect you in any way with her condition 1&#xD;
A. She did not.&#xD;
Q. Why, then, was she angry toward you?  A. Well, I suppose from&#xD;
what I said to'her; it was not very pleasant; she told me that a young&#xD;
man who lived in the neighborhood four years before had taken advan-&#xD;
tage of his intimacy with her, and that other men Who knew of this held&#xD;
it over her head as a threat, and by this means they, too, succeeded iu&#xD;
making her yield to their desires-(sensation)-my reply to be.r was that&#xD;
she was lower than any prostitute that lay in the gutter, and I should&#xD;
have nothing more to do with her-(sensation)-&amp;amp;-was sorry afterwards te&#xD;
have used that xpression.&#xD;
The Moderator and Mr. Dodd protested against these revolting details&#xD;
No third party can be implicated by name.&#xD;
Dr. Eddy arose and said, with determination :-"Mr. Moderator, I say&#xD;
that these details are very important. Mr. Glendenning now stands&#xD;
under a weighty charge. If he can show us such facts as will remove&#xD;
the guilt from him and place it on other shoulders let him speak out, give&#xD;
us the name, and then let him face the consequences in this community."&#xD;
(Loud applause.)&#xD;
Dr. Imnbrie moved that the Presbytery adjourn until the room be cleared&#xD;
and that hereafter none but the Presbytery and the reporters be present.&#xD;
A scene of wild confusion ensued. The motion was carried, and the room&#xD;
&#xD;
was cleared, not however, without great difficulty and loud protests espec.-&#xD;
ially from the ladies. Several voices rang out, "Name! name I" and&#xD;
Glendenning's voice was heard ringing out in reply, "Yes, I will." At&#xD;
this point it seemed as if the dense crowd woul ep across the barrier&#xD;
placed against them, angry threats were uttered, and gestures' of 'wild&#xD;
indignation were seen throughout the entire audience. Amid all the inut-&#xD;
terings, murmurs, creaking of benches and protests, Glendenning main-&#xD;
tained a remarkable self possession. One old lady dressed in black,&#xD;
standing only a few feet in front of him, cried out, "why don't he give us&#xD;
the 'naues before we leave?"  The ,crowd became more excited outside&#xD;
and lingered in a menacing attitude rapping at the doors anc windows.&#xD;
One of the irate individuals must have been possesed of a diamond ring,&#xD;
with which he cut out nearly a whole pane in the stained glass window,&#xD;
through which he could view the proceedings. No party of lynchers&#xD;
could be more brimful of excitement and indignation. Elder HoWell&#xD;
called for police protection, and the crowd was cleared away after clamor-&#xD;
ing for three-quarters of an hour in vain.&#xD;
The doors having been locked, the Presbytery came to order and Glen-&#xD;
denning resumed his narrative on cross-examination-Miss Pomeroy left&#xD;
the impression on my mind that these transactionsavith the parties refer-&#xD;
red to had not occurred for some time; she afterwards told me they had&#xD;
been going on lately, she informed me of her condition and gave me the&#xD;
name of the guilty party; she afterward gave me the name of another&#xD;
party in connection with  he paternity of her child; she asked me, in&#xD;
consideration of the pas  endship between us, to write to her aunt lit&#xD;
Perryville, N. Y., and she might take pity on her condition; while mak-&#xD;
ing these revelations she threw up; her hands several times and said she&#xD;
wished she were dead.&#xD;
Q. After such revelations what action did you take in regard to them?&#xD;
A. I had no one to apply to in the case; never have been able to satisfy&#xD;
myself why-she turned around so suddenly against me.&#xD;
Q. How is it that after you got her note and after all these revelations&#xD;
you went abroad with her and took soda water with her in a drug store;&#xD;
A. She thrust herself upon me, if I may so express it; don't remember&#xD;
proposing a written confession in Justice Aldridge's office; had a conver-&#xD;
sation with a reporter in regard to giving my defence to the public; by&#xD;
the advice of my lawyer I did not; the public mind was too excited.&#xD;
Toward the close of his examination he denied that ho kissed Miss&#xD;
Pomeroy, but he was. immediately reminded by several members of the&#xD;
Presbytery that he bad already sworn the other'way, to which he ans-&#xD;
wered, "I said I may have kissed her; the proposition on the night-of&#xD;
my arrest to settle the matter I understoA  to convey that the payment&#xD;
of some such sum as $1,000 would settrb the matter; Mary Pomeroy in&#xD;

all her confessions to me never implicated a communicant in &amp;amp;tay Christian&#xD;
Church, so far as I know."&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie-How is that during your long intimacy with her you were&#xD;
deceived in her? A. Well, I was the pastor of this church, and, of&#xD;
course, she would present herself before me in the best possible light;&#xD;
never saw anything coarse in her.&#xD;
To Dr. Edwards-4 visited saloons and took ice cream with Miss Pom.&#xD;
eroy at least twice; never sat with her in any other than a lighted room.&#xD;
A member asked why he brought Miss Pomeroy's note with him on&#xD;
the night of his arrest to Mr. Miller's and he answered that he had in.&#xD;
tended to use it, but that he afterward changed his mind.&#xD;
Dr. Dodd offered in evidence the following letter, which was the coun-&#xD;
terpart of Mary Pomeroy's alleged confession already published:&#xD;
July 7, 1874.&#xD;
MY DEAR GLEN.-I an going to leave to-day, and desiring to make-&#xD;
an explanation to mpy cousins I have written them anote, a copy of&#xD;
which I enclose. I am sorry to have to make such an explanation&#xD;
now, but I could not tell them before. If I have done you wrong I&#xD;
did not mean it.- Excuse me for allowing any suspicion to fall on&#xD;
you without at once freeing you by telling the whole truth in regard&#xD;
to the matter. Shall I see you before I go away ?   MARY.&#xD;
Robert Marston, late sexton of the church, testified that Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
gave him notes at times to hand to Mr. Glendenning and that some of the  &#xD;
envelopes had no writing on them; he could not identify any particular&#xD;
letter, but that shown to him was about the size of one Miss Pomeroy&#xD;
handed to Mr. Glendenning at the organ on the 5th of July.&#xD;
A res6lution was adopted providing that the summing up of the case&#xD;
should take place in presence of the Presbytery only. The Presbytery&#xD;
then adjourned.&#xD;
Edwin A. Bailey testified that Mr Glendenning was at his house on&#xD;
the 13th of July last; he came there at seven o'clock in the evening and&#xD;
stayed till after dark;'think he was at my house on the 9th of July. On&#xD;
cross-examination he said he was not sure about the date.&#xD;
Charles L. Corbin, of Stelton, N. J., testified:-Know Miss Haskins;&#xD;
she was employed in my family; on the 8th of October last she made a&#xD;
statemeuit as to what she heard from Miss Pomeroy, whom she attended.;&#xD;
she sais that while Miss Pomerov was ill Mrs. Miller called on her one&#xD;
day and whispered to her, and then walked away; Miss Pomeroy said,&#xD;
"There, she wants twenty-tive dollars more, and that is the last money I&#xD;
have'; she got ninety-five dollars before from me that I earned in the&#xD;
church;" Miss Pomeroy told Miss Haskins about the same time that she&#xD;
was in great distress in consequence of an interview she had with Mr.&#xD;
Miller; he told her that if she did not talk so and so to the lawyers, he&#xD;
would have Mr. Dudley (Overseer of the Poor) come and take her to the&#xD;
poorhouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
-&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
On cross-examination witness testified that Miss Haskins stated that&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy declared that Mr. Glendenning was, the father of her&#xD;
Abild; when asked if Miss Haskins made the statements voluntarily and&#xD;
without any questioning on his part, the witness said that he remarked&#xD;
that some of Mr. Glendenning's friends believed that Miss Pomeroy was&#xD;
under the influence of the Millers in the statements she made.&#xD;
The testimony of Dr. Willard Parker, of New York, taken by commis-&#xD;
sion, was read. He discussed the causes that led to Miss Poimeroy's&#xD;
death and the effect of her physical diseases on her mind.  ie vas of&#xD;
opinion from all the information submitted to him that she died of pneu-&#xD;
monzia. Under his theory of the case the brain was so affected that the&#xD;
person was most likely to reiterate statements previously made. The&#xD;
following question was put:-Would a seduced woman's statement under&#xD;
such circumstances as to the parentage of her child be regarded by you&#xD;
ds satisfactory evidence against that man ? A. I should receive the&#xD;
statement of one, situated as I understand this woman w'os fifteen or&#xD;
twenty minutes before -death, with very great doubt, on the ground of&#xD;
her nearness to death by this disease; if it were some other disease her&#xD;
faculties might be clear to the last.&#xD;
Q. If her. mind was clear one-half hour before death, would it be an&#xD;
extraordinary case? A. It would; I do not now recall any such case.&#xD;
The motion in   card to the secret session was reconsidered. Mr.&#xD;
Moore moved, at me request of My. Glendenning, that the officers of the&#xD;
thurch be admitted during the summing up. Mr. Amnierman was ift&#xD;
favor of throwing open the doors to all. Mr. Moore was opposed to this.&#xD;
He said that during the tumult on Friday a knife was brandished. Dr.&#xD;
Riggs, for the.-prosecution, said that a great advantage had been hitherto&#xD;
gained by the full and free reports published in the papers, and it gave&#xD;
confidence to the public mind that the Presbytery were acting honestly.&#xD;
That advantage would now be lost if the gentlemen of the Press were&#xD;
excluded during the summing up. Mr. Dodd, for the defence, protested&#xD;
against the admission of the press during the summing up. On behalf of&#xD;
his client he had many-things to say which it would be highly improper&#xD;
to have sent broadcast over the country. Dr. Eddy moved that the press&#xD;
be admitted during the summing up. On a close vote the motion was&#xD;
declared lost.&#xD;
The reading of Glendenning's testimony on cross-examination was&#xD;
then' taken up and occupied the remainder of the session.&#xD;
Twenty-second day. Rev. Mr. Booth moved that a committee he ap-.&#xD;
pointed to prepare a' digest of the case, in order that it might be ready dt&#xD;
ihe same time as. the 'verdict of the Presbytery. The otion was adopted&#xD;
anrd the Rev. Meszrs. Bdoth and Waterbury were appointed.&#xD;
When the reading of the cross-examination was concluded Dr. Imbrie&#xD;
Asked the defendant some questions, to which the following answers were&#xD;

POOR MARY POMERoY.&#xD;
&#xD;
given:-When Miss Pomeroy made. the statements to me in regard to&#xD;
the individuals with whom she' said she had intercourse she gave the&#xD;
date and circumstances connected with each case she talked like-a sane&#xD;
person, but with a certain degree of hesitancy, which I attributed to a&#xD;
feeling of shame.&#xD;
Q. Did you ever charge any of these persons with being the father of&#xD;
ber child? -A. I did not,&#xD;
Q. Did you not charge Mr. Northrup to his face ? A  I don't think I&#xD;
did; I told him' I had heard something about it; he said, "Who charges&#xD;
me in that way ?" I answered that I did, not; and that if he chose to ac'&#xD;
cause himself I had no objection.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd objected that this line of examination-was -stretching too far.&#xD;
He thought that the decision of the Presbytery a few days ago that.Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning should not mention names was very wise and prudent ansd&#xD;
he hoped it would be adijered to. He had been speaking to one of the&#xD;
civil justices, who informed him that the decision of the Presbytery was&#xD;
very judicious, inasmuch as Mr. Glendenning would be liable to a suit&#xD;
for slander at the hands of any of the parties so named, and that in such&#xD;
a suit the civil tribunal would take no cognizance of the fact that the*&#xD;
statement was made under an oath administered by the Presbytery. In&#xD;
other words, such an oath would be no protection against a suit for slander-&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie then asked the question, if he relied solely on Miss Ponm..&#xD;
eroy's statemefits as the sole ground on which these parties were impli.-&#xD;
cated, and the defendant answered in the affirmative. He added -that he&#xD;
bad no suspicion till she made those statements. He had a certain de-&#xD;
gree of suspicion when he received the anonymous letters.&#xD;
Dr. Imbrie explained in answer to the objection of the defence that his&#xD;
only object in asking those questions was to have the characters of respect.,&#xD;
able men in the community placed where they properly belong.4&#xD;
In answer to further questions, defendant said that the anonymous let-&#xD;
ters mentioned the same names as those contained in Miss Pomeroy's&#xD;
statement, but not all.&#xD;
Mr. Horace Dean recalled-Mr. Glendenning called on me the morning&#xD;
after his arrest and showed me a letter he had received from Miss Pom-&#xD;
eroy (letter produced); that is the letter; it was not divided as it now&#xD;
is, but in one pie.#e; have never seen Miss Pomeroy's handwriting, ex-&#xD;
cept in some papers connected with this case.&#xD;
Cross-examined by Dr. Riggs:-How do you know this letter was&#xD;
from Miss Pomeroy?   A. Mr. Glendenning'told me so.&#xD;
Q. Is that your only source of information? A. Yes, sir; I believed&#xD;
him when he told me; Mr. Glendenning told me he had been arrested&#xD;
the previous night and that Miss Pomeroy had given him this letter un-&#xD;
 solicited h the Sunday previous, and that she had explained it in part,&#xD;
but never entirely ; he: said he intended to use it in his defence; he told&#xD;
&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
me that when he was arrested he realized the necessity of having that&#xD;
paper,&#xD;
Dr. Riggs repeatedly reminded Ihe witness that he wanted specific&#xD;
answer s without the "of course," "undoubtedly," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Moore recalled-I called on Mr. Glendenning soon after his&#xD;
arrest; he read two letters for'me; one was from Miss Pomeroy to him,&#xD;
and the other on the second leaf of the sheet was a dopy of a letter from&#xD;
Miss Pomeroy to her cousifis; one was explanatory of the other; the&#xD;
letters here are the same as he read them, but I don't think he read the&#xD;
 date oi- the, signature; this occurred on the 17th of July ; he told me the&#xD;
circumstances under which he received them. On cross-examiiation the&#xD;
witness intimated that his memory failed him completely in regard to the&#xD;
dates of the conversations between him and Mr. Glendennitg; the latter&#xD;
left the impression on his mind that he hat given Miss Pomeroy the&#xD;
watch and chain, but he could not tell at what time the conversation oe-&#xD;
curred, except that it was between the 15th of Ja'y and the 15th of No-&#xD;
vember. He was asked the question :-Did you not have the impression&#xD;
that Mr. Glendenning's admission that he gave her the watch and chain&#xD;
was an unfavorable one to him ? A. No. he cross-examination elicited&#xD;
one important point. There was a very serious discrepancy between&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning's statements to the witness and those to RevA Mr.&#xD;
Frenich regarding the presents. To the witness Mr. Glendenning stated&#xD;
that he had bought the watch and chain at Miss Pom roy's request,&#xD;
while to the Rev. Mr. French he stated that he presented t'hem to her on&#xD;
the aniversary of her union with the church and as an encouragement to&#xD;
her to lead a true Christian life. This witness having been resworn pre-&#xD;
vious to giving his testimony, Dr. Edwards arose and asked the Moderator&#xD;
if the practice was .not irregular. The Moderator replied that it was the&#xD;
practice in Presbyterian assemblies for a witness to take ain oath whenever&#xD;
he comes to testify on a new subject.&#xD;
Mr. Mesereau asked the Moderator when and where he ever knew of&#xD;
such a case.&#xD;
The Moderator-The Moderator declines to state.&#xD;
Mr. Meserean-Then I don't care to hear it.&#xD;
Dr. Eddy-I never heard of it before.&#xD;
The defence closed.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd here announced that defence had no further testimony to&#xD;
offer. Whether it would be necessary to introduce other witnesses here.&#xD;
after depended on the course the prosecution might take.&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DECISIVE MEETING.&#xD;
&#xD;
This meeting was' conspicuous by the unusually large attendance af&#xD;
members. The first business in order was the reading of the testimony&#xD;
of the Rev. Mr. French, taken by commission, and the testimony of Mr.&#xD;
Glendenning himself, taken in rebuttal. The commission, consisting of&#xD;
the Rev. Mr. Fisher, Rev. Dr. Eddy and Mr Marc Martin, and con-&#xD;
pleted their digest of the testimony so taken, yet, contrary to expectation,&#xD;
it'was not read. There was a delay of nearly an hout' iin consultation&#xD;
between the prosecuting committee and the committee for the defence,&#xD;
after which the Moderator announced that the Piesbytery were prepared&#xD;
to hear the summing up.&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Riggs then arose on behalf of the prosecntion, and, after a&#xD;
few prefatory remarks on tee unpleasant task imposed upon him, pro.&#xD;
ceeded to road the case for the prosecution based on the evidence. His&#xD;
delivery was very pleasing and marked with deep sincerity, yet there&#xD;
was a keenness and severity in style that produced a palpable effect on&#xD;
K      the members. The gose of his address was particularly fine, and was&#xD;
greeted with smiles of congratulation.  A brief conference took place&#xD;
between him and his associate, Dr. Imbrie, when he resumed his seat.&#xD;
He spoke for three hours and a half.&#xD;
A recess was taken, after which the Rev. Dr. Iinbrie arose and summed&#xD;
up for the prosecution. Hie submiitted that it was not necessary to travel&#xD;
over the evidence in detail, as the members of the Presbytery were suffi-&#xD;
ciently conversant with the facts and circumstances in the case, but he&#xD;
felt bound to submit the conclusions which, in the judgment of the pros-&#xD;
ecution, were warranted by the testimony adduced. In an elaborate ad-&#xD;
dress he then developed the strongest points in the case. In dealing with&#xD;
the dying statement of Mary Pomeroy he was so affected as to command&#xD;
profound silence, and many of his hearers bowed their heads as if they&#xD;
witnessed the painful scene.  The character of the witnesses for the&#xD;
prosecution, he contended, stood unimpeached. But it was when he&#xD;
came to speak of the attempt to asperse the memory of Mary Pomeroy&#xD;
that he faced the Presbytery with indignation and became truly eloquent.&#xD;
 It was only at this point that the Presbytery realized the magnitude of&#xD;
the work which the case involved, though they had repeatedly sympathized&#xD;
with him in the difficulties of his position. After speaking for two hours&#xD;
and ten minutes he resumed his seat. Ilis address was pronounced a&#xD;
masterly effort by many of the members.&#xD;
At half-past thtee o'clock Mr. Dodd arose and spoke to evidence for the&#xD;
defence. His address, like the preceding ones, was in writing, anl con-&#xD;
tained many strong features. The position in which Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
stood, the aspersions cast -upon his character, the grave charges which&#xD;
&#xD;
- POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
ne was called upon to answer before the PreAbytery, and the momentous&#xD;
consequences involved in the verdict, were questions which, he contended&#xD;
affected not merely the community, but the entire Church. He attacked&#xD;
the testimony for the prosecution with unsparing severity, called into&#xD;
question the veracity of many of the witnesses and asked the Presbytery&#xD;
to throw overboard entirely all the evidence relating to Mr. Glendenning's&#xD;
visit to the Clinton Place Asylum. He called upon the Court to consider&#xD;
his client the victim of persecution and to save him from the shafts of hig&#xD;
enemies, who were pursuing him with an unrelenting purpose.&#xD;
Mr. Dodd did not conclude'without paying a compliment to the press,&#xD;
which he considered had been so severe throughout the entire case that&#xD;
-e did not feel justified in saying that it treated his client fairly.&#xD;
At the conclusion of his address it was announced that Mr. Wall in-&#xD;
tended to sum up for the defence, and, as the hour was late, it was decided&#xD;
to adjourn till the next morning at half-past nine o'clock. Many persons&#xD;
lingered around the church during the afternoon, actuated by curiosity,&#xD;
and expecting to obtain admission, but they were disappointed. The&#xD;
ladies of the church entertained the members of the Presbytery with a&#xD;
bountiful repast. An invitation had been given previously by the ladies&#xD;
of the Prospect avenue Presbyterian church; but for the sake of greater&#xD;
convenience in point of location the Presbytery were constrained to&#xD;
decline.&#xD;
The long-expected day for judgment in the Glendenning case arrived&#xD;
on Dec. 8.. The Presbytery assembled at half-past nine o'clock in the&#xD;
First Presbyterian church. The Moderator was absent. The first busi-&#xD;
ness after prayer was offered was a discussion on the letter of Mr. Jones,&#xD;
who was excluded from giving testimony in rebuttal, and Mr. Glenden-&#xD;
ning's answer thereto. One of the members (Rev. Mr. Meserau) in-&#xD;
sisted that the language of the reply was most improper and called for&#xD;
severe censure. The debate became very warm, and Mr. Glendenning&#xD;
was asked to retire. The following digest t of the case was then sub-&#xD;
mitted:&#xD;
The testimony in the case of the Rev. John S. Glendenning being all&#xD;
iti, the Presbytery of Jersey City met in the First Presbyterian church&#xD;
on Monday, November 30, to hear the summing up and to take the final&#xD;
vote. The counsel on both sides occupied the whole of Mondny an d- part&#xD;
of Tuesday in summing' up, after which the Rev. Mr. Glendenninmg was&#xD;
asked whether he had anything further to add in his defence. He replied&#xD;
that he had thought of making some remarks, but in compliance with&#xD;
the advice of his counsel, he would say nothing further. The counsel on&#xD;
both sides then asked and received permission to withdraw, and they,&#xD;
with Mr. Glendenning, retired. The presbytery then spent theremainder&#xD;
of the session on Tuesday in prayer for God's guidance. On Wednesday&#xD;

both before, and particularly thereafter, maintained with her such in-&#xD;
timate intercourse as to lead to a conviction on the part of others of the&#xD;
existence of an. engagement of marriage between them, and led her to&#xD;
declare the existence of such an engagement to a fiumber of parties;&#xD;
and that notwithstanding this Rev. John S. Glendenning did emphatically&#xD;
refuse without just cause to consummate a marriage with her. Sustained,&#xD;
8; not sustained, 13. Therefore the second charge was declared not,&#xD;

POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
his Christian characer by making Miss Pomeroy so many valuable pres-&#xD;
ents, vlingr her so frequently and at such unseasonable hours and liv-&#xD;
in on' isun itLitimate terms with her as to occasion public suspicion of&#xD;
impropriety. especially as he at the same time declared that no more than&#xD;
the orlinarv -rclations of" life existed between them. Sustained, 16 ; not&#xD;
sustained, 5. Therefore the fourth charge was declared not sust-ained as&#xD;
to speciiration first and sustained as to specifieation second. Two elders&#xD;
were exeus'd. from voting.&#xD;
The Presbvterv then adjourned to meet at the same place on Tuesday,&#xD;
Decenmb -r 8, at halt past nine'o clock A M., to receive and act upon the&#xD;
report of the committee (Rev. Henry Booth, chairman) appointed to&#xD;
draw up a final minute inrieference to the case.&#xD;
On Ti esday, December 8, the Presbytery met according to adjourn-&#xD;
ment axvl adopted the report of the committee, which was as follows:-&#xD;
The committee's report. The committee instructed with the preparation&#xD;
of the verdict for the adoption by the Presbvterv in the case of the Rev.&#xD;
John S. ilendenning, against whom charges or unmiiAerial and un-4&#xD;
chrisaiin conduct have been sustained by vote of the Presbytery, recog-&#xD;
nize the solemnity of this duty, and have sought guidance of Him who&#xD;
gives wisdom freely without upbraiding. Beli-vimg that. God loves His&#xD;
church and His ministry far better than we can love either, your con.&#xD;
mituec have l-ked upward for that help which alone can lead us to a&#xD;
righteous and beneficent dedi-ion.  The honor and prosperity of the&#xD;
Church dependd upon the absolute purity of the ministry. In order to&#xD;
their continued usefulness the ordained servants of God must be above&#xD;
all suspicion or reproach. A charge of unministerial conduct, therefore,.&#xD;
when it is sustained on the ground of inconsistencies and improprieties''&#xD;
which look in the direction of impurity of life possesses a gravity and im-&#xD;
"A&#xD;
portance which no other charge possibly can. In these repects a bishop&#xD;
must be "blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, and must have a&#xD;
good report of them which are without." The Presbytery cannot express&#xD;
too forcibly its ensure of the unministerial conduct of thme Rev. John  '&#xD;
Glendenning in his foolish and injudicious intimacy with a memher of his&#xD;
church, the late Mary E. Pomeroy, as exhibited in the visits he paid her&#xD;
the costly presents he gave her, the relationshe sustained to her both by&#xD;
manifesting regard for her and by allowing her-to express her preferences&#xD;
for him to such a derree that their names became associated as persons&#xD;
eng'agred to the married. The I resbyterv recognizes the fact that a plea&#xD;
has been. urged in extenuation of this intimacy on the ground of the re-&#xD;
ligious ignorance of the young lady already named and the desire of her&#xD;
minister to be faithful in his pastoral oversight and friendship, but the&#xD;
Presbytery has not so learned the duties of the pastoral office as to give&#xD;
any other .than a most severe condemnation to visits and presents and&#xD;
intimacies such as these. With the utmost sadness of heart that such a&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="86-87 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7473-00000044"/>&#xD;
POOR MARY POMEROY.&#xD;
&#xD;
charge -should rest upon one of its menibers the Presbytery hereby ad-&#xD;
ministers its solemn censure to the Rev. John S. Glendenning for his&#xD;
unministerial and unchristian conduct.&#xD;
And inasmuch as the church over which the Rev. John S. Glendenning&#xD;
has been placed by the Presbytery has already suffered greatly from the&#xD;
disturbing influences incident to this case; and is still suffering,.and the&#xD;
Presbytery believes that only confusion, strict and ultimate ruin will re,&#xD;
suit from the continuance of the Rev. John S. Glendenning as pastor of&#xD;
the Prospect avenue church, and moreover, since so large a minority of&#xD;
the Presbytery voted to sustain the grave charges of the accusation,&#xD;
which vote has a great moral weight. as anelement of the vote which&#xD;
supported the only specification sustained, viz., that of unministerial and&#xD;
unchristian conduct; under those circumstances it is unwise that the&#xD;
Rev. John S. Glendenning should continue to act as pastor of the Pros,&#xD;
pect avenue church, and the Presbytery in the exercise of that authority&#xD;
committed to it for the welfare of the churches and the glory of God's&#xD;
most holy name deems it right to dissole this pastoral relation; there,&#xD;
fore be it resolved&#xD;
1. That the Pastoral relation existing between the Rev. John S. Gler.&#xD;
denying and the Prospect avenue church be and hereby is dissolved.&#xD;
2. That the Rev. T. G. Wall (Moderator) be t appointed to preach in&#xD;
the pulpit of that church on the Sabbath after next, December 20, to de.&#xD;
clare the pulpit vacant and to read to the congregation the judgment en,&#xD;
t'6rred in this case.                   HENRY M. BOOTH&#xD;
C. GIDDES,&#xD;
JERSEY CITY, Dec. 8, 1874.          ,C. H. WATERBURY.&#xD;
After the delivery of this judgment Mr. Glendenning was called into&#xD;
the meeting of the Presbytery and, the judgment having been announced,&#xD;
he was asked what he had to say. He looked around and finding that&#xD;
neither of his counsel was present, be contended himself by saying he&#xD;
would make use of the ten days allowed by the Book of Discipline by&#xD;
lodging an appeal to the synod. He appeared quite disappointed, as did&#xD;
some of his friends in the Presbytery. It was somewhat remarkable&#xD;
that while neither of his counsel was present the committee for the pros-&#xD;
ecution, Drs Imbrie and Dodd, were in attendance. A lively scene oc,&#xD;
curred at the close of the proceedings. Rev. Mr. Paulison approached&#xD;
Mr. Glendenning and exhorted him to speedy repentance, reminding him&#xD;
that, no matter how great the fall, he who turns his heart to Christ would&#xD;
not be cast away. To this Mr. Glendenning replied warmly that such&#xD;
an advice was not needed, as he would have confessed in the first instance&#xD;
if he felt conscious of guilt. "Then," said Mr. Paulison, "if you -be not&#xD;
guilty you are the victim of the foulest conspiracy ever known."  "Now&#xD;
you've struck it," retorted the Rev. Mr. Moore, who has stood by Mr&#xD;
Glendenning in all his troubles.&#xD;
