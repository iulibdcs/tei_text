            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>IN writing this little volume, we designed to give a truthful account of the experience, success and, we may say, <emph>triumph</emph> of a woman, who, in early life was left a widow with three children dependent upon her. We have written without any attempt at exaggeration or any desire to make the account, in any respect, different from what the facts would warrant. There are many persons, for want of energy, self-reliance or, perhaps, more from not knowing how much they could accomplish and from a disposition to take an unfavorable view of human nature or who, from being intimidated with trifling obstacles or from want of courage to man the trials of life, don't make any effort but spending their time and energy in complaints or from fear of lions, which exist in the imagination, pine away and die. The energy thus expended, if put forth with courage, hope and confidence, would lighten many a heart and remove the dark shades of life. The nicest machinery will rust, if<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC5572-00000004"/> it be not oiled and rubbed often,-and the mind requires constant employment, in order to enjoy life,-the body, constant labor, in order to be kept sound and healthful, and much cannot be accomplished unless due care be taken to keep both the body and mind in constant employment; the more pleasant the employment or the more in accordance with the desire and taste, the more certain is success.</p> 
            <p>There can be no employment more agreeable to a mother than training her children to usefulness and happiness. To see the mind expand, the heart improve and the body develope affords peculiar gratification to a mother; and when she is thus engaged the amount of difficulty she will overcome, the amount of labor she will perform and the hours she will spend in diligence and efforts to accomplish her purpose surpasses ordinary belief. Many of Mrs. Parks' acquaintances could not understand how she could accomplish so much; the care of one child was more than some were equal to, and the care and education of three daughters by the needle-woman was incomprehensible to them. Providence had blessed her, and with those blessings she was ready to continue the<pb n=""/> voyage of life, and trust that Providence who regards the widow and fatherless with peculiar care.</p> 
            <p>If these lines should ever see the light and others should thereby be induced to imitate her example and adopt her motto, "God helps those who help themselves," and with energy and perseverence overcome the obstacles in their way and thus pass through life triumphantly, one of the purposes of the writer will have been accomplished.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>AS I was passing to my place of business one bright morning in May, a friend accosted me, and said-</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Parks and Miss Wood had a ride together yesterday."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed!" says I; "Are they engaged?"</p> 
               <p>"It seems so."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Mr. Parks is a young man of fair business capacity, and Miss Wood is smart, energetic, and of fine personal appearance, and she will make a good wife. A very fair match, and I am glad of it."</p> 
               <p>"So am I," said my friend; "and I wish them much joy." And we then separated to commence the duties of the hour.</p> 
               <p>There are different customs in the villages of New England. Some of them are peculiar, and it is not certainly known how they originated. The village where my friend and I met was situated on the banks of the meandering, always-working, never-tiring Merrimack. This river turns more wheels, does more work, gives employment to more hands, and supports more people, and adds more to the material interest of New England, than any other water-power does to the inhabitants on its banks in America. Villages are on each bank of it, and they command beautiful views,<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5572-00000006"/> variegated scenery and picturesque and charming landscapes. This village at this time contained from three thousand to four thousand industrious, frugal and untiring inhabitants, who were friendly to themselves and each other, and consequently social, and they enjoyed life.</p> 
               <p>In one of these villages, on the banks of the river, were large spreading willows, and here it was customary for the people of the village to promenade on Sunday eve, and if a young man and woman walked arm-in-arm under a certain willow tree which overshadowed the promenade, in presence of the people, all the world was at liberty to say they were engaged,-a novel way to announce an engagement, but a most effectual and public one. Another peculiarity existed, which, under certain circumstances, was equally significant. If the lady accepted an invitation to ride with the gentleman, not in a party, an engagement was announced. This mode did not require quite so much fortitude as walking under the branches of a tree on the public promenade, with hundreds of people in sight.</p> 
               <p>In different countries customs obtain which originated so long ago that no one can give their origin, except possibly by tradition. The Scotch are peculiar and by themselves-neither English nor Irish, nor part of both. <choice>

                     <corr>Betrothals</corr>
                  </choice> by them were made in this way: The parties pressed the thumbs of their right hands, which they licked, together, and vowed fidelity. The ceremony possessed the solemnity of an oath; the violator of such an engagement being considered guilty of perjury. A favorite Scottish song commences <q>
                     <l>"There's my thumb, I'll ne'er beguile thee."</l>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>The pressure of <choice>
                     <sic>moised</sic>
                     <corr>moist</corr>
                  </choice> thumbs at the solemn ratification of an engagement, was used in other contracts. The records<pb n=""/> of Scottish courts contain examples of sales being confirmed by the judges on the production of evidence that the parties had licked and pressed their thumbs on the occasion of a bargain. The Highland and Lowland school-boys still lick their thumbs in bargain making.</p> 
               <p>No matter how an engagement is made public, whether by a walk, a ride, licking the thumbs, or formal declaration, it is an engagement, and that is a matter of vital importance to the parties. The village soon had the news. Each had his opinion. The young man was in good business, industrious, capable-had been often trusted and proved faithful. There seemed no good reason why he should not assume the duties and responsibilities of married life. It was the universal opinion that in his selection he had used good judgment and sound discretion, for he had selected for his partner a young lady, whose early training had fitted her for the companion of a young man commencing life, dependent upon his energy, his will, and the smiles of Providence. She could adapt herself to circumstances, and was equally at ease in the workshop or drawing-room. To all outward appearance, a long life, a useful life, a happy life, was before them. Their circumstances were equal. Both had been educated in New England to habits of industry, economy and virtue, and in a few months a few friends met, he said yes and she said yes, and they two were one.</p> 
               <p>Now life begins in earnest. Up to this hour, what is it? The training of a grape-vine-the culture of a flower-the moulding of matter-the expansion of an intellect, or the growth and culture of mind and matter. What is life, anyway? It is a reality. It has purpose, object, meaning, and soul. To some it has aims high, lofty, grand, noble, eternal. To others it is aimless, shapeless, without form or comeliness,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5572-00000007"/> of to-day, without vitality, and gone or lost. It sometimes begins with fair prospects of success-a change comes, and the responsibilities and fruit of the union devolves upon one.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Parks had now embarked. Life was theirs with its duties, its cares, its sunshine and its shade. Mr. Parks' business gave him fair support. He was an agent, employed at a fixed compensation. He knew his income, and was not dependent upon daily profits. In this he had an advantage. He must govern himself accordingly. But who can count the changes in New England in forty years? Commerce to-day-manufactures to-morrow; a ship, a brig to-day, steamboat to-morrow. A stage-coach to-day, a railcar to-morrow; a post to-day, a telegraph to-morrow. To-day the world is at a distance, and people strangers to each other; to-morrow the world's news comes with the morning sun. Strangers are friends, and the President of the United States congratulates the Emperor of all the Russias on the birth of a son. Spain begins new life with religious liberty. The revolution of 1776 is in full force. The spirit of our fathers has entered the Old World. The Pope rises in his wrath. He tries to stop the falls of Niagara with impotent bulls, and he is drowned.</p> 
               <p>But we have digressed. Mr. Parks' employers found that changes had rendered their business unprofitable. They discontinued it, and his agency is at an end. His duties to himself and family remained the same, and now he must seek other and less certain support. He was just in the condition to look to government for an office, and being politically with the then dominant party, and possessing business talents, he soon obtained an office which promised him ample support. He enters upon its duties, and discharges them to the satisfaction of the department. But a change comes, and after<pb n=""/> eight years of service, he finds his place filled by another, and, what seems passing strange to the uninitiated, himself without any other means than he had when he commenced discharging the duties of his office. What becomes of the money of office-holders is a mystery. The best of their days are gone, and they are pecuniarily no better than when in early or middle life they entered the service of government.</p> 
               <p>And here Mr. Parks was. Again he must find employment or engage in business; but after middle life has past few men enter upon new and untried business with that energy which commands success, and though a man at forty may have more experience and maturer judgment than at the commencement of business life, there is a want of that spring which the Yankees say secures success. Young men will run round him twice a day. Mr. Parks felt this change, but he could not help it. He could not know nor see everybody, as he once could, and if he did see them, he had not that tact which he formerly possessed, and he soon found it a task to compete with younger men. His health had been impaired, and his energy, his courage, began to fail him. We have seen the sun rise fair, and smile upon the earth, and in a few hours the clouds would overshadow it, and for days it could not be seen, though occasionally it would give promise of appearance, when another and a deeper and darker cloud would hide it from our view. So in this life. A cloud arises. We think little of it at first. It seems to disappear. Again we are startled by it, and then again our fears seem groundless, but at length the reality comes, and though nature has been striving and struggling, firmer and stronger has disease seized the system, and the physician and nature too, yield the victory.</p> 
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5572-00000008"/> 
               <p>Suffice it to say that Mr. Parks was soon obliged to relinquish his business, and in spite of the efforts of an experienced physician, and the careful nursing and constant watching of his tender and affectionate wife, he was obliged to take leave of her and their three daughters, and look upon them no more forever. Friends came. The last duties were discharged. Mrs. Parks found herself alone with three bright and dependent daughters to accompany her life's journey through. But how shall they be fed and wherewith shall they be clothed? The last years of Mr. Parks' life had been attended with loss, and his sickness had consumed what little substance remained at the close of his business. Mrs. Parks was now alone with three daughters, and a needle for their support. The duties of the hour were full of interest to her, and how and what to do required but a few moments' reflection.</p> 
               <p>"The girls, my jewels, must live together and grow up in each other's affections, or they must be separated. If separated, who will be mother to them, and when and where and how often shall their mother see, meet and receive their smiles, and enjoy their happy and cheerful childhood and youth? Separate them? No, never. This needle shall support us. To-morrow this Christian people shall know that I have three jewels which with this needle I must support, educate and train to act well their part in life. I ask only for work, and I will feed, clothe, and educate the three daughters with whom God has blessed me. They will stimulate me to exertion. They will buoy me up. They will sweeten every hour of my life."</p> 
               <p>Jenny Lind said, when first in this country, and when her name was on every tongue in the land, and when on a visit to a friend in the western part of New York, as she took up<pb n=""/> the foot of her babe and kissed it, "Ah, madam, you have something worth living for," and surely Mrs. Parks had something worth living for, and, besides, God helps those who help themselves.</p> 
               <p>"By His providence I am left a widow, not to repine and die, but with these jewels, whose life is my life, with whom I will live, and for whom, if necessary, I will die, to enjoy life, and to receive from them His blessing."</p> 
               <p>At once she announced to her neighbor and friend, Mrs. Dix, her situation, her resolution, her purpose, with a request that she would make known to others as she had opportunity, that she was prepared to work with her needle, and that she hoped to find employment, and with her needle to support herself and daughters.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Dix looked up with a smile, and asked her if she really was in earnest.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks instantly replied, "I am."</p> 
               <p>"What is their age?"</p> 
               <p>"Eleven, nine, and three."</p> 
               <p>"They will require some care. I suppose Alice and Grace must attend school, while little Fanny will be with you all the time. Well, Mrs. Parks, I have three daughters, and I know what it is to care for them. I am obliged to keep help and work myself, and we all have enough to do, while Mr. Dix is diligent and provides for us. I don't think it would be possible for me to do what you purpose to do."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not, Mrs. Dix; but you have other engagements-you must look after the poor of the Parish. The Benevolent Society calls upon you often, and claims of you as much as one day in the week-a meeting of ladies to-day, the sewing circle or benevolent society to-morrow, and in various ways, socially, your time passes-all of which requires hours<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5572-00000009"/> each day, and days each week; but I must deny myself all such agreeable duties, and devote myself to the maintenance of myself and little ones-with my needle I must support them."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Parks, I am glad to witness your courage and determination, and I hope your success will be equal to your energy and resolution. The Benevolent Society will meet this afternoon, and several ladies will be there who hire most of their sewing done, and I will inform them of your purpose, and I doubt not you will find them ready and happy to employ you."</p> 
               <p>"I Thank you, Mrs. Dix. Every one must decide for themselves what they can and what they will do, and go about it resolutely and cheerfully. No one knows what they can do till they try. I have always been used to work, and I have no fear of a little extra exertion, if necessary, and you know God helps them who help themselves. Good morning, Mrs. Dix."</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Parks. I am happy to see you in such good spirits."</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>MRS. Parks returned home, if a hired house can be called home, where she found her little ones, and as their bright eyes met hers, and she saw how happy, how innocent, how content they were, and how tenderly they loved each other, her heart throbbed with emotion-her resolution was firmer, her purpose unalterable. <choice>

               <p>In the afternoon, Mrs. Dix was in the rooms of the Benevolent Society at the usual hour, and after the ladies had commenced their work, she told them she had had an interview with Mrs. Parks that morning, and that she had concluded to keep her children with her and support herself and them with her needle, that she was now prepared to <emph>take in work</emph>, and she hoped if any of them had any sewing, which they did not intend to do at home, they would employ her to do it.</p> 
               <p>"Why Mrs. Dix! Does Mrs. Parks expect to support herself and her three daughters by her needle?" said Mrs. Bradley. "I have only two children and I keep help; and I am obliged to hire a seamstress and Mr. Bradley thinks I keep a woman sewing half the time, and how can Mrs. Parks think of supporting herself and three children with her own hands? I don't think I could support myself with a needle, and I call myself smart!"</p> 
               <p>"I think" says Mrs. Smith, "a woman, who has three children and no means of support, ought to put them out in respectable families, where they can be of some use and be put to work. I know some mothers dread putting their children under the care of others, but I think it is because they don't want them to work, but be brought up genteelly. Poverty and pride often go hand in hand, and I have no patience with, nor sympathy for, persons, who refuse good places for their children."</p> 
               <p>"But Mrs. Parks proposes to keep her children with her and support them herself; and if she can, I presume you have no particular objections, Mrs. Smith?"</p> 
               <p>"No, none in particular; but I believe in transplanting children,-and this notion that a mother can't be separated from her children, is all affectation."</p> 
               <p>"You have no children, Mrs. Smith, and know comparatively<pb n=""/> ly little of a mother's heart," said Mrs. Dix. "I have no doubt, if you had children, you would feel a responsibility, a duty, a love for them, which would induce you to make your utmost exertion for their comfort and happiness. It is easy to say what we would do under particular circumstances, but theory and practice do not always agree; and as Mrs. Parks proposes to provide for them by her own industry, I think she ought to be encouraged. She asks no favors, unless it be a favor to be employed to work."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I understand that, Mrs. Dix. She wants to take care of her three children, and earn their bread and butter with her needle. Preposterous! Who ever heard of a woman's undertaking to feed, clothe, and educate three children with a needle! I doubt if she can take care of herself. Suppose she should be sick for a month-what then? I tell you, Mrs. Dix, it would be better for the children and Mrs. Parks too to put them into good families, than for her to be so foolish as to undertake to provide for them herself. How old did you say they were?"</p> 
               <p>"Three, nine, and eleven."</p> 
               <p>"Let some person adopt them and see how much better it would be for them and Mrs. Parks, than for her to struggle with such a task."</p> 
               <p>"This adopting children," says Mrs, White, "seems well in theory, but a very different thing in practice."</p>

Then the idea of sending one here, and another there, and have them grow up comparatively strangers to each other, is extremely repugnant to the feelings of a tender and affectionate mother. My friend, Mrs. Chamberlain, intended to be a kind woman, and, no doubt, supposed she was,-but then she was nervous, and though she had children, who were married, she undertook to adopt a <choice>

                     <corr>niece</corr>

                     <corr>niece</corr>
                  </choice>; but she contrived to keep her in torment all the time. She had a sister in the western country, who was left a widow with children and no adequate means of support, and Mrs. Chamberlain took one of the daughters and fitted her with dresses and kept her as a sort of companion, and wherever Mrs. C. went her <choice>

                  </choice> was sure to go.</p> 
               <p>"When Mrs. C.'s friends called, they naturally inquired whose little girl she had with her and then she would begin and exclaim 'O dear! If you could only have seen her when I found her out west with my dear sister, who is a widow:-There they were in a log-cabin, as poor as poverty itself. This little girl had only one plain calico dress, and I have taken her and fitted her with new clothes, so that she might look decent and I hope to make something of her; I wish you could have seen how they lived-O dear me, such poverty I never witnessed before; so destitute! My sister with four children, living in a log-cabin, and scarcely anything to eat and less to wear, except some second-hand dresses I sent her. One of her uncles has taken the other daughter, and I hope he will do as well by her as I shall by this<pb n=""/> one. Come here, my dear, and tell the lady how you lived out west!'</p> 
               <p>"Lizzie hesitated, and hung down her head, when her aunt told her to come and tell the lady the story of her poverty.</p> 
               <p>"'Oh, Aunt! I don't think we were so very poor! I'm sure we were very comfortable till Father died, and I think we should have got along very well,-brother William would take care of us.'</p> 
               <p>"'You see, Mrs. Hox, she is not willing to own anything. Did you have anything but a calico dress out there?'</p> 
               <p>"'That was all we wanted, aunty, we <choice>

               <p>"'O dear, how unwilling poor children are to own their condition. Her father was a very proud man, and I guess Lizzie comes honestly by her pride.'</p> 
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Chamberlain,' says Mrs. Hox, 'she appears to be a bright girl, and very soon she will be a companion for you.'</p> 
               <p>"'O yes, she is bright enough, but I want her to realize what I am doing for her, and own up to it. I have already had four dresses made for her, and bought her a fashionable hat, and taken her to meeting with me, and I think she is old enough to appreciate what I have done for her.'</p> 
               <p>"'I think she does, or will,' said Mrs. Hox; 'but I presume she would just as soon not hear so much about her former condition.'</p> 
               <p>"'It may be, but I don't mean she shall forget it,' said Mrs. Chamberlain.</p> 
               <p>"'Good morning, madam, good morning little girl. I hope you will be happy with your aunt.'</p> 
               <p>"No sooner had Mrs. Fox gone than Mrs. C. began to chide the little girl, because she had not told Mrs. Hox about the<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5572-00000012"/> log hut, and what she had done for her. Lizzie tore herself away and by herself cried as orphan children do. She said to herself she had rather live with her mother in rags than be out on exhibition in this way, and her tears gave her relief. Her aunt was so good, so kind, so obliging, so loving, she supposed she ought to do as she said, but somehow she couldn't. This same play was acted for weeks, for months, as one and another called, until the little girl's spirit was nearly broken and her heart nearly burst. The few months she had been with her aunt had witnessed more sorrow, more tears, than the other twelve years of her life. She had been to the beach, she had seen many fine ladies and pleasant children of her age, she had nice clothes, she had the delicacies of the table, but to everybody and everywhere Mrs. C. would detail in her presence her poverty, and exhibit her in such a manner as would wound the pride and break the spirit of any child, and instead of loving her aunt, if she didn't hate her, she couldn't bear her presence anywhere, and she would contrive to keep out of sight, particularly when she feared or saw signs of any exhibition. She had spirit, she had sense and sensibility. Poverty was a precious morsel to such exhibits. Many a night had she cried herself to sleep, and started as she saw or dreamed she saw strangers with her aunt. She concealed her feelings as well as she could when company was present, but sometimes she would leave the room abruptly, sobbing almost aloud: Poor girl, her aunt would exclaim, I have no doubt she feels bad when she thinks how poor she was, little thinking she was piercing her through and through with the most deadly weapons and with sorrow upon sorrow-that poverty has no kindred to mortification-that the spirit of a miss of fourteen summers may be broken, though she be clothed in silks and satins and fare sumptuously every day.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Lizzie had heard so much and so often of her poverty, that she longed for the log cabin and calico dress, and if her aunt would only send her back to the west she would throw up her silks, her satins and her hat, so high that they would never reach her head again. Some persons when in trouble will have no courage. They will despond, and seem about to die. If a bear be in the way, they leave their self-possession and can make no resistance but yield themselves to his power, while others will contrive ways and means of escape, and often overcoming one difficulty will give strength to surmount other and greater difficulties, they will march boldly on and frighten bears out of sight and hearing. Courage, and self-reliance is more than half the battle in this life.</p> 
               <p>"Though Lizzie had suffered enough to break the heart of a giant, she hoped this ding-dong account of her poverty would die out and be forgotten. But her aunt was in a sort of passion or frensy to make known how kind, how benevolent she was-and she exhibited her niece more as evidence of her own disinterested benevolence than for any other purpose. As preparations were made for the sea-shore, Lizzie found the same parties would be there and she must be exhibited as the poverty-stricken orphan of nearly two years' standing. During the winter and spring, her aunt had seen but little company, and Lizzie had made herself busy with books and thus escaped their presence. But now as one and another called before leaving town for the summer, she began to hear how her aunt was fitting her as she would her own daughter, and what a contrast there must be between her present and her western life. The scenes of the last summer revived with the freshness of spring. She thought, too, the girls of her own age would whisper and point to her as the orphan with a calico dress from the west. She could not endure the sight of the<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5572-00000013"/>  beach. She would rather see a field of corn on the western prairie than the waters of the Atlantic. The plains of the west were beautiful, while the hills and <choice>
                     <sic>roades</sic>
                     <corr>roads</corr>
                  </choice> of New England had no charm for her. But how to escape from the show and vanity of fashionable life, and once more live with her mother, though in a log cabin, and away from such exhibitions was a problem which an older miss might find it difficult to solve.</p> 
               <p>"Thinking, pondering, planning, dreaming ever, she finally hit upon an expedient which she hoped would relieve her. Not more than a day's journey by railroad lived her father's brother. Before going to the sea-side, she asked permission to visit him. Now her aunt did not deny any reasonable request, and she gave her permission, and hoped she would have a pleasant visit. Then she breathed free and easy. She was herself again. Arrived at his house in safety, and after a few days she made bold to detail her sufferings and her horrors.</p> 
               <p>"Her uncle saw at once how intended kindness accompanied with a passion for self-esteem and public commendation rendered the subject of that kindness miserable, and the kindness itself, absolute cruelty. Her uncle was a man of too much sympathy for his own comfort; his feelings were easily and quickly enlisted, and though her sister had been with him for years, she had never heard a word of her former condition, but rather might think she had done him a kindness by spending a few years with him.</p> 
               <p>"Life is too short to be spent in misery; childhood and youth should be cheerful; life should be enjoyed; and if Lizzie was in constant agony, she might as well be in a convent.</p> 
               <p>"In a few weeks a letter was sent to Aunt Chamberlain, in the following words:</p>

               <p>"To the west she went; and to this day she has not seen her aunt nor Lynn beach. Now, Mrs. Smith, this is an extreme case, but not a solitary one. I have seen orphan children apparently incapable of enjoying the plays and sports of childhood and youth. They were suffering for a mother's sympathy and love, though with kind and benevolent friends. Depend upon it, no other person can take care of daughters as a mother, and they had better suffer with her, than from her."</p> 
               <p>Here Mrs. Dix interposed her authority, and said a few matters of business must be attended to before the hour of adjournment; and then the Circle, thinking and talking of the pluck and spirit of the needle-woman and her jewels, left for their own fire-sides and happy homes.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN the Sewing Circle separated, Mrs. White had just finished her account of Lizzie and her aunt, and it had made a deep impression-and now as they met the next week, they were all charged, and they let off their batteries like Capt. Bragg, when Gen. Taylor cried out to him, more grape, Capt. Bragg, more grape, Capt. Bragg.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor first accosted Mrs. White, and said she was a perfect convert to her doctrine. When she first saw Mrs. Parks and her treasures, she thought they must suffer, and in many families they might be adopted and treated kindly, but kindness often shows itself in such selfish ways as to render the recipient unhappy and sometimes miserable. "For my part, I would go out washing before I would be separated from my children, and I should rather have two meals per day with them, and a crust of bread at that, than go to bed without a good-night kiss. We live for our children, and I don't know what this life would be worth without them, and I fully justify Mrs. Parks, and I shall employ her all I can."</p> 
               <p>"I am very happy to hear you say so, Mrs. Taylor," said Mrs. Dix.</p> 
               <p>And Mrs. Orne said amen, when Mrs. Gilman said I agree with you fully, ladies. And so do I, said Mrs. Hayes,-and Mrs. Emery said she didn't believe there was one lady of nerve, of pluck, and of heart, who wouldn't justify Mrs. Parks and encourage her too.</p> 
               <p>This was too much for Mrs. Smith, and she said that was<pb n=""/> an extreme case, of which Mrs. White gave account, and she didn't believe but what it was colored some. "This supporting herself and three daughters with a needle, sounds well, and may read well in print, but I tell you it can't be done, and it won't be three months before we shall be asked to make up some clothes for these orphans, and I am still of the opinion that in some rich families they would all be better off."</p> 
               <p>"Well, suppose we are, would not you sooner make clothes for those who helped themselves, than for those irresolute complaining persons, who rather others would work for them, than to work themselves?" said Mrs. White.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so," said Mrs. Smith, "but if Mrs. Parks is not willing to put her children out, she need not think of getting anything of this Sewing Circle, so far as I am concerned."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mrs. Smith, you are always for sending everything a distance, where you don't know whether the recipients are worthy or not, and having an account of it published in the papers," said Mrs. Taylor a little excited-"but I think charity begins at home, and if Mrs. Parks needs any assistance of us, she will have it, whether you vote for it or not," when there was a general stampede all around, Yes she will Mrs. Taylor, indeed she will.</p> 
               <p>But Mrs. Smith was by no means disconcerted. She was one of those persons who are obstinate, and as willful as most pretty women, and she enjoyed a storm and was gratified at the excitement of the moment. "And now ladies, you needn't try to scare me, for I have seen as much of the world as any of you," said Mrs. Smith, "and I can bring you more cases where orphans have been brought up by other families and properly cared for, and have also become respectable and useful members of society, five to one, than you can of<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5572-00000015"/> such cases as Mrs. White gave us in that long and pitiable story about Mrs. Chamberlain and Lizzie. She might have been a nervous woman, of unhappy temper, and a little envious withal, but you can't find another such case in all your experience. Pride and poverty go hand in hand, and if a woman is too proud to put her children into respectable families, I have little sympathy or pity for her."</p> 
               <p>Shame on you, Mrs. Smith, said half a dozen voices, what pride is there in working fourteen to sixteen hours per day. Those who help themselves are to be commended, and not to be accused of poverty and pride.</p> 
               <p>And here Mrs. Foster, a peace-maker, interposed and said she was obliged to differ from Mrs. Smith, and agree in the main with the other ladies. She had seen a good deal of the world, and believed they all knew Mrs. Hox. She has her carriage and postillion, money, equipages, servants, but not a chick, and we all know what a fidgety, fussy, uneasy, discontented body she is; she is never happy, nor willing any body else should be, and all that ails her is, she is childless. She was naturally a clever woman, but now nothing suits her nor ever will. Could she have been blessed with children she would have been an entirely different woman. Externally she has everything she wants, but, in fact nothing. Riches, an elegant mansion, beautiful furniture, fine carriages, horses and servants, are well enough, but then if the possessor is still in want of something, which she much desires and can't have, of what avail to her are riches, and houses and lands-she is destitute. Could she have three daughters, like Mrs. Parks, at the expense of her fine things, I have no doubt she would part with them at once, and even try to support her children with the needle.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I guess she would promise to," interrupted Mrs. White.</p> 
               <p>And Mrs. Dix said she had no doubt Mrs. Hox envied Mrs. Parks, more than Mrs. Parks did her.</p> 
               <p>"I never saw a married woman," continued Mrs. Foster, "without children, who enjoyed life. To be married to a man and live with him for years without a sunbeam, or the natural links which bind husband and wife together, is not natural, and hardly endurable. I should rather be an old maid than married and motherless. Some people think it a disgrace to be a spinster, but I think single blessedness much preferable to double blessedness, if the fruit of the union does not follow. For my part, I always thought old Hannah was right, when she prayed the Lord to take away her disgrace among men."</p> 
               <p>"Good, Mrs. Foster! let us have the Bible, and read the account," says Mrs. Taylor.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Orne catched down the Bible and read as follows: "Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite; and he had two wives, the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah, and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship, and sacrifice unto the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.</p> 
               <p>"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions. But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion, for he loved Hannah, but the Lord had shut up her womb. And her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb. And as he did so<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5572-00000016"/> year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat. Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah why weepest thou, and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? Am I not better to thee than ten sons?</p> 
               <p>"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk: (now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord:) and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but will give unto thine handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. And it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth. Now Hannah she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee. And Hannah answered and said, No, my Lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p> 
               <p>"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p> 
               <p>"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned and came to their house to<pb n=""/> Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her. Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son and called his name Samuel, saying because I have asked him of the Lord. And the man Elkanah, and all his house went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow. But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord and there abide forever. And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good. Tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word.</p> 
               <p>"So the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him. And when she had weaned him she took him up with her, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh, and the child was young. And they slew a bullock and brought the child to Eli, and she said, O my Lord, as thy soul liveth my Lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him. Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord: as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there."</p> 
               <p>For a wonder the whole Circle kept silence while Mrs. Orne read this chapter. Then they looked at each other, but no one said a word. At length Mrs. Bradley said-</p> 
               <p>"I think they had funny times in old Scripture days."</p> 
               <p>"Funny times or not," said Mrs. Orne; "I think Hannah expressed the feelings of every true woman, and her expression of gratitude, praise and thanksgiving, in the next chapter<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5572-00000017"/> ter, indicate the feelings of all true women under like circumstances."</p> 
               <p>"Now, Mrs. Orne, as you have got the Bible, I would like to hear you read the book of Ruth," which she did, and there was the greatest interest manifested, and the most perfect silence ever known in a sewing circle, till the whole was finished, when Mrs. Bradley exclaimed, that beat any courtship she ever heard of. And it seemed all new to her, for she didn't believe she had read it in twenty years. Mrs. Taylor said it was a very interesting book to her, and she had read it when young with so much interest that she couldn't forget it.</p> 
               <p>"Hannah and Ruth were representative women in the Old Testament," said Mrs. White, "and I don't wonder their acts and history are recorded for our imitation and example."</p> 
               <p>Here Mrs. Dix interposed, and said ladies must defer the discussion to the next meeting, though she wished to say she had enjoyed the meeting highly, and at the next session she would try and give them an account of an eminent and true woman, in one of the largest towns in the Commonwealth, which she thought a very remarkable case.</p> 
               <p>This discussion had taken such a turn that Mrs. Parks and her little ones had nearly been forgotten after the first half hour, though the whole discussion arose from the interest the Circle manifested in the needle-woman</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN we left Mrs. Parks she was preparing to move, as we term it in the country. We now find her in a house barely tenantable, her furniture all neatly arranged, and every indication of contentment. She prepared Alice and Grace for the term of school which was just commencing, and with the care of little Fan, and with the work which was daily offered her, she found no time, and she had no heart for complaining. She cheerfully did what she could to-day, and let the duties of the morrow come in their course without any fear or apprehension she should not be able to discharge them. There is a great deal of unnecessary complaining in this life, and many burdens (as they are termed) are made heavier by the spirit and temper with which they are borne. Life is pleasant to those who feel pleasant. The poor can enjoy life, while "the eye of the rich is never satisfied with riches, and there is no end to his labor." It is not much which the soul wants in this life. Reconciliation to the dispensations of Providence will give peace, which neither riches, honor nor distinction can impart.</p> 
               <p>Many neighbors, as they called and witnessed the constant plying of the needle and the cheerful countenance, wondered how it could be, but when Alice and Grace returned from school, and the mother and her children were together, they could have seen the impelling power. Nature has done all which is necessary for the preservation of all the species, by planting in the mother a love which has no fear, and which<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5572-00000018"/> is bounded only by the endurance of nature itself. Alice and Grace were prompt at school, and prompt to return, for they wanted to see mother and little Fan more than the toys and attractions on the way. They had also many and amusing incidents to relate, for they observed and remembered too, and their mother always listened to what seemed of interest to them, though it might not have much importance or significance in itself. A person at all acquainted with children must have marked how much enjoyment some will derive from the little incidents of the day, while others will see nothing, and, if possible, know less. These little girls seemed not to let anything pass unnoticed, and when together with mother, they would talk by the hour with the greatest enjoyment and pleasure.</p> 
               <p>A lady once remarked to the writer, that she had been greatly amused witnessing how much they had to say when they ran home, and how interested they were in everything. If they came home from an evening meeting, she said they would know everything that was said, and who said it. Mrs. Parks listened to the sayings of her children. She was interested in everything which interested them; and in everything of interest or importance in the village. She could rejoice in the success and prosperity of others, if the hour of midnight found her busy completing the work, which she had promised in the morning.</p> 
               <p>Many a mother may have wondered why her children were not better talkers, little thinking that when they were young and they came to her with a story or incident, which to them was of much consequence, she repulsed them in such a way that they ran away, and said to themselves, I'll never tell mother anything again. If mothers would have their children talk, they must talk with them, and give them their confidence<pb n=""/> dence. A mother never lost anything by showing her children that she had confidence in them. The old saw, "Little pitchers have great ears," has done more mischief than all the pitchers with great ears have been worth for a century. Nothing makes children more hidden and disagreeable than the habit of distrusting them, and hiding from them in such a manner as to convey to their mind the conviction that mother has no confidence in them. How many children have caught the air of the sweet song of "A Bonnie Lass," when in the nursery, and have themselves charmed the world with their song, and all because they had a sweet songster in a sweet nurse.</p> 
               <p>Hours, days, months, years, swiftly pass. To the diligent and industrious they pass pleasantly. If the mind and hands be constantly occupied, there is no danger of ennui.</p> 
               <p>Alice soon began to be of some assistance, while Grace, if even some plain work to do, would be sure to devour every book within her reach, before her work was done. There is as much difference in children of the same family, as there is in the stars of Heaven for magnitude. They may look alike but when the astronomer points out their position, their magnitude, their velocity and power, their difference is apparent, while the great mass of the world know not one from the other. Alice and Grace had the full advantages of the town schools, but they were preparing for different positions, though they knew it not. They early began to realize how diligently and how constantly their mother worked, and how patiently she fitted them for school. They were considerate. They seemed to realize how important it was for them to improve every hour. Example has more power than precept.<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5572-00000019"/> They could not see their mother at work when they retired at night, and again when they rose in the morning, without knowing it was in part for them, neither could they help seeing how gratified their mother was with the weekly reports of their teachers, and also in having them say to her: "in a little while, mother, we shall be out of school, and then you won't have to work so hard, nor so late." Years passed. There are few incidents in the life of a working-woman which can interest the general reader. The duties of to-day do not vary much from the duties of to-morrow. Mrs. Parks had resolved what to do, with a full understanding that it could only be accomplished with untiring industry, and the strictest economy. She would gladly have gratified her daughters with many things which they would have enjoyed, but which were not absolutely necessary for their comfort.</p> 
               <p>They early learned their mother was at work for them and everything they had she earned, and they considerately refrained from asking for many things which they desired, because they knew it was not in her power to grant them. They were thus early trained to habits of economy, as well as diligence and industry.</p> 
               <p>They had now lived in a house for several years which was hardly tenantable, but less and less comfortable from year to year. Alice and Grace began to feel that their house was not fit to live in, and they talked about it to their mother and among themselves, and finally concluded they would see their early friend and ask his advice about moving into a house, the rent of which was considerably more than their present tenement. One day when he was on the promenade busily talking with some men, he saw, upon the opposite promenade, Mrs. Parks and her daughter Grace evidently waiting<pb n=""/> for some purpose, he thought probably to see him. At the earliest convenient moment he crossed to them, when they met him with a cheerful "Good Morning."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks said "We were waiting to see you-the tenement we occupy is much out of repair, and there is another tenement which we can have, but the rent is higher, and Grace wanted me to see you, and ask your advice about our taking it. The children are earnest to have me move, for they think we should enjoy ourselves much better down there, and be much more comfortable, but I didn't like to incur any additional expenses."</p> 
               <p>"Take it by all means," he said, "Mrs. Parks, and I will be responsible for any sum you may need to meet your rent."</p> 
               <p>Grace stood by her mother. She listened, she watched every feature, but said not a word. Her countenance told the feelings of her heart. It spoke volumes of delight, and her first utterance as she met Alice and Fanny, was "We are going to move."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I am so glad," and they clapped their hands with such joy as children only can express. Men are oftentimes rewarded for their acts in this life. This man could hardly <choice>
                     <sic>had</sic>
                     <corr>have</corr>
                  </choice> a better reward than the pleasure which he had given others that hour. He really enjoyed it, and remembers it to this day with the liveliest satisfaction. The moving was soon over, and the needle was plied hour after hour, and day after day with such diligence as would astonish most women and with such endurance as most people believe nature could not sustain. Few people know what they can do till they try, and many persons have been surprised at their success, and the amount of endurance their system would sustain. Few people suffer from work-other<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5572-00000020"/> causes bring suffering. Habits have more to do with it than work. The laboring man works his ten hours, the business man, the professional man, the man of science and letters find fifteen to eighteen hours per day gives them no more time than their business or <choice>
                     <sic>persuits</sic>
                     <corr>pursuits</corr>
                  </choice> require. Many persons spend more time in doing nothing, than they do in doing something, and if they were told how much of their time was spent in idleness, they would charge the informer with want of veracity, if not with actual slander. The secret of success is diligence, and the reason so many accomplish little or nothing is that they spend their time in doing nothing, and before they get ready to work their life is spent.</p> 
               <p>The needle-woman was untiring. The hours she worked would surpass belief, still, she might be found watching in the sick chamber oftener than most women, and was ever ready to lend a helping hand to those in distress. Had she been as some women are, she would have spent half her time telling what a hard time she had, and how much she suffered, and her treasures would have been half fed and half clothed.</p> 
               <p>She never complained. She had no cause of complaint as she saw Alice improving every day, and knew Grace was at the head of her class at school, and as little Fan became more interesting every day, and of less care. What had she to complain of? Of work? That never hurts any body. That never brings want, penury or misery. That never prevents a man from enjoying his meals or a night's sleep. In large cities many needle-women may suffer from want of adequate compensation for their work, and from unhealthful quarters.</p> 
               <p>Alice begins to look forward to the time when she shall<pb n=""/> leave school and help her mother. Grace has been told she must prepare herself for a teacher. She comprehends the whole meaning and reason of it, and loses no time. Fanny is the idol of them all, and she has been running to the primary school for a year, and looks for all the world as bright, as pretty, as cheerful, as happy as the daughters of the minister, the doctor or lawyer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN the Sewing Circle separated, they were commenting on the book of Ruth, and Mrs. Dix promised them a story which she knew to be true. In the interval they had searched the scriptures some, particularly the old testament, some of whom had not read it for years, and the prayer of Hannah, and the courtship of Ruth was as new to them as the whole Bible is to some learned and scientific men, who never read it, and do not know what it teaches.</p> 
               <p>They were on tip-toe to hear Mrs. Dix's story. They were fond of entertaining, and of being entertained, and all except Mrs. Smith, who had no children, enjoyed a laugh, a joke or a frolic. Sometimes the old folks will beat the young people all hollow in carrying on, and when they once get started, they keep on till they are weary, worn and tired. We like to see old folks happy, cheerful and gay, and we always give a wide berth to a morose old fellow. We occasionally pass people unnoticed, because they are always growling, never satisfied with themselves nor any body else. This is a very nice little world to live in, if everybody would keep good natured, but some people get rich and become top heavy and oppressive. Some are grasping and ugly generally, others are purse proud and have no manners, think they can look down upon neighbors who have no money, not thinking they can't by any possibility elevate themselves to the moral and intellectual position which many poor men sustain<pb n=""/> tain. This is a pleasant world to those who feel pleasant and know how to enjoy it.</p> 
               <p>"Come Mrs. Dix, you promised us a story at the last meeting."</p> 
               <p>"I was a little excited then, and don't know as I ought to tell it."</p> 
               <p>"We have your promise."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I'll tell it, if you will agree it shall go no further."</p> 
               <p>"Agreed all round."</p> 
               <p>Now what force there is in an agreement not under seal in a Sewing Circle, or the Benevolent Society, those can judge who are members thereof, at any rate we were not parties to any such agreement, and didn't hear Mrs. Dix or any of the Sewing Circle report the story, but we had it from a distinguished lawyer, and every-body knows that they tell the truth. We have no doubt the story is true. Have you reader? If you have I hope you won't read it, for it is true, and can be proved by court and town records.</p> 
               <p>"Proceed, Mrs. Dix."</p> 
               <p>"About one hundred years ago, a woman in New England found herself married to an impotent man. She was a young woman of brains, of culture, refinement and taste; she moved in the first circles, and was an accomplished lady. To live with such a being was more than she could do, it was not in accordance with her judgment, her inclination, nor her sense of duty or propriety. She applied to counsel and the counsel applied to Court for a divorce. The fact appearing, her petition was granted, and she was free again. In the course of time, another suitor appeared, and she married a man this time by whom she had a large number of children, and among them four sons, and they became the first men of their day, one was an eminent jurist, and for many years occupied a<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5572-00000022"/> seat upon the bench in one of the first courts in the land. Another was a distinguished physician, with a name and reputation equal to any other man of his day. Another was a leading merchant, and had control of the wealth of millionaires, and was foremost in the improvement and manufactures of the land. Another was a lawyer of abilities, rather eccentric, and adopted some foolish and impracticable notions, but notwithstanding was highly esteemed and respected. Four more distinguished men can rarely, if ever, be found in one family. Of her daughters I know nothing personally. They married parties of whom I had no acquaintance, but have heard they were women of equal abilities with their brothers, who were marked men-representative men of their day. They had influence, power, character and position. Now do you think this woman did right in making the condition of her first husband known, and asking protection and separation from him?"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed we do," shouted the whole Circle.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Orne says, "Do you suppose I would live with a man if I could not have children by him?"</p> 
               <p>"What can life be worth," said Mrs. Taylor, "without the image, coming, and expanding with grace and beauty and love?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. White, "in this case we have evidence of the approval of heaven in the eminent men and women which were the fruit of the second marriage. Heaven smiles upon the obedient."</p> 
               <p>"I often think what my friend Mrs. Tyng said when she had lost two beautiful babes-sons they were," said Mrs. Hayes. "And when one and another called and condoled with her, and told her they were better off and happy in heaven. That afforded her no consolation. She wanted to<pb n=""/> see those babes, infants, boys, youth, young men, men, and after they had acted well their part in this life, they would be better fitted to praise God in the life to come. She had the heart of a woman, and expressed the feelings of a mother."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed she did," said Mrs. Upton. "There is only one way to live in this life. The Creator has pointed out that way, and it is our duty to walk therein. Life has its cares, its pleasures, and its pains. We cannot have one without the other, and if there is any pleasure in this life, the sweetest, the purest, the best, is associated with our children, who endear life to us all.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>ON the promenade, one beautiful day in June, Mrs. Taylor met Mrs. Hale: "Good morning, Mrs. Hale; a very pleasant morning."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, a pleasant morning to those who feel pleasant," says Mrs. Hale.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor was a bright, intelligent woman, kind, benevolent, thinking no evil, ready to give a helping hand in case of need; one of those women everybody likes, because she likes everybody; Of Mrs. Hale the reader may judge. She had an elegant mansion, splendid furniture, a <choice>
                     <sic>cariage</sic>
                     <corr>carriage</corr>
                  </choice>, horses, fine clothes, money.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Hale, how do you do?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm sick, this morning I had no appetite. I was at the table, but I didn't eat anything. I told Mr. Hale I would have the carriage and ride down in town, and here I am languid, irresolute, and miserable!"</p> 
               <p>"Why Mrs. Hale!" Says Mrs. Taylor, "You ought not to be so! You have everything, no children, and nothing to do but enjoy yourself."</p> 
               <p>"Enjoyment! I don't know what it means," said Mrs. Hale. "I am going home to dinner, but I don't believe I can eat the least thing. Then I shall take a lounge-perhaps fall asleep-then order the carriage; and at tea, sip a little, perhaps eat a little, and after tea perhaps Mr. Smith will call and talk politics with my husband till ten o' clock-then I will go to my room; and in the morning find myself<pb n=""/> as I did this morning with nothing to do and no motive to do it."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, Mrs. Hale, I think you make your case worse than it is. I don't think you are in very good spirits this morning."</p> 
               <p>And here comes Mrs. Parks, the needle-woman, who immediately says: "Good-morning ladies, a beautiful morning. How do you do, Mrs. Hale?"</p> 
               <p>"O, I am miserable!"</p> 
               <p>"How are your little girls?" says Mrs. Taylor.</p> 
               <p>"O, they are very well. Alice and Grace are at school and I left little Fan at home, while I ran up in town for a few minutes."</p> 
               <p>When Mrs. Hale says, "I believe your daughters are doing very well at school."</p> 
               <p>"I hope so," Mrs. Parks.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," says Mrs. Taylor, "my daughters are very fond of them, and everybody seems to be glad that they are doing so well. They must be a great comfort to you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ladies; I shouldn't know what to do without them. I am glad to meet you, ladies, but I must be at my work. Good-morning." And she trips along on the side-walk with the elasticity of a girl fifteen summers. She recognizes whomsoever she meets with a pleasant smile, and in a moment she is plying her needle, having been much refreshed by her morning walk.</p> 
               <p>She was hardly gone before Mrs. Hale exclaims, "How does that poor woman live?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, she lives by her needle, Mrs. Hale. How bright she looks! I shouldn't think she had any care, or was ever weary. Mrs. Hale, she works till ten or eleven and sometimes twelve o'clock at night; and then, in the morning, she will<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5572-00000024"/> have her daughters ready for school in season, neat and tidy, happy and bright as the morning!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't see how she does it." says Mrs. Hale. "But perhaps, if I had her health,----I told Mr. Hale this morning that if I didn't feel any better, I must go to the Beach, the Mountains or the Springs, where there was something to excite, to interest me."</p> 
               <p>"I believe you go every year, Mrs. Hale."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but this going to such places is just like everything else; after a while it becomes a monotonous way of living. Fashion is the greatest tyrant in the world; and she has the most subjects to do her reverence. It is fashionable to go to the Springs, the sea-shore and the Mountains. But what is fashion at such places-gayety, frivolity, dress, equipage, great men and little men, women dressed in silks and satins, ornamented with gold and diamonds, mothers marketing their daughters,-and when the excitement of the hour passes-what is it but mere vacancy!!"</p> 
               <p>"Indeed is it so, Mrs. Hale?" said Mrs. Taylor. "I never find time for such places. My little ones keep me busy, and Mr. Taylor's business is such, he can't leave it for fashionable resorts."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I sometimes wish" said Mrs. Hale, "I had never seen the Beach, the Springs or the mountains. I have seen fashionable people, pleasure-going people, people of caste and people of no caste,-the millionaire and the destitute-and there is not much difference; and if ever I envied any body, it is Mrs. Parks, with her three sunbeams, as she calls them. Then if I could walk home so quick, with such elasticity and firmness as she did, Billy and the carriage might leave for parts unknown and I should never inquire for him. She has three daughters; and she provides for them<pb n=""/> and herself with her needle; and when you meet her or go there with work, she never seems weary, languid or cast down, but she speaks so cheerfully and she is always so ready to work and appears so pleased, that it does one good to see her."</p> 
               <p>"It is so, Mrs. Hale, and I think things are pretty equally divided in this life; some seem to have everything but really have nothing, and others have nothing and seem to possess everything. It is later than I supposed it was, Mrs. Hale, and I must bid you good-morning."</p> 
               <p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Taylor." Billy opened the carriage door and Mrs. Hale crept in and he drove her home-she hardly knew why!</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor walks slowly along and thinks aloud: "Indeed," she talks to herself and says," some people don't enjoy anything; Mrs. Parks lives for her children-she works for them, she eats for them, she sleeps for them and she talks and laughs with them-and her life is pleasant, her food is sweet and her sleep, refreshing; she has an object, a motive, a purpose; at night her work is done, in the morning it begins. Mrs. Hale goes to bed because it is mid-night; she rises in the morning because the bell rings; she dresses because company may call; she rides because she has not energy enough to walk; she goes to the Springs because she enjoys nothing at home; she goes to the Mountains because she is tired of the Springs, and she goes to the Ocean because she has no taste for mountain scenery, and she goes home because she has no where else to go. And thus her life passes, without an object, without a purpose. She does not live-she only stays around. Active life is full of enjoyment; it nourishes, it cherishes, it sustains itself." And here Mrs. Taylor finds the door open and her husband and children<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5572-00000025"/> waiting for her and wondering why she staid so long. She says she was detained by Mrs. Hale, which satisfies them all.</p> 
               <p>No one found fault or complained at her house for sunshine reigned there. She was happy at home, she was happy at the sewing-circle, she was happy at church, she was happy everywhere, and consequently everybody was happy where she was. "The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her" and "her children rise up and call her blessed."</p> 
               <p>Since writing the above we took up a paper and read the following words, and we liked them so well, we copy them here, not knowing the author: "Many a child goes astray, not because there is want of prayer or virtue at home, but simply because home lacks sunshine. A child needs smiles as much as flowers need sunbeams. Children look little beyond the present moment: if a thing pleases, they are apt to seek it: if it displeases, they are prone to avoid it. If home is the place where faces are sour and words harsh, and fault-finding is ever in the ascendant, they will spend as many hours as possible elsewhere. Let every father and mother then try to be happy; let them talk to their children, especially the little ones, in such a way as to make them happy."</p> 
               <p>Here is developed the secret and misery in families. Here too, is the reason why boys never want to stay at home evenings; and here, also, why they prefer home to any other place. When a house is covered with clouds and darkness, no wonder the young avoid it; but when sunshine enters the doors, windows, and every crevice in the house, the young find no place so agreeable, so pleasant, so delightful as home.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>MRS. Hale, Mrs. Parks, and Mrs. Taylor met on the promenade. Mrs. Parks hurried home to her work; Mrs. Taylor met her happy family, always glad to see her; and Mrs. Hale rode off in her carriage. In a few days Mrs. Hale went to the Springs-but she was Mrs. Hale there. The place was changed, but not the mind or heart. She had been at home a few days, when Billy was ordered to have the carriage ready, and she rode down and around town, with no particular object, but faintly hoping something might attract her attention which would interest her, and with a sort of vacant stare she looked out of the carriage window and saw Mrs. Parks tripping along the sidewalk with her usual elasticity. She ordered Billy to stop the carriage and call her, and Mrs. Hale, after the usual salutations of the morning, and after inquiring for her health and the health of her daughters, said to her;</p> 
               <p>"Now, Mrs. Parks, I have been to the Springs-I have seen rich people-women covered with rings and diamonds, but I have seen no woman like you. I enjoyed being at the Springs a few days, but then it is only a whirl of excitement without any permanent satisfaction, and I am now, as I was before I left home, without any appetite, listless, lifeless, miserable. Now do tell me how it is you look so bright, walk so quickly, and always appear so cheerful and happy."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks looked at her with amazement, but her reply was ready and to the point.</p> 
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5572-00000026"/> 
               <p>"Come down," said she, "and take a needle with me from daylight till dark, till ten, eleven, and sometimes twelve o'clock at night, and I guess you would find a walk such a morning as this pleasant, and you would not care so much what you had for dinner, as you would to be sure you had enough of it. Those girls with which God blessed me, stimulate me to exertion, and I have great reason to be happy, grateful, that they have been spared to me. They will soon be in a condition to relieve me. I intend Alice shall leave school at the end of this term, and I expect Grace will enter the High School, and I hope she will soon be able to assist me in educating Fanny, whom I want to have a first-rate education. You know, Mrs. Hale, the greatest ambition of New England mothers is to educate their children, and I confess to having a full share of this ambition."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed Mrs. Parks," says Mrs. Hale, "I don't see how you have succeeded the last four or five years in sustaining yourself and your daughters, as you have."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Hale, you know God helps them who help themselves. He never seems to have anything to do with the indolent and idlers. After Mr. Parks died I confess I had some anxiety, but then I lost no time, and I now feel a good degree of confidence that I shall succeed in <emph>bringing up my daughters respectably</emph>, and I hope and trust I shall never regret the efforts I have made for them."</p> 
               <p>"I don't think you will, Mrs. Parks. Alice is a very good scholar, and I understand Grace is the first scholar in her class."</p> 
               <p>"Alice is my oldest, Mrs. Hale, and I had to call on her for many little things, which took her attention from her books; and I think she has done as well as any one could under the circumstances. She for the last year has helped<pb n=""/> me much. If I set Grace to do anything, I find her with a book at her side, and she'll do it, as soon as she has finished this part of the book, or her lesson, and I don't trouble her much, for her education will be worth more to her and to me than the little she can do for me now. So long as I hear good reports of her from school, I have not a heart to divert her attention from her books."</p> 
               <p>"You know, Mrs. Parks, Mrs. Smith wanted you to put your children out (as the term is) into good families."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks looked down either grieved or indignant, we thought a little of both, but in a moment she rallied and calmly said: "Mrs. Smith has no children. Such women can coolly calculate how much better children would be in other families, and think it easy for a mother to part with them, but then I don't think I could have done it. It was a great trial to lose my husband in mid-life, and <choice>
                     <sic>had'nt</sic>
                     <corr>hadn't</corr>
                  </choice> it been for my little ones to engage my sympathies, my affections, and to stir my energies within me, I must have sunk under it, but they have buoyed me up, and we have been able to keep together, and I trust we shall till they are able to take care of themselves."</p> 
               <p>Here Mrs. Parks said Mrs. Hale must excuse her, she left little Fanny at home alone, and she was seldom away so long when Fanny was alone.</p> 
               <p>Fanny was overjoyed when her mother arrived. She had been to the door a dozen times to see if mother was not coming, and wondered why she staid so long.</p> 
               <p>In a few months Alice left school, and Grace entered the High School on her marks, or merits, as it is termed. It is customary for the teacher of the Grammar School to mark the standing of her pupils, and at the end of the year those who have the necessary marks enter the High School, while<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5572-00000027"/> others must be examined, and if their examination is satisfactory, they are admitted.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks was pleased that Grace was one of the few who merited admission to the High School, and she told her she wanted her to fit herself for a teacher, to which Grace replied she would do her best.</p> 
               <p>The girls had always been the companion of their mother. They knew she had worked hard for them, and they <choice>
                     <sic>had'nt</sic>
                     <corr>hadn't</corr>
                  </choice> a heart to disobey or displease her. But Mrs. Parks was not without her trials. Girls at school form acquaintances and sometime attachments which grow and ripen with their years, and which are often productive of the most lasting and permanent happiness. Persons thus interested in each other will often strive to conduct themselves so as to be approved by each other. Young men are often kept from places and company which would be injurious to them by the attentions and affections of a pure minded sister or friend.</p> 
               <p>Alice could not help being acquainted with the lads at school and in the village, and it was not surprising at all, that one of them should show her marked attention, but he was not after the heart of her mother. Some mothers might have been pleased with him. Mrs. Parks was a woman of discrimination and judgment, and she told Alice she must not receive any attentions from John Russ. Alice would not offend her mother for all the Russes in Christendom. She loved her mother, and Grace and Fanny. How could she help it? <choice>
                     <sic>Had'nt</sic>
                     <corr>Hadn't</corr>
                  </choice> her mother endeared herself to her by every tie of nature, and <choice>
                     <sic>had'nt</sic>
                     <corr>hadn't</corr>
                  </choice> she witnessed her love for her by her efforts by day and by night for her, and were not they all one? Had they any purpose or desires except for each other? People in moderate circumstances often become devoted to<pb n=""/> each other, while the rich as often quarrel about their inheritance and many times become enemies.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks and her daughters had but one interest, one purpose, one motive. Mrs. Parks was always right in their eyes, and from her advice and counsel there was no dissent or appeal. So Mr. Russ' attentions were gracefully declined, but his mother was not easily pacified. She was a high-spirited woman, and she couldn't see why her son was not as good as Alice Parks, and her mother, his grandmother, joined with her. The old lady was vindictive. She was one of those women who are never satisfied-not reconciled. She didn't know but one honest man in her old age, and that is more than many people know. She, with Mrs. Russ, commenced a storm, which might have given Mrs. Parks much trouble and anxiety. They did not hesitate to do and say much, which was intended to disturb the equanimity of Mrs. Parks. But people in the right always have the advantage, while people in the wrong labor under great difficulties, which increase with the wrong-doing.</p> 
               <p>Up to this time Mrs. Parks had not an enemy. The whole village were her friends; consequently Mrs. Russ had no sympathy. She annoyed Mrs. Parks somewhat, and added to her care, but we don't choose to acquaint the reader with the means she used, because the reader can judge what women do when their pride is touched, and they can't help themselves. Suffice it to say, she and her mother soon found they were kicking against the pricks, and they soon gave up the chase with thorns in their feet. Mrs. Russ soon recovered from her disappointment, but the old lady felt the thorns in her feet to the ends of her death. The sequel was proof of Mrs. Parks' judgment and discrimination.</p> 
               <p>At another time, Grace came home from school and said<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5572-00000028"/> she had been invited to Joanna Hall's to a party, and she was going. Her mother looked up surprised. If you are willing, mother, was omitted entirely. Somehow she left that important part of the sentence off. Whether she had a presentiment or fear that her mother would not approve of her going to the party, and thus took upon herself the responsibility of deciding for herself, cannot now be told. Her mother calmly replied, "No, my daughter, I think it not best for you to go to her party." Grace went to her chamber, and in a few minutes returned, and seating herself upon the floor, proclaimed aloud that she was going to Joanna Hall's party. "I will go."</p> 
               <p>Here was some determination-some defiance, even. It was unusual. But her mother said, "No, my daughter, I think you had better not go." Grace says, "Yes, I will go." Here was danger of a conflict. There was no time for excitement. Mrs. Parks knew her daughter better than she knew herself. She laid aside her work, and said to her,</p> 
               <p>"You know, Grace, I am willing to indulge you in everything I can, but it is important you should be particular in selecting your associates, and Joanna Hall is not a proper person for you to select as a friend or intimate. She will have such company as you know is not suitable for you, and it would afford me great pleasure to have you go to her party, if I could think it would promote your happiness, but I think if you go, you will not like the company nor enjoy it. I don't like to say anything against any person, but you know how Joanna has her own way,-is not properly restrained, and sees such company as you would not, with my approbation." She then named several parties who would be there, rude, coarse and uncultivated. "I know Joanna well. I have seen her at her mother's. She has been indulged to<pb n=""/> injury. I know her character, taste and disposition. Her mother has no control over her. She is a wild, heedless girl, by no means fit for an associate for you. It would be pleasure to gratify you, Alice, and I would not deny you unless from a sense of my duty to you. I should be anxious and distressed all the afternoon, if I knew you were at her party. You must yield, my dear, to the wishes of your mother. If you love me, Alice, you will hear to me."</p> 
               <p>Alice rose, went to her chamber and her books, and said not another word about Joanna or her party. She comprehended her mother's objections. She cheerfully yielded. The thought she was there against the wishes of her mother, would deprive her of all ability to engage in their plays, the sports or the pleasures of the afternoon. She respected-she loved her mother, and her smile was worth more to her than the pleasures of an afternoon and evening party with any-with all the town. In after years she loved her mother more, if possible, for her counsel, her advice, her denial. Such is usually the judgment of riper years. We seldom hear an adult complain that proper discipline was administered him in his youth, while bitter has been the experience and severe and crushing the condemnation by the child of the parent who fostered his self-indulgence and left him unrestrained, till the prison, the gallows, the judgment, were upon him. The greatest enemy to a child is self-indulgence, unrestrained passions or uncontrolled gratification. Parents do not like to deny a child pleasures, which seem innocent, but which they would avoid and eschew if counsel were given them in kindness and love.</p> 
               <p>How often has the heart of a parent sank within him when told by the child, you ought to have taught me better. O, that I had told my child better, often has a parent exclaimed,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5572-00000029"/> when witnessing his degradation, his ruin; while many blessings have followed the parents who, with prudence, with caution and discretion, restrained and controlled their children.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>GRACE had entered the High School. She knew that her mother expected much of her, and that she looked forward with a good deal of interest to the day when she too would relieve her, and sustain herself and more too. Alice had left school young, that she might assist her mother in the support of Grace and Fanny. It must occur to the reader that the expenses of Mrs. Parks increased with the age of her daughters. It was therefore a great relief to have Alice to assist her, but we never know what will be on the morrow. Man proposes, God disposes. He smiles too upon and blesseth the widow and the fatherless.</p> 
               <p>In New England, towns are often divided into districts, and the stranger has often wondered for what use those one-story wooden buildings, 24x30 feet, were, which they saw at the corner of the streets every three or four miles, and when told they were school-houses, where the a, b, c's were taught the Adamses, the Warrens, the Hancocks, the Parsonses, the Storys, the Lincolns, the Jacksons, the Spragues, the Shaws, the Cushings, the Websters,-jurists and statesmen,-and the Edwardses, the Griffins, the Dwights, the Hopkinses, the Paysons, the Adamses, and Beechers,-divines of New England,-with many others of eminence and distinguished usefulness; they have passed along reflecting upon and commending the wisdom of the Puritans and the faith of the Protestants.</p> 
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5572-00000030"/> 
               <p>In one of these New England towns, where groves and fields alternate, where hill and dale give variety and beauty to the scenery, where the brooks wind through the valleys, and the trout sport in the morning sun and hide under the little cascades at the approach of the boys with their pin hooks, where the rosy cheek and sparkling eye give evidence of health and intellect, and where the boys and girls rise every morning with the rising sun in freshness and beauty, a young man had been elected by the fathers a committee to employ a school teacher and look after the prudential affairs of the district. If there was a suitable person in the district it was customary to offer her the school, otherwise seek one at a distance. In one of the High Schools in one of the large towns of New England, one April morning was heard a loud rap on the door, and Samuel Knox was bidden to open the door, when George Nye appeared and bid the Principal good morning, and immediately said he was school committee in -- village, and he wanted to hire a person to teach their summer school, and he came here to ask him to recommend some one as a teacher for them.</p> 
               <p>The Principal made some inquiries about the size and character of the school, and then looked over his list, and when his eye reached Alice Parks' name, he stopped. He knew something of the industry of her mother, as well as her circumstances and condition. He looked to Grace, and in a moment asked her if Alice would probably like to take the school, and she replied she thought she would, and the Principal said he would recommend her. Grace's eyes flashed, and her countenance told with how much interest and pleasure she heard the Principal recommend Alice. George took the name, the number and the street, and with a regular country bow, and with an open and honest thank you sir, he closed the door.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>In a few minutes he was in River Street and rang the bell at the house of Mrs. Parks, and with such force that it started Mrs. Parks, and she said to Alice, "do open the door and don't let that man pull the bell again, for if he does he may part the wire or take the bell with him." Alice dropped her work and opened the door, and there stood a good looking young man, who inquired if Miss Parks was within. Alice replied yes, and showed him into the workroom and went to her chamber for a moment. She supposed he meant her mother, so little distinction is usually made in the pronunciation of Mrs. and Miss.</p> 
               <p>George looked around and said "are you Miss Parks?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
               <p>"Well then, I am school committee in the District No. 1, in the village of -- about ten miles from here, and I came down to see the Principal of the High School, and he recommended to me Miss Alice Parks, but I thought she was a young woman."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks suppressed a smile and inquired about the school, the number of scholars, the wages, the term of the school, etc. etc.</p> 
               <p>He at once lighted up and assumed all the consequence necessary for a Prime Minister of England and said the number of scholars would not exceed thirty, wages four dollars per week and board, and term three months, perhaps four, but said he "we want a young woman."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks laughed and said she supposed her daughter Alice was the person recommended by the Principal of the High School, "I will call her."</p> 
               <p>When Alice appeared his countenance changed. He recognized the young lady who opened the door, and he was pleased with her appearance.</p> 
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5572-00000031"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks said, "This is my daughter, and she is thinking of taking a school this summer."</p> 
               <p>"She is young."</p> 
               <p>"Yes sir, she is seventeen."</p> 
               <p>"Well, that is a good age. When I was seventeen I was as smart as white oak." Mrs. Parks and Alice smiled, and he said, "I could cut my swarth with any man, and work from daylight till dark. Some old people may think seventeen too young, but I don't, and the High School man spoke so well of your daughter, that I am ready to hire her."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Alice, what do you think about it," said her mother. "The school is not very large."</p> 
               <p>"I don't know, I will do what you think best."</p> 
               <p>"You may act your pleasure about it. Perhaps as you want to keep school you won't have a better opportunity."</p> 
               <p>"You say, sir, you will pay four dollars per week and board, and the term will be three, perhaps four months. Do you pay expenses up?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't think we do, we have usually had a teacher in the village, and that matter has never been a part of the wages, but I guess I will venture to pay your fare, unless some of us should be down, then you could ride up without expense."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if you think best mother, I will venture to engage it. I have been to -- and I think it a very pleasant place."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we think it pleasant, and it is very healthful."</p> 
               <p>"When will your school begin?"</p> 
               <p>"The first Monday in May."</p> 
               <p>"I shall have to go up Saturday, then."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and I will pay your fare up, or send for you. Let us see, the first Monday in May we farmers are pretty busy, and it may be inconvenient to come down at that time, so you may take the stage Saturday, and call at Parson Kelly's,<pb n=""/> and he will inform you where to go, and I'll have all matters arranged, and perhaps meet you there."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks kept her needle running, for she had long since learned to work and talk at the same time.</p> 
               <p>The young man was pleased with the appearance of both Mrs. Parks and her daughter, and he rather liked it that he was introduced into the work-room and not into the parlor, and he went on to say he was twenty-one last January, and they chose him committee the first meeting after he was twenty-one, and he felt a little proud of it, and he hoped they would be satisfied.</p> 
               <p>Alice said she would do the best she could.</p> 
               <p>"Well I guess you will do well. That High School man thought you would do first rate, he wouldn't recommend anybody else till I had seen you, and I guess he hit right the first time."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks laughed, Alice smiled and blushed, when George said-</p> 
               <p>"Seems to me you is pretty smart with that needle, I guess you have sewed some before to-day."</p> 
               <p>"O yes," says Mrs. Parks, "I have taken a good many stitches in my day."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you is smarter than our folks, though we call ourselves pretty smart."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks and Alice had hard work to suppress a broad laugh, when George says,</p> 
               <p>"I can always tell when father hires a man whether he is good for anything or not, as soon as I see him handle the farm tools, and I think you handle that needle pretty cute."</p> 
               <p>"It is a great deal in use, sir."</p> 
               <p>"So it is in everything. Well I guess I must be going, you will be on hand now, Miss-"</p> 
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5572-00000032"/> 
               <p>"Yes sir, I'll be there Saturday before the first Monday in May."</p> 
               <p>Then Alice shew him the door very civilly, and he bid her good-day and departed. Alice and her mother now made up for all the laughing they had suppressed, when Mrs. Parks said-</p> 
               <p>"He is an honest fellow, I have no doubt."</p> 
               <p>In a few minutes Grace came rushing into the room, and cried out,</p> 
               <p>"Mother, has there been a man here to hire Alice to keep school?"</p> 
               <p>Alice had just gone up stairs. Her mother said-</p> 
               <p>"Yes. Where is she?"</p> 
               <p>"Is she going?"</p> 
               <p>And before her mother could reply she was up stairs, and told Alice what the master said to her, and how pleased she was, and they talked about school-keeping, going away from home, and how soon she should be old enough to keep school. It was too bad that her mother had to work so hard for them. She meant to study all she could, and she didn't believe but what she could get through the High School in two years, though three years was the usual term.</p> 
               <p>"You know, Alice, those girls up there don't study as you and I do, and I can keep ahead of them all the time."</p> 
               <p>"I hate to go away from home, Grace," said Alice. "But I think we ought to do our best, for certainly mother has done her best for us. Little Fan is growing up fast, and she is a bright little scholar, and mother wants her to have a first rate education, and I hope she will."</p> 
               <p>The girls were now summoned to dinner, and Fan cried out as she saw Grace-</p> 
               <p>"There has been a man here and hired Alice to go and<pb n=""/> keep school. I heard all they said, though I didn't say a word. I didn't go to school this forenoon, because I didn't feel very well."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry you wasn't well, Fanny."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I am better now, and I am going to school this afternoon."</p> 
               <p>At dinner Alice told Grace all the committee-man said and did, and they enjoyed it hugely. Mrs. Parks could but laugh when Alice came to the white oak, and her sewing. Grace joined with her, and they had rather a merry dinner that day. Fanny laughed with the others, and said she guessed that man liked Alice pretty well. They all looked at her and smiled. Grace heard the school-bell, and she was in her seat in time.</p> 
               <p>She had no sooner met the eye of her teacher, than he went to her and asked her what success the young man had with Alice. She told him the whole story. He said he was pleased, and that Alice would make a good teacher. Grace was pleased, and commenced preparation for her afternoon exercises with more than usual diligence.</p> 
               <p>It is hardly worth while to detain the reader with the account of the next four weeks spent in this family. At the appointed day Alice was ready. The parting for the first time was a little sad, though they told Alice to be of good cheer. A kiss, good morning, and a look, and the stage took Alice to her new duties, new cares, and new work. In the mean time, George had called at the minister's on his return, and gave him an account of his success, and he felt his importance as he never had before, and as he never will again. As soon as he got home, and had finished his supper, he told his sister Mary what great things he had done. She laughed at him, and he went to bed.</p> 
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5572-00000033"/> 
               <p>Before the time arrived, however, George had made all the arrangements for the school, and instructed the stage-driver where to call for the teacher, and where to leave her to board the first week. Now I suppose the reader must know that in some of the districts in New England, it was customary for the teacher to board round-that is, one week with Mrs. Sargent, one week with Mrs. Jones, and thus nearly every family would give the district the board of the teacher one week, and all the school-money-that is, all the money raised by taxation for the support of schools-would be applied to pay the teachers and incidental expenses, and in this way the school would be protracted one month or more. It was not so pleasant for the teacher sometimes, but they generally fared better than they would at one house. Women are sometimes a little ambitious. Each family must provide for the teacher as well as her neighbor, and the best the house could afford.</p> 
               <p>But it was difficult for the teacher to navigate around the shoals of a school district without giving offence, but Alice had seen many women, who came to her mother to have work done, and who occasionally had a word to say about their neighbors, but it didn't do any hurt if not repeated, and she had from her childhood been instructed not to repeat anything she might hear Mrs. Chase or Mrs. Nichols say against others, and she could hear what each one had to say about the minister's children and others, and not remember a word of it to repeat.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>PERHAPS the most embarrassing hour with the teacher is the first hour, or day, at church-when the whole congregation seem to gaze upon the stranger teacher-and the safest way is to fix the eye upon the preacher and listen to every word. Alice made up her mind when she went to church to give her whole attention to the preacher, and not see others looking at her. This was an easy task and she did it to perfection.</p> 
               <p>On the return from church, little was said about the sermon-but one and another had a word to say about the school-teacher. Mrs. Kent said, "Parson Kelly had one hearer to-day that fixed her attention on him." Mrs. Vose said she looked towards the teacher, and she seemed to look the minister in the eye, "and I guess he won't complain of one of his hearers to-day!"</p> 
               <p>"For my part," said Mrs. Todd, "I wanted to see what kind of a looking teacher we had; you know, Mrs. Vose, we can judge something by the looks and appearance."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we can;" replied Mrs. Vose, "and I formed a very favorable opinion of her. Her appearance indicated that she had been in good society, and I think her manners and conduct in church were very much in her favor."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my little girls could not keep their eyes off of her, and I reckon they will have a lesson on manners and behavior in church and I shall make their school-teacher the foundation of my remarks. Only last year, a stranger was visiting<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5572-00000034"/> ing here, and she came to church with her silks and satins and her trail and ribbons and gewgaws, and she looked and appeared ridiculously, if not contemptibly, and I was disgusted with her. She looked all about the church, evidently to see who was looking at her. She appeared as vain, as light and trifling as the gewgaws and butterflies about her head. I would have called on her, out of politeness to my friend, Mrs. Page, but I concluded I didn't want her acquaintance. It is strange some people think they can appear in church as they can in a ball-room, or at a cotillon party! The church is no place in which to make a sensation, and those persons who have so little sense of propriety as to attempt it, only prove that they are empty, giddy and senseless and know nothing of the proprieties of life. Our teacher was dressed plain, neat and well, and she conducted herself with propriety; I couldn't but contrast her dress and appearance with that fashionable gewgaw lady, who was here last summer. If <emph>she</emph> was a fair sample of fashionable ladies, I am glad they so seldom enter our church. Uncle Jerry used to say there was propriety in all things,-and there is propriety in going to church arrayed in modest apparel, and not in purple and fine linen."</p> 
               <p>I wonder how these ladies, arrayed in their long trails and embroidery, feel, when they unite with the minister in asking the Lord to "clothe them with humility, as with a garment;" what kind of an article of humility would that be which is compared to their purple, and silks, and ribbons? and again, "help us to take our proper places in the dust, before Thee!" how would their long trails, and silks and satins with low necks and bare bosoms appear in the dust before the Lord! What show would they make, and how would their prayer be regarded by the "searcher of hearts," who<pb n=""/> knoweth all things? <emph>As one that mocketh?</emph> And when the poor, humble and penitent Christian appears before the Lord to commemorate His undying love, and as he sees, with an eye of faith his beloved Redeemer crucified and slain for him, how do these sinners in gorgeous robes appear? They think they are Christians; perhaps they are,-but then they chill the humble Christian. Their light is darkness-and how great is that darkness! and their salt is <emph>without savour!</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>We have "switched off" again; one thought suggests another, and we find ourselves out of sight of our needle-woman and her daughters; but Alice was shown the school-room by George, who had everything in readiness; the little ones came in and selected their seats and gave their names, and Alice gave them their lessons,-and in an hour or two, the school was in good running order. It was not many days before Alice could call all the children by name, and they read and prepared their spelling lessons and did just as the reader did and other children, when they were little ones and went to school.</p> 
               <p>It is customary for the minister to visit the school during the first or second week of the term and make such remarks as he deems fitting the occasion. The minister was so well pleased with the appearance of the teacher at church, that he was prepared to be equally pleased with her and her school, and though he could not well judge of the school the first week, he was so well satisfied that he was ready almost to guarantee its success this summer; he probably would, hadn't he been a minister of great propriety. He, however, ventured to congratulate George on his success, which elevated him a little higher than he was the other night, when he went to bed. Alice had a little pride, a little ambition, a good deal of character, and she determined to do her best,<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5572-00000035"/> and as the children returned home, the parents liked their account of the teacher, and as she left family after family, week after week, she left friends, and no one to criticise her manners, habits or character. The children soon began to tell how they liked the teacher, and if the children liked, the mother did, also. It is but a little way from the heart of the child to the heart of the mother.</p> 
               <p>Four weeks had now passed, and though they had been long weeks to Alice, they were full of interest. George's duty as Committee was to furnish water-pail, dipper and broom, see that the glass was mended and keep the house in repair. To all these duties he was faithful, and he thus became necessarily acquainted with the teacher; in fact, she was instructed to call on him for books for the poor children and other necessaries of the school room. It was customary for people who lived within ten or twelve miles of the town to visit it once in four or five weeks, to purchase many necessaries which were not kept in the small country store. George found that he wanted some seeds and a few other things and that he must go to town, and, strange as it may seem, it occurred to him that Alice might like to ride down with him and see her mother and sisters; so, without doubting the propriety of riding to town with her, he informed her that he found it necessary to go to town, Saturday, and he could carry her down, just as well as not, to see her mother and sisters. Alice didn't stop to think a minute and said she would go. George told her she might dismiss the school Friday night and the next Saturday keep all day; an arrangement not uncommon in the country.</p> 
               <p>Now a ride of eight or ten miles with a well-informed and cultivated young woman has no particular incidents connected with it which could interest the general reader. He can<pb n=""/> probably remember when he didn't object to such a ride himself. Alice anticipated so much pleasure in being at home a few hours, that the ride was delightful to her-and she alighted at the door of her mother with a lighter heart than she ever possessed before. She rushed into the house, while George was tying his horse, and embraced mother and sisters too,-the reader knows <emph>how</emph>-and then rushed to the door and conducted George to the work-room, where they were all very civil and polite to him. He, however, had business on hand, and he informed Alice he would call for her about three o'clock. He could not be persuaded to dine with them; he knew very well that they would enjoy the few hours together and he didn't wish to interrupt that enjoyment.</p> 
               <p>They had asked her all sorts of questions about her school,-how she liked 'boarding-round,'-and how she did, and when she did, and what she did, and where she did. She answered their inquiries and told them how very civil and polite the minister was to her; that she was very fond of her little school; that she had not heard any complaint, and she guessed she was getting along very well. But Grace wanted to know something of this young man, who, when he was seventeen, was "smart as white oak,"-an expression which had made a deep impression on her mind. Alice merely said he was coming to town and she wanted to see them so much she couldn't refuse so good an opportunity, and she had nothing more to say.</p> 
               <p>There are times in the history of young people when they have nothing to say. George had hired her to keep school and consequently felt interested in her success. He had invited her to ride to town with him and that didn't warrant her in saying any more, and she hadn't any more to say; still, the looks, the appearance, the manner of George might mean<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5572-00000036"/> more, and it might not. His sister, Mary, was kind and attentive and made herself agreeable. She could but notice this; it might be only her native politeness, still, she made up her mind to form her opinion of these people and keep something to herself she'd scarcely tell to any.</p> 
               <p>The hour of three arrived. Fanny ran to the door and gave notice the wagon was ready, and off Alice went with a light heart and merry countenance. Mrs. Parks, Grace, and little Fan watched her as far as the eye could reach and threw kiss after kiss to her, and then returned to the work-room.</p> 
               <p>The neighbors knew that Alice had been at home, and, as they ran in and inquired for her and her school, Mrs. Parks and Grace told them about Alice, the school, the minister and boarding-around; and Fanny asked "why they didn't tell about the white oak,-she should think they had told them everything else," when Mrs. Parks and Grace laughed, and Mrs. Parks gave them the white oak and George in full; and a happier circle was not to be found in the palace of kings nor among the potentates of the earth.</p> 
               <p>There is a depth of enjoyment, a sincerity, a mutual union with the industrious and virtuous poor which the rich and fashionable never possess and cannot attain. I heard a lawyer of ability and learning say that "if he could only have the enjoyment which his neighbors had in their praying circle, he would give anything he possessed;" but he knew not the peace of mind which submission and reconciliation secures, nor the power and music of the words, <q>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>YOUNG people will do much as did their parents. Alice continued to do her duties at school very acceptably. Her mother heard from her often and her letters gave evidence of contentment, which was very gratifying. She wrote about herself, her school and the village,-but she said nothing of George, except that she had a very pleasant ride home, as she then termed it. George, however, seemed to make the most of his office, and he left nothing undone which a prudential school-committee ought to do, and it so happened that in a few weeks-not exceeding four-he was done haying and business called him to town again; and he talked to himself:-"I wonder if Alice would ride to town with me again! I don't see why I should go alone. She had a pleasant ride before, I know, for she said she did," and then if he went to town, he must call at her mother's and if asked why he didn't bring Alice with him, he should not know what to say; and he guessed he would venture to ask her to go with him. George came out of his reverie, and he met the teacher and asked her to ride to her mother's again.</p> 
               <p>"O," said she, "I should love to go,-but don't Mary want to go?"</p> 
               <p>George said "he guessed not."</p> 
               <p>"Why, she hasn't been to town since I have been here, and I know she would like to go with us,"-and before George had time to interpose a word, she found Mary and told her<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5572-00000037"/> George had asked her to go to town with him and she thought <emph>she</emph> would like to go. She said she should, if George would like to have her.</p> 
               <p>In a minute, Alice met George and Alice said, Mary <emph>would</emph> like to go with them.</p> 
               <p>George looked at Mary; she read him at once: he didn't want her to go. But just then, before Mary had time to say a word, her mother spoke up and said: "I think you had better go, Mary. I want to send for a number of little things, which you know George can't buy."</p> 
               <p>There it was-not another word! George said, "Well, girls, be ready by seven o'clock, for it is warm weather and I want to get in town before the sun gets very high."</p> 
               <p>In the morning they were all prompt, and at seven o'clock the driver's seat was made and off they went. Sallie Rice had not a word to say, for if George and Mary were going to town, it was proper and right for them to ask the teacher to go with them, as she hadn't been home but once in weeks.</p> 
               <p>Now there are not many incidents in a ride of ten or twenty miles of much interest, though sometimes they are pregnant with great events. Alice chatted by the way and made herself as agreeable as possible. Mary laughed and talked too. George drove the horse and occasionally remarked it was rather warm. Alice rallied him occasionally, spoke of his beautiful horse and horsemanship in the pleasantest terms, hoped he was not crowded, told him she was having a splendid ride and it was very kind in him to ask her to ride to town with Mary. George looked around to Mary and said nothing; but his countenance spoke-there was meaning in his face-and Mary burst out into a broad laugh, which rather puzzled Alice and she asked Mary what she was laughing at.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"O, I was only laughing at George."</p> 
               <p>Before anything more was said, they were in the village. The people on the side-walks, with their quick step and careworn countenances, the horses and carriages in the streets and the goods displayed from the shop-windows engrossed their whole attention till George stopped the horse at the door of Mrs. Parks. Alice had hardly alighted before her mother, who felt that somebody had stopped at her house, dropped her work and was at the door. Mary was introduced and cordially invited in, when George was told she was glad to see him again with such emphasis and in such a manner that he knew she was glad to see him as well as Alice and Mary. George was about turning his horse when Mrs. Parks invited him to dinner, but he excused himself, said he must put up his horse, and he guessed he would dine at the hotel; when Mrs. Parks said she wished she had a place for his horse; and away he went, having arranged that the girls should be ready at five o'clock, when he would call for them.</p> 
               <p>Alice was delighted at being with her mother again, and after inquiring for Grace and little Fan, who were at school, and after seeing her mother and her mother had seen her, and after Mary and Alice had told Mrs. Parks about the school, and Alice had inquired for the minister and his family and all her friends, and Mrs. Parks had given all the news that occurred to her, and they had spent an hour in the most free, agreeable and social manner possible, Alice and Mary wanted to buy a few things for her mother; but before they went shopping she guessed they would run up to the High School and see Grace and Master Brooks, and she looked for the time and said they should just get there at recess; off they went.</p> 
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5572-00000038"/> 
               <p>Grace met them at the gate and they embraced each other as only loving sisters can. As soon as practicable, Mary was introduced to Grace, who invited her into the schoolroom, and to Master Brooks, when he inquired of Alice about her school,-how she liked boarding around, and interested them in inquiries and remarks peculiar to a schoolmaster, when the bell rang. Alice thanked him very kindly for his recommendation of her. Mary made bold to tell him that she gave entire satisfaction to the whole district. He said he was very glad, but he knew she would and then he turned and told Grace he guessed she wouldn't object to being excused for the rest of the forenoon. She smiled, thanked him and away they went.</p> 
               <p>In a few minutes they were in a millinery shop,-then in a dry-goods store and then in another and another till they had visited the most important ones in town and had inquired for all they wanted and many more things they did not want at each store saying they guessed they would look a little further and then, perhaps, call again, and thus they went the rounds. Mary was greatly pleased; she had seen what she wanted at several places, but she hadn't bought a thing-and she had seen the new goods and the fashionable things in all the stores in town,-and now, as they returned to the stores where they intended to buy, the clerks felt sure of a sale.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you couldn't find any better bargains than I offered you; could you?"</p> 
               <p>"We thought we would look at some of your goods again."</p> 
               <p>And now they called for what they wanted only, purchased them at several places and ordered them sent to the house of Mrs. Parks, River Street. As they started for the house<pb n=""/> Mary said "it was too bad to make the clerks take down so many goods for the few things we wanted."</p> 
               <p>"O," Alice said, "they liked to show us the goods, for ever so many persons ask mother where they can buy this, that and the other, and they all like to have her know what they have. She works for so many people, and buys a great many things for other people herself; and they are always very civil to us."</p> 
               <p>Mary was satisfied, and as they looked up they saw little Fanny running up to meet them, who caught Alice by the hand, and hopped and skipped along their side as happy as the happiest, and as bright as the morning glory.</p> 
               <p>When the girls went into the house they found dinner all ready for them, and in a few minutes they were at the table enjoying it, and giving an account of their forenoon's experience. Mrs. Parks looked at Mary's purchases, and said she thought her mother would be satisfied, for they were very good goods.</p> 
               <p>After dinner the girls called to see Alice. They inquired about the school-if she wasn't homesick, and how long her school would be, and told her how glad they were to see her. Mary on every proper occasion told them they were very much pleased with their teacher, that she gave good satisfaction, and they had concluded to keep her four months. She said they hired their teacher for three or four months. If they didn't like them, they had only three months' schooling; but if they were satisfied with the teacher, they kept her four months, and she heard her father say they were to have four months' term this year. The girls thought that was quite a compliment. Alice said she had done the best she could. As one left another came and they received and entertained company that afternoon. When Mrs. Parks said<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5572-00000039"/> it was most five o'clock, and she guessed she would make a little tea and prepare some dry toast for them before they left, and she thought George would like some too. At five o'clock he was at the door tying his horse, when Mrs. Parks invited him in and told him they had some tea and dry toast which they would take before they left.</p> 
               <p>"Ain't the girls ready?" said he.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but I think they better have a little tea. Now come right in; don't say a word."</p> 
               <p>It was no use; and before he had time to consider his danger, he was at the table with Mrs. Parks, Alice and Mary, Grace and Fanny. Mary told him that she found everything her mother sent for, and he said he too had purchased what few necessaries they wanted, and he didn't think he should have to come to town again till they had finished harvesting. Then Grace undertook to bring him out a little, and said to him:</p> 
               <p>"Your sister says they like Alice pretty well up there."</p> 
               <p>He looked to Mary, to Alice, to Mrs. Parks, and finally said they did. He hadn't heard any complaint this summer.</p> 
               <p>"She says they have got a first-rate Prudential School Committee."</p> 
               <p>This was a little hard on him, but he said he had tried to do his duty. Mrs. Parks said a school depended a good deal upon whether everything was in readiness or not. If the poor children had their writing paper and books provided in proper season, and didn't have to wait till the class were half way through a book, it made great difference. George looked pleased, and Alice said she had no fault to find in that particular. Everything had been in season and in order. Grace said:<pb n=""/> "I don't know but what I shall want to keep school up there one of these days."</p> 
               <p>"Well," said he, "if I am committee, I'll hire you. I don't believe you can beat Alice, though."</p> 
               <p>"You don't know till I try," said she.</p> 
               <p>"Well," said he, "we shouldn't want to hire you but three months at first."</p> 
               <p>When they all laughed at Grace, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"Well, I would like to go on those terms."</p> 
               <p>They then left the table. The girls threw on their shawls and bonnets, Mrs. Parks thanked George very kindly for bringing her daughter and his sister there, and Fanny said,</p> 
               <p>"We are all greatly obliged to you-hope you will come again sometime."</p> 
               <p>"O yes, Mr. Nye, call when you come down in the fall, and we hope you will come with him, Miss Nye," said Grace. "We shall love to see you."</p> 
               <p>Good-bye, a kiss, and off they went, and in about an hour and a half drove home.</p> 
               <p>"Why, George," said Mrs. Nye, "I have been looking for you this hour. I never knew you so late before. Your father said he was afraid something had happened to you."</p> 
               <p>"Well," George said, "when a man goes off with two girls he is lucky if he gets back at all. I was surrounded down there, and had to stay their time."</p> 
               <p>Alice ran across the road to her boarding-house. Mary ran in and showed her mother her purchases. George went to the stable with the carriage and then to the pasture with the horse. He met his father, told him the price of oats and hay and potatoes in town.</p> 
               <p>"Lambs sell quick," said he "at fifteen to twenty cents per lb." Beef was high. Pork was eleven cents in the hog.<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5572-00000040"/> Butter quiet at forty cents, and cheese scarce at twenty, and he thought if prices kept up till winter, farmers wouldn't have any reason to complain this year. Mrs. Nye examined her cotton cloth, flannel and other articles which Mary purchased, and said they were just what she wanted. The old gentleman and George came in, and after sitting a few minutes, and after telling his father that Squire Hale had died a number of weeks ago, Mary read the nineteenth Psalm, the old gentleman fervently returned thanks for the blessings of the day, implored forgiveness of sins, and protection and blessing of God upon his household, and all for whom it was his duty to pray, and then they all quietly retired.</p> 
               <p>Monday morning, after George and his father had gone into the field, Mrs. Nye said to Mary, "What kind of folks are the Parkses?" Mary said Mrs. Parks appeared to be a very hard-working woman. "She supports herself and family with her needle. She has two daughters besides Alice: Grace and Fanny. Grace was in the High school, and Alice told me she was first scholar in her class; she has a fine head, a full eye and I should think would learn easy. Fanny, was a little, bright, frolicsome girl, sprightly, light hearted, and the youngest and favorite of them all. The neighbors ran in to see Alice and seemed to think a great deal of them. They occupy a part of the house and receive all the company in the work-room. They made no excuses or apologies, Mrs. Parks kept at work most of the time, and I liked them and think they are as respectable poor people as you often meet."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Nye said she was glad to hear about them, for she rather thought George had an eye on the teacher and she wanted to know more about them. "It is no objection<pb n=""/> that they are poor, if they are only industrious, truthful and honest."</p> 
               <p>"Well," Mary says, "you know everybody up here likes Alice and I know she could not come from any mean folks."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I wanted to know something more about them, and on that account, in part, I wanted you to go to town, and I am glad to get so good an account of them. You know George is young, very liable to be pleased with a pretty face, but I don't care how soon he gets married if he only marries a girl of good parentage and who knows the value of money and has good common sense, and of what I have seen of Alice, I should think her a very fine girl."</p> 
               <p>Mary said "I like her." She then put the cream into the churn, rolled it over and over and sang the Sicilian hymn and Dundee.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks was very much gratified with Alice's visit and what she learned from Mary and George about her school, and she told Grace she looked forward with a great deal of pleasure to the time when she could keep school also.</p> 
               <p>Grace said they require three years' study at the High school before they let them graduate, and she believed she could gain one year of the three: "For I don't have to study more than half of my time, and I might, just as well as not, take the studies of the next year and keep up with both classes."</p> 
               <p>Her mother said she wished she would.</p> 
               <p>The next day Grace told her teacher what she wanted to do. She thought favorably of it and spoke to the principal, who at once said "Let her try it."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks was now reaping the reward of her untiring industry, and her heart swelled with the pleasantest emotions as she heard the accounts of Alice's success and saw the<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5572-00000041"/> efforts which Grace voluntarily and so cheerfully made at her age to prepare herself also to relieve her mother.</p> 
               <p>Grace had a large, projecting forehead, a full, penetrating eye and a countenance expressive of great intellectual power. Her teachers had full confidence in her ability to complete the three years' course in two years, and were rather pleased that she had undertaken it. Teachers always have a preference for bright scholars,-they are no trouble to them and often stimulate the more moderate and less ambitious pupils. Grace had been under their instruction one full term of a third of a year when she proposed to prepare the lessons in the advanced classes, and they were confident she would perform what she had undertaken if her health was sufficient for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>HANNAH, Ruth, and Mrs. Dix's account interested the members of the Benevolent Society and they talked with each other at intervals, and some of them began to inquire why it was now so different from what it was in the days of our Fathers. Then, it was an honor to be a mother, but now,-how changed! Young men will say "Yes," as if it were no disgrace to them. They can't support children and some look upon the birth of a child as a calamity, or a burden! How came such a feeling to get possession of the minds of the young people of the present day? It is unnatural, and must proceed from a false view of life.</p> 
               <p>When the Society met, Mrs. White alluded to the subject before them at the two former meetings and said she thought those women were noble specimens, and, for her part, she wished there were more of them.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Hays said "There now seems to be a practice among young people of destroying or preventing the birth of children."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I think" says Mrs. Taylor, "such a practice is abominable."</p> 
               <p>"Abominable is too mild a term, Mrs. Hayes," says Mrs. White, "it is outright murder; and the physician, guilty of such practices, ought to be executed with the utmost despatch. By it, young women are losing their health, their spirits, their <emph>life</emph>, and are criminals in the first degree."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Orne asked for an explanation; she didn't fully understand<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5572-00000042"/> derstand the reasons of Mrs. White's remark. Mrs. White then explained, and said "few young married people, now-a-days, have children; and it is whispered around that physicians aid them in destroying, or preventing the birth of children."</p> 
               <p>. Mrs. Orne said she had heard intimations of the kind, but she did not suppose the practice general.</p> 
               <p>"I fear" says Mrs. Hayes, "that too many young women are led astray by cowardly and foolish husbands."</p> 
               <p>"I know" said Mrs. Orne, "that infanticide is said to be common among the heathen, but I should be slow to believe that such a practice prevails among Christian people."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor said she had heard more said about it of late than in all her life before. "It is but a few days since I heard that a young woman lost her life by an attempt to destroy her child,-and all because her husband said he didn't want children in the family, and, to gratify him she suffered one of these physicians to be called in, and the result was-she lost her life. And her husband, I suppose, will have the impudence to ask another innocent and beautiful girl to marry him, for the basest purposes."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Dix said this was a grave subject; she hardly dared to express her feelings. "The sin of such people will surely find them out, and the burden of their consciences will be greater than they can bear. Hannah was a representative character and she deserved all the glory which her name bears. But how can the young women of our day be regarded, who voluntarily become barren and a reproach among men?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor said a young woman of her acquaintance was at dinner, well and happy. In the evening the doctor informed the lady with whom she boarded that she was very sick,-her husband was with her, and she needed attention.<pb n=""/> 'You must be mistaken, doctor, it isn't an hour since I saw her and she never appeared better.' 'Depend upon it, Madam, she is very sick,'-and true enough, sick she was, unto death; and in two days she was a corpse,-murdered by the man who first announced her illness. At the earnest and urgent solicitation of her husband she assented,-for a few dollars a physician was found, base and abandoned, and she and her child were <emph>murdered</emph>.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Doe knew of a case, when a young woman was the mother of four children, she conceived the idea that she would not have any more; she saw some prescription advertised and without the knowledge of her friends, she procured it and dropped dead in her room.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Thorn said she had known of several cases, "but immediate death does not always follow; long and lingering illness is the result of such practices, and I should rather bury a daughter than have her guilty of such crimes and thus linger with broken spirits, shattered constitution and a conscience burdened beyond endurance."</p> 
               <p>No subject had ever been introduced into the sewing circle which made such impression. They reflected, they considered and case after case came rushing into their minds where the health of beautiful young women had <choice>
                     <sic>began</sic>
                     <corr>begun</corr>
                  </choice> to fail them and they looked pale, cadaverous, were often ill and no satisfactory cause had been assigned for it-and if this were the cause, it was time it be known and such persons marked as a disgrace to their species. It is rank rebellion against Nature and Heaven, and the curse of disobedience will soon overtake them. The young people of the present day are fashionable, cultivated, Christian,-Ah! how impotent is language, sometimes, to give expressions or impressions! The power of Heaven only can impress the mind<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5572-00000043"/> and heart fully and adequately, in view of such many times inconsiderate criminality.</p> 
               <p>Here the Society were about separating, but they lingered; they were in a different state of mind from what they were usually. A new and untried subject was before them. They usually have what is called a fine time: they talked about all the interesting incidents of the day,-sometimes about the minister and his family,-sickness and poverty came in for a large share of their sympathy, (they work for the poor) engagements, weddings interest them hugely, in fact they have the care of the village and are to see that no one suffers for food or clothing,-indeed, they are of as much consequence as the parish minister; in fact, they are the exemplification of the religion which he teaches: "The Poor ye have always with you" has a significance with them, and, like Dorcas, they are commended for their good works and benevolent acts: the garments which they make. They enjoy their social gathering, and usually part in great glee, but now, when they parted, they were sad and sorrowful. They were women of culture, of principle, of character and, most of them, of strong religious faith. They would not aid, abet or give countenance to any criminal act or slight misdemeanor, and they began to fear that young people regarded the acts which have been mentioned with complacency.</p> 
               <p>It was not our intention to introduce subjects not connected with our main object, and it is time to return to our original plan and let the sewing-circle take care of the matters which have so unexpectedly engaged their attention. We have no doubt they will discuss the subject at the next meeting and attempt to devise some method by which a practice so wicked and criminal can be stayed, and to create a more healthy public sentiment, or, by all means, expose physicians<pb n=""/> and others, participants in such crimes. If the women who wish to become notorious would take up this subject and expose it in all its deformity they would do more to assert their rights and command the respect of the world than they can do by claiming the right to vote or to wear men's clothes.</p> 
               <p>Strange they can't give their attention to something which would elevate them, and not be constantly degrading and disgracing themselves. Their position was fixed by the Almighty: "Thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee." Now if these would-be-called big-minded women think they can alter this decree,-they will do well first to stop the Falls of Niagara, or prevent the tide from ebbing and flowing. This talk about women's rights, women's position, women's voting is only another exhibition of rebel lion to the authority of Jehovah; envy, ambition and folly are the foundation of it, and as some persons only seem to live to render vice disgusting, so these women seem to be left to expose their own weakness and imbecility. They can't govern themselves, much less the men of the nation.</p> 
               <p>"Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." Let them blow their blast, spin their thread and effervesce a little-their "desire is to their husband and he shall rule over them."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THERE are different ways to govern and manage a school. Some teachers secure the love, confidence and respect of their pupils, while others seldom have either; and the difference consists in the manner of treating children. Some teachers seem to think they must govern by fear and that the children must always fear them. They never succeed. Scholars, under the influence of fear in a school-room, can't learn. A boy was once told, if he didn't get his lesson, he should be punished. He could not get his lesson,-he was a nervous boy and the idea that he might be punished so preyed upon his mind that he couldn't commit his lesson. The teacher saw that something was wrong, that the disposition of the boy was right, but for some reason he could not repeat his lesson though he appeared to know it. The boy trembled and was greatly excited. The teacher saw the difficulty; instead of threatening him he praised him, sat by his side, assisted him, told him next time he would have no difficulty, took him by the hand and caressed him-and the little fellow was himself again. He found the teacher was his friend, had no disposition to hurt him, and that night he went home from the school with his teacher, his friend, though the other scholars had preceded him a half an hour.</p> 
               <p>That boy had no difficulty after that in getting his lessons. His father said to the teacher "You did just right. You convinced Albert you was his friend. That fear which so<pb n=""/> agitated him disappeared, and he now studies and gets his lessons without difficulty. If you had whipped him you would have had to whip him again and again and it would have been of no use, and finally he would have run away from school, and all because you didn't understand him."</p> 
               <p>Now Alice took the right course with her scholars: she never excited any fear in them, but if one made a mistake he must try again, be helped a little, the word divided more distinctly in pronounciation, and the second effort was usually successful, with great pleasure to the little scholar. The boy was not mortified, but felt that he had triumphed,-and so he had, and the teacher had triumphed in securing his confidence and love. Had she treated him with severity, he would have missed again and again and after a little while wouldn't care whether he missed or not.</p> 
               <p>When the Committee visited the school the last week and day of the term, Alice called out her classes, one after another. They read distinctly, spelled correctly and took their seats orderly. The older classes gave the boundaries of the States, the geography of this and that country; while others had also studied Murray and know as much about Grammar as boys and girls at twelve or fourteen years of age usually do,-and after two hours spent in the different exercises, the Committee had an opportunity to ask such questions as they pleased.</p> 
               <p>The parson rose, and with much grave dignity expressed his entire approbation of the teacher and the school. The squire assented to and approved the remarks of the parson, and the first selectman told them that they would soon be called to take active parts in life, would soon be the fathers and mothers in their stead, and then little boys must fill the places of their fathers and be Selectmen and overseers of the poor in<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5572-00000045"/> a few years, and how important it was that they should study their books and learn spelling, writing and arithmetic.</p> 
               <p>The parson implored the blessing of Heaven upon them all and the Committee took leave of them with more gravity and dignity than many men would exhibit in presence of Ulysses S. Grant or the Emperor of all the Russias. And now the scholars were dismissed with a few kind and pleasant words from the teacher, and began to wind their way to their several homes. Katie Brown, however, bright and full of spirits and fun, said to the teacher on parting "How funny it was to hear that old man tell us about being fathers and mothers, just as though we understood what he meant;" when James Smith shouted, "I am going to be first selectman, and here is John Stark, he is to be overseer of the poor." "Yes," said Thomas Jones, "and John Kelly and Kate Brown are to be father and mother;" and thus they went off in a frolic full of fun and music.</p> 
               <p>We heard this story of one of the Council of the Know-Nothing Governor of Massachusetts. The Governor with his Council visited some of the Normal Schools, when after the Governor had finished his remarks, the Council were invited to address the school. One of them rose and said: "Now, boys, you must be good boys at school. I was always a good boy at school. I am the Governor's Council, and if you will be good boys at school you may be of the Governor's Council."</p> 
               <p>Now some people were disposed to criticize this speech, but how could it be better? Here was a man who was a fair illustration of being a good boy at school, who told them his present position was the effect of being a good boy-a living proof of the fact, a demonstration before them-but John Smith didn't help the matter when he whispered almost<pb n=""/> aloud, "If you are the Governor's Council I should think any man might be."</p> 
               <p>Alice had now closed her first term of school-teaching successfully. She took leave of her friends and returned home, all expressing the hope she would be their teacher the next year. It is idle to attempt to impress upon the mind the pleasure of a mother when her daughter returns home under such circumstances-especially when that mother, by her personal efforts and industry had prepared that daughter for position and usefulness. The reader must exercise his own judgment in determining how this little family enjoyed the hours together when Alice gave them her summer's experience, anecdotes and incidents connected with her school and boarding round. We were not there, and therefore cannot inform the reader what was said, what was enjoyed, and our imagination does not come to the rescue, and inform us what was said and what was enjoyed in recital of facts and incidents illustrative of innocent, buoyant and youthful human nature.</p> 
               <p>School-keeping is an art. Some succeed-others fail, and are at a loss to know why. Some will govern a school with a word or a look; others will be in a constant turmoil, without discipline or government. But one thing is certain, a teacher who cannot govern himself, cannot govern a school. In a country town in New Hampshire, some years ago, there was a district school of eighty-three scholars. A boy from college was engaged as teacher. There were children in the school who must be taught their letters, and others taught the higher branches of a village school. One rule of the district was that the larger boys in turn should build the fire and the boys keep the fire burning. The fifth Saturday, the teacher observed that the fire was low, and as Albert Cobb<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5572-00000046"/> was going out, he told him to bring in some small wood. When he returned he had two sticks covered with ice, and full of frost, which in a few minutes would have extinguished all the fire on the hearth. The teacher happened to be between the fire and the door and saw what he had, supposed a mistake, and told him they wanted a little small wood, as the school would close in about an hour, and to carry that out and bring in some small wood. Albert went out and again came in with two large sticks of wood, frozen, covered with snow and ice, and before the teacher had time to interfere, was at the fireplace, with the wood upon the hearth. The teacher calmly told him he must bring him some small wood, when he defiantly refused. Now he was seventeen years old, full of sap and muscle, and had the teacher undertaken to flog him, he might have got the worst of it. Still something must be done promptly and decidedly, or the government of that school was no longer in the power of the teacher. Albert was again ordered to bring him some small wood, or take his books and leave the school. He didn't dare to resist this order, and in a few minutes he was on his way home, and another boy supplied the wood for that hour.</p> 
               <p>Monday morning the teacher was at his post early. Albert came to the door with his books, apparently supposing turning him out of school was all his punishment, and that he could take his seat as usual. But not so thought the teacher, and he met him at the door, and told him he would take his books, and before he took his seat he must bring in <emph>a little small wood</emph>. Albert chocked, and finally said he would go home and see if he had a right to go to school. Albert didn't return, and the general, the doctor and the lawyer began to discuss the rights of schoolmasters, and the verdict was in favor of the teacher. The rules of the district must be<pb n=""/> kept, and order sustained in the school. The general was the father of Albert, but he was out of command. He could not control his boy, nor raise any opposition to the teacher in the district. In two or three weeks, however, lawyer Dwight asked the teacher into his office, and said it was a pity Albert should lose his schooling, and wanted to know if he couldn't then go to school. "O yes," replied the teacher, "but before he takes his seat he must bring in a little small wood." This was a stunner. The lawyer saw the propriety of it, and he said not a word.</p> 
               <p>The teacher closed his school, took the stage for college, and left the general, the doctor, and the lawyer to discuss the duties and power of schoolmasters. He never after saw Albert, the general, the doctor, or lawyer Dwight. He presumed they have been to the river and passed safely over. Whether the ferryman required Albert to bring in a little small wood before he went aboard, he cannot say, but this he does know, for seven weeks he didn't take his seat in that school-room, because he refused to bring in a little small wood. The government of the school was preserved, order reigned, and the teacher was respected by the school and the district. The teacher was right. Everybody in this life would have but little trouble, if they are only right. Every body should be right, especially the schoolmaster.</p> 
               <p>Harvesting comes on rapidly in the fall of the year. Frost takes possession early in New England-never waits for the farmer to dig his potatoes, or gather his apples. Winter follows with rapid strides. The snow flies, and the earth is covered. The moon rises in great splendor, and now is the time for the farmer boys and girls to have their recreations, and the evenings are usually employed to good advantage.<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5572-00000047"/> Sleigh-rides are expected and enjoyed as much as the seaside and mountain air are enjoyed by the sons and daughters of fashion and folly. Mr. Nye had done most of his harvesting, though George had occasionally been to town, when he never failed to call and inquire after Mrs. Parks and her daughters. He was usually in his working apparel, and did not make any formal calls. The family was always glad to see him, he knew, for they said they were. He was urged to bring Mary down with him, and Alice and Grace told him they would go shopping with her. He said he would, and then they knew he would.</p> 
               <p>Not many days passed, and Alice looked from her window, and George and Mary were at the door, just alighting from their carriage. Alice was with them instantly, and they were welcomed. Without any ceremony they entered the work-room, when Mrs. Parks for once dropped her work, and spent a half hour socially with them. After that the shops must be visited, and George must attend to some business affairs, when all would return to early tea at five o'clock. The shops were visited, and the clerks were very polite, and recognized Mary at once where she had made her purchases before. She found no difficulty in filling her list, when the three promenaded the principal streets and examined the public buildings and places of interest.</p> 
               <p>Alice and Grace were particular in their attentions, and made the walk very pleasant and agreeable to Mary, and at five o'clock were punctual to tea. George was not far behind, and they all enjoyed a social cup of tea. Mrs. Parks and her daughters were polite and attentive to their guests, and made their visit pleasant and agreeable to them.</p> 
               <p>At seven o'clock they took their leave without ceremony,<pb n=""/> but in that simple and quiet manner which marks the peasantry of the country, and shows that true politeness is not made up of fuss and feathers. This visit was the turning point with George. He no longer hesitated what to do.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>THE subject upon which the Benevolent Society were talking and meditating when they parted, was exceedingly interesting and exciting. In the interval they had talked with their husbands, with their confidential physicians, and with each other, and when they met again, they began where they left off. They took pride in their children and grand-children, and counted the former by seven, nine, twelve, and fifteen, and never felt certain of the number of grandchildren, except on thanksgiving day, when the annual report was made. Now some mothers had two, others only one, and the number of fruitless marriages was astonishing. A new revelation was opened to them. They were grieved; they talked in sorrow, but they were calm. They reminded one of the calmness before a hurricane, when all nature is still, but suddenly a cloud arises in the east and another in the west, and when they meet everything must give way, as in the September gale. Trees are torn up by the roots, houses are blown down, and the tornado carries with it everything in its circuit.</p>

                     <corr>ebullition</corr>
                  </choice> of indignation and wrath. Those people who have seen women filled with holy indignation and intense sorrow, can judge just how she looked. Language cannot impress upon the mind the countenance, the manner, the spirit. Mrs. Taylor followed her with words more bitter, and with indignation more intense, if possible, and with expressions of supreme contempt for<pb n=""/> all such parties, when Mrs. White said she considered such practices murders in the first degree, crimes against nature, which would surely bring down the vengeance of heaven; and if she knew any of her daughters had become parties to such a crime, she would warn them of their sin and danger, and if they insisted upon the practice, she would treat them as parties guilty of the highest crimes known to the law, and their husbands, if they seduced them to become parties to such offences, they should be banished from her presence forever. She never bore sons, she knew, who were such cowards they didn't dare to undertake the support of a family before nor since the war.</p> 
               <p>Here a dozen voices united in expressions of shame, cowardice, villainy, execration upon all parties, high or low, rich or poor, who aid in such crimes. Mrs. Kelly said any physician, a party to such practices, should never enter her house, and she thought he ought to be hooted in the streets; yea, more, branded as a murderer, if the law would not reach him and part his head from his shoulders. Mrs. Orne said she could hardly believe what she heard. How young people, brought up in this age, with the privileges of education and the blessings of the gospel, could be guilty of such practices, was unaccountable to her. Where is their conscience? Have they no fear of the judgment of heaven? Is all our teaching of their accountability lost? Do such parties expect to meet us in heaven? And do we meet them here in church, pretending to be Christians, and to unite with us in adoration and praise to the Father of us all? It is hypocrisy. It is mockery. The love of God cannot dwell in such hearts.</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, it can't," said Mrs. Tyler, "and I wonder what the Devil will invent next to secure victims for the pit."</p> 
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5572-00000049"/> 
               <p>Then Mrs. Parker said she thought "a new duty devolves upon us mothers-to warn our daughters of the criminality of such crimes, the danger to their health and the certainty of a lingering if not a premature death."</p> 
               <p>"From what I can learn," said Mrs. Sprague, "young men are the more guilty party."</p> 
               <p>"Now," said Mrs. Dix, "we are the Benevolent Society, representing all sects, all societies in town. Let us set ourselves to expose any physician guilty of such practice, and any parties who aid or countenance it." To this there was an unanimous aye, with such force and energy that it meant work.</p> 
               <p>"What shall we do, Mrs. Dix," asked Mrs. Little, "if we meet one of these physicians?"</p> 
               <p>"Spit upon him!" said she.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mrs. Dix, you don't mean," said Mrs. Taylor, "that I should actually spit upon him, do you?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, not exactly; but treat him in such a way that he will feel as though he had been spit upon. Indeed, I don't know that I wouldn't actually spit in his face. It would be difficult for me to restrain my feelings, though I am not easily excited. Such physicians ought to be outcast. They have forfeited all claim to the respect or protection of society."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed, they have," said Mrs. Wood. "I had no idea of the number of deaths by such practices, and the number of healthful, cheerful, and happy women, who have lost their health, become dejected and miserable, in consequence of being inconsiderate parties to such practices. Only yesterday, it may be a similar case to the one mentioned the other day. I heard of a beautiful, talented and educated young woman, who was the wife of a man of learning and ability, and every way respectable and respected,<pb n=""/> and after having two beautiful boys, she conceived the idea of not having any more children. She had read the advertisements of these wretches, called female doctors, and she lent a willing ear to them, and after taking one or two of their prescriptions, she fainted and died."</p> 
               <p>"But her case was not so bad," said Mrs. Hayes, "as far as this world is concerned, as the condition of those who linger in pain, suffer for years, and then die a distressing, excruciating death."</p> 
               <p>"I can mention a dozen women of my acquaintance," said Mrs. Todd, "who have been married from four to six years, and who, when married, were full of health, and hope, and the pride and ornament of society, but after a year or so they would be ill for a week, then again well apparently, and then again ill, until their health was broken down, and they became pale, cadaverous looking beings, no more like themselves, than the dry limb is like the full bud in spring. Life is a dreary waste for them. Ask their husbands why they don't have children, they reply without any apparent shame, 'O, I can't support children.' But can they support a sick wife, and infamous medical men?"</p> 
               <p>Thus one after another expressed their indignation and wrath, and the Sewing Circle was for once united to a man. Mrs. Smith, even, did not oppose them, but united heart and soul with them in expressions of indignation and scorn for parties aiding or abetting such practice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>ON their way home, George and Mary talked very freely about Mrs. Parks and her daughters. Mary said she had never met parties who seemed more happy, and who were more cordial and agreeable. They seemed to know how to treat people, and though they made no pretensions, it was pleasant to meet them, for it was evident they were glad to see us, and that they were honest, truthful people.</p> 
               <p>"These are the best sort of folks after all," said George. "Industry, honesty and truth are virtues which do not grow on every bush."</p> 
               <p>When Mary had shown her purchases to her mother and she approved them, she told how Mrs. Parks' girls assisted her and what a beautiful visit she had, and Mrs. Nye asked her many questions relative to Alice and her mother and sisters, which Mary answered favorably.</p> 
               <p>George told his father the price of produce, and that old Mr. Hale was dead, that there was a great deal of fever for going to California, and the gold diggings, and in two or three years many people thought they would begin to build a railroad to California, and some people said it would be finished in ten years.</p> 
               <p>"Not in my day," said the old gentleman.</p> 
               <p>He said it looked like a storm, and he thought we should have snow in a day or two. It was three weeks before snow fell in such quantities as to make good sleighing, and then<pb n=""/> George after dinner harnessed the horse for a sleigh-ride, and in an hour or two he was in River street, and this time found Mrs. Parks in her work-room alone. She met him very cordially, and after speaking of the weather, the sleighing and after answering Mrs. Parks' inquiries in regard to Mary and her parents, he said to her that he had been thinking about getting married. Mrs. Parkes said she thought it was a good plan for young men to marry young, and inquired if he had made choice of a partner. Now this was quite a relief to him, and he said he had if she would give her consent. He said he proposed to offer himself to Alice, if it would be agreeable to her. She said Alice was young, but if they were agreed, she would not make any objection.</p> 
               <p>Now this showed good sense by both. George spoke his mind, and Mrs. Parks knew he was honest, sincere and truthful, and she answered him as a sensible and discreet woman would always answer a young man under similar circumstances, if indeed she had no reasonable objection to him. From his inquiries he had learned that Alice was at one of the neighbors, but that she would be home soon.</p> 
               <p>Success had attended George so far, and time began to seem long to him, when little Fan, always in the right place at the right time, came running in, and after speaking to Mr. Nye, and taking him by the hand, and asking him how he was, how Mary was, and if it was beautiful sleighing, before he had time to answer either question, Mrs. Parks said to her, "You step into Mr. Kent's and tell Alice Mr. Nye is here." It is Mr. Nye now and hereafter. Fan was not many minutes in finding Alice, who returned home immediately, saying to Mrs. Kent that she had a caller at home. She met Mr. Nye very cordially, said she was glad to see him, when he replied he was glad to see her, and she immediately<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5572-00000051"/> diately began to inquire for Mary, his father and mother, parson Kelly, the little ones and neighbors generally. After answering her inquiries, and spending a half hour in social and pleasant conversation, he said it was very fine sleighing, and asked her to ride around town with him. She looked to her mother, who assented, and she said she should be very happy to.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments she was dressed for the ride, and they enjoyed as much any other parties in town or city that day. They had not proceeded far, when he made known to Alice the purpose of his visit, the assent of her mother, "and now it is in your power to make me the happiest man in town." She knew Mr. Nye was no coxcomb, but honest and truthful, and she replied that she was young, hardly competent to take charge of a house, and she didn't think of being engaged or married so young. He said she was just the right age.</p> 
               <p>"What will Mary say, and your parents?" said she.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nye said he had not consulted them, but he had heard them speak of her in such terms that he had no doubt they would be pleased with her for a sister and daughter-in-law. Alice said she could not think of marrying a man if his friends objected.</p> 
               <p>"Neither," said he, "should I think of marrying a person to whom they object."</p> 
               <p>Alice said all the money she had in the world was what he paid her for keeping school, and some of that she had spent. Her mother had worked very hard for several years "for we girls, and I was hoping to be able to relieve her for a few years at least."</p> 
               <p>"As for the money," said Mr. Nye, "that is not a consideration with me, and if you haven't much, it won't take you long to get ready. I appreciate your desire to assist your<pb n=""/> mother, but as I have her consent, she has relieved you of all embarrassment on her account."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose you would not think of being married at present."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I thought I should like to be married in just one year from the day I saw you for the first time and hired you to teach our school."</p> 
               <p>"O my!" said she, "In less than six months?"</p> 
               <p>Alice didn't speak again for several minutes; it seemed to Mr. Nye a long time. They rode around and around in the different streets, when Alice said, "You can hardly expect a direct answer now, Mr. Nye. I must see mother and Grace and little Fan, and have a family talk with them."</p> 
               <p>"O no," said he, "but I always thought if I intended to marry a person I would tell her so at once, and she then would know how to act and would not be deceived. I have no patience with young men who will wait upon a young lady month after month, without having made their purpose known. There is Thomas Clark,-he has waited upon Lizzie Jones these two years, but says he is not engaged! I don't think such conduct fair or honorable. If he intends to marry Lizzie, why not tell her so,-and if not, stay away about his business. She supposes he intends to marry her, no doubt, but no one knows how soon he may see some other pretty face and be carried away with it; whereas, if he is engaged, there is only one pretty face to him."</p> 
               <p>"I like your principles, Mr. Nye. I heard a story of Mrs. Balch I liked very much: she had four or five sons,-they were young men of good character,-and one of them waited upon a young lady a year or more. His mother and her mother probably supposed they were engaged. They appeared very fond of each other; he was often there, always welcome, and<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5572-00000052"/> he intended to marry the young lady as soon as circumstances would permit. She expected and wanted to marry him. His mother heard he had never offered to marry her. She called him, as he was about to leave the house, and told him if he was not engaged, to engage himself that night or else never visit Miss Steel again. If she was her father, she would know why he was so often at her house without declaring his purpose or he would be notified to leave, without ceremony. 'Now don't you come home till you settle this matter.' The voice of the mother prevailed, and that evening the ring was on the finger and, subsequently, they were married and were happy."</p> 
               <p>"I like that Mrs. Balch. Now, I don't want you to be in haste, but as soon as you can, I want you to be as frank as I have been."</p> 
               <p>Alice said, "You will be down again in two or three weeks."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, in two weeks from to-day."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I will be very happy to see you," and they were at the door of Mrs. Parks', and tea, and toast were ready for them. Alice said she had a delightful ride, she enjoyed it very much; but at the tea-table she was rather quiet, absent-minded perhaps, but Grace and her mother, with little Fan, had much to say. After tea, the evening was spent socially; occasionally a neighbor called to whom Mrs. Parks introduced Mr. Nye; when about nine o'clock, he bid them all good-evening and took home much love for Mary.</p> 
               <p>The next day, after Grace and little Fan had gone to school, Alice and her mother had some time together. She told her mother she hated to leave her so young,-she was now able to help her some and she felt it was her duty to do so. Her mother told her she was a very dutiful daughter; she had never made her any trouble,-she thought Mr. Nye<pb n=""/> would make her a good husband, and that she had better consider whether it was wise to reject so good an offer,-"Mr. Nye appears to be an honest, upright young man, you know him better than I do, and you must decide a matter of this kind for yourself."</p> 
               <p>Alice thought deeply,-she considered,-she reflected, and she said to her mother, "We have all lived here so many years together! Grace will graduate next year, and Fanny soon be grown up, and we can all work and keep school. We <emph>have</emph> enjoyed life as well as most people and we <emph>can</emph>, here, for many years."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we have got along very well, but we have no security that Grace wont find someone who will carry her off in a year or two. We can't always expect to live together."</p> 
               <p>Alice said she liked Mr. Nye; his character was good, his habits were good, and his father's family was very respectable, as much so as any family in the village, and she couldn't see any objection except that she was so young and that she must leave home,-"it wouldn't be like going away to teach school four months."</p> 
               <p>Her mother made no reply, and Alice seemed to be very thoughtful, disinclined to talk when Grace came home, and she continued in a sort of meditative, contemplative, serious, almost solemn state of mind for several days, when Grace said "Why, what is the matter with you, Alice? You don't seem to be yourself. <choice>
                     <sic>An't</sic>
                     <corr>Ain't</corr>
                  </choice> you well?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," she said she was as well as usual.</p> 
               <p>At evening Grace was in her chamber with her books, and Alice went in and sat by her side. She asked her a question about her lessons, what she was then studying, but Grace didn't appear to hear her, and she didn't, for her mind was so concentrated on her lessons that you might go in and out<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5572-00000053"/> of the room a dozen times and she would notice you no more than the passers-by on River Street. But Alice wanted to have a talk with her, and she took her by the hand and said, "Grace, I have something to tell you." She then had Grace's attention, and she began and told her what Mr. Nye said to her the other day when they were riding,-how she and her mother had talked over the subject, and how hard their mother had worked for them and how she hated to go away and leave them,-and she burst into a flood of tears; Grace joined her with her hand upon her bosom, when they all but cried aloud. Tears soon relieved Alice of the pent-up sorrow which had so changed her in appearance and demeanor for several days, and with tears running down her cheeks she said, "Now, Grace, what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>Grace couldn't speak for a minute or two, when she said, "What fools we are to cry so!"</p> 
               <p>Alice said she didn't know.</p> 
               <p>"It is not the first time I have cried within the last few days."</p> 
               <p>Grace arose, went and washed her face, but when she came back she could not speak, tears would run in spite of her, when Alice, who was somewhat relieved, said, "There! Your washing has done you no good." And it hadn't. If there is any pure affection in this life, it exists in the breasts of two sisters, who, in comparative poverty have seen their mother tasking nature to its utmost capacity for them, and who, with pure minds and hearts, have begun fully to appreciate the efforts of a mother for them and to realize their own condition and responsibilities.</p> 
               <p>It is no use to say girls marry without thought or consideration. Some may rush headlong, and fashionable, gay and<pb n=""/> jeweled girls, at the Springs or Mountains or sea-side, may make a match for convenience or position, but <emph>then</emph> it is not expected it will have any of the elements of pure affection or be productive of any permanent happiness. Such persons are not domestic; their happiness consists in show, in fashion, in dress,-in the waltz, at the theatre or opera. It is empty, evanescent, tasteless. The parties tolerate each other and sometimes find their spirits congenial, and live in peace and harmony. But here is a domestic circle which had seen poverty, but had lived in each other's love and affection-about to be separated. They had no separate desires or purposes, and Alice would have rejected the Prince of England rather than displease her mother or sever the affections which had strengthened with her years. But her mother favored marrying him, and if Grace did too-she must assume the duties and responsibilities of married life.</p> 
               <p>Grace had fortitude, character, but Alice had taken her by surprise and she broke down, and she couldn't seem to recover her self-possession. At length, however, she mastered herself enough to ask, "What does mother say about it?"</p> 
               <p>"O," Alice said, "mother is a mother, and what <choice>
                     <sic>wont</sic>
                     <corr>won't</corr>
                  </choice> a mother do for her children? She would give her life if it would promote our happiness. Mr. Nye consulted her before he made any proposal to me, and she gave her consent and favors the match. She thinks, if I love him or think he is such a man as I could be happy with, I ought to marry him."</p> 
               <p>"Then I would," sobbed Grace.</p> 
               <p>"But I don't want to marry him unless we all think it best. I mean to talk with little Fan about it; she will probably be pleased without knowing why."</p> 
               <p>"She liked Mr. Nye and so do I, Alice, from what I have<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5572-00000054"/> seen of him and I think he will make you a good husband," said Grace. "He appears to be a very honest young man, of good abilities and well-informed."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Alice, "they think everything of him at home, and I don't think there is a young man in the village more respected than he is; at the several places where I have boarded they all spoke of him as a reliable young man, of good character and ability. They have a farm very pleasantly located and are in good circumstances-but then mother and you and I and little Fan have lived together so happily that I can hardly think of leaving you, but I suppose I must if you all say so."</p> 
               <p>Grace's tears <emph>would</emph> flow in spite of her. By common consent they retired for the night, and in each other's arms slept dull care and sorrow away. In the morning they felt as one that dreameth,-they wisely abstained from alluding to the subject of the evening. In a few moments Grace was at the table with her books and Alice with her mother. She must have one more talk, however. At a favorable moment she took Fanny one side and told her the story,-she saw in Grace's eye a tear and she burst out crying as children cry. She liked "White Oak," as she called him. In a few minutes she said, "Was that what he was down here for? I wish he had staid at home!" and she jumped up and ran away from Alice and sighed and sobbed no more.</p> 
               <p>The work was done. Alice began now to look upon the bright side of the picture, as her mother had always done. She looked for Mr. Nye with a good deal of pleasure, when she should announce to him that she would comply with his wishes. She was calm, collected, did the duties of the hour cheerfully, talked with her mother and Grace about school-the many happy acquaintances she had made there<pb n=""/> and how happy she thought she should be with Mr. Nye. Mary was her friend and always would be, and Mr. Nye's father and mother were just the folks she should like to live with. When Mr. Nye came at the day appointed she met him, not with an <choice>
                     <sic>ebulition</sic>
                     <corr>ebullition</corr>
                  </choice> of passion or expression of extreme delight, but with dignity and self-possession. She inquired for Mary, his father and mother and how he had been for two long weeks. She was evidently glad to see him, and his answer he saw in her face. He was in the work-room; Alice never looked so pretty in his eyes before,-Grace was in her best mood, and little Fan as bright and sprightly as ever, and they were socially and agreeably enjoying the hour when Mrs. Parks said to him, "When you came here, last Spring, you said you wanted a school-teacher. You didn't say you wanted a wife."</p> 
               <p>Alice blushed, Grace smiled, and Fanny laughed aloud, and he said that was his business then, and he succeeded so well he thought he would come again. He "was in earnest then, and is now." Immediately, Alice invited him into the spare-room, when she made him acquainted with her interviews with her mother, Grace and little Fanny, and said, if his friends at home were satisfied she would comply with his wishes. He said they knew the object of his visit and approved it highly. They spent the hours of the evening socially and agreeably, when he said he would be down again next week, and then said good-night, and she said good-night.</p> 
               <p>In the morning it was not necessary to ask him how he succeeded, for his whole appearance and demeanor spoke out. After a while Mary says, "When are you to be married, George?"</p> 
               <p>"In May," said he.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THERE is something heroic in a young girl of sixteen undertaking to accomplish at school in two years what scholars usually do in three years; and when we consider the motive, that she might relieve her mother of care and labor and fit herself also for usefulness, we must admire the character, the principles which governed her and the heart which impelled her to such exertions. Grace prepared the lesson of her class and then took the lesson of the class of the next year which she also prepared in a manner highly satisfactory to her teachers and creditable to herself, and thus, by diligence and extra exertions, she was prepared to enter the senior class at the end of the first term of the senior year. That she had acquired as much knowledge or made as much proficiency in a year and three months as the scholars were required to do in two years and more was evidence of intellect, as well as industry and perseverance.</p> 
               <p>Few people know what they can do till they try; and if they would try and not repine, they would find life much more agreeable, and themselves enjoying the world more in accordance with the designs of the Creator, than they do by finding so many trials and hardships in the way. If Grace had been ordered to do in two years what she voluntarily did, she might have considered it a hardship,-but the motive was so honorable to herself, and the reward for which she fought was so desirable and laid so near her heart, that every effort she made was a pleasure to her and a source of great gratification<pb n=""/> ification to her mother. We, however, could but think, when she was admitted to the senior class and stood there their peer, a little pride must have taken possession of her, or at least manifested itself in some way. This we do know, whatever her feelings might have been, her teacher was proud of her and took occasion at all proper times to commend her and also to stimulate others to exertion by the success which had attended her efforts, her industry and perseverance.</p> 
               <p>Some people think that great men are made great by their Creator, while in fact the difference in men is more in their habits of industry and diligence than the world is prepared to admit. Brains are good substances, but are useless alone and no better than a lump of clay. How often do men say, "He is a man of talents, of wit, of discernment, but he is indolent, he is dissipated, he has no ambition, he has wasted his time, and his talents are of no use to him or the world. Again, if he had been born poor and been obliged to work, he might have been, the representative man, the eminent statesman, or the distinguished jurist, while, in fact, all that was necessary was industry and principle!" which teaches that every talent given us by our Creator should be improved to the greatest possible advantage and His blessing is sure to follow. Many men would like to be great men, if they could without the exertion which makes men great. Show me the man who is pre-eminent among his contemporaries, and I will show you the man who loses no time, who leaves none of his powers or faculties to rust or waste.</p> 
               <p>Grace's success was the result of cultivating, of improving the talents which nature had given her; one talent was time,-she lost no time in idleness; she never saw any idleness at home and practically she knew it not, and we have heard her say in substance "How I wish I had the means,<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5572-00000056"/> the opportunities which some others had! I did the best I could under the circumstances-who could do better!" Fanny was the youngest, Alice was teaching, Grace was in the High school and her studies engaged all her time. Mrs. Parks was alone,-but how inclined mothers are to have their children or at least one of them for company, and it didn't seem very important that Fanny should be at the Grammar School every day, and if her mother had a longing for her company, or if she was more inclined to be at home occasionally than at school, it was not surprising. Then she was so handy, useful, she could assist her mother a great deal about the house.</p> 
               <p>"The next term I do not intend to keep Fanny from school one day." But how weak are our resolutions when in opposition to our inclinations! The next term was like the last, "but she is young, she will have opportunity to go to school, and when Alice comes home, every day must find her with her books and at school,"-and thus one term passed after another, and Fanny attended school part of each term. Her attention and time was divided, and gradually she lost interest in the school and the result was that she, like Alice, left school early. Perhaps it was as well for her and her mother,-her education was sufficient for all the ordinary purposes of life. Grace continued her studies,-the years roll rapidly when all our time is occupied.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN the ladies of the sewing-circle began to investigate the subject which had excited so much indignation, they found the evil far more widespread than they anticipated, and that it was necessary for them to move with some caution. Many young married women were suffering from disease engendered by such practices, they had no doubt, but how to prove it, or how to approach the subject was extremely difficult and perplexing. Parties would not acknowledge their own shame,-physicians dare not tell the whole truth. "My darling daughter would not dare Heaven by such heathenish practices!" It required prudence, wisdom, judgment, discretion, to present such practices in their true light, and not at the same time give unpardonable offence.</p> 
               <p>Sewing-circles sometimes get the name of talking scandal, and possibly they deserve it,-but here was a serious evil which was impairing the health and destroying the peace and happiness of many families; to let it pass unnoticed, when it had been presented to them, would make them <foreign xml:lang="LAT">particeps criminis</foreign> or accessories, and remiss to the duties, which, as mothers, they owed to society,-and it would provoke the wrath of Heaven; vengeance would follow, perhaps slow, but sure. They must do their duty!</p> 
               <p>The number of young women who had been married from two to ten years and were not mothers astonished them. Many of them began to show symptoms of disease; some had a hectic cough,-some had hollow cheeks, cadaverous-looking<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5572-00000057"/> countenances; many of them said the doctor called their complaint "disease of the liver." Some complained of dyspepsia, of indigestion, a loathing at the stomach, most of them looked dispirited,-they had lost that glow which indicated health, that bright and innocent countenance which belong to their age,-and that elasticity and energy which indicated life and activity. It was painful to contrast them with the others who had borne their second, third, fifth, and, in some instances, their sixth babe to the altar, before the whole congregation, that she might express her gratitude and love, her confidence and faith, her belief and trust, her hope and dependence upon a covenant-keeping God. They had not violated the laws of Nature, and they had "a correspondence fixed with Heaven," "which is sure a noble anchor."</p> 
               <p>Here was the difference: A mother with half a score of children leading in the benevolent acts of the day,-seeking out the poor, that they might be clothed and fed;-was always at the prayer-meeting; while her motherless sister could not be exposed to the evening air, and her health was such, she could hardly do the duties of the hour at home. Now, something must be done; and what could a few women do to stay an evil which had got such hold of the community-before it was known,-that it was now appalling. They could talk about it,-they could consult intelligent physicians upon the subject,-they could instruct their own house-hold, and if they could get the ball in motion-the tide once setting against the practice-public opinion in the right direction, and viewing the subject correctly-the crime might be exposed, the conscience awakened and the plague stayed.</p> 
               <p>Archimedes said "if he had a place upon which to stand, he could move the earth;" and these women were<pb n=""/> satisfied, if they could only get a standing-point, a way to come at the subject, they could stay its progress. Perhaps they never deliberated so long, so thoughtfully, so prudently, so profoundly and so cautiously upon any other subject,-for the reason they never had a subject under consideration before, which weighed so heavily upon them, which was so momentous in all its consequences, and which required so much wisdom. They were not appalled, but in earnest, resolute, determined; at first, they would spit upon the physician,-but now they must move with caution, with prudence, with discretion. Mrs. White said some one ought to write a book upon the subject. Mrs. Orne said the press ought to speak out and expose the crime. Mrs. Taylor said the press often times did more hurt than good by telling people how crimes were committed, and many were thus tempted. Mrs. Dix said for her part she did not know what to do; she had two daughters of marriageable age, but she had not even alluded to the subject. "Human nature is such, that it is dangerous to talk with the young upon some subjects. I might give them information which it might be as well for them not to have."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Hayes said she didn't know; she thought we erred sometimes in not giving our daughters proper instruction and information before marriage. Mrs. Orne said it didn't look as though they would come to any conclusion to-day. Mrs. Hayes asked if it would not be as well to choose a committee to make a report upon the subject. Mrs. White said she thought they had better be a committee of the whole, and think upon the subject,-get all the light they can upon it, and each, at the next meeting, come prepared with a plan, if possible, by which the evil can be stayed. To this they agreed, and retired with sad countenances and heavy hearts.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>MRS. Taylor asked Mrs. Dix for the health of the needle-woman, and she said she was very well; that Alice had taken a school a few miles from town; that Grace was doing finely in the High school and she believed Fanny went to the Grammar school; "but," said she, "Mrs. Parks works too hard. She must have a constitution of iron. Her endurance is beyond anything I ever knew."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor said there was a great deal in the will. "If a person is determined they will accomplish certain purposes or do certain acts, they usually have strength equal to their will. Mrs. Parks has a will."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Orne, "she is most too willing to work, but she has found great pleasure in it. I never saw her low-spirited or discouraged, and I think we might all envy her for her buoyant spirits. I never called when she did not appear bright, active, ready to do my work, and I have left her wondering how she could always be in such fine spirits."</p> 
               <p>"O," says Mrs. Todd, "she has such beautiful daughters, and they are growing up with her after her own heart. They are very kind to her, and they always will be. You never knew a family, which, by such industry, had maintained a respectable position, who did not continue to live in each other. There is no jarring, no discord, no contention, no envy, but each is happy in the others' happiness."</p> 
               <p>It was not many days before Mr. Nye was in the work-room<pb n=""/> room of the needle-woman, on River street; he could not come and go unobserved, and his visits attracted the attention of Alice's friends, and she was asked to explain. She did not hesitate to announce to them her engagement, which was not long in reaching the ears of all her friends in town. Congratulation followed congratulation, expressions of esteem for and interest in her daughter's prospects and happiness were so frequent and evidently so sincere that they began to think the whole town their friends, which, in fact and truth, they were. They had witnessed the efforts of Mrs. Parks; she had earned, she had won their respect and esteem, and she was now convinced they appreciated her.</p> 
               <p>No woman could live in New England and so assiduously devote herself to the maintenance of herself and daughters without securing the regards, the friendship, the interest of all persons who can appreciate the heroic efforts of a mother. Alice gratified Mr. Nye and consented to be married about the time he proposed; much time was not required for preparation. She told him she had little to do with, and consequently but little to do.</p> 
               <p>Oh the---day of---, in the presence of a few friends, he said "Yes" and she said "Yes" and they two were one. Alice was dressed simply, neatly, tastily, without any attempt to appear different from what she was or her means afforded. The little and choice presents were tastefully arranged, and after an hour pleasantly and agreeably spent by their families, (they were one, now,) Mr. and Mrs. Nye received the best wishes of all present; Mrs. Nye kissed her mother and sisters dear, and they left for home,-sweet home; it has been no other to them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN the sewing-circle broke-up, they were deeply moved. They had seen distress and relieved it. They worked for the poor and afflicted-but the subject which had engaged their thoughts and nerved their very souls was not mentioned in their rules or by-laws. As they met, on the promenade and other places, during the week, they alluded to the subject, and each hoped the other would come with some plan or suggest some mode by which the evil could be corrected; but when they met, they looked each to the other, and were in trouble and doubt. How such heathenish practices could be introduced and tolerated among a Christian people and in Christian families, was incomprehensible to them.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. White said she was bold to ask her physician about it, and when he told her what he knew-how many he supposed were guilty-and how some persons, called physicians, and men who passed for respectable, were parties to such crimes, she was appalled. She asked him what could be done. He said all such parties should be considered as criminals and treated accordingly, "'No matter,' said he, 'whether they are high or low, rich or poor, ministers' daughters or laymen's daughters, they should know such practices are a sin against high Heaven, which will surely bring vengeance upon the guilty party.' He had patients all the time who have lost their vivacity, their spirits, were languid, broken-down, and as old at thirty as they ought to be at fifty.<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5572-00000060"/> He could do nothing for them,-they couldn't rally; a little tonic would give them temporary relief, but there was such inertness, listlessness and torpor in the system, produced, he had no doubt, by such practices, that it baffled the skill of the physicians. Violence has been done to the system; consequently, a wound has been made, and the process of repairs may have commenced, but nature has to make extra efforts to repair damages; a loss has been sustained, and, not infrequently, before the repairs are completed, other violence may have been done,-and after repeated assaults upon the system, nature has less and less power to regain itself, and after a while, gives up, and the patient is beyond recovery. Sometimes the system is in such condition that inflammation prevents the commencement of repairs even, and we find any attempt to stay the progress of inflammation fruitless, and the patient sinks and dies suddenly."</p> 
               <p>"How any party can venture upon such acts, particularly if acquainted with the human system at all, is mysterious to me. I never did attempt it, and if I had no principle to prevent my participating in such acts, I judge the risk so great that I should never dare to attempt it. Nature will not suffer violence long; she is very sensitive, and she will not suffer herself to be imposed upon by young people, and she seems to be her own avenger. It is true that some persons recover from such acts of violence, and some partially recover, but they never enjoy life. A guilty conscience can't be cured by medicine. The mind affects the body, and more seriously than most people are aware of, and when a young woman finds she has lost her health by such practices,-that her husband begins to show symptoms of impatience,-she droops away and dies. In other cases <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"It hardens all within</l> 
                        <l>And petrifies the feeling,"</l>

                  </q>
                  <pb n=""/> and in all cases it is a sinful, wicked and abominable act, a murder in the first degree."</p> 
               <p>"'Is there no remedy,' said I, and he said he didn't know. 'We medical men have considered the subject, talked about it; we would expel any physician from our associations who would assist, aid, or abet in such practices, but then it is so difficult to prove it; we may be satisfied the crime has been committed, and treat the patient accordingly, but then it is our opinion only. We could not testify only in our opinion, which, you know, is not evidence to convict a party of crime. Then the state of society is such, that it is almost impossible even to check such a practice. If I should say to Mrs. F. that her daughter was losing her health in consequence of such criminality, she would never employ me again. There is Dr. A., a well-read, skillful and conscientious physician, but he doesn't have half as much <choice>
                     <sic>practise</sic>
                     <corr>practice</corr>
                  </choice> as Dr. B., who is a notorious libertine and a very ordinary physician.' I told him I hoped the medical profession would take up the subject and expose it in all its length and breadth. He said they would find themselves in scalding water very soon. I told him to fear not, but let the worst be known."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor said she and Mrs. Orne met the other day, but they could not seem to devise any plan or suggest any remedy. Many of the other ladies said they had been interested in Mrs. White's account with her physician, but they did not know what to do; when Mrs. Hayes said she believed in agitation. "Agitate." "Agitate." And she thought they had better adopt that motto, and agitate and agitate the subject, and let the consequences take care of themselves; to this there was one unanimous assent, and many of them said they believed it would be an effectual remedy. They now breathed easier, their burden was lightened. They could see into, if<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5572-00000061"/> not through the darkness. They were sanguine, they hoped. They had a duty before them; they would discharge it faithfully, boldly,-effectually they believed. When they separated, they said to each other, "Agitate is the word."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. White, "agitate is the word, and let the guilty hide, or veil their faces in public. If we don't raise a storm, we will clear our consciences by exposing this sin, this crime, in all its deformity and enormity."</p> 
               <p>"For my part," said Mrs. Taylor, "I think the press ought to take up the subject, and handle it without gloves. Let the public take sides, and, if there be any parties who advocate infanticide, let us see them, mark them, brand them. Public opinion has great power in this country, and public opinion will not tolerate such crimes." And thus the benevolent society separated once more, having agreed upon a plan of action and being fully determined to act upon that plan.</p> 
               <p>When we commenced writing it was not our purpose to introduce this subject, and how we happened to do so we don't know. It must have been suggested by some thought or remark made by somebody, and we propose to leave the subject in the hands of this benevolent society to agitate in such manner as their judgments dictate. We, however, think it a subject which ought to engage the attention of honest people, and that parties engaged directly or indirectly in such practices should be stamped with infamy. If these lines ever reach the public, it must give the writer credit for having done his duty. We began to write for the purpose of giving an account of the energy, perseverence, industry, determination and success of the needle-woman; other subjects have incidentally engaged our attention, and possibly we may "switch-off" again. This is our first experience in writing a book, and perhaps the public will be of the opinion-if they<pb n=""/> ever see it-it ought to be our last. Mrs. Parks has been an acquaintance of ours for nearly forty years and we know the fact of which we write. They are substantially true. We don't pretend that every incident occurred just as we have written it, or that every person used the precise words we have given; but that Mrs. Parks lost her husband and was left in the condition we have described-that by her needle she sustained herself and educated her daughters, as we have and shall detail, is strictly true; we would like to give her true name, but, for obvious reasons, we were obliged to use another name. We proceed with our narrative.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THE next day after the marriage, Mrs Parks might be seen in her room, constantly plying her needle; Fanny was with her, and her mother seemed to have an increasing desire for her company-always cheerful, she lightened her burden, though she never seemed to have any burden. It was dull to be alone. The light of the countenance and the smile of a child are cheerful, and, somehow, the days didn't seem so long when Fanny was at home.</p> 
               <p>Grace went to the High School the day after the wedding. She kindly answered all the questions of her teachers and mates about the wedding and home of Alice, and thanked them for their expressions of interest in and wishes for her happiness. She was a member of the senior class, and at the end of the year she would graduate and then be prepared to teach others, which she had anticipated with so much pleasure in order that she might relieve her mother. The day and the hour came, and we witnessed with great satisfaction her examination with her class, and enjoyed the class party in the evening and the promenade. The teacher very graciously told her mother she was as capable of teaching the High School as she, the teacher, was, herself. Her mother's heart throbbed with emotion! The day of her reward had come. She smiled, said she hoped she would succeed in teaching, as she had engaged a school for her.</p> 
               <p>Her teacher replied, she need give herself no anxiety on<pb n=""/> that account-"for" said she, "I have called upon her, as we upon members of the senior class, to hear the recitations of the other classes, and I have been so pleased with her manner and tact of teaching that I sometimes feared I called on her too often; but she was so capable, so thorough and accurate, it was a pleasure to hear her recitations and witness her mode of teaching others. She has clear and quick perceptions, and she knows <emph>what</emph> she knows. No scholar has graduated her superior since I have had charge of the school. Now, Mrs. Parks, I don't say this to flatter you, for it is no flattery,-it is no more than the truth."</p> 
               <p>What more could a teacher say,-what could a mother say! She dropped a tear as she remembered how she had been alone in early life with her jewels, how she had worked for them, and how, now, she was blessed! Mrs. Parks enjoyed the hour; she received the congratulations of friends, who had witnessed the exhibition and who were present to enjoy the evening promenade at the invitation of the class.</p> 
               <p>These class promenades are much like the President's party at commencement: a band of music is present, who usually play their choice airs; the parsons, the lawyers and professional men of the town, with the teachers, school-committee, the friends of the class, with the literary and cultivated men and women, and young people generally, making a select, chaste, sociable and agreeable party, and they usually promenade with the graduating class, commend them for their exercise and appearance, bid them all sorts and kinds of good wishes-and thus enjoy the evening socially, rationally, and in the most agreeable and happy manner possible. It is usually <emph>the</emph> evening of all evenings of the year. The newspapers vie with each other in giving a truthful and correct account of it; and it usually interests the parents, teachers<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5572-00000063"/> and pupils of all the schools, hugely. The graduating class are ambitious-and woe betide that unlucky wight, who should venture to say that the exercises and performances of this year were not equal to and as entertaining as they had been at any former year. Everybody is happy, and, in being so, makes everybody else exceedingly comfortable. The rich and poor meet together and merit is the only criterion of excellence. Not unfrequently, a little Irish boy will hold his head and shoulders above all the rest of the class; some of them are brilliant scholars, having not only an abundance of mother wit, but brilliant intellects and keen, quick perceptions. They are the Burkes-the Burns-the Currans of our day, and many of them will be the orators, poets, philosophers and statesmen of America; we hope none of them will have occasion to be warriors, but if they do-such soldiers as Sheridan will appear in the hour of danger and trial, and rescue America from the hand of the traitor or enemy to the constitution and to religious liberty, the equal rights of all men under the law and the constitution.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Dix met Mrs. Smith, and after a few moments conversation about their health and families, she looked at her with a sort of conscious triumph and said,"Mrs. Parks has put out one of her daughters."</p> 
               <p>"I understand she has, and into a good family, too."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed. Mr. Nye is a young man of character, much respected at home, and the family is in very good circumstances. Alice kept school there last summer and she made many friends, and now she has gone there under very pleasant circumstances. There were ever so many girls of his acquaintance who would have considered him a man not to be refused, but he chose Mrs. Parks' daughter<pb n=""/> ter and showed his good sense, or else he was in love and couldn't help it."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Taylor here joined them, and said, "O, he was in love and couldn't help it, and it was well for him he couldn't. When a young man marries a girl who tells him all the money she has is what he paid her for teaching school four months, there is no policy in the match, but a marriage for love, and because he saw in her character and habits a person in whom he could confide and whom he esteemed and couldn't help loving. Such marriages are Heaven-made and always prove blessed. Mrs. Parks is now reaping the reward of her industry and perseverance: Alice is married, Grace has graduated at the High School with the first honors of her class, having completed the three years' course in two years, and having, her teacher says, a more perfect knowledge of her studies than any other member of the class; in mathematics she has not a superior, and it is really pleasant to hear her solve problems-she has such clear and perfect understanding of them."</p> 
               <p>"Well," says Mrs. Smith, "I give it up! The result shows Mrs. Parks was right, and truly I rejoice in her success; but she is a remarkable woman. If she had kept her children together and kept them at work, as many families do, it would have seemed different; but she has not only supported them she has educated them as well and better than many rich families in town have educated their daughters, and, for my part, I don't know any family more respected or which makes a better appearance than Mrs. Parks and her daughters. Grace is certainly a girl of very superior abilities,-she acquits herself well in any position; Fanny is bright, sprightly and a great favorite,-her mother lets her remain at home with her so much that her education will not be equal to her<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5572-00000064"/> sister Grace's, but it will be sufficient for all practical purposes."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Dix said "when Mrs. Parks told me what she intended to do, I trembled for her; but she was so resolute and determined and had so much confidence in her ability that I always encouraged her. When her friend, whose name is not to be mentioned, told her he would be responsible for her rent, it was worth more than the sums he gave her. He says they were so small and amounted to so little, they are not worth mentioning. They may not have been viewed so by her, for a sum, small in itself, may make up the necessary amount and be the means of great relief to the recipient."</p> 
               <p>No one knows what they can do till they try. I remember of hearing the following story when I was a boy: Mr. Foster said to his boy, "John, go and tip over that stone." He said "O, I can't!" but when ordered again to do it, he obeyed and succeeded. His father told him never to say "I can't" again. At noon, he told John to take hold of the corner of the house and tip it over. The boy lifted away, and, when I heard the story, I couldn't help wishing he had toppled over the house and his father with it; but in this way he taught his boy not to say "I can't." Mrs. Parks never seems to know the meaning of the word-her motto being "God helps those who help themselves." She resolutely and cheerfully did the duties of the hour, and she has been eminently successful.</p> 
               <p>Grace seems to have the same spirit. She never seems to fear to undertake anything, and when she undertook to accomplish in two years what others did in three, she never had a doubt but what she could do it. Several years after she left school she gave me an account of her experience. Jenny Snow's father offered her a piano-forte if she would<pb n=""/> learn to play on it, but she took no interest in music and declined to do it; "O," said Grace, "how I wished he had made me the offer! I had to borrow many of my books, because the committee did not supply them." They had books. Such is often the case. Girls who have a plenty of money and books have no ambition, and, instead of improving their minds and of acquiring useful knowledge, spend their time and money for dress and to be stylish and fashionable; while those in moderate circumstances will improve every moment.</p> 
               <p>A young man was at my door, after I penned the above lines, and he said he was a member of an academy and he was fitting for college; when he entered the academy he had fifty cents, and when he had finished the first term he had three dollars,-having paid his bills from his own earnings. He intended to educate himself and he believed he could do it. We wanted to give him ten dollars, but he chose not to have any gifts. This young man is sure to win. He has the energy and the will necessary; he has an object, a purpose in view, which stimulates and energizes him. I never knew such a young man to fail; when he shall have finished his collegiate course he will have so disciplined his mind and have formed such habits of industry and economy that he will surely rise from one degree of eminence to another till he has made his mark-indeed till he has a name which will live. We could give his name, that thirty years hence proof might be had of what we have here stated. There is no necessity for it, for there are and always will be living witnesses of the fact, that industry-real work-makes the man; and, when that has been commenced in earnest, nothing will withstand it.</p> 
               <p>"Just as the twig is bent, the tree is inclined," an old copy<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5572-00000065"/> from which we wrote more than fifty years ago, was true then, is true now, and always will be true.</p> 
               <p>We left several ladies rather abruptly. Grace had graduated with the honors of her class. She spent the vacation with her mother, with occasionally a day with Alice, and then commenced teaching the school which her mother had engaged for her. She has now taught seven years with just such success as might have been reasonably expected. With less than three hundred dollars a year she faithfully attended to her duties for several years. Her salary is now about six hundred dollars a year. During all this time, committee after committee have visited her schools and uniformly reported unusual success. No committee have ever criticized her manner of teaching, but have uniformly commended it: "Her success has been equal to our highest expectations." She has never confined herself to school-hours, "The lessons of the day must be recited before the pupils can be dismissed," when the work of the day is done, <emph>then</emph> it is time to leave, and not till then. When remonstrated with, by other teachers, for punishing herself for the purpose of compelling the dull and indolent to do their work, her only answer has been "I can't help what others do and say. I can't dismiss my school till the work of the day is done. I was hired to teach this school, and not to stay here six hours and then run home."</p> 
               <p>She has always taught in the town where her mother resides and boarded with her on River street. No remonstrances from other teachers availed with her; when she had satisfied her conscience that she had done her duty, it was time to close her school and not till then, and not even then unless her scholars have done their work. Her sister, Fanny, has a different turn of mind: she has tact, talent and she is a leading spirit in the circles in which she moves.<pb n=""/> "We are content with our lot," says Grace. "We don't care for dress,-we have been used to be content with such as we have, and we don't intend to distress ourselves to appear any different from what we are." She is an honest, faithful, successful teacher. She has had several opportunities to change her position, but thus far has been content to be a teacher of the youth, and she has been very useful, and lives to a good purpose.</p> 
               <p>Few people can do more good than the teachers of youth. The employment is honorable and ought to be more remunerative. Fanny has also remained with her mother; skilled in all domestic duties, ready with her needle, she maintains herself genteelly and well, and but a few days since she was heard to say, she would not exchange places with any of the girls. "They have many things we can't have. We have all that is necessary, and are content."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THE habits of Americans differ from the habits of people in England, once the mother country; but now all countries are the mother country of America, for her inhabitants came from every nation, kindred or tribe known upon the face of the earth. Consequently, an American has not that attachment to his country which some others seem to have. In England, the son follows the occupation of the father, and if the father was a smith a thousand years ago, his descendents are now hammering iron; or, if the father was a woolen-manufacturer, the representative of the family is a woolen-manufacturer, whether in the Old Country or in America; and so of any other occupation, and, very likely, the old stand has been transmitted from father to son for thousands of years. But it is not so in America; the son does not often pursue the same avocation which his father did, neither does he live in the same town, nor occupy the same hamlet. If the father was an uneducated man, he felt the want of education and it would be the height of his ambition to have his sons educated, and in this matter the mother took more interest than the father; if she could see her sons and daughters at school preparing themselves for useful positions in society, she would deprive herself of many of the conveniences, if not, the actual necessities of life.</p> 
               <p>Daniel Webster was indebted to his mother for his education and, as he said, for any quickness of apprehension which he possessed above the ordinary race of men. She was a<pb n=""/> reading woman and comprehended the value of an education to her sons: "The boys must be educated, Major, if late at night and at early dawn it be necessary for me to provide for them; for knowledge will be worth more to them than money or estate." And such has been the sentiment of American women. "We must prepare our children for usefulness," is the common expression of New England women; and thus we learn why so many of them occupy positions in every nook and corner of the great republic.</p> 
               <p>A Frenchman once said, "Let me write and sing the songs of the people, and I will control the nation." But in New England the sons and daughters are modelled by their mothers. Let me know the mother and the future of the son may be foretold with the accuracy with which an astronomer will calculate an eclipse or determine the elevation of a mountain or the depth of the ocean,-but, ordinarily, she must have the co-operation of the father, or the father must have the ordinary sense allotted to the majority of the species. The sons may possess much more ability than the father, but they never excel the mother in intellect or native power. By education their minds may be developed and they may make their mark in the world, but to their mother they are indebted for their "quickness of apprehension," their bound sense, correct taste and judgment. A weak-minded woman was never the mother of an eminent man, but a man of ordinary ability has often been the father of the most brilliant and eminent men in the nation or world.</p> 
               <p>It is not uncommon to find the sons of distinguished men their inferior in mind, influence and character, and for no other reason than that the mother had little capacity, much less than the father. The mother of Webster had no superior; with an eye, black, keen, penetrating, and without much<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5572-00000067"/> education in early life, she possessed great intellectual power and she comprehended the value of books and the advantages which education gave men, and this advantage she secured her sons,-and they were their mother's sons, her perfect representatives. History may not do her justice, for little was known of women in her day beyond the family circle, and few men seemed to appreciate the power of the mother in imparting physical and mental ability to the child.</p> 
               <p>In the little village where the needle-woman lived, a man with a wife and children resided, who had lived in a village not far distant but who found it for his interest to change his residence. He was a mechanic, an industrious, honest man, not ambitious for place or power, but he assiduously provided for his family, and, after the work of the day was done, his greatest ambition was to be with the wife of his bosom and the mother of his children. He consequently enjoyed home, and as he spent his evenings there, his children loved home, and it was a pleasure to them to be with father and listen to words of wisdom from him. There is no place like home to the child, if the parents are kind, affectionate, social and agreable. Many a child has been driven from home by the moroseness, sternness of the father, and because the father took no interest in the little matters which were the life of the son, and thus the son would seek places unfit for him and consequently be lost to his parents and the world.</p> 
               <p>One of the great sins of some fathers consists in keeping their children at a distance from them, and in never giving them their confidence. But such was not the fault of Mr. Lambert; his children were his blessing, his house his home, and they desired no other, and, when of proper age, at the village school they were prompt, diligent and obedient, and<pb n=""/> in their studies and proficiency their parents manifested much interest, and, consequently, an hour spent in looking over the lessons at evening was very agreeable to the children. But Charles, only, has any peculiar interest in these pages, and here it may only be necessary to say he left the High School with the respect of his teachers and with a character for sobriety and a demeanor for propriety and correct deportment much above and superior to young lads of his age, and in a short time he was sought, for a place where there was great responsibility, and where integrity was an indispensible requisite; and for years he filled this place to the entire satisfaction of his employers and secured for himself their confidence and a reputation which cannot be bought nor valued in coin.</p> 
               <p>As a matter of course, there were lawyers in this village, and one of them took great interest in the youth of the village and invited them to his office, where he would spend an hour with them socially and without any austerity and in such a manner as to secure their confidence and respect. Charles was of this number, and finding the lawyer alone in his office, he asked him if he knew Mr. Parks in his life-time, and receiving an affirmative answer, he inquired his character, and received the following account: He was a man of strict integrity; in early life trusted by men of means and ever found faithful. His father was an honest farmer, whom he had often seen in the village and whom he knew well, and his sons are all industrious, prudent men, "not of much show but they work for a living, pay their debts and fulfill their contracts. They are an honest family. Mr. Parks, of whom you inquire, unfortunately accepted office, and, somehow, such men never seem to accumulate property, whether it is taken from them to sustain the party or for other purposes when<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5572-00000068"/> there is a change of administration and consequently a change of subordinate officers, no one of them seems to have anything left; and such was the case with Mr. Parks,-when he left his office he had spent many of his best days, but he left it with less than he had when he entered, and he commenced business again. But years had made changes, and after a few years, his health began to fail him, and he sickened and died. He left his family without means, but he had the reputation of being an honest man." Charles said he wanted to know, or was glad to know-or words to that effect-and no more.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THERE are attractions in all the avocations of life. The young aspire to be merchants, that they may be rich and have everything that their eyes covet or their hearts desire, while some aspire to be learned, and others great, and others seek power and position; but all these never satisfy the mind. The literary man is seldom satisfied with his learning,-the man of position seeks something beyond, which attracts his attention and which seems necessary to the fulfillment of his ambition, and for the attainment of which he will spend his time and his strength; and the merchant, after weary days and nights of counting his gold and reckoning his profits, longs for the country, where, upon the farm, he may enjoy life and be free from the anxiety of credits and the perplexities of business. But the young farmer finds constant enjoyment in his work: he looks upon his fields,-they invite him to sow his seed and patiently wait the blessing of Heaven. The blade and the tender herb in the field are, to him, sources of much joy; the lowing of the ox, the neighing of the horse and bleating of the lamb are music to his ear. What is more beautiful than the waving field of grain, or sweeter than the smell of new-mown grass, or what is more attractive than the pasture, in which the horse, the ox, the cow, the sheep, the calves, the lambs do all leave their grazing and run to bid him welcome to their enclosure. There is something majestic in the noble ox,-the man of<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5572-00000069"/> letters, the statesmen, or divine never tire of looking at him with his stately gait and dignified demeanor.</p> 
               <p>Webster had his friends around him: the learned jurist, the eloquent barrister, the devout divine, the eminent physician and his never-tiring friend were there to comfort him in his dying hour, to hear from him his last words of wisdom and to console him in his last hours. They were not enough. "Tell John to drive the oxen to the window, that I may once more see their faces before I die." Such was his admiration of this animal that the sight of him eased his pain and caused him almost to forget he was dying.</p> 
               <p>The higher the cultivation of the mind the more comprehensive the intellect, the greater the love of Nature and the animals which God made for man. To the cultivated man there is always an attraction about the old farm homestead; the little rivulet where he, with pin-hook, caught his first shiner, and where he has seen the little trout dart and hide beneath the rock or the overgrown moss, afford him a peculiar pleasure. Then the yard filled with the domestic animals which look to him for sustenance and protection, and which are ready to do service at his bidding give him peculiar satisfaction and delight.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nye, when his first vision extended beyond the walls of the nursery, saw the animals pass around the farm, and he soon began to follow them to the barn and then to the pasture, and, as he grew up and began to care for and protect them, his interest in them increased and the pleasure of the farm and the farm-life satisfied him. He and Alice were now living together where he was born and where he first began to realize the objects, the ends of life. Life was now a reality to him. To be a good husband, a good citizen, an upright man, respected by himself and his fellow-citizens, to<pb n=""/> cultivate his farm and secure his crops in their season, to economise all his resources-that each year might secure him a small surplus above the ordinary and incidental expenses of his household-occupied his attention and gave him employment the year round. There was nothing peculiar in his farm; it was situated a few rods from, but in sight of the main stage-road, it had its undulating land, its hills and dales, its fields, its pasture and its wood with rivulets and springs, and it produced well, for it was cultivated with care and judgment. It had its peculiar attractions for Mr. Nye, because it was his birth-place and the birth-place of his grandfathers, whose children had left to pursue avocations agreeable to their tastes and inclinations, leaving Mr. Nye's father at home to care for and protect their parents in the decline of life; consequently, the homestead was, by common consent, his birth-right.</p> 
               <p>And now George was content to do as his father had done, and Alice was his wife, to share the duties, the pleasures, the responsibilities of life with him, and here they were content; and here Mrs. Parks and Grace and Fanny were ever welcome to spend a day, a week or a month, as their several duties would permit, and here they enjoyed the hour as those whose objects, whose joys and sorrows are one can enjoy life; and here, too, when the door was closed at the dwelling on River street, Charles Lambert, Israel Taylor and Thomas Woods found it pleasant to spend an evening with Grace and Fanny, a few miles' ride adding to the enjoyment of the hour, and no wonder, for Grace was intelligent, sharp, and entertaining, having unusual conversational powers, while Fanny was bright, sprightly, and attractive.</p> 
               <p>And here we leave Mr. and Mrs. Nye for the present, enjoying life. They were independent. Their independence<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5572-00000070"/> consists in their habits of diligence, prudence and economy, and in limiting their wants to their means. Their wants are not meagre nor their means scanty, but they have all that may be necessary for a happy and useful life. What more can the rich have? What more can they enjoy? What do the gay, the fashionable, the millionaires have which can be compared to this-or what would they give for that independence which lifts them above pride, vanity and fashionable life?<figure> </figure>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>THERE are some young men, whose conduct cannot be reconciled with honorable dealing, good manners, good breeding, nor with that propriety or delicacy of feeling which should be the heritage of every cultivated young man. Many don't weigh the consequences of their acts or professions. It is not unusual for some young men to show marked attention to young ladies of their acquaintance, to excite expectations and to give occasion or reasons for supposing their intentions have meaning and a purpose, and they conduct themselves in such a manner as to show they have neither sincerity, honor or integrity, and, strange as it may seem, sometimes such young men enlist the feelings and secure the affections of a cultivated young lady. Society suffers from the insincerity and duplicity of such parties.</p> 
               <p>But we find less of this class of young men in the middle walks of life than we do in the more fashionable and trifling circles, and here indeed, their characters are properly appreciated, and they are met by parties whose sincerity and friendship is like tow in the fire. It is evanescent. It has no worth. It cannot rise above self-gratification or self-aggrandisement. It does not elevate, but depresses. It does not produce union and harmony, but discord and strife; and when parties of such character are united in the <emph>holy bands of matrimony</emph>, they may, for a while, tolerate each other, but the true felicity, the union of heart and soul and the happiness<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5572-00000071"/> ness which arises from seeking to promote peace, the contentment, the well-being, the desire to render each other's condition equally peaceful, and to realize all their excited hopes or expectations, or to joy with each other's joy or sorrow with each other's sorrow has never seemed to them to be a part of life; but selfishness, self-gratification, self-indulgence is the ruling passion with them, and, with such, life is a mere strife, a broil, without noble purposes, without honorable ends; it may be endured, but it is a stranger to enjoyment, to the sincere felicity of the disinterested friend or lover.</p> 
               <p>But in the middle walks of life ambition, the desire to attract attention, to secure <foreign xml:lang="FRA">eclat</foreign> is not the prominent motive or feeling, but to love and be loved, to merit affection, to secure confidence, to trust and be trusted, to make happy and be happy is the prominent desire and purpose of life.</p> 
               <p>When Charles Lambert made inquiries of the character of Mr. Parks he had an object, honorable to him, and the result of the inquiry may have been the turning-point in his life. He was acquainted with Mrs. Parks and her daughters. There was no occasion to inquire about them; his own observation gave him all the information necessary, all, indeed, he desired. He visited at the house on River street, he met Grace and Fanny at the social-circle, he saw them, he conversed with them, he knew their characters. They knew his character, his habits, his reputation. They took pleasure in seeing him promoted from one position to another, and as they heard his name mentioned with approbation, it afforded them pleasure. Fanny said he was a good friend. They never had a brother. The friendship of a young man of character, who had secured the respect and confidence of men, was to them a treasure of great value. They appreciated his friendship;<pb n=""/> they cultivated his acquaintance. Common sense was not a stranger to Mrs. Parks and her daughters. Life to them had a meaning, a purpose and end. They saw much of life. They had lived much in society, for, at their house, work must be done for a great number of persons with greatly diversified characters. Perhaps Mrs. Parks' work-room was as good a place to study character as any other position or condition. The young people were often there; the middle-aged, the matron who had daughters whom she was about to introduce into society and sons for whom she desired to secure the respect and confidence of the community. Their views, feelings, desires, intentions were here often expressed without reserve, and it was not difficult to determine the motive and the governing principle of their lives.</p> 
               <p>Human nature seems to be the same it was in the days of the fathers, and it will, probably, continue the same, notwithstanding kings are losing their authority and the people begin to understand, appreciate and assert their rights. Time passes rapidly. It seems but a few days since Mrs. Parks undertook to sustain herself and daughters with the needle. It seems but a few days since Mrs. Taylor called and offered her employment. But Alice has been married, and she is a mother; Grace has taught school for seven years, and her salary has been increased from two hundred and forty dollars to six hundred dollars; Fanny has grown to be a young woman, educated, yea, more versed in all the domestic duties of the family; and Charles Lambert and a host of other lads, who, but yesterday, were driving the hoop or tossing the ball, are young men, occupying useful and responsible positions. Such is life.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>MRS. Parks has never regretted that she undertook to support herself and daughters with her needle. Mr. and Mrs. Nye often call and seat themselves in the work-room, with a beautiful daughter, with whom God has blessed them. His sister, Mary, long since married, and she, also, lives upon a farm, a mile or two from the old mansion, with her husband and three children worth living for. Mr. Nye's house is always open for Mrs. Parks and her daughters, and, many a day have they whiled away in this retired and beautiful farmhouse, where contentment and, consequently, happiness reign triumphant.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks says her daughters have never suffered for the want of anything; it would have been convenient and agreeable to have had many things which they have not had, but as for actual suffering-they know it not. And now, with proper industry and economy, they are independent, and, as age advances and her ability lessens, she has no fear but what she will have all the necessaries and many of the conveniences of life. It is not to be supposed that these parties have had uninterrupted good health, that no sickness has entered their dwelling, for such is not usual in families in New England. Fanny, in her early school-days, was often compelled to remain at home, from indisposition; Grace has, also, found the attendance of a physician, twice a day, necessary to stay the raging of disease; and Mrs. Parks has often found the<pb n=""/> labors of the day so exhaustive that to-morrow has found her prostrate, and rest absolutely necessary for her physical being.</p> 
               <p>On the sea-shore, in some parts of New England, of late years, have been erected tenements for the accommodation of families who wish to go to the sea-shore and enjoy the bracing air from the ocean without the expense or annoyance of fashion, pride and vanity. A few days since, in one of these tenements was a woman with her two daughters. They provided their own meals and enjoyed the beauties of the ocean and breathed its invigorating air. Mrs. Parks had been to the ocean before and so had her daughters, but now they were there for several days, and saw the waves rise and recede, strike the earth and then roll back again, just so, day by day and evening by evening. In the distance were the white sails passing before them, and occasionally a steam-boat cutting its way through the watery deep, all of which were beautiful and exciting; but then, as the sun appeared in the morning, coming out of the deep sea, and the moon, at night, rolling itself out of thick water, the mind is awed into silence.</p> 
               <p>The majesty of Heaven is in sight: We see the sun rise and the moon and stars appear in their turn, and think nothing of it; but by the ocean-side the moon and stars, the ocean with constant and never-varying roar, the ships at sea, and the waves-interrupted by no hand, stayed by no power-all combined to render the scene grand,-awful. And here were Mrs. Parks and her daughter Fanny full of life and spirit, exclaiming "O, how wonderful! How grand! How splendid!" but Grace sat looking, not a word dropped from her lips. She saw with what mathematical precision wave after wave appeared, the moon, never so beautiful, never so splendid, never so magnificent before. She contemplated, she saw, she<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5572-00000073"/> enjoyed the whole scene in comparative silence, in wonder and admiration. Beautiful, splendid, magnificent were words too insignificant to express the depth of her soul.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Mother, there <emph>is</emph> a God. He rules in Heaven above and on earth beneath. There is no chance here. These ocean waves don't beat these shores as one that dreameth. The majesty of Heaven is here. The greatness of Jehovah is spread out before us, and he, who thinks he can escape His judgments or hide from His presence, let him here put out his hands and stay the waves of the mighty ocean. Yes, mother, there is a God of mighty power, a God of Justice, of Love and of Mercy. He is in the ocean depth, He is in the firmament above as He is here. He is everywhere."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my dear. And He is the God whom I have trusted; He is the God upon whom I have relied, and He is the God, who, with tender eye, looks upon the widow and the fatherless. He is true,-His word is true. He never forsakes those who trust Him. He is the widow's God and a father to the fatherless."</p> 
               <p>For a day, Mr. Nye, Alice and Lucy were there, to enjoy the ocean wave, to breathe the pure and invigorating air from its mighty depths; but it was no place for the needle-woman and her jewels to forget, but just the place and the scene to impress upon them, the duties of the hour, and the obligations of man to his Maker. Can there be a man so stupid, after spending a day, a night here, to deny the God who made him? But when the mighty ocean is in full view with all its beauty, its grandeur and magnificence, and man stops to think, to reflect, to consider the power and wisdom of the Creator, the power with which the ocean moves, and the wisdom, which, in the creation, planned and completed and sustained His works, he may well exclaim, "Wonderful!<pb n=""/> Wonderful are Thy Works; in Wisdom hast Thou made them all."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Parks was impressed-her daughters were impressed with the wisdom and mighty power, which was in full view. Others might rant "around in pleasure's ring" and neither see nor feel the power and wisdom which was before them. Others might waste their talents or bury them in mirth and levity, but here Mrs. Parks and her daughters could but see and adore-and grow wiser and better every hour. They returned to their duties cheerful and happy; cheerful, because they had long since learned to be content with their condition and circumstances, and happy, because such is the reward of industry and virtue, a reward to which they were eminently entitled, and which no earthly power could wrest from them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>A CLOUD appears in the horizon. It looks dark; it portends a storm, a wind, perhaps a hurricane, it may be a gentle rain, which will refresh and beautify the earth. We look at it often, watch its movements, scan its appearance and begin to express opinions of its force, its effect and consequences. But it moves on, it heeds not any obstructions, and its effects may be seen by the upturning of trees, the demolishing of buildings and devastation generally in its course. Men look, wonder,-they are appalled. The propelling power is beyond their conception, its force is irresistible. Men are disarmed; they see their own weakness and a power which they can neither resist nor control. A storm arises among men. They look at each other with flashing eyes, with knit brows, with frowns and in anger. An attempt to allay the storm is as useless as the attempt to control the hurricane. The pent-up fires are lighted, the smouldering embers are on fire; they increase and spread, till a general conflagration claims and arouses the people to action, to self-protection. They then act with decision, with power, with efficiency.</p> 
               <p>The angry multitude must be appeased, if the life of men be requisite-if brothers war with brothers, and the nation fly to arms. The experience of the last few years show how men will act when their favorite institutions are attacked, or the liberties of their country or the integrity of their government are in peril. The young men are for war, often<pb n=""/> impelled by those who look to them for protection, but who will sacrifice brothers for their country and who regard death for one's country honorable. Better to die on the battle field than to live with a country dishonored or with traitors triumphant.</p> 
               <p>During the late civil strife young men could not die restrained from offering their lives to their country, and not unusual was the exclamation, "I may live thirty years, and then it is not in me to say to my children that I took no part in subduing the great American Rebellion. I would rather die,-much rather die on the field of battle, in defence of my country, than to live-having had no share in rescuing her from the hand of the destroyer!" Words were of not much account on such occasions; action, <emph>action</emph> is the word. To arms! To arms! Your country calls ! Her claim is <emph>now</emph>,-immediate; it will admit of no delay. When the struggle had progressed the danger seemed imminent, and men assembled in multitudes to hear one and another talk of patriotism, the dangers and duties of the hour. A young man takes the platform-thousands of eyes upon him and a breathless stillness in the vast assembly-and, with nerve and energy, he says to them, "I'm going to war! I'm going to war! I'm going to war!" The stillness of the moment was past. The round of applause, the "hurrah" of the whole assembly cheered, nerved, energised the youth, the hope of the country. The quota was filled. The country was safe.</p> 
               <p>How changed was everything during the fearful and momentous struggle! Young men were marching to the music of The Union. They thought of little but the defence of their country, the integrity of their government, and the union of the great republic. The day of deliverance came. The republic lives, and now young men and maidens begin to be<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5572-00000075"/> themselves again, and, though many a heart sighs for the friend buried in a patriot's grave, the fact that he died in defence of his country soothes the aching heart and dries the falling tear. Those, however, who, in the meantime, have grown to manhood, begin to realize their duties and obligations.</p> 
               <p>To live alone is not life; it is mere subsistence, without any of the joys or sorrows of life. These are wonderfully and wisely mixed. Variety is said to be the spice of life; what would that life be which is all joy or all sorrow? A stale existence. It would have no variety, no charm. Providence is wise. He <choice>
                     <sic>meets</sic>
                     <corr>metes</corr>
                  </choice> to us joys and sorrows; such a variety that one relieves the other. If it were all sunshine, we should never know the beauties of the summer rain, nor the glory of the rainbow; and if it were all joy, we should never know the relief from sorrow, the worth of sympathy, or the value of friendship,-and if it were all sorrow, how dark the picture would be, how sad the countenance, how vacant the smile. Indeed, there would be no smile. But now how sweet a smile is, how valuable to the aching heart. It is surpassing calculations, it cannot be valued in coin, treasures will not buy it, riches cannot gain it. It is beyond the reach of the miser; it is worth more than silver or gold, because it gives what silver and gold cannot give: it gives relief to an aching heart, it gives peace to a troubled soul. What is life without a friend? Ah, more, what is life without a companion?</p> 
               <p>Charles Lambert had the confidence of his fellow-men. He respected himself, and he was respected. But, after the duties of the day had been faithfully discharged, something was wanting. He might not know precisely what, but he found his way to Mrs. Parks' house on River street and he<pb n=""/> met Grace and Fanny, and here, in the social circle, he found relief from the burdens of the day or the duties of the hour, and soon he found his calls here as regular as the calls of his business or the duties of the hour, and thus he experienced the fact that it was not good for man to be alone. Indeed, he could not live alone. The approbation of friends did not satisfy, the respect of his fellow-men was not all his heart desired. But when at the house of Mrs. Parks, there seemed to be a satisfaction, a contentment, a relief, which his very nature desired, which his very soul craved, and he found himself often in the society of Grace and Fanny, and that the society seemed necessary to his existence. But he had common sense, and this led him to the correct appreciation of the fact that he could not live alone,-ah, more: that he could not live without Fanny Parks-and he did not want to-and he told her so,-and she told him he need not, for <emph>she</emph> would live with him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>WHEN Mrs. Parks was married, more than thirty years ago, engagement rings were uncommon in the villages of New England; but now a diamond ring-an engagement ring-follows an engagement as a matter of course. In a few days Mr. Lambert had it finished and he presented it to Fanny, who received it with much grace and propriety. And now the news passed from one to another, and the congratulations Mrs. Parks received were frequent and sincere. Fanny smiled, as the young folks told her they knew it would be so and they thought she had been fortunate, "for we all think well of Mr. Lambert."</p> 
               <p>"And so do I," said Fanny.</p> 
               <p>Indeed they had reason to, for he had an unsullied reputation and had shown himself not only trusty and faithful, but capable. Some young men seem to be honest, but they have no tact or turn for business: They can do what they are told, but lack the capacity to manage business, the judgment and self-reliance which are requisite for success. It is not only necessary to know how and what to do, but to have energy, "snap," as the Yankees say,-a capacity for dispatch and for completing what is commenced. It is not unfrequent that the remark is made of a young man: "He seems to be honest and trusty, but he has no business in him." Capacity as well as honesty is necessary to the successful transaction of business.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Perhaps no persons felt more interest in Mrs. Parks and her daughters than Mrs. Dix and Mrs. Taylor. At the sewing-circle, they made it a subject of conversation and expressed much satisfaction in the fact that they had been the early friends of Mrs. Parks, and that she had so much comfort in her daughters.</p> 
               <p>"When I first called on her," says Mrs. Taylor, "Fanny was a little girl, bright, sprightly, full of life and very attractive as some little creatures are, and now she has grown up to be a young woman and she is engaged to be married. It seems but a few days since you called my attention to Mrs. Parks and her daughters, Mrs. Dix."</p> 
               <p>"No, it is only a few days, and yet it is nearly twenty years since Mr. Parks died. I am so glad Mr. Lambert has made such a choice, and a wise one, too, I think!"</p> 
               <p>"For my part, I think he is worthy of any young lady in the village, and in making the selection he has, he has consulted his own good sense and judgment, and has not chosen a young lady because her father was rich, and, some time, may leave her money, but he relies upon himself, and Fanny will make him a wife, a partner. She is accomplished in all the domestic duties of the household, which is worth more to a young man than skillful playing on the piano or any of the fashionable accomplishments of this age. Beside, she can receive and entertain company as pleasantly as any young person of her age."</p> 
               <p>Here, Mrs. Smith came up and said, "Ladies, you seem to be much interested in your conversation."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Dix, "I suppose you have heard that Mrs. Parks has concluded to put out another of her daughters: Fanny, the youngest."</p> 
               <p>"O yes; I have heard of it, and I was much pleased when<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5572-00000077"/> I heard of it. I thought Mrs. Parks undertook too much after the death of her husband, but I tell you what, Mrs. Dix, I believe Providence smiles on industry, and I believe He has peculiar care of fatherless children. Now, how many young ladies in the village we could name, who are highly educated, whose fathers have an abundance of wealth and who occupy position in society and command influence and who could give a young man advancement at once, and who would gladly have given Mr. Lambert their daughters! But he has chosen another, who has neither money nor rich friends, but who nevertheless, will make him happy, and will help him surmount difficulties and, in the voyage of life, triumph with a buoyant spirit, cheerful, self-reliant. She has seen much of real life, while many young ladies, educated, fashionable, have no correct idea of life, no practical views of what life really is, though they have been introduced into society with all the advantages which education, wealth and position could give them."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mrs. Smith, it is so, and we think Mr. Lambert has made a wise choice, and though I have no personal acquaintance with him," said Mrs. Taylor, "I have great respect for him from what I have heard of him, and this last act increases my respect. I shall congratulate Mrs. Parks when I see her, and Fanny too. I really can rejoice with her, for I have always felt a great interest in her and she will ever have my kindest wishes for her health and happiness."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Dix says she had seldom known so popular an engagement. She had heard it mentioned by many ladies in the village and they all seemed to be glad,-"they could not have been more so had she been one of their own daughters."</p> 
               <p>"I don't wonder at all," said Mrs. Taylor, "for we have<pb n=""/> all witnessed the efforts, energy and diligence of Mrs. Parks, and we all hope the evening of life with her will be pleasant and free from care and anxiety."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Smith said "Her example is worthy of imitation, indeed more,-of the highest commendation; and when I see any one complaining of the hardships of life, I point them to Mrs. Parks and tell them to imitate her in industry, diligence and economy and they will find their burdens lighter and their causes of complaint, like the hills in the distance smaller and smaller the nearer you approach them."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>MRS. Parks is now past fifty years of age. It is near twenty years since she found herself with three jewels, sunbeams, looking to her alone for sustenance and stimulating her to exertion, to diligence, and, at the same time, shedding light in her path and making life desirable and full of hope and joy.</p> 
               <p>Many changes have taken place in that time: The companions of her youth have passed away, leaving one here and another there,-now in the decline of life. Upon some,-<emph>fortune</emph>, some would say,-we say <emph>Providence</emph> has smiled. Others have struggled with adversity and found the trials of life many and frequent. Sunshine and shade seem to be the inheritance of mankind. To know how to enjoy the sunshine, and in the shade prepare for the reappearance of the sun, and at all times to regard the light and shade with equanimity, with self-reliance and reconciliation, is true philosophy. The future is before us; we cannot penetrate a moment. It is well we cannot. We can look upon the past,-review it, consider it, and learn wisdom from its teachings. But when we ask "What will be on the morrow?" We can only reply, "To-morrow is in the hand of Providence; His infinite wisdom has not revealed it to us." We discharge the duties of the hour and meet them as they come. Three-score years, and the little ones, whom we protected, taught and loved, are side-by-side with us in the journey of Life.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Alice, Mrs. Parks' eldest daughter, long since assumed the duties of married life. Her daughter accompanies her to the house on River street and sheds light on the path of the household. Grace, for ten years, has been the faithful, honest teacher. It is impossible to value the services of a teacher of the young; wages are paid them for their time and labor, but the value of those services to class after class, year after year, cannot be determined by dollars and cents. They are seldom appreciated. They come as a matter of course and, like many of the privileges and blessings of life, no estimate is ever placed upon them, because they are beyond the comprehension of finite beings.</p> 
               <p>We might continue this narrative, but our purpose is accomplished. Mrs. Parks may live many years; light shines in her path. The decline of life is cheerful and happy, and she lives relying upon that Providence, who helps those who help themselves, and who is the widow's God and a Father to the fatherless.</p>
