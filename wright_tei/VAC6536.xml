UNIVERSITY PRESS: WELCH, BIGELOW, &amp; CO., CAMBRIDGE.   GOOD STORIES. THE METEMPSYCHOSIS. CHAPTER I. A SLIGHT shudder came over me as I was entering the inner court of the College of Gottingen. It was, however, but momentary ; and on recovering from it, I felt botlh taller and heav- ier, and altogether more vigorous, than the instant before. Being rather nervous, I did not much mind these feelings, imputing them to some sudden determination to the brain, or some unusual beating about the heart, which had assailed me suddenly, and as suddenly left me. On proceeding, I met a student coming in the opposite di- rection. I had never seen, him before, but as he passed me by, he nodded familiarly,-"There is a fine day, Wolstang." -"What does this fellow mean?" said I to myself "He speaks to me with as much ease as if I had been his intimate acquaintance. And he calls mnie Wolstang, - a person to whom I bear no more resemblance than to the man in the moon." I looked after him for some time, pondering whether I should call him back and demand an explana- tion; but before'I could form any resolution, he was out of my sight. Thinking it needless to take any further notice of the circum- stance, I went on. Another student, whom I did not know, now passed me. "Charming weather, Wolstang." - ' Wolstang again!" said I; " this is insufferable. Hollo, I say! what do you mean?" But at this very moment he entered the library, and either did not hear my voice, or paid no attention to it.&#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6536-00000003"/> 4          GOOD STORIES. As I was standing in a mood between race and vexation, a batch ES of Collegians came up, talking loud and laughing. Three, with whom I was intimately acquainted, took no notice of me; while I two, to whom I was totally unknown, saluted me with "Good morn- ing, Wolstang." One of these latter, after having passed me a few  yards, turned round and cried out, "Wolstang, your cap is awry." I did not know what to make of this preposterous conduct. Could it be premeditated? It was hardly possible, or I must have discovered the trick in the countenances of those who addressed me. Could it be that they really mistook me for Wolstang? This was still more incredible, for Wolstang was fully six inches taller, four stones heavier, and ten years older than I. I found myself in a maze of bewilderment in endeavoring to discover the cause of all this. I reflected upon it in vain, summoning to my assistance the aids of Logic and Metaphysics to unravel the mystery. Nay, Euclid was not forgotten. I called to mind the intricate problems of science which a rigid study of this- Prince of Mathematicians had enabled me to solve; but on the present occasion my thoughts, though screwed to the utmost pitch of philosophical acumen, com- pletely failed in their aim. While meditating as in "a revery on these events, I was aroused by approaching steps. On looking up,'I beheld the most learned Doc- tor Dedimus Dunderhead, Provost, and Professor of Moral Philos- ophy to the College. He was a man about five feet high; but so far as rotundity of corporation went, noways deficient. On the con- trary, he was uncommonly fat, and his long-waisted velvet coat of office, buttoning over a capacious belly, showed underneath a pair of thick stumpy legs, cased in short small-clothes and silk stockings, and bedizened at the knees with large buckles of silver. The Doc- tor had on, as usual, his cocked hat, below whose rim at each side descended the copious curls of an immense bob-wig. His large carbuncle nose was adorned with a pair of spectacles, through which he looked pompously from side to side, holding back his head in gren- adier fashion, and knocking his long silver-headed baton to the earth, as he walked with all the formal precision of a drum-major.  Ai^   THE METEMPSYCHOSIS.           S5 Now be it known that it is binding on every student who attends the University of Gottingen, to doff his cap on meeting this illus- trious personage. This is not an optional ceremony; it is a com- pulsory one; and never on any occasion has it been known to be neglected, except once by a Dutchman, who, in consequence there- of, was expelled the College. It may be guessed, then, what was my degree of stupefaction when I saw Doctor Dunderhead approach, when I heard his baton striking upon the ground, responsive to his steps, - when I saw his large eyes, reflected through the specta- cles, looking intently upon me, -I say my stupefaction may be guessed, when, even on this occasion, my hand did not make one single motion upward towards my cap. The latter still stuck to my head, and I stood folded in my college gown, my mouth half open, and my eyes fixed upon the Doctor in empty abstraction. I could see that he was angry at my tardy recognition of his presence; and as he came nearer me, he slackened his pace a little, as if to give me an opportunity of amending my neglect. However, I was so drowned in reflection that I did not take the hint. At last he made a sudden stop directly in front of me, folded his arms in the same manner as mine, and looked upwards in my face with a fixed glance, as much as to say, "Well, master, what now?"   I never' thought the Doctor so little, or myself so tall, as at this noment. ' Having continued some time in the above attitude, he took off his hat, and made me a profound bow. "Mr. Wolstang, I am your most humble servant." Then rising up, he lifted his baton to- wards my cap, and knocked it off. "Your cap is awry," continued he. "Excuse me, Mr. Wolstang, it is really awry upon your head." Another bow of mockery, as profound as the first, followed this - action; and he marched away, striking his baton on the ground, holding back his head, and walking with slow, pompous step down the College court. "What the devil is the meaning of this?" said I. "Wolstang again! Confusion, this is no trick! The Provost of the College engage in a deception upon me, -impossible! They are all mad,&#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6536-00000004"/>  or I am mad! Wolstang from one,- Wolstang from another,- Wolstang from Doctor Dedimus Dunderhead! I will see to the bottom of this, -I will go to Wolstang's house immediately." So saying, I snatched up my cap, put it on my head, and walked smartly down the court to gain the street where he lived. Before I got far, a young man met me. - "By the by, Wolstang, I wish you could let me have the ten gilders I lent you. I require them immediately." "Ten gilders!" said I; "I don't owe you a far- thing. I never saw your face before, and my name is not Wolstang; it is Frederick Stadt." "Psha!- But, Wolstang, laying'jesting aside," continued he, "I must positively have them." "Have what?" "My dear fellow, the ten gilders." "Ten devils!--I tell you, I don't owe you a farthing." "Really, Wolstang, this joke is very silly. We know you are an odd fellow, but this is the most foolish prank I ever saw you play." "Wolstang again!" said I, my heart boiling with indignation. "I tell you, sir, -I tell you, sir, that-- that- "I could not get out another word, to such a degree had indignation confounded me. Without finishing my sentence, I rushed into the street, but not without hearing the person say, "By heaven, he is either mad or drunk!" In a moment I was at Wolstang's lodgings, and set the knocker agoing with violence. The door was opened by his servant-girl Louise, a buxom wench of some eighteen or twenty. "Is Mr. Wolstang in?"I demanded, quickly. "Mr. who, sir?" "Mr. Wolstang, my dear." "Mr. Wol-   Mr. who, sir?- I did not hear you." "Mr. Wolstang." "Mr. Wolstang!" re-echoed the girl, with some surprise. "Assuredly, I ask you if Mr. Wolstang is within." "Mr. Wolstang!" reiterated she. "Ha, ha, ha! how droll you are to-day, master!"   "Damnation! what do you mean?" cried I, in a fury, which I now found it impossible to suppress. "Tell me this instant if Mr. Wolstang, your master, is at home, or by the beard of Socrates, I---I-"- "Ha, ha! this is the queerest thing I ever heard of," said the lit- tle jade, retreating into the house, and holding her sides with laugh- ter. "Come here, Barnabas, and hear our master asking for himself." I now thought that the rage into which I had thrown myself had excited the laughter of the wench, whom I knew very well to be of a frolicsome disposition, and much disposed to turn people into ridi- cule. I therefore put on as grave a face as I could - I even threw a smile into it - and. said, with all the composure and good-humor I could muster, "Come now, my dear, conduct me to your master; I am sure he is within." This only set her a-laughing more than ever; not a word could I get out of her. At last Barnabas made his appearance from the kitchen, and to him I addressed myself. "Barnabas," said I, laying' my hand upon his arm, "I conjure you, as you value my happiness, to tell me if Mr. Wolstang is at home?" "Sir!" said Barnabas, with a long stare. I repeated my question. "Did you ask," replied he, "if Mr. Wolstang was at home? If that gentleman is yourself, he is at home. O yes, I warrant you, my master is at home." "In what place is he, then?"I inquired. "Wherever you are, he is not far off, I warrant you, master." "Can I find him in his study?" "O yes," continued Barnabas; " if you go to his study, I warrant you he'll be there. Will you please to walk in, sir?" and I could see the fellow put his finger to his nose and wink to the girl, who kept tittering away in a corner. As soon as I wats in the study she tit burst into a loud laugh, which ended by her declaring that I must be mad-"Or drunk," quoth the sapient Barnabas, in his usual dry manner.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6536-00000005"/>   On entering the room, no person was to be seen ; but from behind a large scleen, which stood fronting the fire, I heard a sneeze. "This must be Wolstang," thoulght I: "but it is not his sneeze either; it is too sharp and finical for him; however, let us see." So on I went behind the screen, and there beheld, not the person I expected, but one very different, - to wit, a little, meafre, brown- faced elderly gentleman, with hooked nose and chin, a lon!, well- powdered queue, and a wooden leg. He was dressed in a snuff-col- ored surtout, a scarlet waistcoat, and black small-clothes buckled at the knee; and on his nose was stuck a pair of tortoise-shell specta- cles, the glasses of which were of most unusual dimensions. A dapper-looking eocked-hat lay upon the table, together with a large open snuff-box full of rich rappee. Behind his right ear a pen was stuck, after the manner of the counting-house, and he seemed busily poring ovrer a book in manuscript. I looked a few seconds at this oddity, equally astonished and vexed at being put into what I naturally supposed the wrong room. "I am afraid, sir," said I, as he turned his eyes towards me, " that I have intruded upon your privacy.  I beg, leave to apologize for the mistake. The servant led me to believe that Mr. Wolstan, with whom I wished to speak, was in this chamber." "Don't talk of apology, my dear sir," said the little gentleman rising up and bowing with the utmost politeness. "Be seated; sir - be seated.  Indeed, I am just here on the same errand to see Mr. Wolstang-   eh (a sneeze) - that rappee is certainly very strong.  Do me  the honor to occupy the seat opposite. I under- stand from  the servants that he is expected soon." (Another sneeze.) For the first five minutes I did not form a very high opinion of this new acquaintance.  He seemed to have all the fidgety polite- ness and intolerable chit-chat of a French petite maire of the old school. He bored me with questions and apologies, hoped I felt myself comfortable -and every interval of his speech was filled up by intolerable giggingand sneezing.  In order, as it were, to in- crease the latter, he kept snuffing away at a preposterous rate; and   GOOD STORIES.   THE METEMPSYCHOSIS.   when he addressed me, his 'mouth was drawn up into a most com- placent smile, and his long nose and chin, which threatened each other like nut-crackers, thrown forward to within a foot of my face. However, in the next five minutes he improved upon me, from some very judicious observations, as I thought, which he made; and in five more I became convinced that, notwithstanding Iis out- ward frivolity and sneezing, he was far from being an ordinary man. This impression gained such strength, that in a short time I entirely forgot all my previous irritation, and even the reasons which brought me there. I found that he had a complete knowl- edge of the different philosophiical systems of the day; among oth- ers, that of my favorite Kant - and on the merits of the school in the North of Germany, founded by this great metaphysician, his opinions and mine tallied to a point. He also seemed deeply con- versant with the mathematics. This was a subject on which I flat- tered myself I had few equals; but he shot far ahead of me, dis- playing a knowledge which scardely any man in Europe could have matched. He traced the science downwards. in all its historical bearings, from Thales, Archimedes, and Euclid, to Newton, Euler, Leibnitz, and Laplace. In algebra, geometry, and astronomy his information was equally extensive. From several hints which he threw out, I learned that he was no stranger to the science of geo- mancy; and he gave me to understand that he had cast the nativi- ties of several individuals belonging to noble families; and that as their horoscopes portended, such invariably was their fate in after life. Nor was his knowledge confined to these abstruser branches of science; it embraced the whole circle of literature and the fine arts. Poetry, criticism, philology, painting, and sculpture seemed to be equally within his range. He descanted upon them, illumi- nating his positions from such a vast source of illustration, that I gazed upon him with a feeling akin to amazement. Let it not be supposed that all this was done with the formal pomp of a philosopher; on the contrary, he preserved throughout his frivolousness of manner, apologized for everything he advanced, hoped I was not offended if he differed in opinion from me, and concluded every position with a sneeze.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6536-00000006"/>   "By the by," said I, "talking of Gall and Spurzheim, what do you think of their doctrine? I am inclined to believe there must be some truth in it; at least, I have seen it verified in a number of heads, and among others in that of Cicero, which I saw a few years ago in the sculpture-gallery of the Louvre. It was a beautiful head." "You are right there, my dear friend," cried he. "The head, phrenologically considered, is extremely beautiful. I believe I have got it in my pocket." (A sneeze.) "You got the head of Cicero in your pocket!" cried I, with surprise. "O no! not absolutely the head of Cicero," said he, smiling. "Mark Antony disposed of that, -but only his bust,- the bust that you saw." "You mean a miniature of that bust? '" "No, - not a miniature, but the real bust. Here it comes, - how heavy it is!"And, to my amazement, I saw him take out of his pocket the identical bust, as large as life, of the Roman orator, and place it on the table before me. "Have you any more heads of this description about you?" said I, not a little marvelling how he was able to stuff such a block of marble into his pocket. "I have a few others at your service, my dear friend. Name any one you would wish to see, and I shall be most happy to pro- duce it." "Let me see, then, the head of Copernicus." I had scarcely spoken the word when he brought out the philosopher, and put him beside Cicero. I named successively Socrates, Thales, Galileo, Confucius, Zoroaster, Tycho Brahe, Roger Bacon, and Paracelsus, and straightway they stood upon the table as fresh as if they had just received the last touch of the sculptor's chisel. I must confess that such a number of large heads emanating from the pockets of the little meagre man in the snuff-colored surtout and scarlet waist- coat, would have occasioned me incredible wonder, had my stock of astonishment not been exhausted by the previous display of his   abilities. I had little more to throw away upon any new subject, and looked upon these fiesh exhibitions without experiencing any- thing beyond a slight surprise. "And do you," I demanded, as the last named was brought forth, "always carry those heads about with you?" "I generally do so for the amusement of my friends," answered he. "But do not think that my stock is exhausted; I have still a few more that I can show you, - for instance, Pythagoras." "Pythagoras!" exclaimed I; " no, don't produce him. He is the last of all the philosophers I would wish to see. The Stoics, the Epicureans, ay, even the Cynics, with Diogenes or Menippus at their head, were sages compared with Pythagoras, the founder of the most preposterous system of philosophy that ever existed." "My dear friend," said the little man, with unusual gravity, " you do not say so?" "I do say so. Pythagoras was a fool, a madman, an impostor." "You don't speak thus of the divine Pythagoras?" returned he, putting his bust upon the table. "No, not of the divine Pythagoras, for such a person never ex- isted. I speak of Pythagoras the Samrnian, --him of the golden thigh, the founder of what is called the Pythagorean philos- ophy." "And the most rational system of philosophy that ever existed. Begging your pardon, I think it goes far beyond that of Plato or the Stag'yrite." "If you mean that it goes beyond them in being as full of absurd- ity as they are of wisdom, I really agree with you," said I, my anger rising at hearing the divine doctrines of Aristotle and the disciple of Socrates so irreverently spoken of. "Pray, what were its absurdities?" asked he, with the most im- perturbable good-nature. "Did not Pythagoras enjoin silence to his disciples for a period of five years, - absolute silence, muteness, dumbness?" "And a very good injunction it was. No man can be a philoso- pher unless he knows how to keep his tongue under a restraint."   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6536-00000007"/> 12          GOOD STORIES.  ' I am afraid, then, you will never be one," I remarked, forcing a smile, although I was at bottom considerably nettled. He did not  seem to take my observation in, but passed it off with one of his characteristic giggles of laughter. "You were talking of his absurdities, my dear friend." "Ah, well, did he not forbid the use of animal food to his follow-  ers? and, to crown all, did he not teach the monstrous doctrine of transmigration of souls, - sending the spirits of men, after death, to  inhabit the bodies of dogs, and cats, and frogs, and geese, and even  insects?"  "And call you this a monstrous doctrine?" "Monstrous!"I exclaimed with surprise,-" it is the ne plus ultra, the climax of fatuity, the raving of a disordered imagina- tion." "So you do not believe in Metempsvchosis?" asked he wi  a smile,  "I would as soon believe in demonology, or magric. There is  nothing I would not rather credit. Kenelm Dighy's sympathetic  powder, the philosopher's stone, the elixir vitae, animal magnetism,  metallic tractors, judicial astrology, -anything, in fact, would more readily find a place in my belief than this nonsensical jargon, which is credited by nobody but the superstitious Brahmins of India. But perhaps you are a believer?" He shrugged up his shoulders at this last remark, stroked his chin, and giving me a sarcastic look, said, with a familiar nod and smile, "Yes; I am a believer." "What!" said I," you, - you with your immense learning, can you put faith in such doctrines?" If I put faith in them,' said he, " it is my learning which has taught me to do so. If I were less learned, I might perhaps spurn at them as erroneous. Doubt is as often the offspring of ignorance as of credulity. Your great doubters are generally as ill informed as your great believers, and much more self-conceited." "And do you really go all the lengths of Pythagoras?"I de- manded. "I not only go all his lengths, but I go much further. For in-    THE METEMPSYCHOSIS.          13  stance, he believed that the soul never left the body until the latter was dead. Now, my belief is, that two living bodies may exchange souls with each other. For instance, your soul may take possession of my body, and my soul of yours, and bothour bodies may be alive." "In that case," said I, laughing heartily, "' you would be me, and I would be you." "Precisely so, my dear friend," replied the little gentleman, laughing in his turn, and concluding with a sneeze. "Faith, my good sir," my reverence for his abilities somewhat lessened by this declaration, "I am afraid you have lost your senses." "I am afraid you have lost something of more importance," returned he, with a smile, in which I thought I recognized a tinge of derision. I did not like it, so, eying him with some sternness, I id hastily, "And pray, what have I lost? ' Instead of answering , he burst into a loud fit of laughter, holding his sides while the ears ran down his cheeks, and he seemed half stifled with a flood of irresistible merriment. My passion at this rose to such a pitch, that had he been a man of any appearance I should have knocked him down; but I could not think of resorting to such an extremity with a meagre, little elderly fellow, who had, moreover, a wooden leg. I could, therefore, only wait till his mirth subsided, when I demanded, with as much calmness as I could assume, what I had lost. "Are you sure you have not lost your body?" said he. "M y body!" answered I with some surprise; " what do you mean?" "Now, my dear friend, tell me plainly, are you sure that this is our own body?" "My own body, - who the devil's can it be?" "Are you sure you are yourself?" self, - who, in heaven's name, could I be but myself? a "Ay, that is the rub," continued he; " are you perfectly satisfied that you are yourself, and nobody but yourself?"I could not help smiling at the apparent stupidity of this question; but before I was able to compose myself, he had resumed his query. - 'Are you sure you are - that you are - "<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6536-00000008"/> 1U          GOOD STORIES. "That I am who?" said I, hurriedly. "That you are Frederick Stadt?" c Perfectly." "And not Albert Wolstang?" concluded he. A pang shot through my whole body at this last part of his question. I recalled in an instant all my previous vexation. I remembered the insults I had met with, not only from the students of Gottingen and Doctor Dedimus Dunderhead, but from the do- mestics of Wolstang; and lastly, I recollected the business which- had brought me to the house of the latter. Everything came as a flash of lightning through my brain, and I was more perplexed than ever. My first impression was that the little man, in spite of his vast learning, was insane, or perhaps, as Festus said of Paul, his madness was the consequence of too much learning; but then, if he- was insane, the Gottingen students must be insane, Doctor Dedimus Dunderhead must be insane, and Wolstang's domestics must be in- sane. "I am perhaps insane myself," thought I for an instant; but this idea, I was soon satisfied, was incorrect. I sat for several min- utes pondering deeply upon the matter, and endeavoring to extricate myself from this vexatious dilemma, while my companion opposite kept eying me through hiN immense glasses, stroking his chin, and  smiling with the most lugubrious self-complacency. At length, arousing myself from my stupor, I put the following question to hi m - "Did you ask me if I was sure that I am not Wolstang?" "I did, sir," answered he with a bow. "Then, sir, I must tell you that I am not that person, but Fred-. erick Stadt, student of philosophy in the University of Gottingen." He looked incredulous. "What, sir," said I, " do you not believe me?" He shrugged up his shoulders. "Confusion, sir! this is not to be borne. I tell you, sir, that my name is Stadt." This I said in my loudest and most impassioned manner, but it did not affect him in the least degree. He continued his eternal smile, and had even the politeness or audacity (I know not which to call it) to offer me his snuff-box. I was so enraged-at   THE ME TEMPSYCHOSIS.          15       this piece of coolness, that I gave the box a knock, spilling its con- tents upon his scarlet waistcoat. Even this did not ruffle him. He commenced, in the most composed manner imaginable, to collect the particles, remarking with a smile, a You do not like snuff, sir," and finishing, according to custom, by one of-his everlasting sneezes. ".It is impossible, sir," said I, " that you can mistake me for Wolstang, -seeing that, on my entry, you told me you expected that gentleman in a short time, and desired me to be seated till he came in." At this he seemed a little disconcerted, and was begin- ning to mutter something in explanation, when I interrupted him. Besides, sir, Wolstanc, is a man at least six inches taller, four stones heavier, and ten years older than I." What an immense fellow he must be, my dear friend! At that rate, he ought to stand six feet eight inches, and weigh twenty stones." I could hardly retain my gravity at this calculation. ' Pray, what do you take my stature and weight to be?" "I should take you," replied he, " to be about six feet two inches high, and to weigh some sixteen stones." This admeasurement raised my merriment to its acme, and I laughed aloud. "Know, then, my good little man, that all your geometry -has availed you nothing, for I only stand five feet eight, and never weighed more than twelve stones." He shrugged up his shoulders once more, and put on another of his incredulous looks. "Ehl, eh, -I may be mistaken, - but I -I -" "Mistaken!" exclaimed I; $' zounds, you were never more egregiously mistaken, even when you advocated the Pythagorean doctrine of Metempsychosis!" "I may be wrong, but I could lay five gilders that I am right. I never bet high, -just a trifle, just a trifle occasionally." "You had better keep your gilders in your pocket," said 1, c and not risk them so foolishly." "With your permission, however, I shall back my pieces against yours," - and he drew five from a little green silk purse, and put them on the table. I deposited an equal number.&#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6536-00000009"/> 16          GOOD STORIES. "Now," said I, " how is this dispute to be settled? where can I get myself weighed?" "I believe," answered he, " there is a pair of scales in the room hard by, and weights too, if I mistake not." He accordingly got up and opened the door of theadjoining chamber, where, to my surprise, I beheld a pair of immense scales hanging from the roof, and hun- dred and half-hundred weights, &amp;c., lying around. I seated myself in  one of the scales, chuckling very heartily at the scrape into which the little fellow had brought himself. He lifted up weight after weight, placing them upon the opposite scale. - Eleven stones had been put in, and he wax lifting the twelfth; -"Now," says I, / eying him waggishly, "for your five gilders." He dropped the weight, but the beam never moved, and I still sat on the lowest scale. Thirteen were put on, but my weight yet triumphed. With amazement I saw fourteen and fifteen successively added to the number, without effect. At last, on putting down the sixteenth, 'the scale on which I sat was gently raised from the ground. I turned my eyes upwards towards the needle, which I saw quivering as if uncertain where to stop; at last it paused exactly in the centre, and stood erect: the beam lay perfectly horizontal, and I sat motionless, poised in middle air. C You will observe, sir, that my calculation was correct,' observed my companion, taking a fresh pinch of snuff. c You are just sixteen stones. Nothing now remains but to measure your height." "There is no occasion for that," I replied, rising slowly from the scale. "If you can contrive to make me weigh sixteen stones, you can readily make me measure six feet two inches." I now threw myself down on a seat in the study, which both of us had re-entered, placed my elbows on the table, and buried my face in my hands, absorbed in deep reflection. I thought and thought again upon every event which had befallen me since the morning. The students of Gottinen,- Doctor Dedimus Dunderhead,-the domestics of Wolstang, -the little man with the snuff-colored surtout, scarlet waistcoat, and wooden leg, passed like a whirlwind through my brain. Then the bust of Cicero, which I had seen in the Louvre,   THE METE3PSYCHOSIS.           17 the busts of the others which he drew from his pockets, - geometry, - geomancy, - transmigration of souls, and the affair of the scales, - the whole formed a combination which I found myself utterly unable to comprehend. In a few minutes I looked up, exhausted with vain thought. All the heads were gone, except that of Pythagoras, whchl he left lying in its place. - He now took up his snuff-box and deposited it in his waistcoat pocket, - drew an old-fashioned watch out of his fob, and looked at the hour, - and, lastly, laying his hand upon the ten gilders, he dropped them one by one into his green purse. 'I believe, said he, with a smile, "the money is mine." So saying, he snatched up his little cocked-hat, made me half a dozen of bows, and bade me adieu, after promising to see me at the same time and place two days after. CHA PTER     II. AGAIN did I bury my face in my hands; again did my fit of meditation come on; I felt my bosom glowing with perplex- ity. It was now the scales which occupied my thoullats, to the exclusion of everything else. "Sixteen stones! -impossible, I cannot believe it. This old rascal has cheated mne. The weights he has put on must be defective, - they must be hollow. I will see to it in a moment, and if there has been any deception, I shall break his bones the first time I set my eyes upon him, maugre his wooden leg , I will at least smash his spectacles, trip up his heels, and pull lis hook nose." Full of these resolutions, I proceeded- to the adjoining room. Guess of my amazement, when, instead of the great machines in which I had been weighe. but ten minutes before, I beheld nothing but a small pairl of ipothecary's scales, and a few dlrachm, scruple, and grain weilghts scattered upon the floor. Not knowing what to make of tl0 *, T returned into the study, when, happening to look into a mirror placed behind the chair" o1 which I had been sitting, I beheld (joyous sight) the reflection of No. 2.     2  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6536-00000010"/> 18          GOOD STORIES. Wolstang. "Ah, you have come?" said I, turning round to receive him, but nobody was to be seen. I looked again through every part of the room ; no Wolstang .was there. This was passing strange; where could the man have gone in such a hurry? I was now in a greater funk than ever, when, casting my eyes a second time upon the mirror, he again made his appearance. I instantly looked round,- no one was present; in another instant I turned to the glass, and there stood the reflection as before. Not knowing what this phenomenon could be, and thinking perhaps that my eyes were dazzled by some phantom, I raised my hands, and rubbed them; Wolstang did the same. I struck my forehead, bit my lip with vexation, and started back, when, marvellous to relate, the fig- ure in the glass repeated all my gestures. I now got alarmed, and, shrinking away from the apparition, threw myself upon the chair. In a few minutes, my courage beingf somewhat revived, I ventured to face the mirror, but without any better success, the same object presented itself. I desisted, and renewed the trial three several times with the like result. In vain was my philosophy exerted to unfold this mystery. The doctrines of Aristotle, the dreams of alchemy, and the wonders of the Cabala, presented thlemselves in succession to my disordered fancy. I bethought me of magic, nec- romancy, the witch of Endor, Simon Magus, the brazen -head of Friar Bacon, and a multitude of other fantasies. All was in vain  nothing could account for the present occurrence; nothing in mysti- cAl or scientific lore bore any analogy to it. In this perturbed state of mind my eye caught the bust of Pythagoras. This was a flood of light to my understanding. I instantly remembered what the old fellow had hinted about trans- migration of souls: I remembered what he said about me being my- self, or another person. Then connectingt this with the previous events of the day, with the Gottingen students, with Doctor Dedi- mus Dunderhead, with Wolstang's domestics, and, lastly, with the reflection in the looking-glass,-I say, coupling all these things together, I came to the horrible conclusion that I was not myself. ( There must be some truth in the Pythagorean doctrine, and I am laboring under a Metempsychosis." ' u a   THE  METEMPSYCHOSIS.          ]9 To put the matter beyond a doubt, I went once more to the mir- ror, where I beheld the same figure which had first startled me. I then looked at my hands; they were larger and stronger than for- merly. The dress I had on was also not my own, but evidently that of Wolstang. Evelry circumstance contributed to confirm me that I was no longer myself. It would be a vain attempt for me to describe the horror I en- dure? at this dreadful transmogrification. After the first burst of dismay was over, I wept bitterly, bewailing the loss of my dear body, which I now felt convinced was gone from me forever. "And poor Wolstangi" cried I, lamentably, "you are no longer yourself. You are me and I am you, and doubtless you are de- ploring your misfortune as bitterly as your unhappy friend Stadt." Night was nown coming on, and it became necessary that I should resolve upon what ought to be done in my present state. I soon perceived that it would serve no purpose to say that I was myself; no one would have believed me, and I would run the risk of being put in a strait-jacket as a lunatic. To avoid these evils, there was no resource but to pass myself off upon the community as Wolstang. Even here there was considerable risk of being regarded mad; for how could I at once adapt myself to his circumstances, get a knowl- edgre of them, think as he thought, and act as he acted? It was plain, that although I was Wolstang in body, 1 was only Stadt in mind; and I knew that in disposition I was as different as possible from Wolstang. "There is no help," said I, weeping grievously; "it must be done." In order to cool my heated brain, I went out into the open air, and wandered about the streets. I was addressed by a number- of persons whom I did not know; and several of my acquaintances, to whom I inadvertently spoke, did not know me. With the former I was very short, answering their questions at random, and getting off as soon as possible. To the latter I could only apologize, assuring them that they had been mistaken by me for other persons. I felt my situation most unpleasant; for, besides the consciousness of no longer being myself, I was constantly running into the most perplex- O0*A \      .

For instance, after strolling about for a considerable period, I came, as it were, by a sort of instinct, to my own lodgings. For a time I forgot my situation, and knocked at the door. It was opened by my domestic, from whom I took the candle whichl he held in his hand, and, according to wont, 'walked into the study. "Mr. Stadt is not in, sir," said the mnan, following mne; " perhaps you will- sit till he comes: Hexpect him soon." This aroused me from my revery, confirmin too truly the fact that I was changed. I started up from - the seat into which I had dropped, rushed past him with dismay, and gained the street. Here I made up my mind to return to Wolstancr's lodgings, which I accordingly did, in a mood which a condemned criminal would hardly envy. I kept the house for the whole of next day, employing myself in writing, in order that the servants might at least see some cause for my confinement. Notwithstanding this, it was easy to observe that thley perceived something unusual about me; and several remarks which escaped them convinced me that thhey considered my head touched in no slight degree. Although I did all that I was able to jcompose myself, it was impossible that I could think like Wolstanc, and still less that I could know a hundred private and household matter, on which the pert Louise and sapient Barnabas made a point of consulting me. Whenever I was spoken to concerning things that I knew, my answers were kind and condescending; but on any point about which I was ignorant, I utterly lost temper, and per- emptorily forbade them to repeat it. Both shook their heads at such inconsistent behavior; and it was soon bruited among the neighbors that Mr. Albert Wolstang had parted with his senses. - The second day arrived, and found me in the same state of mind. The amazement which succeeded the discovery of my metamorphosis had indeed given way, and I could look at my reflection in the mir- ror with less pain than at first; but my feelings were still as im- bittered as ever, and I ardently longed for death to put an end to such intolerable misery. While brooding over these matters, the door of the study opened. Thinking it was one of the domestics, I paid no attention to it; but in a moment I heard a sneeze, which   THE METEMPSYCHOSIS.           2t made my flesh creep, and in another the little man with the snuff- colored surtout, the scarlet waistcoat, and the wooden leg- made his appearance. Since I last saw this old fellow, I had conceived a mortal hatred against him., I thought, althlough the idea was wild enough, that hle had some hand in my Metempsychosis, - and the affatir of the scales and the marble busts, together with his Pythago- rean opinions, his vast learning, his geomancy and astrology, gave to my idea a strong confirmation. On the present occasion his polite- ness was excessive; ihe bowed almost to the ground, made fifty apolo- gies for intruding, and inquired with the most outre affectation of tenderness into the state of my health. He then seated himself opposite to me, laid his cocked-hat upon the table, took a pinch of snuff, and commenced his intolerable system of sneezing. - I was never less in a humor to relish anything like foppery; so throwing myself back upon the chair, putting on as commanding a look as I could, and looking at him fiercely, I said, t So, sir, you are back again; I suppose you know me?" "KInow you, my dear friend - eh-yes, I derived great pleas- ure in being made acquainted with you the day before yesterday. You are Mr. Frederick Stadt,-that is to say, you are Mr. Albert Wolstang." - (A sneeze.) "Then -you know that I am not myself? ' "My dear fr iend," replied he, with a smile, "I hinted as much the last time I saw you." ' And pray how did you ascertain that?" "You don't ask me such a question," said he, with an air of sur- prise; "I knew it by your own signature." "My own signature! I know not what you mean by my sig- nature." "Eh - ehl-  the signature, you know, - that is, the compact you made with Wolstang." "I know of no compacti" cried I, in a passion ; "nor did I ever make one with any man livin(r. I defy either you or Wolstang to produce any such instrument." I believe it is in my pocket at this moment, Look here, my *  * ^.   &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6536-00000012"/> dear sir." And he brought out a small manuscript book, and, turn- ing up the leaves, pointed to view the following words:- "I hereby, in consideration of the sum of fifty gilders, give to Albert Wolstang the use of my body, at any time he is disposed, provided that, for the time being, he gives me the use of his.- FREDERICK STADT." "It is a damnable forgery," said I, starting up with fury; "a deceptio visus, at least, - something like your scales." "What about the scales, my dear friend?" said he, with a whin- ing voice. "Go," replied I, " into that room, and you shall see." He ac- cordingly went, but returned immediately, saying that he observed nothing remarkable. "No!" said I, rising up ; ' then I shall take the trouble to point it out to you." My astonishment may be better conceived than described, when, instead of the small apothle- cary's scales, I beheld the- immense ones in which I had been weighed two days before. I felt confounded and mortified, and returned with him to the study, muttering something about deceptio visus, necromancy, and demonology. "Well," continued I, after recovering a little, " what about this compact, -when and where WHas it made?" "It was made some three days ago, at the Devil's Hoof Tavern. +    You may remember that you and Wolstang were drinking there at that time." "Yes, I remember it well enough; but I understood that I was putting my name to a receipt for fifty gilders which he paid me. I never read the writing; I merely subscribed it." "That was a pity; for really you have bound yourself as firmly as signing with a person's own blood can do." "Did I sign it with my own blood?" said I, alarmed. 6' Exactly so. You may recollect of cutting your finger. I had the pleasure of stanching the blood, a sufficient quantity-of which was nevertheless collected to write this document." "Then you were present," said I;- "yes, I have a recollection of your face, now that you mention the circumstance. You were then dressed as a clergyman, if I mistake not."   THE- METEMPSYCHOSIS.          23 - Precisely." "And what," continued 1, are the conditions on which I hold this strange existence? Suppose Wolstang dies?" 'Then you keep his body till the natural period of your own death." C Suppose I die?" c' He then keeps your body." "Then, if he dies, my body is buried and goes to decay, while I am clogged up in- his body, till relieved from it by death?a "Precisely." This announcement struck me with terror. s And shall I never," said 1, weeping, " see my dear body again?" "You may see it, if ever Wolstang comes in your way." "But shall I never possess-it, - shall I never be myself again? ' "Not unless he pleases." "The villain" exclaimed I, in an agony of grief; I Iam then undone, -the tool of a heartless, unprincipled miscreant. Is my case hopeless?" "O no, my dear friend," said the little man, " not at all hopeless; there is nothing simpler than the remedy. Only put your name here, and you will be yourself in a minute. The fellow will then lose all power over your body." I seized with avidity the pen which he presented to me, dipped it in a vial of red ink, and was proceeding to do as he directed, when the writing above caught my eye. It ran thus: - "I hereby engage, after my natural decease, to give over my soul to the owner of this book." "Zounds!" said I, A" what is this?" "It is nothng, at all; just a form, -- a mere form of business, of no intrinsic meaning. If you would just write youlr name,- it is very easily done." "Has any other person signed such deeds?" demanded I. "Iany a one.  Here, for example, is Wolstang's name attached to a similar contract. It is, in fact, by virtue of this that he has the power over your body. The deed which you have signed would have availed him nothing without this one."

"if you relieve me from my present condition, you break faith with Wolstang, seeing that you deprive him of his stipulated power. "I deprive him of his power over you, but I give him in return a similar power over some other pel son,which will answer his pur- pose equally well. I think you had better sign." No, you old villain " said I, wrought up to a pitch of fury at the infernal plan which I saw ie was meditating, "I will never sign your damnable compact. I have relise     know the tvalue of my soul, and sufficient philosophy to blar with any wretchedness I may endure under my present form. You may play the Devil if 'o choose, but tnou shall never get me to act the part of Dr. Faus- yo cooebutwhc you    tm  imt  nayn    edr, tus." I pronounced these words in a voice of thunder; but so far from being angry, he used every endeavor to soothe me, - made a thousand apologies for having been the unwilling cause of such a commotion; then, snatching up his hat and making a profound bow, he left the room. CHAPTER III. A GLOW of conscious virtue passed over me on his depart- ure. I found that I had resisted evil, and gloried in the thought; but this triumphant, feeling gave way to one of revenge against the author of my calamity. After reflectingJ for a short time, it oc- curred to me that the best way to punish him would be to commit some outraore-which might stamp him with infamy, and render him miserable if ever eh thougiht. of resuming his body. -"I shall at least have him expelled from the university. This shall be the first blow directed against his comnfort. He will in time become weary of my body, and will find very little satisfaction in his -own when he takes it. into his head to make an exchange." Full of these ideas, I entered the College court, where the first object that met my eyes was Doctor Dedimus Dunderhead coming towards me,-the baton   THE METEnMPSYCHOSIS.         . 25 in his band, the spectacles on his carbuncle nose, and his head thrown back as he strutted along a  la militaire.  Without a mo- mnent's hesitation, I advanced up to him and knocked off his cocked- hat; nor did I stop to see how he looked at this extraordinary salu- tation, but walked deliberately on. I heard him distinctly call after; me," You shall hear of this, sir, by to-morrow." " When you please, Doctor," was my answer. "Now, Master Wolstang," said I to my- self, "I have driven you from Gottingen College, and wish you much joy of your expulsion." Such were my thoughts, and the morrow verified them; for a meeting of the Senatus Academicus being summoned by the Provost, that learned body declared Albert Wolstang unfit to be a member of the university, and he was accordingly placarded upon the gate and expelled, in terrorem. This circumstance being just what I wanted, gave me no uneasi- ness; but a few days thereafter an event arose out of it, which sub- jected me to much inconvenience. Having, unwittingly strolled into the College, I was rudely collared by one of the officers, which so enraged me that I knocked down the fellow with a blow of my fist. For this I was apprehended the same day by three gendarmes, and carried before the Syndic, who condemned me to suffer two weeks' close confinement, and to be fed on bread and water. This punishment, though perhaps not disproportioned to the offence, was, in my estimation, horribly severe: and now, for the first time, did I feel regret for the absurdity of my conduct I found that in en- deavoring to punish Wolstang I was in truth only punishing myself, and that it was a matter of doubt whether he would ever submit to a corporeal change, seeing that my fortune was much more consider- able than his own, and that he would come at it in the course of six months. This I had no doubt was the chief consideration which could have induced the fellow to bring about such a metamor- phlosis. On getting out of prison I was the most miserable wretch on earth. The fierce desire of vengeance had formerly kept up my spirits; but this was now gone, and they sank to the lowest pitch. I found that I was spurned by those very persons who were before :                                &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6536-00000014"/> most anxious to cultivate my friendship. Barnabas and Louise had' punishment of a malefactor. In order to clear up matters, I fre- quently called at my own house to inquire if I myself was at home, -for so was I obliged to speak of the miscreant who had posses- sion ofmy body;,- but on every occasion I was answered in the neg-  ative. "I had gone out to see a friend in town I had gone to the country"; "I was expected soon." Never by any possibili- ty could I get a sight of myself. All this convinced me that the case was hopeless, and that I must make the best of my deplorable situation. Wolstang had evidently played my part much better than I did his, for he had an interest in doing so, and was (thanks to my simpli city) intimately acquainted with the state of my affairs. If anything could add to this irritation, it was to notice the improve- ments, or rather changes, which the fellow was making in ay house. Everything was turned upsidae down. Many of the most valuable books in my library were brought to the hammer, and replaced by more modern works. Some antique MSS. found among the ruins of Pompeii, and on which I set a high value, were disposed of in the same manner; together with my porphyry snuff-box, my mother's diamond ring, my illuminated missal, and rabic autograph of the Koran. The money produced by these valuable relics was laid out in new-painting my studyJ, and in fitting it up with Chinese landarins, silken pagodas, and other pieces of Eastern trumpery. In consequence of the peculiar opportunities which I enjoyed, I soon disconsvered that W stang, whom I had long thought rather soon discovered that W01stan% w       'Some persons of highly of, was in reality a very bad character.

I discovered that he had two mistresses in keeping; that he, had seduced the daughters of several of the most respectable citizens, and was the father of no less than seven natural children, whom he had by those unfortunate   THE METEMPSYCHOSIS.           27 women. I found out even worse than this,-at least what Hdreaded much more. This was a forgery to an immense amount, which he, in concert with another person, had committed on an extensive mer- cantile house. The accomplice, in a high state of trepidation, came to tell me that the whole was in a fair way of being blown, and that if we wished to save our necks, an instantaneous departure from the city was indispensable. Such a piece of intelligence threw me into great alarm. If I remained, my apprehension would be inevitable; and how would it be possible for me to persuade any one that I was not Wolstang?  My conviction and execution must follow; and though I was now so regardless of life that I would gladly have been in my grave, yet there was something revolting in the idea of dying for a villain, merely because I could not show that I Was not myself. These reflections had their due weight, and I resolved to leave Gottingen next day, and escape from the country altogether. While meditating upon this scheme, I walked about three miles out of town for the purpose of maturing my plans, undisturbed by the noise and bustle of the streets. As I wasegoing slowly along, I perceived a man walking about a furlong before me. His gait and dress arrested my attention particularly, and after a few glances I was convinced that he must be myself. The joy that pervaded my mind at this sight no language can describe; it was as a glimpse of heaven, and filled me with perfect ecstasy. Prudence, however, did not forsake me, and I resolved to steal slowly upon him, collar him, and demand an explanation. With this view I approached him, concealing myself as well as I could, and was so successful that I had actually got within ten yards of my prey without being discov- ered. At this instant, hearing footsteps, he turned round, looked alarmed, and took to his heels. I was after him in a moment, and the flight on one side, and pursuit on the other, were keenly-con- tested. Thanks to Wolstang's long legs, they were better than the short ones with which my antagonist was furnished, and I caught him by the collar as he was about to enter a wood. I grasped my body with Herculean grip, so terrified was I to lose it. "And now, you villain," said 1, as soon as I could recover breath, "tell  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6536-00000015"/> 28          GOOD STORIES. me the meaning of this. Restore me my body, or by heaven I will '- "You will do what?" asked he, with the most insolent coolness. This question was a dagger to mny soul, for I knew that any pun- ishment I inflicted upon him must be inflicted upon myself. I stood mute for a few seconds, still holding him strongly in my grasp. At last throwing pity aside, by one vast effort I cried out, ' I de- clare solemnly, Wolstang, that if you do not give ie back my body I shall kill you on the spot." "Kill me on the spot!" replied he. Do you mean to say that you will kill your own body?" "I do say so," was my answer. "I will rather destroy my dear body, than it should be disgraced by a scoundrel like you." 'You are jesting," said Wolstang, endeavoring to extricate himself. "I shall show you the contrary," rejoined I, giving him a violent blow on the nose and another on the ribs. 'rThese strokes almost drew tears from my eyes; and when I saw my precious blood flow- ing, I certainly would have wept aloud, but for the terrible energy which rage had given me. The punislhment had its evident effect, however, upon Wolstang, for he became cagitated and alarmed, grew pale, and entreated me to let him go. "Never, you villain, till you return me back my body. Let me be myself again, and then you are free." "That is impossible," said he, "and cannot be done without the agency of another person, who is absent; but I hereby solemnly swear, that five days after my death your body slall be your own." "If better terms cannot be had, I must take even these, but- better I shall have; so prepare to part with what is not your own. Take yourself back again, or I will beat you to mummy." So saying, I laid on him most unmercifully, - flattened his nose (or rather my own), and laid him sprawling on the earth without ceremony. While engaged in this business, I heard a sneeze, and looking to the quarter from which it proceeded, whom did I see emerging from the wood, but my old acquaintance with the snuff-colored surtout, the'   THE- ME7TEIMPSYCHOSIS.         2 29, scarlet waistcoat, and wooden leg. He saluted me as usual with a smile, and was beginning to regret the length of time whichhad elapsed since he last had the pleasure of seeing me, when I inter- rupted him. "Come," said I, "this is not a time for ridiculou grimace; you know all about it, so help me to get my body back from this scoundrel here."  "Certainly, my dear friend. Heaven forbid that you should be robbed of so unalienable a property. Wolstangc you must give it up. 'T is the hei^t of injustice to deprive him of it." "Sall I surrender it, then?" said Wolstang, with a pitiable voice. ' By all means: let Mr. Stadt have his body." In an instant I felt great pains shoot through me, and I lay on the gloudcl, breathless and exhausted as if from  some dreadful pun. isniment. 1,I lso saw the little gentleman, and the tall stout figure of Wolstang, walk away arm in arm, and enter the wood. I was now myself aain, but had  at first little cause of congratulation on the elhane, for I was one heap of bruises, while the unprincipled author of my calamities was moving off in his own body without a sinoge scratch. If my frame was in a bad case, however, my mind felt relies ed beyond conception. A load was taken from it, and it felt the consciousness of being encased in that earthly tenement des- tined by Heaven for its habitation. CHAPTER     IV. ALAS, how transient is human happiness  Scarcely bad an hour elapsed when a  shudder came over me, precisely similar to that which occurred some weeks before on entering the College of   Gottingen . I also perceived that I was stronger, taller, and niore vigorous, and, as if by magic, totally free of pain. At this changce a  horri sentiment came across me, and, on looking at my shadow in a well, I observed that I was no longer myself, but Wol-  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6536-00000016"/> tan, ; the diabolical miscreant had again effected a metempsychosis. Full of distracting t ideas, I wandered about the fields till nightfall, when I returned into the city, and threw myself into bed, overpow- er-ed with fatigue and grief. Next day I made a point of calling at my own house, and inquir- ing for myself. The servant said that I could not be seen, bein confined to bed in consequence of several bruises received in an en- counter with two highwaymen. I called next day, and was still confined. On the third I did the same, but I had gone out with a friend. On the fourth I learned that I was dead. It will readily be believed that this last intelligence was far from being unwelcome. On bearinl of my own dealth I felt the most lively pleasure, anticipating the period when I would be myselt aain. That period, according to Wolstan,'g solemn vow, would arrive in five days. Three of these I had spent in the house, care- fully secluding myself from observation, when I heard a sneeze at the outside of the door. It opened, and in stepped the little man with the snuff-colored surtout, the scarlet waistcoat, and the wooden leg. I had conceived a dislike approaclhingll  to horror at this old rascal, whom I naturally concluded to be at the bottom of these diabolical transformations; I, however, contained my wrath till I should hear what he had to say. "I wish you much joy, my dear friend, that you are going to re- sume your own body. There is, however, one circumstance, which perhaps you have overlooked. Are you aware that you are to be buried to-day? A "I never thought of it," answered I calmly, "nor is it of any consequence, I presume. In two days I shall be myself aoain. I shall then leave this body behind me, and take possession of my own." t And where will your own body be then?" "In the grave," said I, with a shudder, as the thought came across Ine. "Precisely so, and you will enjoy the pleasure of being buried alive; that, I suppose, you have not calculated upon." i ..   This remark struck me with blank dismay, and I fel$back on my chair, uttering a deep groan. "Is there their no hope? cannot this dreadful doom be averted? must I be buried alive?" "The case is rather a hard one, MSr. Stadt, but perhaps not with- out a remedy." " Yes, there is a remedy," cried I, starting up and striking my forehead. '-I shall hie me to my own house, and entreat them to suspend the funeral for two days." "I saw the undertaker's men enter the house, as I passed by, for the purpose, I should think, of screwing down the coffin-lid. The company also, I find, are beginning to collect, so that there is little hope of your succeeding. However," continued he, taking a pinch of snuff, " you may try, and if you fail, I have a scheme in view which will perhaps suit your purpose. I shall await your return." In a moment my hat was on my head, in anotherl I was out of the room, and in a third at my own house. What he had stated was substantially true. Some of the mourners had arrived, and the undertaker's men were waiting below, till they should be summoned up stairs to screw down the lid. Without an instant of delay I rushed to the chamber where my dear bodly was lying in its shell. Some of my friends were there, and I entreated them, in imploring accents, to stop for two days, and they would see that the corpse which lay before them would revive. " am not dead," cried I, forgetting myself, 'L I assure you I am not dead." a Poor fellow! he has lost his senses," said one. "Ahl, poor Wolstan," observed another, R he ran deranged some weeks ago, and has been going about asking for himself ever since." "I assure you I am not dead,"-said I, throwin, myself upon my knees before my cousin, who was present. "I know that, my good fellow," was his answer, " but poor Stadt, you see, is gone forever." "That is not Stadt - it is H it is I - will you not believe me! I am Stadt-this is not me-I am not myself. For heaven's sake suspend this funeral." Such were my exclamations, but they produced no other effect but that of pity among the bystanders.   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6536-00000017"/> 32          GOOD STORIES. "Poor unfortunate fellow, he is crazed. Get a porter, and let him be taken home." This order, which was given by my cousin himself,/stung me to madness, and, changing my piteous tones for those of fierce resist- ance, I swore that "I would not turn out for any man living. I would not be buried alive to please them." To this nobody made any reply, but in the course of a minute four stout porters made their appearance, and I was forced from the house. Returning to Wolstang's lodgings, the old man was there in wait- ing, as he promised. "What," said I with trepidation,-" what is the scheme you were to propose? Tell me, and avert the horrible doom which will await me, for they have refused to suspend the funeral." "My dear friend," said he in the most soothing manner, " your case is far from being so bad as you apprehend. You have just to write your name in this book, and you will be yourself again in an instant. Instead of coming alive in the grave you will be alive before the coffin-lid is put on. Only think of the difference of the two situations." "A confounded dieffernce indeed," thoughlt I, taking hold of the pen. But at the very moment when I was going to write, I ob- served above the following words:-  "I hereby engage, after my natural decease, to give over my soul to the owner of this book." "What!" said I, " this is the old compact; the one you wished me to sign before?" "The same, my dear friend." "Then I 'll be d-d if I sian it." "Only think of the consequences," said he. "I will abide the consequences rather than sell my soul." "Buried alive, my dear sir, -only think." ' I will not sign the compact."

Is not the idea dreadful? Only think what your feelings  will be when you come to life in that narrow charnel-house, and know your situation."  I gave a shudder at this picture, which was drawn with horrible truth.; but the energies of religion, and the hopes of futurity, rushed upon my soul, and sustained it in the dreadful trial. 'Away, away," said I, pushing hin back. "I have made up ny mind to the sacrifice, since better may not be. Whatever happens to my body, I aln resolved not to risk my eternal soul for its sake." "Think again," said he, " and makle up your mind. If I leave you, your fate is irrevocable. Are you decided'?" "I am." "Only reflect once more.

The greater part of that day was spent in religious exercises,-from which I felt considerable relief.

It came, and I endeavored by every means to subdue the terror which it brought along with it. On arising from bed, I sent for my servant, an elderly woman whom I had got to supply the place of Barnabas and Louise, and gave her one hun- dred gilders, being all the money I could find in Wolstang's bureau. "Now, Philippa," said I, "' as soon as the clock of the study has struck three, come in, and you will find me dead. Retire, and do not enter till then." She went away, promising to do all that I had ordered her. During the interval I sat opposite the clock, marking the hours pass rapidly by. Every tick was a death-knell to my ear,-every movement of the hands, as the motion of a scymitar levelled to cut me in pieces. I heard all, and I saw all in horrid silence. Two o'clock at length struck. "Now," said l, " there is but one hour for me on earth, - then the dreadful struggle begins, - then I must live again in the tomb only to perish miserably." Half an hour passed, then forty minutes, then fifty, then fifty-five.. I saw with utter de- spair the minute-hand go by the latter, and approach the meridian number of the dial. As it swept on, a stupor fell over my spirit, a mist swam before my eyes, and I almost lost the power of con- sciousness. At last I heard one strike aloud, - my flesh creeped with dread; then two,-I gave an universal shudder; then three, -and I gasped convulsively, and saw and heard nothing further. - - - V ,            ^ -^.  CHAPTER    V. AT this moment I was sensible of an insufferable coldness. My  heart fluttered, then it beat strong, and the blood, passing as it were  over my chilled firame, gave it warmth and animation. I also began by slow degrees to breathe. But though my bodily feelings  were thus torpid, my mental ones were very different. They were  on the rack; for I knew that I was now buried alive, and that the  dreadful struggle was about to commence. Instead of rejoicing as 8-   THE METErMPSYCHOSIS.          35 O0 I recovered the genial glow of life, I felt appalled with blank dei spair. I was terrified to move, because I knllew I would feel the horrid walls of my narrowprison-house. I was terrified to breathe, because the pent air within it would be exhausted, and the suffoca- tion of struggling humanity would seize upon me. I was even terrified to open my eyes, and gaze upon the eternal dkness by which I was surrounded. Could I resist? the idea was madness. What would my strength avail against the closed coffin, and the pressure above, below, and on every side?"No, I must abide the struggle, which a few seconds more will brine on: I must perish  deplorably il it. Then the Epicurean worm will feast upon my re. mains, and I shall no longer hear any sound, or see any sight, till the last trumpet shall awaken me from slumber, and gather m-e ton vether from the jaws of the tomb." Meanwhile I felt the necessity of breathing and I did breathe  fully; and the air vas neither so close nor scanty as might have ,een spposed. "o Thcsn:e:           asY ^ mgt h7     I een supposed. This, however," thoufht 1, "is but the first of ny respirations:  a few mole, and the vital air will be exhausted:. hen will the aronry of death truly commence." I nevertheless reathed again, and aaain, and again; but nothing like stifling eized upon me, - nothigD of the kind, even when I bad made fift ood respirations.  On the contrary, I respired with the most per-  at freedomn.  This struck me as very singular; and being naturally  r an inquisitive disposition, I felt an -irresistible wisl, even in my readful situation, to investigate if possible the eause of it.

I even raised my hands on high, to feel if it were possi- ble to reach the top: no such thing; the coffin was apparently with- out bounds. Altogether, I felt more comfortable than a buried man could expect to be. One thingD struck me, and it was this,-- I had no grave-clothes upon me. "But," thought I, " this is easily accounted for: my cousin comes to my property, and the scoundrel has adopted the most economical means of getting rid of me." I had not as yet opened my eyes, being daunted at the idea of en- countering the dreary darkness of the grave. But my courage being somewhat augmented by the foregoing events, I endeavored to open them. This was impossible; and on examination, I found that they were bandaged, my head being encircled with a fillet. On endeavoring to loosen it, I lost my balance, and tumbled down with a hideous noise. I did not merely fall upon the bottom of the coffin, as might be expected; on the contrary, I seemed to roll off it, and fell lower, as it were, into some vault underneath. In en- deavoring to arrest this strange descent I caught hold of the coffin, and pulled it on the top of me. Nor was-this all ; for, before I could account for such a train of extraordinary accidents below ground, and while yet stupefied and bewildered, I heard a door open, and in an instant after, human voices. "What, in heaven's name, can be the meaning of this?" ejaculated I, involuntarily. "Is it a dream? - am I asleep, or am I awake? Am I dead or alive?" While meditating thus, and struggling to extricate myself from the coffin, I heard some one say distinctly, "Good God, he is come alive " My brain was distracted by a whirlwind of vain -conjectures; but before it could arrange one idea, I felt myself seized upon by both arms, and raised up with irresistible force. At the same instant the fillet was drawn from my eyes. I opened them with amaze- ment instead of the gloom of death, the glorious light of heaven burst upon them! I was confounded; and, to add to my surprise,  I saw supporting me two men, with whose faces I was familiar. I , gazed at the one, then at the other, with looks of fixed astonishment.   *1   THE ME TEMPSYCHOSIS.

But I would not allow him to depart till he had uncavelled the strange web of perplexity in which I still found myself involved. Nothing would satisfy me but a philosophical solution of the problem, "Why was I not buried alive as I had reason to expect?" The doctor expounded this intricate point in the following manner: - "The day before yesterday," said he, "I informed the resurrec- tionists in the service of the University, that I was in want of a subject, desiring them at the same time to set to work with all speed. That very night they returned, assuringeme that they had fished up one which would answer to a hair, being both young and vigorous.  - In order to inform myself of the- quality of what they brouglht mne,  I examined the body, when, to my indignation and grief, I found  that they had disinterred my excellent friend Mr. Frederick Stadt,  who had been buried the same day." "What!" said I, starting up from the bed, "did they disinter me? - the scoundrels " "You may well call them scoundrels," said the professor, '"for preventing a gentleman from enjoyina the pleasure of being buried alive. The deed was certainly most felonious; and if you are at  all anxious, I shall have them reported to the Syndic, and tried for  their impertinent interference. But to proceed. No sooner did I observe that they had fallen upon you than I said, My good men,  this will never do. You have brouaht me here my worthy friend -  Mr. Stadt. I cannot feel in my heart to anatomize him, so just   carry him quietly back to his old quarters, and I shall pay you his -H price, and something over and above."  ; What!" said I, again interrupting the doctor," is it possible you  could be so inhuman as to make the scoundrels bury me again?"  ' Now, Stadt," rejoined he with a smile, " you are a strange fellow.  You were angry at the men for raising you, and now you are angry -X at me for endeavoring to repair their error by reinterring you." "But youll forget that I was to come alive?" "How the deuce was I to know that, my dear boy?"  "Very true. Go on, doctor, and excuse me for interrupting you  so Ooften."   1 ^vi lM b iVE SYCHOSIS. 39 "Well, continued he, the men carried you last night to deposit you in your long home, when, as fate would have it, they were pre- vented by a ridiculous fellow of a tailor, who, for a trifling wager, had engaged to sit up alone, during the whole night, in the church- yard, exactly at the spot where your grave lay. So they brought you back to the, college           So they brought ,. I  vin to inter you to-night, if the tailor or tie Devil himself, should stand in their way. Your timely re- suscitation will save them this trouble. At the salne- time, if you are still offended at them, they will be very happy to take you back, and you mafyyet enjoy the felicity of being buried alive." Such was a simple statement of the fact, delivered in the profes- sor's good-humored and satirical style; and firom it the reader may guess what a narrow escape I had from the most dreadful of deaths and how much I am indebted, in the first instance, to the stupid blun- deriot', of the resurrectionists, and, in the second, to the tailor. I re- turned to my own house as soon as possible, to the no small mortifi- cation of my cousin, who was proceeding to invest himself with all that belonged to me. I made him refund without ceremony, and al- tered my will, which had been made in his favor; not forgetting in so doing, his refusal to let my body remain two days longer unburied. day or two afterwards I saw a  funeral pass by, which, on inquiry learned tobe Wolstana's.  He died suddenly, as I was informed and some apersons remarked it as a  curious event that his death happened   at preciseely  tie ame nmoment as my return to life. This was merely mentioned   as a passing observation, but no inference was deduced from it. T le old domestic in Wolstang's house gave a wonderful  acqount of biis death, mentioning the hour at which he said he was to die, and how it was verified by the event. She said nothing bowever, about the hundred gilders. Many considered her story  as a piece of mere trumpery.  She had  nevertheless a number of believers.

Of course, I concealed everything connected with the Me- tempsychosis, and kept out many circumstances which at the time I did not wish to be known. He was nevertheless highly delighted, and gave it as his opinion (which/ being, oracular, was instantly acted upon), that a description of the whole should be inserted in the Annals of the University. I had the further honor of being invited to dinner at his house,- an honor which I duly appreciated, knowing that it is almost never conferred except on the syndics, burgomasters, and deacons of the town, and a flew of the pro- fessors. These events, which are here related at full, I can only attest by my own word, except indeed the affair of the coming alive, which everybody in Gottingen knows of. If any doubt the more unlikely parts of the detail, I cannot help it. I have not written this with the view of empty fame, and still less of profits Philosophy has taught me to despise the former, and my income renders the latter an object of no importance.

Above all,- they should carefully abstain from signing any paper he may present to them, however plausible his offers may be. By mere thoughtlessness in this respect, I barougllht myself into a multi- tude of dangers and difficulties, from which every one in the same predicament may not escape so easily as I have done.

But there was neither darkness nor silence in the house of Alynheer Grootschedel, the Burgomaster of Nimeguen.   Servants in diverse liveries hurried hither and thither, in ball, staircase, and corridors, all of which were bright with lights and gay with flowers and foliagre. The sound of music pervaded the entire mansion, whose massive timbers vibrated to the measured tread of scores and scores of dancers.  The scene  dis- played to the curious interlopers of inferior rank, who  ere peering inward from the outer doorway of the splendid first-floor suite, was one combining evelry charm of the fairest spectacles of nature,-- all imaginable variety of tenderer tintor richer coloring, of comely form and of gracefully undulating  movement, under light too well diffused to admit of sombre shadows, he  whole instinct with life in that culmination of beauty which owes its short-lived reigrn to joy quickrened by flutterinog ope, and the soft lightning darted between pleasule-sparling  eyes, and setting cheeks aglow. But amid everv landscape there are spots of blight and lesola- tion, none the less real for their not appearing in the general pros- pect. All was not mirth and hope within that festive scene. There was one among the guests who stood moodily apart, -a young man of some five and twenty years more aristocratic in his bearing and the taste of his attire than most of t'ose then present.

By one faniiliar with the Court of Frace, he would  - have been set down, from the effeminate extravaoance of hbs dregs  his scented curls, his affected accent, as one of the number of the ; his scented curls, bisn        ^  ^^ hi   sasi notorious mivns of that miserable  i whom, on his assassin   X tion about a year before, the splendid line of Valois had so inlori-  ously ended. The burgomaster had made this count's aequaintance  only two days before; and, for reasons of his own, bad introduced him to his daughter, bidding him at the same time to the present .   entertainment. Count Ulrich, though a stranger to Nimeguen, had also his reasons for accepting the invitation; and now, much as he might look -down on the assemblage of money-making citizens among whom he found himself, he had evidently made up his mind that the attractive daughter of one whose money was already made was not unworthy of his serious attention.  Hendrick, - whose mind had been crossed more than once by a suspicion that Bertha herself was a party, willing or unwilling, to the game so success- fully carried on before her eyes, - had desisted from his attempts to reach and to address her, and stood, as has been said, apart,in no comfortable or benevolent frame of mind and feeling. Still, to the surreptitious lookers-on, all seemed alike joyous, bright, and enviably gay. But a change came over the smiling aspect of the scene. From the farthest chamber of the suite was heard suddenly a female shriek, followed instantaneously by many others in every variety of voice and intonation. The movements of the dance were arrested, there was a rush of guests towards the inner room, and the music died away in a few agitated chords. Then, after a mo- ment's silence, the voice of the burgomaster was heard, -but barely heard, -for its tones were overborne, absorbed, and silenced by those of another voice, deep as the first utterance of the thun- der-cloud. Mute attention was evidently given to the new speaker's words, and ere these could have been very many, the whole listen- ing crowd of revellers wsere seen to direct suddenly behind them a look of comfortless dismay towards that outer doorway, from whence the servants and their favored friends were watching their proceed- ngs. These hereupon looked also involuntarily round, and discov- ered themselves to be hemmed in by a file of shaggy steel-capped troopers, who, fully armed with sword and arquebus, had silently taken post behind them in the corridor. At the same moment the first articulate sound reached them from the huddling mass of panic- stricken revellers within, by whom was repeated the name of " Mar- tin Schenk!" in every accent of amazement, consternation, and despair,  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6536-00000023"/> Y^L          v  Lm   U1. L-E * Yes," said one of the troopers to a gazing townsman, whom he clapped at the same time cheerfully upon the shoulder, " old Don- nerblitz is in there, by the high dais, with some choice additions to the company. He is not going to interrupt the mirth, but share it. We, too, expect our portion of what good cheer is going." Martin Schenk was one of the most formidable coadjutors of the Prince of Parma,-the relentless governor, consummate general, and accomplished liar, - who was drawing his toils around that portion of the revolted Netherlands which had baffled the craft and had withstood the military power of Parma's uncle, the pale bigot of the Escurial, and so achieved its deliverance from the Spanish rule. Martin, a captain of free companions, had long kept the Bish- oprics of Cologne and Cleves in check by perpetual surprise of towns, and levying of black-mail, under the pleasant appellation of Brandschaditzzng, or price of exemption from being burnt out of house and home. He had recently extended his operations farther to the west; but no one in Nimeguen, except, perhaps, the thought- ful and already experienced Van Oorsveldt, had ever dreamt of his paying their good town a predatory visit. He had entered the mansion by a backway, and, mounting by a  private staircase, had passed from thence to the inner reception- room, to which it adjoined; and all this so quietly, though accom- panied by half a dozen of his officers, that already he himself stood near the middle of the chamber, and the officers within its private doorway, ere this addition to the company had been remarked by any one save the disengaged and observant -Oorsveldt. When, however. a lady (turning, oppressed by heat, from the group that surrounded Bertha) caught sight of the six grisly troopers, and discovered their stern and weather-beaten captain at her elbow, all being drenched and dripping from the waisthelt that bore their pistols and confined their buff-coats downward, she gave utterance to her surprise and terror in the -cry which had startled all within hearing from their festivity. "This hlouse," said Martin, coolly disregarding Grootschedel's loud demand to be informed who they welre who thus intruded   THE UNLINVITITED.          45 unbidden, on a scene of private festivity, and on what pretext they did so,-"this house, with the entire block in which it stands, two houses on the right, three on the left, and six behind, is enclosed by a double line of gentlemen like those you see. I will interrupt your mirth only so long as while you, Herr Burgomaster, countersigrn these modest requisitions," pulling herewith some papers from his pouch. "The firlst set are for meat and drink to be furnished to my companions -nay, sir, you need not stilr," added he, as a gen- tleman moved from near him towards the principal entrance of the room; "look that way, and you will see that there is no passage from this suite"; -and then it was that all within sight of the doorway leading to the corridor looked in that direction, as above described. ' Thile second set, my worthy host, are for one hundred thousand gilders, to be laid down, here where I stand, within three hours' time. Alh! impossible,' you were about to say," as he saw the burgomaster opening his lips to speak. "If it is, that matters little. My boys are very reasonable, and never kick against impossibilities. Where coin is scarce, they will compound cheerfully for gold, or even gems and jewels of sufficient price., Where requisitions fail, they call content themselves with a sack instead, - but always with fire to follow," added he, in words which left no doubt, in the minds of those who healrd, as to who it was with whom they had to do; and then the outer room resounded, as already said, with the dreaded captain's name. "Nay," said he, with a grim smile, when the first shock of sur- prise and terror had subsided, "if it really appears to you that a properly-apportioned requisition might perhaps be attended with success, you have only, Mynheer Burgomaster, to fill in, with the assistance and advice of these worthy townsmen whom I have the pleasure of now meeting under your hospitable roof, this schedule, viz. in this column, with ten to twenty good and substantial names, and in this with the proportions of the proposed contribution for which each may, in your estimation, be equitably made answerable. Then, attach your signature. My  lieutenant, here, trusty Jan Voolrst, will, under the guidance of some gentleman familiar with  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6536-00000024"/> "         GOOD STORIES. the town, present the document to such of the assessed as are not here present; and some of my officers now in waiting below will accompany to their homes, or other repositories of their cash, such of your kind contributors who are. These preliminary matters once arranged, we will resume the festivities of the evening; and when supper shall be served, I hope, with my friends, to do it as ample justice as its excellence will unquestionably merit." While the free captain spoke thus, Hendrick, who, amid the con- fusion occasioned by his first appearance, had easily made his way at last to Bertha's side, exchanged a few words with her, which must have had a quieting effect upon her nerves. She breathed after this conference more freely. II. NOT long thereafter a cavalier issued from among the group of guests nearest to the outer doorway, and stepping, with a business- like air, up to one of the troopers there on guard, said to him,- "Follow me, to find pen and ink." "Martin Schenk never is without them," answered the man, without moving a muscle that was not concerned in the utterance of this brief reply. "Well and accurately stated," said the gentleman; "it is only ink we want; the water has spoiled his, so this way, if you please." And the trooper, suffering him to pass, followed without further parley. They soon returned, the gentleman bearing a silver stan- dish. He re-entered the rooinms, and disappeared among the still silent and closely crowded company. After a brief interval the same gentleman again approached the trooper. The first instalment is wanted," said he; "you and I must fetch it"; and he showed a bunch of keys. The trooper accompanied him to an upper floor. There, enter- ing an apartment which had the appearance of a luxuriously ri    THE UNINVYITED.           47 furnished dressingr-room, having evidently a lady for its rightful occupant, he opened a cabinet, and counting the drawers inside till he came to one of which hle was in search, unlocked this and took firom it an elegant but strongly-constructed casket. ' This," said he, "I must convey to the presence of your captain, but not through the crowd outside; you must accompany me down tile other stairs, and pass me inward by the private door." With these words he put a gold piece in the trooper's hand. ' Lead on," said the fellow, with a surly smile of satisfaction. They gained the private door; the gentleman was admitted, and his formidable attendant, ere he turned away, saw him deposit the I casket on a table by which stood the fair mistress of the house,- I an act which the grim Martin honored with an approving nod. The trooper llad not long resunmed his appointed post, when the servants and strangers, getting weary of their confinement in the nalrow s space around the doorway, began to struggole for greater liberty of locomotion, nor were the efforts of all the guards on that station more than was required to control them without the use of deadly weapons. Ere these insubordinates had been fully reduced to sub- mission, the cavalier already mentioned appeared a third time, with his bunch of keys, as before. "You seem to have your hands full," said he to his former attendant; " but you can trust me, now. And, after all," he added, "I presume that it would be difficult in any case to run away." ' Pass,- said the man, with a rigid smile. Tile gentleman disappeared, ascending as before, but this time alone, the upward flight of stairs. Nearly three hours elapsed  before he again descended. But his non-appearance in the interval did not disturb the trooper. Every known outlet of the house was gualrded, and the soldier took for granted that the gentleman would as before, re-enter the dancing-rooms by the back entrance. This, however, was by no means -the purpose of the latter. No sooner had hle reached the room whence lie liad fetched the casket, than, seizing a light which burnt there, and taking up an iron firehooli from the stove, he made his way swiftly to the second  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6536-00000025"/> '      ';48         GOOD STORIES. range of the attics, which rose tier on tier within the high-pitched roof of the mansion. There, in a spacious laundry or drying-room, he possessed himself of a coil of rope, strong enough, when doubled, to sustain his weight, and also of a handful of dry linen. Opening a window in the gable-wall, and carefully guarding his light from the rush of air which was thus admitted, he ignited the linen, and, thrusting it through the opening, obtained, as the night-wind fanned it to a flalring flame, a momentary view of the relative arrange- mlents, in these airy regions, of this and the contiguous house. He could perceive that the latter, in common with nearly all others in -the town, but unlike the burgomaster's new and more pretentious dwelling, turned its gables to the street; and that, consequently, the slope of its tiled roof formned, with the perpendicular wall, from one of whose apertures he viewed it, a valley (as the builders term it), and that the bottom of this hollow was occupied by a leaden gutter. This seemed to lie about twelve feet below his present position. Attaching therefore his doubled cord to a collar-bearn overhead, he cast the other end throulgh- the window, clambered out, and slid safely down upon the gutter. Great as was his haste, he thought a few moments migiht be well employed in reconnoitring the enemy. So, proceeding towards the front, he peered cautiously over into the dark gulf of the street below. It was a moonless October night. A link gleamed here and there, flickering  and twinkling, as the wind swept by, amid a narrow circle of uncertain light. But, ob- serving such figures as came within these spots of scanty illumination, he could see that all traffic up and - down the street was prevented, by the simple process of arresting and detaining every person who approached the cordon of armed men described by Schenk in his lucid explanatory speech. So profound was the silence enforced, that the inmates of the mansions overlooking this investing force seemed as yet quite unconscious of its presence. He satisfied him- self that the line of guards did actually continue its course down a narrow cross lane two houses off, and doubted no lolnger that all communication with the town forces and authorities, through ordi- nary channels, was effectually cut off. This confirmed him in his   atI       THE UNINVITED.            49 :r P9 , present purpose.

He dropped boldly, at all hazards, in, lighted on what felt beneath his feet like a Ileap of clothes or other drapery, and, stumbling on the yielding and uneven surface, fell forward across a bed, and upon its occupant. A rouh voice, as of one startled out of sleep, demanded, X with an oath} who was there. "Heer van. Oorsveldt, answered the gentleman. "Up, knave, d and bring me to your master." "He's ill, and can't be seen," answered the other in a sulky tone. "He must!" said Oolsveldt. "Do not give me the trouble of dragging you out of bed. Up, and do my bidding!"

"All I want" said Hendrick, after he had briefly explained to him the critical position of affairs, " is a rope and a lantern. Be liberal of your drink. when called on, and do not yet despair." He got what he required, and in due time, working his way rapidly from attic to attic, descended into the third house, being that whose side-walls flanked the narrow lane already mentioned. In the upper tenement dwelt, as he knew, a worthy tradesman, the tailor whom he usually employed, Heer Zumpt by name. Finding him abedhe soon  roused him out of all tendency to slumber by the intellignce lie comnunicated; and received from him, on the instant, promises of unlimited  assistance. A ladder was the first requisite, and hands enough to manage it, with" noiseless ease, the second. No.- 2.   4  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6536-00000026"/> *j      50          GOOD STORIES. "There are repairs," said Zumpt, " going on upon the house be- hind; there must be ladders in the yard, - and this is a populous tenement. I'll find you hands." Soon a ladder of moderate length was hoisted in by a back window of the attics, and an opening made through the roof on the side to- wards the lane, the tiles being carefully drawn inward. Hendrick was raised with his lantern half-way through it, to investigate the conditions of his projected enterprise. He saw that, owing to the narrowness of the lane, with which he was familiar (and whose houses, moreover, projecting story over story, decreased in mutual distance as they ascended), the roof of the house over the way was not more than nine feet distant from him where he stood. There was a sort of storm window in it, nearly on a level with his present position, and directly opposite. He - redescended ; the ladder was cautiously thrust through, and with much care, and the use of some hastily-improvised tackling, adjusted as a bridge terminating on the other roof, close beneath the window, which seemed to be unglazed and closed only by a shutter. Bidding those within hold firm, israc  Oorsveldt crept out upon the ladder. He, was already over the lane, a mark only too clearly defined against the now starry sky for the bullet of any trooper who should happen at that juncture to look up, when he heard a loose tile, disengaged by some movement of his friends -behind, slide downwards. There, thought he, goes a message to seal my fate, and that of Nimecguen. It was impossible to turn. He waited a second or two to hear the crash below,- the alarm, - and to receive the deadly volley. But all was still. It had pleased Providence, in its all-foreseeing wisdom, to endow good Heer Zumpt with an indomitable taste for gardening, a pen- chant which, in his lofty premises, he could no otherwise indulge than by the use of window-boxes filled with mould. In one of these the tile, that might have been so fatal, lay quietly arrested. Who knows with what weighty issues his most trivial acts are pregnant? Little thought the honest tailor, when he hung that unusually capa- cious box of his over the heads of his fellow-citizens, in' what a mighty drama he was acting an essential part! - the great drama   t          .(jTIlE UNINVITED.  OfJ of Dutch independence,and, in it, that of English liberty, in which has further stood involved that of every country now free, or destined yet to be so, throughout the habitable world. After that pause of awful expectation, Oorsveldt, with a beating heart and some faintness of the limbs, moved slowly on, and gained the storm window that rose from the steep slope of the opposite roof. The eaves concealed him from all eyes below; but, alas! he found the shutter to be fastened so securely on the inner side, as to resist every effort he could make to open it. Chagrined, but not disheartened, he slowly worked his painful way backward along the ladder. "Who," said he, "can find a carpenter with his centre-bit and keyhole saw?" None responded, save the good Ileer Zumpt. "If my Jan were only here!" said he. "' He is a schoolmaster and sexton now, but he can handle all sorts of tools; for Wilhelm "Horst and he-" "But Jan is n't here, so where 's the use?" interrupted a more practical,but, for the time, equally resourceless counsellor. "F leather," at last said a little girl, from the crowd which now filled the attic, I saw Wilhelm Horst come  up before I went to bed; I  am sure it was he, though it was not quite like him neither." "Nonsense, child!" said Madame Zumpt, "Vrow Horst had no thouht at five o'clock this afternoon of her son's coming hnome." "But, said Hendrick, catching at a chance,  " if he is a carpen- ter, we can but see for ourselves whether your little grl is deceived or not. Lead the way, Heer Zumpt; let us pay Vrow  Horst a Zumpt instantly complving, they descended to the second floor below, where-the tailor knocked at a dingy-lookin door. It was opened instantly by a woman of some five-and-forty years, in her ordinary daylight dress. She did not appear to have retired to reset. "Neighbor Horst," said Zumpt, " my kattkin tells me that Wil- helm is  now  withyou. Is'it so?"  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6536-00000027"/> ,!    B52         GOOD STORIES. ; i  "Yes, my good friend," replied she, with a sad voice and tearful eye ; " but - " "Let us see him instantly," interrupted the tailor: " he is wanted for a job that admits of no delay." "Alas!" said the poor widow, " his last job, I fear, is done. He cannot help you. But see him, and then judge. He'll be pleased to greet you." She made way for them to enter. Reclining on his bed, but not undressed, they found the artisan,- a tall and handsome man, of that intelligent look and kindly aspect in which one may recognize 'the true widow's son.' But his flushed and hollow cheek, and over brilliant eye told at a glance that he had come home to die. That stage of his fatal malady was not, however, apparently yet reached when strength and energy are utterly extinguished. Hen- drick laid on a table by his bed three gold-pieces. "There," said he, "is your fee, if you will come instantly and help us." What is the job!" asked the carpenter; " and why can't it wait till I have had some sleep? I have come far, and am somewhat weary." Zumpt explained the case. The carpenter sat up. "It would be his death," cried his mother, in an indignant voice. Away, sir, with your gold! Not but that you are very kind, - but do you think I can let him sell what chance of life he yet may have for any sum of gold that you could name?" "Friend," said Hendrick, " gold may improve his chance." "Thanks to my boy himself, sir," said the woman, 'I have wherewith to procure him all he call require while his complaint continues. Should the Lord see fit td take my son, I can trust Him to provide for nmy necessity. Take away that money," she resumed in terror, as she saw her Wilhelm extend his hand towards it. But the latter only pushed it towards Oorsveldt, rising, however, as he did so. "Mother," he said, " you would that my life should be prolonged. There is but One who can prolong it. If I refuse his work while I   Isg        TACHE UNINVITED.53 can do it, dare you pray to Him that He would spare mne? Do you know what threatens us? Have you lived through these years, * and not learnt what is meant by the pillage of a town? And even if Schenk can be bought off this time, hle will come again for more and hold us with a garrison at last, like Arnheim, -hold us for these demons of Spain; and the true Gospel, for which my father died, will be quenched in fire and blood and torture, as before. It ill give worth indeed to my poor life to risk it in a cause like this. I thank God for the call: for I thought my days of usefulness were ended.  Give me no gold," he continued, addressing Hendrick. "My mother will not want. I have provided for her better than she is aware." H He reached an old tool-box, a relic of his boyish days. The mother threw herself in silence into her elbow-chair, covered her face with her apron, and struggled with convulsive grief. i a  "Come,' said the mechanic, " let no more time be lost." The heart of Oorsveldt smote him as he marked the languid gait and the emaciated limbs of the artisan who ascended the steep attic stairs before him. "Cruel necessity!" thought he, " that bids me tax, and perhaps drain the last remnant of his wasted strength. But necessity it is; and besides, who could turn him now? Heaven only grant he may be equal to the task!" But he was not. Once out upon the ladder,-a  position which he did not attain without a  visibly prodigious effort,-his head swam, and he sunk flat upon that perilous and narrow bridge. It was well that so many were there to help; for it required the exertion of no small power to draw the ladder now so far backwards as to admit of its being disencumbered of its load. While Horst, prostrate on the attic floor, was slowly recovering consciousness, Hendrick had nearly made up his mind, though utterly unskilled in carpentry, to take the needful tools, and as a desperate resource, attempt himself to pierce the shutter. But time was now everything, and such work must in his hands be desperately slow, if performed at all. In that moment a voice firom the stairs, as of a young man, struck hbs ear, and inmediately Heer Zumpt rushed out exclaiming,- vM y Jan! sent by Providence in the nick of time!"  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6536-00000028"/> tI   54          GOOD STORIES. I/j{ "O yes!" cried Jan, in answer to his father's quick appeal, "give me the tools. You 'll trust me with them, Wilhelm," added he, with a cheerful smile, as he stooped to select the implements required from the box which stood by the slowly reviving carpenter. The eyes of the latter beamed with delight and happy confidence. "But, mother," said Jan, "you must be active too, and all you women, for that matter. Those rascals seized me at the corner. I was on my way home from Fried. Schmitt's wedding feast. But when they learned that I had relations here, they let me come in to get them a supply of eatables and drinkables. So collect at once all the meat, and, above all, the strongest drink you can find between roof and cellar floor, and let them have it instantly; the busier they are With that the better for us." With these words he scrambled nimbly upon the ladder, and returned in less than ten minutes, having successfully pierced and opened the obstructing window-shutter. "Heer Baron," said he, " the time has not been lost which Prov- idence has made you wait to find a workman. The shutter board was large; so the saw, fine as it is, made some noise, which must have been partly heard below there.   But the sky has clouded over in the last twenty minutes. The night is black as pitch; the ladder is now as invisible to them as nothing. But up, Freyheer, and I will follow you; for you may find bolted doors as well as win- dows on your way." "And you, mny good friends,"' said Hendrick, turning to the other men of serviceable a-ie, then present, " do you, too, follow; I shall want you all." None hesitated, under the new security of total darkness. Once in the street, a few doors beyond Schenk's outermost pickets, Hendrick and his party hastened with all speed to the house of the commandant of the town-guard (fortunately an old and experienced soldier). To explain all to this officer, to despatch his own followers, each furnished with twenty addresses of the members of that force, and bid to summon them quietly to an imme- diate muster under arms, -to array the first twenty who arrived   THE  UNINVI TED.          55 in certain dresses, procured in the interval from various houses of   his friends, - to arrange with the commandant the combinations he had himself devised,-these were tasks which, in the course of much less than the ninety minutes of respite from general military rapine that now remained, he executed with the unembarrassed promptitude which belongs only to minds of that order out of which  events mould leading warriors, statesmen, and-when they are wanted - kings. "I ascertained," said he to the captain, "by hazarding to a trooper a remark, which hle did not contradict, that they came in across the river. You know, therefore, where the line of their communication must be broken. Press them hard around Groot- schedel's by three o'clock. Now, good night; and the Lord be our  helper!" , III. SUPPER had been served, -the second sumptuous repast of that night's revel, - in the mansion of the burgomaster. Even the ter- rible Martin had proved unable to induce his victims to renew the dance. Such a mockery of their own grief and indignation they refused to perpetrate. But supper had intrinsic recommendations of a kind less dependent upon temporary. circumstances. Some sacrifice of dignity would not utterly destroy the savor of fricassees, of roasts, and comfitures, nor deprive their host's rich wines of all their power to cheer and elevate. They were honest Hollanders, - the guests. So the immense company sat now at several tables, in the many-pillared, low-ceiled hall, which occupied the chief part of the basement story of the building. At the head of the chief board sat Schenk, his rough features arrayed in grotesque smiles of seem- ing jovial abandonment. Grootschedel, who appeared to have decided that utter subserviency was, unlder the circumstances, the wisest policy, not only was seated on his right, but had actually obliged his daughter to occupy a place upon the ruffian's left; where she sat, pale but untrembling, ready for such prompt speech or  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6536-00000029"/> Il    56          GOOD STORIES. action as occasion might require. Troopers, in sufficient number to maintain complete control over the unarmed company, were stationed round the hall, - a guard of honor, as Schenk facetiously termed them. These, notwithstanding their having had a libelrt1 share of liquor, had lost no trace of their customary stern solidity of look and bearing. Their officers sat judiciously dispersed amid the guests. The servants were, apparently, more numerous than had attended at the earlier meal. The additions to the number of these latter might be kitchen and office functionaries, at leisure from further commissariat duties to give their aid in the banquet-room. That their present occupation was, at all events, not their customary one, was a thought readily suggested by their awkwardness and embarrassment, which amused not a little those whose habits enabled them to detect such menial deficiencies. " Can you make room for me ? " said a well-known voice behind Frank Gronow, who sat at an angle of a table contiguous to that at which Schenk had his place, and nearest to that place of all the guests, except those seated right and left of the free-captain. "If good company has, as it seems, dulled your appetite, hard work has sharpened mine.  Thank you," as Gronow edged away so as to admit Hendrick to the corner-place upon the bench. " Now listen to what I have got to say." While Gronow listened to Hendrick, stout old General Backliuys was thus addressed in a low voice, in like manner from behind. "When Van Oorsveldt cries, ' Schenk foreverP! seize with your neighbors that enemy beside you. The guards will not interfere. We-are all armed, and will dispose of them." He looked quietly round, and saw one of the awkward squad of servants standing, with a stolid look/ ready to fill his glass with a rare wine; which was being then served exclusively, as he had remarked, by them. He saw -this man, thereafter, stoop behind an officer of Schenk's, by whom he sat, and address him precisely at the same length; but, listening attentively (and he was sharper- eared than the trooper for his own native Guelder tongue), he could    THE UNINVITED.            57 discover that a description of the wine formed for him the sole substance of the servant's communication. There was a turn-table in the wall whereby the viands were introduced. Through this there had been passed, at an early period of the meal, some large panniers, filled apparently with flowers.  These were received uniformly by the same less handy waiters, and were distributed on the various side-tables that lined the circuit of the- hall. Time wore rather anxiously on. At length Schenk arose, with no trace of even affected hilarity remaining on his brow. "Heer Burgomaster," said he, turning to his host, C not more than one third of the stipulated ransom lhas come in. Time is now up; and we may wait no loncger. Captain Voss, pass the second word, and let the sack begin; now, my brave boys, let each choose for his hostage the fair lady that best suits his fancy. Mine sits here by me." With that he moved his right hand towards the pistols in his belt, and was extending the other to lay hold on the now dismayed and fainting Bertha, when a powerful blow struck down his upraised arm. He felt himself enclosed in an embrace so irresistible as pinned both his sinewy elbows helpless to his sides. In the same moment, "Schenk forever!" was shouted in a voice of gay derision close behind his ear, and every officer of his at table was seized, overpowered, and disarmed by the civilians who sat round him. "Guards, ho!" cried the free-captain, purple, and foaming with astonishment and fury. But half of his guards were already shot down by the new-come servants, with pistols drawn promptly from beneath the ample skirts of the liveries they wore; the others, having made a wild discharge of their fire-arms with but slight effect, amid the surprise and confusion of that sudden melee, were endeavoring vainly to make head with their swords against the whole host of attendants ho had armed themselves from out the flower baskets with sim- ilar weapons.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6536-00000030"/> 58 .         GOOD STORIES.    -  None of their trooper comrades came to their reinforcement from  without, for volleys now echoed from the street, mingled with shouts 1 and yells as of the fiercest combat.                Our worthy freebooter was foiled this time in both the chances of  his double game.                         3 By possessing himself of the persons of the leading citizens,  as their dames and daughters, as his manner was, hle had meant to  J secure hostages for advantageous parley, in case of discovery and surprise from without; while a suck, once commenced, could secure to him, by stipulating to countermand it, escape from any over- matclhing move within. c Forth, then, for your lives! ' cried Martin, to his disarmed as- sociates and throwing off with a sudden effort those townsmen who now held him, he rushed throurgh the nearest doorway, and escaped into the street behind. One officer achieved a like escape; the rest were reserved for trial and punishment. Schenk, as is well known, fought his way, with arms snatched probably from some dead or disabled combatant, through all oppo- sition, to the river, and plunged once more amid its waters. But he never reached the farther bank alive. His flight once known, the survivors of his company surrendered. Loud were the praises gratefully bestowed on Hendrick van Oorsveldt for his ready wit, dauntless perseverance, skilfuloman- agement, and bravely decided action, - praises which mingled with the shouts of victory and the hysteric tears in which even the, strongest nerved among the women now found relief from the terrible strain their feelings had endured. To Hendrick all felt that their deliverance was owing. As hle handed to Grootschedel, safe and untouched, the valuable casket of which Bertha had permitted him to make an occasion for training his surly trooper friend to give him free transit to the upper floors, the worthy burgomaster embraced him publicly,-an act which caused Bertha's eyes to brighten, and her cheek to glow, in spite of the languor of exhaustion which had by this time overwhelmed her.  This helped the tide of Grootschedels own   THE  UNINVITED.           59 existing feelings to carry the good man one step further,-but that step a most important and unexpected one.  This youth, thought he, will make a fortune for himself; and if not, I have enough. So, taking Bertha's hand, he placed it in Hendrick's, gave them both his blessing, and called all present to witness their betrothal. Where, meanwhile, was the exquisite Van Aldenhuysen, while he was being thus summarily superseded? Catching, as was his wont, the mood, for the time being, of the man he wished to win, and influenced possibly by a feeling, more or less vague, that it must be pleasanter anywhere than in the same room with Schenk, he had, when the burgomaster called for a guide to the lieutenants, promptly volunteered, though he scarcely knew as yet the leading thoroughfares of the town. It was not till after an hour's wander- ing that he and the exactors blundered upon the first mansion that was to be visited. By the time they found the second, the burgher guard had already secured it; the lieutenant and his men were made prisoners, and stopped from all further levy of brandschat- sung. Hendrick seldom thereafter passed the corner-house without looking in to inquire after the health of the generous and patriotic  carpenter. The latter's conversation was extremely interesting to an adventurous man like Van Oorsveldt; for Horst had at one time been half round the globe, as carpenter on board an English vessel, and could describe not only the wonders of the deep, but the charms, the riches, and the dangers, too, of the tropical emporia of trade. His clear religious faith, his patience under miserable suf- ferings, and his constant solicitude for the comfort of all around him, endeared him much to Hendrick, who was himself a sincere and thoughtful Christian. He died ere many months in perfect peace. He had, as he told Hendrick on the occasion of their first meet- ing, provided comfortably for his mother, having clubbed his savings with those of a fellow-journeyman, intelligent like himself, to commence in partnership an independent business. This already  &#xD;<pb n="60" xml:id="VAC6536-00000031"/> bV          WAV  Do uVt-D.,          C gave good promise of becoming large and profitable. He be- queathed his share to his mother by a formal testament, and for  some years she had remittances from his surviving partner more than sufficient for all her simple wants. Seven years had already  elapsed since the date of the events that have been related, when Oorsveldt, now a general of high repute in the service of the States, found, on a temporary return to his home, his lady, the still beau- tiful and brilliant Bertha, in some perplexity to supply the place of the gouvernante who had superintended the larger of their two sumptuous establishments, and who was about to make an advanta- geous marriage. The General had brought no register -of such ladies from the field, and could not in this matter immediately assist his wife. Next morning, however, he was summoned, as a member of t\ judicial commission, to hear an appeal -in which a poor widow appeared as the complainant. The allegation made on her behalf was, that her partner in a carpentry business, after having passed, in her name and his own, through the regular course of legal proceed- ings as a bankrupt, had recommenced business on his own account, under circumstances which suggested grave suspicions of fraud. Although the creditors had been paid so nearly in full as to indis- pose them to reopen inquiry, the stock with which he had resumed business was as large at least, if not identical with that which had been sold off; yet the widow's property was utterly gone. The plaintiff appeared in court.. In her the General immediately recog- nized the mother of noble-hearted Wilhelm Horst. The defendant and his lawyers were too clever, or the law, too weak, - the poor widow could have no redress. But she had not trusted in vain that God would care for her when her son was gone. She never begged her bread. Years after this defeat of justice, she breathed her last in Bertha's arms, - the long-loved, prized, and venerated echevine of her chateau of Rozenbergen.  &#xD;<pb n="Illustration-61" xml:id="VAC6536-00000032"/> it's  /;iN TH ELOSMNDRO LOS   THE BELLOWS-MENDER OF LYONS'. MY  history is composed of the most singular circumstances. Condemned by my birth to associate among beings of, the most abject class, my elevation was the work of human malice. That evil of society which ruins so many fortunes laid the solid foundation of mine. I am married,-rich, and happy, from having been the docile instrument of an extraordinary act of malevolence. T I was born in a little hamlet situated in the neighborhood of Montelemart. My father had made many fruitless efforts to raise himself above indigence. His last resource in his old age arose from the exercise of a trade which he had acquired in his youth, - that of a bellows-mender. ' This, though not a very brilliant occu- pation, was the work at which I was placed at that time- of life when I was thought capable of earning my livelihood. Satisfied at first in following this business under the inspection Of my father, nature had endowed me with an industrious disposition, -and I soon ' rivalled and even excelled my master. Ambition led, me to imagine my talents were fitted for a wider sphere, and some of my excursions as far -as the gates of Montelemart succeeded beyond my wishes. After furnishing all I could spare for the support of my father in his old age, I found means to gather a little sum of money, which enabled me to undertake a journey to Lyons. I made my appear- ance in that great city, amply provided with such articles as be- longed to my profession, and the public places, and most crowded streets, soon resounded with my cries. I was young, dexterous, and well-formed; I sold my wares rapidly and became a general favor- ite with the servant maids, which was the utmost limit of my am- bition at this time.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6536-00000033"/> 62          UU   A i 'VLll' S. Returning home late one evening to my little garret, which served me for a warehouse as well as a lodging, I was accosted by four well-dressed young men, who seemed to be taking an evening walk. We were in one of the most solitary streets of the quarter of St. Clair. They threw out a few pleasantries on the lateness of the evening, accompanied by sarcasms on my profession of bellows- mender, which I answered in a style of raillery at which they appeared to be - surprised. I saw them look at each other signifi- cantly, and immediately after heard them say, "This is our man." I own that these words alarmed me, finding myself alone in the dark without any means of resistance, and at the mercy of four stout young men. What would become of me, was the reflection that occupied my mind; when one of them, who guessed at the cause of my terror, soon dispelled it by saying to me, in a tone of affability,- "Perourou,"-the name which the people of Lyons give their - bellows-menders, - Perourou," said he, " you, probably, have not supped, neither have we. Our supper is ready, will you join us? Our intention is to do you more good than you have any idea of. Come and sup with us, and after supper we will talk with you. Do not be afraid; we are gentlemen. If you will not enter into our schemes we shall only require your promise of secrecy, which you will run no risk in keeping." There was something in the voice of the person whlo spoke to mne, as well as in the proposition itself, so seductive, that I accepted the offer without hesitation. My new acquaintances, after having made me cross several streets, entered a house and conducted me into an apartment elegantly furnished, where we found six other young men, who seemed to have been waiting for their friends impatiently. A short explanation followed concerning me, and we sat down to supper. I had the honor of making the company laugh by some of my arch observations, and confirmed them in the good opinion with which it was necessary they should be impressed before they would come to a further explanation. The servants withdrew, after pla- cing the dessert on the table, and for a few minutes a profound   THE BELLOWS-MENDER OF LYONS.         63 silence prevailed throughout the assembly, which till then had been sufficiently noisy. At length he who presided at the repast addressed me in the fol- lowing words:- s The ten persons with whom you have supped alre all citizens of Lyons. We are engravers: our joint profits, with what we obtain from our families, afford us an easy independence; and we also acquire by our talents a considerable shareof reputation. The happiness we enjoyed has been lately disturbed by love on the one side. and pride on the other. In the street of St. Dominic lives a picture-merchant, who is himself an ordinary man, but who has a daughter eminently beautiful. The city of Lyons, extensive as it is, contains not another masterpiece worthy of being placed on a level with this charming creature. Possessed of every accomplishment, and endowed with every grace, all her amiable qualities are shaded by one single defect; and that defect is an insupportable pride. Vain of being the object of general admiration, she fondly imagines that none ought to aspire to her hand under the rank of a prince. Her father, who is a tolerably good connoisseur in painting, but who has a very limited understanding with respect to everything else, has entirely spoiled her by adulation, amounting almost to idolatry. Novels, her looking-glass, and habitual compliments from all around her, have raised self-love into vanity, and vanity into arrogance, and the most lofty disdain towarlds all who are not decorated with the marks of opulence or the distinctions of rank. I had the honor of engaging her notice, from my connections in business with her father. Sometimes she accorded me the singular privilege of giving me her hand at a ball, or of attending her to the theatre. These slight favors turned my brain; I thought myself beloved, because I was preferred to others, and ventured to unfold my pretensions to her father, who lent a favorable ear to my offers. Indeed, my family, profession, fortune, and situation gave- me a right -to pre- sume that my alliance would be agreeable to the young lady. Judge of my surprise when, on the first overture respecting mar- riage, the insolent girl, in my presence, answered her father in a 1                ,  i  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6536-00000034"/> hifc        \jrV/UUU - L UUlt1.b.6   - tone of the most haughty arrogance, - Do you think, sir, that a young woman like me was born for nothing better than an engraver? "I confess that this insolent and imprudent remark extinguished every sentiment of love in my bosom, and love, when fled, is easily followed by a desire of revenge. 'My friends,' I exclaimed to  those who now surround me, 'this disdainful girl has, in my person,  committed a general outrage against us all. Espouse my cause, and  let us form such a plan as shall serve to show her that she has not indeed been born to the honor of becoming the wife of an en-  graver.'  "Such is my history; do you feel sufficient confidence, and think  yourself endowed with sufficient discretion, to merit being raised  above your present condition? Beneath the abject covering which X now disguises you, it is easy to discern that you have some soul, and  no common share of understanding. Will you venture to become  the husband of a charming woman, who, to attain perfection, wants only to have her pride mortified and her vanity punished?" "Yes," answered I, with firmness, "I perfectly comprehend the part which you would have me to act, and I will fulfil it in such a  manner that you shall have no reason to blush for your pupil." The following day we conferred together, as we did ever after, with extreme precaution. During a whole week, I bathed two hours every morning and evening to get rid of my tinkering skin and complexion. In the interval of bathing, the most elegant hair- dresser of Lyons gave my long tresses the form most in fashion. My ten friends furnished me with assortments of the finest linen, and the most elegant dresses for the various seasons, and were soon so fond of their work that we became inseparable. Almost their whole time was employed in giving me instructions. One taught  me to read, another to write; another gave me some ideas of draw- ings, a few lessons in music, -a little, in short, of everything; so that during three months my time, thoughts, and attention were wholly absorbed in my studies; and I soon perceived that this kind of life  suited perfectly my taste. I felt the utmost ardor to carry to per-   THE BELLOWS-1MENDER OF LYONS.         65 fection these first rudiments of my new education, which had be- come my chief delight. Nature had furnished me not only with a disposition for study, but with a memory so retentive that my friends observed with some astonishment the rapid progress of their ,disciple. At length they thought me sufficiently accomplished to carry their projects into full execution, and I was removed from my closet to take possession of a spacious suite of apartments in one of the first hotels in Lyons. The bellows-mender disappeared altogether to rmake way for the rich Marquis of Rouperou, principal proprietor of the mines of Dauphiny. It was under this title that I presented myself to the picture-merchant as a purchaser who paid little atten- tion to a few louis, provided he met with pieces that were original. A most perfect imitator of my experienced tutors, I had learnt to twirl my seals, display my repeating watch with an air of indiffer- ence, show the brilliant which I wore on my finger, or handle an elegant snuff-box, on which was painted a fancy portrait, which I modestly observed was the picture of a beloved sister. I was desirous of pleasing, and easily succeeded; but it was not enough to impose on the father. In order to fulfil the views of my patrons, the daughter must also be deceived. While I was meditat- ing on this point, the picture-merchant gave me notice that he had just received a superb collection of engravings from Rome, request- ing me to call the same morning, as he would not expose them for sale till I should have made my choice. I hastened to his house, unconscious of the fate that awaited me. Instead of being received as usual by the father, it was the daugh- ter, whom till then I had in vain wished to see; or rather it was beauty itself which stood before my eyes in the form of that lovely young woman. My dear friend, a feeling heart often beats under an unpolished form. More susceptible at my age of passion than of libertinism, my palpitating heart felt all the power of beauty. A new world un- folded itself before my eyes. I soon forgot my borrowed part. One sentiment absorbed my soul, one idea enchained my faculties.

The charming Aurora perceived her triumph, and seemed to listen with complacency to the incoherent expressions of passion which escaped my lips. That interview fixed my destiny forever! All difficulties vanished before the new emotions which animated my bosom. A single instant inspired me with the resolution of lievot- ing my days and nights to study, in order that, possessed with the advantages of knowledge, I might be less unworthy of the happi- ness to which I aspired. Every morning I found some excuse for a visit to the picture- merchant, every morning I had some new trinket to exhibit, or some object of taste on which to consult Aurora. It was the season of flowers, and I presented her every day with a bouquet composed of such as were best adapted to her style of beauty; my friends often joined in the sonnet, or madrigal, of which I obtained the credit, and I sometimes surprised the fine eyes of this charming creature fixed on mine with an expression of tender approbation. Six months passed in this manner, the engravers being too desir- ous of complete revenge to hazard losing it by precipitation. Every evening they required an exact account of my conduct, with which they were so well satisfied that they furnished me with funds far beyond the wants of the personage I represented. I received at length a formal invitation from the picture-mer- chant to a fete which he gave in the country and of which I was led to think myself the hero. The vain beauty behaved so respect- fully towards me, loaded me with such distinguished attentions, was so lovely, so enchanting, whether as mistress of the fete or its brightest ornament, that the mbment we were alone, impelled by an emotion which I was unable to suppress, I threw myself at her feet -and made an offer of marriage. She heard me with modest dignity, while a tear of joy, which dimmed for a moment her fine eyes, con- vinced me that pride was not the only feeling which agitated her heart. Yes, I discovered that I was beloved! After having deceived the daughter with respect to the person, it was necessary to blind the father with respect to the fortune.

They over- whelmed me with so man compliments, that had I  only possessed a slight tincture of vanity, might have believed they rallied me. The event, however, proved that they were serious; and their re- venge on the haughty Aurora was as expensive as it was singular. That very morning they s-ent, in my name, to m y mistress, the most magnificent bouquet, a watch, bracelets, jewels, laces of exquisite fineness, forming a present sufficiently splendid tocomplete the de- eption of both father and daughter.

But in the stillness of solitude, sophis- try and passion disappeared, leaving a dreadful prospective before me.  When I associated the idea of Aurora with the miserable flock-bed which was soon to be her portion, when I figured to my-r self her delicate hands employed in preparing the coarsest nourish- ment, when I beheld her, who deserved a palace, lodging under the thatched roof of my aged father, I shrunk back with horror, or started up covered with a cold perspiration. More than once I re- solved to throw myself at the feet of the injured Aurora, make a full confession of my crime, and cover myself with the infamy which belonged to lhim who could so degrade himself as to act the part of a villain. But self-love and passion came alike to my aid. En- chained by the fascinating enjoyments of the present, my imagination gilded with some rays of hope the gloom of the future. The un- happiness of Aurora, said I to myself, will be but transient; love will soften into bitterness. Her mortal enemies are blinded by their desire of revenge  She will, she shall be happy in spite of them! -they will leave me some money, and the means of procur- ing more by industry. I should be a wretch indeed if I did not devote mny life to the task of strewing flowers along her path. When she learns who I am, her resentment will, no doubt, at first be vehement; but when her good sense shall perceive that the evil is irreparable, resignation will .come to her aid, -love will supply the place of riches, and we shall yet be happy. Such were my reflections during eight days previous to that on which I conducted my mistress to the altar. At the moment when she pronounced the vow to live and die with me, a sudden shivering ran through all my veins, - a general trepidation seized my whole frame. I had never had so near a view of villany. I should infal- libly have sunk to the earth if a flood of tears had not come to my relief, while the silly crowd who surrounded us mistook this last cry of expiring virtue for an excess of sensibility. Aurora herself was   TH .

In proposin to my wife an excursion of which I foresaw all the cruel consequences I could not prevent a deep sigh from escapinor me, to which the credulous Aurora paid "o attention.  Her lively imagination was elated with the idea of travelling by my side in a magnificent equipage, attended  y her women, escorted by servants on horseback, and finding means of indulging at once her pride and her love; ideas excusable enough at eighteen, which was the age of my  wife. She  was delialted in making pre an "ey, theapproachof n     Ina preparationUII for' a jour- ney, the approach of which was to me distraction. More than once I implored my patrons for mercy; the obligations I had entered into were laid before me. We began our journey. Twe f myte. riens^; ^ ^ etere Two of my ten friendsserved me as couriers, while he who had paid his addresses to Aurora, pushed his imprudence so far as to offer himself to me  as coach nan. It is true that  a wit, dexter- ously stuck on his hair, and a patch fixed on his right eye, so dis- guised him that even his friends did not recognize him; three others of the young engravers gayly rode behind  the carriage as lackeys. The other four, detained at Lyons by their affairs, consoled them- selves in not being of the party by making the travellers promise to write to them from every place where we  should stop to rest our- selves, and this we did frequently, travelling only by short stavres. Scarcely could these wicked domestics contain their mirth when they heard my vain bride, who always spoke to them with haughty distance, addressing herself to me in  terms the most respectful, inquiring the anaes of my  chtea zx, the extent of my estates, and of my sei,"norial rights of hunting and fishing; dwelling with eom-  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6536-00000037"/> 70         '  OOD STORIES. piacency on my mines, which to her lively apprehension were equal at least to those of Peru. On subjects such as these turned our conversations, when three leagues beyond Montelemart we perceived the narrow lane which led to a village, the steeple of which ap- peared distant from the high road. This poor village, alas! was rmine. The critical moment was approaching. We passed over lands that certainly were not mine, and after three hours' long and difficult travelling our coachman, too well in- structed, stopped the carriage at the door of a miserable hut. An old man, clad in the homely garb of povelrty, was on the threshold, taking the air. In this old man-I discovered my venerable father. No, my friend, I have no colors with which I call trace this original scene! Figure to yourself the trembling Perourou on one side, the haughty Aurora on the other, and six insolent young men ceremoni- ously placing her on an old broken chair, with most insulting bursts of laughter, and with pleasantries tlhemost aggravating, refining upon their vengeance and her mortification. Figure to yourself the pretended coachman taking off suddenly his patch and his wig, and addressing Aurora with an air of superiority. "No, madam," said he, in a tone of inconceivable disdain,-" no, you have not been born or brought up for an engraver; such a lot would have done too much honor to your birth, to your fortune, and to your choice. A bellows-mender is worthy of you, and such is he, madam, whom you have taken for your husband." I was about to answer, but the pretended coachman was already on his seat, the five others threw themselves into the coach, choked almost with laughter, and we soon lost sight of the whole equipage. I expected that the catastrophe would be singular enough, but less terrible than it proved. My engravers, while they taught me miy part, had kept their own secret. They carried off everything with them, like the scene-shifters of a theatre, who lock up the dec- orations after the piece is finished. As for the unfortunate Aurora, she saw nothing of this. Her former lover continued speaking when she no longer heard or felt. The ruffians left her, when they departed, in a deep swoon. Judge of mly situation! Recollect   THE BELLOWS-MEN    DE  OF LYONS      7 that I hlad now acquired a considerable share of sensibility and del- icacy from the instruction I had received, and the manner of life to which I had lately been accustomed. Alas! in those cruel moments I trembled alike at the thought of losing the woman I adored, or of seeing her restored to life. I lavished on her the most tender cares, and almost breathed wishes that my cares might be unavailing AM! my friend, I thought for a long time that my dreadful vows were heard. Nevertheless, after bathing copiously the pallid face of the lovely and delicate Aurora with water, she regained for a moment the-use of her senses.  Her frenzied eye met mine. "Monster!" shes exclaimed, and her senses again forsook- her. I took advantage of this second swoon to remove her from the sight of thespectators, composed chiefly of women with withered coun- tenances, who might have passed for witches; and laid my plain- tive bride on a little fresh straw, with which a compassionate neiah- bor strewed' the floclk-bed of my old father. When she had again recovered the use of her senses, I commanded every one to leave us, in order -to have no witness of the explanation, and of the dreadful story which I was fated to relate to my wife. When I had disembarrassed myself of the crowdJI took Aurora in my arms; I  pressed her to  my heart,--my scalding tears bathed her cheeks. At length she -opened her eyes and fixed them on me mine  shrank from Iler glance.

What would become of her? In what manner could I act that might least wound her feelings? Would she think herself sufficiently rich in my attachment and ten- derness? O no! I felt all the horrors of her destiny and my own. Yes, of my own! I had, indeed, no reverse of fortune to undergo; I, who was born to wretchedness and nurtured in want. Yet my agonized heart, a heart but too susceptible, told me that I had a sor- row to sustain, perhaps the most cruel in the sad catalogue of human evils. I had not merely to bear indifference from that object in whom I had placed every hope of happiness, -to see that heart alienated whose tenderness was necessary to my existence,-to read coldness in that eye on whose look my peace depended. I recollected with distraction that it must be my doom, not merely to support indifference, but aversion. I was not merely to become an object of contempt, but of horror. I was not merely to feel the bitterness of being hateful to her I loved, but to know that I de- served her hatred, -to find that the sharpest of all my sorrows was the poignancy of remorse. Had not I been the fatal cause of all she suffered? Had not I darkened all the fair prospects of her life, and overwhelmed her with intolerable anguish? Had not I, wretch that I was, planted a dagger in her heart? Perhaps she would find a refuge from me in the grave,-perhaps her last breath would curse me, - or if she pitied and forgave me, could I endure her. cruel mercy? - would not her pity and forgiveness be more barbarous than reproach? - more terrible than her curse? Such were the reflections which absorbed my mind, and made so painful the bed on which I had thrown myself to pass the night. The horror of my situation was increased by a continuance of violent rains, which laid under water the cross-road leading to Montelemart, and rendered it impassable for several days. This circumstance prevented me from sending to the town, as I intended, for a carriage to convey Aurora to a lodging less fitted to mortify her pride. You will easily imagine that I sent frequently to inquire respecting the situation of my unfortunate bride. The answers   THE BELLO WS-MENDER OF LYONS.         73 were satisfactory; my attentions were received with gratitude; I was repeatedly told that the next day I should be admitted to see her; that she had made up her mind; that she should display a firmness of character which, in the cruel circumstances in which she was placed, would astonish and confound her vile enemies. All these things, which were repeated to me with an affectation of secrecy, did not lull me into perfect security. That terrible to-mor- row affrighted my soul; I dreaded the fatal interview more than death! I was meditating how to elude it under different pretences, when the door of my chamber opened and discovered to me my interesting bride. I threw myself at her feet, and seizing one of her hands bathed it with my tears. She looked at me in this hu- miliating posture for some time in silence, then, raising me up, addressed me with all the dignity of pride which nothing could van- quish. "You have deceived me," said she; "it is on your future conduct that my forgiveness shall depend. If any generous senti- ment remains at the bottom of your heart, if you are desirous of not making me altogether miserable, do not take advantage of the authority which you have usurped. Mademoiselle offers me a de- cent retirement at her uncle's house. I have accepted it, because it accords both with my situation and my duties. You may visit me there whenever you please. We will arrange toethher the means of extricating ourselves from this horrible situation, and of providing for our future support. Rely on my honor for the care of defending your own." Man is a confiding creature. A kind word from the woman we love is sufficient to soften all the misery she occasions. Notwith- standing the cold disdain of Aurora, I gave her credit for her meekness, without reflecting that it would have been more natural for her to load me with reproaches. During five days my confi- dence in Aurora's forgiveness continually augmented; and while I traced out to her the plan of life which love suggested to me, I saw her more than once smile at the picture. Could I have imagined that, after so many sufferings, the cruel Aurora had one in reserve for me which surpassed all the rest?  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6536-00000039"/> 74         GOOD STORIES. One morning,- it was the eighth after our arrival in the village, - I awakened after having passed a happy night, soothed by deli- cious dreams. The day was already far advanced, when my father, reproaching me for my indolence, gave me two letters which he had just received. The handwriting of the directions was unknown to me. The first I opened was from my friends at Lyons. "We are satisfied with you," said they, "and after having taken exem- plary revenge of the haughty Aurora, it is just that we should remember the friendship with which your talents and your conduct have inspired us. You are not made to live in the class among which you were born, and we offer you, with pleasure, the means of extricating yourself from all your embarrassments, without wish- ing that you should find your gratitude at all burdensome, since we can serve you without any inconvenience to ourselves. You know that we pushed almost to madness the idea of revenge on Aurora; and we had each made the sacrifice of a thousand crowns to carry our plan into execution. You have not expended the third part of this sum. The rest is deposited in the house of Meme, a notary, well known in our city, who will remit it to you on your simple receipt. The jewels, linen, lace, and clothes, with which you amused the credulity of a foolish father, and a haughty girl, will likewise be delivered to you. Take care of Aurora. We have put her into your arms in the hope that you will never give us oc- casion to regret that we pushed our vengeance too far. Whenever you shall form any undertaking, command the credit, the friendship, and the recommendations of your friends the engravers of Lyons." "Well!" exclaimed I, joyfully, "half my embarrassments have vanished; I shall be able to provide for Aurora." The letter which I next opened, and which had been directed by a stranger, was from Aurora herself. "Some remains of pity," she observed, "which I still feel for you, notwithstanding your conduct towards me, pleads in your favor, and induces me to inform you that at the moment you receive this letter, I shall be at the gates of Lyons. It is my intention to enter a convent, which will rid me of your hateful presence. I am an honorable enemy, and declare that you   TIUE BELLOWS-ME NDER OF LYONVS.        7 must hold yourself ready to appear before every tribunal in France till I have found one which shall do me the justice to break the chains of your victim, and punish the traitors by whom she has been sacrificed." I shall not attempt to paint the violent and conflicting emotions which agitated my mind at the perusal of this letter. One moment I determined to pursue Aurora, to detain and force her to pay due obedience to a man whom fate had made her husband; the next, I felt the most invincible repugnance to persecute a woman whom I so ardently loved. The project also was impracticable. Aurora had already departed several hours; I must have sent for horses from Ilontelemart, or walked thither on foot; either would have required so much time that I renounced all hopes of overtaking Aurora, and only thought of contriving the means of leaving a place which served to recall so many bitter remembrances. I had still as much money left as would enable me to reach Lyons. Be- fore my departure I interrogated severely the cure and his niece, with respect to their knowledge of my wife's escape. Threats and entreaties were lavished in vain; and though they were, as I have since discovered, the primary authors of the plot, it was impossible to bring them to any confession. New embarrassments crowded upon me when I reached Lyons. Where begin my researches, how come to any knowledge, in a great city, of the asylum which Aurora had chosen? In what manner could I present myself before a father, amidst the first transports of his indignation against the criminal deceiver of his daughter? How could I wander from one convent to another without the risk of being suspected from the nature of my inquiries, and exposing my- self to the danger of a dungeon, where I might be plunged for hav- ing acted so shameful a part? In order to deliver myself from these perplexities, I had recourse to my friends the engravers, who all advised me to remain quiet, and wait peaceably till the procedure for breaking the marriage became the topic of general conversation at Lyons. I consented to follow their counsels, to forbear inquiries alike dangerous and useless, and to take measures for improving my  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6536-00000040"/> 76          GOOD STORIES. fortune, too well convinced that this was the only chance of here- after regaining the heart of Aurora. Thanks to my generous friends, after having disposed advanta- geously of the jewels, lace, and other valuable articles, which were useless to me, I found myself in possession of near ten thousand crowns. It was reported at that time that we were on the eve of a war with some of the principal powers of Europe. In consequence of this information, and with the aid of my friends, I made one of those bold speculations which, if it had not succeeded, would have placed me where I had set-out, but which, by splendid success, in- creased more than threefold my capital. While my commercial operations were going forward in profound secrecy, my story became the topic of public animadversion. The intrepid Aurora, from her monastic retreat, hurled her criminations against me and my confederates. This want of address on her part, in attacking the engravers, besides turning the laugh against herself, was of infinite advantage to me, by throwing me in the background, while my friends were so much the more awake to my interests, as it was the best mode of defending their own. Aurora insisted peremptorily that the marriage should be annulled. The abbess of the convent in which she had found an asylum, and who was re- spected for her birth, as-well as her good qualities, moved heaven and earth in her cause. Her father brought together his protectors and friends, and everything threatened us with a defeat,-the shame of which would have fallen on the engravers, and the weight of it on myself. The wags amused themselves in seeing the pride of Aurora made the instrument of her punishment, but no smiles can smooth the brow of wrinkled and severe justice. Already a warrant to arrest me had been issued, from which I had only been saved by the obscurity in which I lived. The affair was brought before the courts with great rapidity. My haughty enemy had requested guards to escort her to the tribunal in which our marriage was to be declared null or valid. She made her appearance arrayed in all her charms, which were still heightened by the semblance of the most unaffected modesty.   THE BELLOWS-ME    NDER OF LYONS.     " Never had any cause assembled so immense a crowd of spectators. Aurora's counsel pleaded for her with so much eloquence that the tears of the auditory sometimes forced him to suspend his declama- tion. The emotion of the judges indicated what kind of sentence they were about to pronounce, and which the feelings of the audi- ence were powerfully impelled to sanction, when the engraver, who bad sought to be the husband of Aurora, seeing that no counsel arose to plead on my side of the question, requested permission from the judges to enter on my defence. This request was immediately granted, that it -might not be said I had been condemned unheard. He gave my-history in a few words, in which nothing was exagger- ated except the eulogium with which he honored me. He owned, nevertheless, that the singular circumstances of my marriage would authorize the judges to declare it null and void. He hesitated for a moment. The most solemn silence reigned throughout the assem- bly ; when, turning to Aurora, he added in a firm tone of voice,- "No, madam, you are not the wife of the bellows-mender; but nature destines you to become the mother of his child! Listen to the powerful cry of the infant which you carry in your womb, and then say if you desire to become free while your child is condemned to the infamy of illegitimacy?" "No, no!" exclaimed the trembling Aurora, bursting into a flood of tears; and the whole audience weeping in sympathy with her, joined in the exclamation of "No, no!" This cry of maternal tenderness decided the cause. The judges declared that the marriage was valid according to the contract, in which I had signed my true name, alleging also that our situations were not sufficiently unequal to authorize the dissolution of our union.  But they wisely decreed, in order not to leave the adven- turer too much cause for triumph, that my wife should be permitted to reside in the convent which she had chosen for her asylum; an injunction was laid on the husband, under certain penalties, neither to reclaim, pursue, or molest her in any manner whatever; that the child should be baptized under his name, but that he should at no time  have a right over its education. The rest of the sentence  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6536-00000041"/> turned on objects of detail more interesting to gentlemen of the long robe than the historian. Aurora left the audience in triumph. The crowd escorted her to the convent, crowning her with eulogiums for the tender sacrifice which she had just made to the infant with which she was pregnant.  Such was the result of this celebrated trial, during the decision of which I was little at my ease. Obliged to hide myself from every eye, I took advantage of my not being known to glide among the crowd; no one conjecturing that the bellows-mender, of whose his- tory they heard so much, wore decent clothes, fine linen, and was a personage in no mean circumstances. The most ridiculous stories were fabricated respecting my absence and my marriage. I some- times endeavored to laugh with the rest, but was horribly abashed to find that even those who amused themselves most at the expense of Aurora were virulent declaimers against what they called my infamy. Agreeably to the dictates of my own feelings, and in con- formity to the advice of my friends, I determined to quit Lyons, and employ my funds in some other place, where my name and history were unknown. I made choice of Paris for my residence, where, amid an immense population, I could most easily escape observation, and also where I could employ my capital to most advantage. There the poor bellows-mender, with a hundred thousand livres, and the credit of his friends at Lyons, established a commercial house, which succeeded beyond all his hopes. I was, during five years, the favorite of fortune; and my conscience renders me this testimony, that I had no reason to blush at any of my speculations. My correspondence with Lyons was active. A happy accident gave me the means of rendering essential service to one of the first banking-houses of that great city. The proprietors testified their boundless gratitude towards me, and pressed me so earnestly to pay them a visit, that the desire of yielding to their solicitations, to- gether with the secret wish of breathing the same air as Aurora, led me to accept of the Invitation. I made my appearance in Lyons with carriages, servants, and fine clothes, none of which were at this time borrowed. Fortune had so successfully labored for me during   THE BELLOWS-MIENDER OF LYONS.        79 five years, that I had the means of supporting a magnificent style of living. lMy old friends scarcely recognized me; it may therefore be im- agined that it was not a very difficult task to escape the penetration of my new acquaintances. Without appearing to annex the slightest importance to the subject, I sometimes talked of the celebrated trial which had interested the city of Lyons five years before, and ter- minated my question by cursorily inquiring what had become of Aurora and her family? I learned that her father had lately died, that losses on the one hand and ostentation on the other, joined to the sums he had lavished on the education of his daughter, had left his affairs so embarrassed, that Aurora, at his decease, found her- self almost without resource, and in some measure dependent on the benevolence of the abbess of the convent where she had taken refuge. I was also informed, that, although whenever Aurora ap- peared, she was still the object of general applause, she conducted herself with so much propriety, that she was not less respected than admired. The bellows-mender, it was observed, had suffered her to remain tranquil since the trial, without attempting to reclaim his lost rights. I did not listen to these recitals without the most lively emotion. During five years' residence in the capital, young and ambitious, as well as deeply enamored of Aurora, the ardor of my efforts to ac- quire a fortune which might give me the right of reclaiming her I loved, had absorbed my mind; but my abode at Lyons, and the un- suspected testimony of all with whom I conversed in favor of my wife, awakened every latent sentiment of tenderness in-my bosom. The image of Aurora, of her whom I had deceived, but whom I adored, again occupied every thought of my soul; again throbbed in every pulse! I felt how worthless was the acquisition of wealth which she refused to share. I felt that she was necessary to my existence! - and my child - was I never to fold it in my arms?  never to feel the endearments of it who owed to me life? never to know those parental transports which, although I had not experi- enced, my heart told me must be exquisite? I could bear these  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6536-00000042"/> - SU   ,U UU       STURllE'S . cruel reflections no longer. I determined to behold Aurora and my  child. One of the engravers, by my orders, assembled her father's cred- itors and discharged all his debts, purchasing for me, at the same time, certain pieces of furniture to which long habit had associated an idea of value in the mind of Aurora; this was the least difficult part of my enterprise. The merchant who had given me so satisfactory an account of Aurora, was a man generally esteemed. It struck me that I might choose him for my confidant, and advise with him what plan I should pursue. I knew that his name alone was sufficient to smooth every obstacle in my path. He was in possession of a beautiful pavilion on the banks of the Rhone. I requested an interview in the most solitary walk of his grounds, and having obtained his promise of inviolable secrecy, "You have hitherto," said I, "'seen in your friend a merchant, who, still young, owes to his talents and his probity an affluent and honorable position. It has been my fate to appear in a mask to the eyes of those whose esteem I most value. I have deceived my mistress, let me no longer impose upon my friend. You have spoken to me of Aurora in a manner the most favorable; you know the half of her history, - hear the remainder. You see before you the unfortunate bellows-mender, chosen by a set of young wags as the instrument of their vengeance." At this unexpected declaration, my friend started back with sur- prise. It was easy for me to read on his countenance the sensations which agitated his mind. "I am indebted," continued I, "to nature for some talents, which I have improved by self-education and study; the generosity of my employers and fortune have done the rest. I am, as you know, about to leave Lyons; but I am firmly decided not to depart with- out Aurora. You enjoy the esteem and confidence of the public; you will be the mediator of your friend with her, and I shall owe my happiness to your intervention." The banker, when he recovered from his astonishment, assured   THE BELLOWS-MENDER     OF LYONS.     81 me that he had no doubt of effecting the reconciliation I so ardently desired. "The abbess of the convent where Aurora resides," said he, "honors me with a certain degree of friendship; it is not late, we are near Lyons, let us order horses and we shall soon be able to arrange with Aurora herself the points which seem to you, at pres- ent, so embarrassing." I adopted this project with fond avidity. I was, now no less eager for an interview than I had once been anxious to avoid it. I thirsted with impatience to gaze upon Aurora and my child. The merchant was announced at the convent under his real name, and myself as the principal of a great commercial house at Paris. We were admitted. Ah, what a picture presented itself to my view! Aurora, the enchanting Aurora, in all the pride of a beauty of twenty-three years of age, occupied a seat near the venerable abbess. A lovely child slept upon her knees, and seemed so en- tirely to absorb all the attention of its mother, that she scarcely thought of returning the usual salutations. The first instant that she threw her eyes on me, I remarked distinctly, from her involun. tary starting, that my presence recalled some disagreeable idea; but introduced by a man whom she well knew, and who was honored with general esteem, and presented as the principal of a commercial house in Paris, those circumstances, together with the shade of twi- light, so completely set all conjectures at fault, that Aurora was far from recollecting her husband in the stranger. My friend opened the conversation by some vague observations; spoke of my speedy departure for Paris, mentioned my having connections with all the great houses of the capital, and requested to know if the abbess had any orders with which to honor me. While this conversation passed, the infant awoke, and the sight of strangers, instead of surprising him, led him to smile. After having looked at us both with a kind of hesitation, it was towards me that he advanced. Imagine my feeling when I found myself covered with the sweet caresses, the innocent kisses of my child! An emotion which I had no power to subdue, made me eagerly No. 2.  ,   6  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6536-00000043"/> 82          GOOD STORIES. seize him in my arms, and throwing myself with him at the feet of my pale and trembling wife,- "Aurora! Aurora!"I exclaimed, "your child, your child claims from you a father! Will you suffer affection forever to be van- quished by pride?' While I uttered these words, in a voice half choked by emotion, Aurora quivered, seemed ready to faint, and fixed her wandering eyes alternately on me, and on her child, who clung to her knees and seemed to implore forgiveness for his father. At length a tor- rent of tears bathed Aurora's face. The child, unable to compre- hend why his mother wept, joined his plaintive cries to mine. ("Pardon! pardon!"I exclaimed. Aurora's only answer was to throw herself into my arms. I know not," she sobbed," whether you again deceive me, but your child pleads too powerfully. Aurora is yours." She pressed me against her palpitating heart. We were unable for a long time to speak. - Our uncontrollable emotion, the caresses of the child, the tears of my friend, the place itself, everything served to add to our delirium. "My children," said the abbess, looking at us with an eye moist- ened by affection, " you have both performed your duty. Monsieur is too much- affected to be a knave; Aurora has too much the heart of a mother to live any longer the victim of foolish pride. May this marriage, which you solemnly renew in my presence, be more lasting than the first. May you enjoy that lasting felicity which belongs only to virtue!" These words, pronounced in a serious tone of voice, calmed our turbulent sensations. I related my history in its full extent, with- out sparing the confession of my faults, and the feelings of my re- morse. I failed not to remark with transport that the hand of Au- rora often pressed mine while I spoke of my projects of tenderness, although she testified neither pleasure nor pain when I mentioned the fortunate situation of my affairs. The part of my narration which most affected her was that which regarded the payment of her father's debts, and my attention to her feelings in saving from   THE BELLOWS-MENDER OF LYONS.          83 the hands of the creditors the pieces of furniture to which she hlad been accustomed from her infancy. My friend celebrated our conjugalreconciliation by afete. Near his pavilion stood a house delightfully situate, and which the heirs of the proprietor, who had lately died, had announced their inten- tion of -selling. A word which involuntarily escaped Aurora dis- covered to me that this acquisition would be agreeable to her. I made the purchase in her name, and twenty-four hours after I put into her hands the papers which left it entirely at her own disposal. I returned with Aurora and our child to Paris. Whether from some remains of her former haughtiness, or from real greatness of mind, she expressed no surprise at finding herself mistress of a house decorated with the utmost taste and magnificence. I found her Character much ameliorated by adversity. I found myself be- loved by her who was now the object of my affection. One bappv year had elapsed when Aurora entered my cabinet, her eyes sparkling with joy. "My dear," said she, " you will not refuse the invitation of your wife. I  wish to give you a dinner in my house at Lyons. No ob- jection! This very morning I am  goin' to set olf with mS1 walk to teach him how a- son ou ht to do his father the honors of = his house."i I  did not fail to arrive at Lyons at the appointed time.

WAS sitting in my office, near the Stock Exchange, rather late one afternoon, when, happening to look over the wire blind which covers the lower portion of the window, and conceals my clerk and myself fromt the public eye, my attention was drawn to the figure of a gentleman coming along the street at a rapid pace, who, after passing the window, began hurriedly to ascend the steps in front of my street door, apparently with the intention of paying me a visit. Arrived at the top of the steps, I of course lost sight of him, owing to the thickness of the wall of the house; but I could see, first, half of a very much splashed right boot, and then the same amount of a similarly decorated left one, being put through such a cleansing process as the invention of a scraper affords' facili- ties for. Naturally, as a man of business, not wishing to be found looking out of window, I went back to my desk to be ready to receive my visitor. I waited some -time, and then, as nobody appeared in the office, returned to my post of observation just in time to catch another glimpse of the individual I had before noticed, who was tow de- scending the steps as rapidly as he had come up them, and who, on arriving at the bottom, proceeded to set off down the street at a rapid pace. He had not gone fifteen yards, however, before he slackened his rate of walking, and then, stopping altogether, seemed inclined to turn back. He stood for some little time, looking first up the street, and then down it, leaning upon an unfurled umbrella which was in his left hand, and smoothing his chin with the finger and thumb of his right, drawing it towards a point, as if he wished, by making that feature a little sharper, to give it somewhat more  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6536-00000046"/> of character, which it certainly would have borne. After standing thus for a moment or two, and happening in one of his eye-excur- sions to catch me looking at him, he turned suddenly back, and :apparently feeling himself now committed to a course, came vers rapidly up the steps' and into the office without any further delays. He was' a thin, large-eyed, light-haired man, with a vacillating and uncertain-looking mouth, and a wandering eye. His loosely- tied neckeloth displaying more of the mechanism of that part of the shirt which encircles the neck than is usually shown, and discover- ing a wonderful number of buttons, apparently placed in their present position with a view of meeting the exigencies of various forms of false collar. It was a muddy'day, as has been already hinted, and one leg of his trousers was turned up round the ankle, while the other remained in its normal condition, a prey to splashes. His coat-collar was half up and half down, and one of his thread gloves was off, while the other was partly drawn on, but not enclos- ing- the thumb. Such was the person who, entering my office, remained standi g close to the door of the room while he explained his business, and seeming very much inclined to take the first opportuitoy which might-offer of running away as fast as his legs would carry him. "He had called," he said, "to makre some inquiries about an investment which he had been given to understand I had the dis- posal of,-not that he felt at all sure of adopting it. Perhaps, that be"ng so, he ought not to have come in,  and yet le thought he should like to know one or two particulars about the speculation. Perhaps, though, it would be giving me useless trouble, -yes, he really thought it was absurd to trouble me, he would call again when he had thought it over a little more." He was actually nearly out of the office before I could make hims understand that I should be most happy to give Mim the informa- tion he required, whether it-resulted in his employing me or not. Upon hearing this, my new acquaintance advanced so far towards domesticating himself in my office, as to go and place his umbrella in-the .umbrella-stand, under the map of that estate in Somerset- 1   1I' 11; I  AiA ,L GH A.1 X1 PV A A l]l I, 6X, J. JLIJ^ LYI OJAUuiJlT- JL'jlVLLj Q'f1 shire which hangs against one of the walls of- my room. Then, seeming to think that by this proceeding he was committing himself to a course of conduct which might have dangerous results, he turned back when he had got half across the room, and took pos- session of the umbrella again, befoge the little pool of water, which (as it had a short time before been raining very hard) ran, from it freely, was any size at all. One would have- thought that he would have had enough to occupy his hands with in keeping possession of this useful imple- ment, and a- large and loosely-packed parcel, tied up in a newspaper, which he retained under his arm, and yet he managed to find fingers enough wherewith to engage from time to time in a sharp struggle to drag certain scattered scraps of whisker towards the corner of his mouth, appearing to be wholly absorbed in his desire to chew these dainty morsels when he ought to have been listening to my account of the different advantages possessed by the investment which was the subject of his inquiries. A wild stare of the eyes into vacancy, it may commonly be remarked, is by no means a sign of fixity of attention, and it is generally less so still when it is accompanied in the listener by a bowing action of the head, softly keeping time to all the periods of the narration which is going on. So, having noted these symptoms in my gentleman, I was the less surprised when I found from his questions that my statement of particulars had been but imperfectly attended to, and that the major portion of them had to be gone over again. As soon as any advantage about the speculation was mentioned, this gentleman, whose name was Smallchange, thought it would just do; but directly he, had himself suggested some attraction which it wanted, and which it would have been very extraordinary if it had possessed, he desponded, and thought it would not. He brightened up amazingly, upon my mentioning that he could always sell again, and appeared to consider this a great point indeed, saying he thought that had settled him about it. But, suddenly remembering that Mrs. Smallchange ouoght to be consulted upon  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6536-00000047"/> -88      -   GOOD STORIES. the subject, he appeared to become all unsettled again, and asked if he might suspend his decision till her opinion had been obtained. As I assented to this, he seemed inclined to go off at once and see her about it, and had actually almost effected a start, when it occurred to him to ask a questiqo or two about the general state of the market. These being satisfactorily answered, he got a little way again towards the door, but returned immediately to inquire whether I didn't think that perhaps, upon the whole, he had better invest at once, without saying anything to Mrs. S. about it. Then, upon my replying to this extraordinary question that he must be a better judge of that than I could be, he said, yes,- he supposed he was; but really he did not know what to do. At last I offered to keep the refusal for him, if he wished it, till the next day; upon which he seemed so happy at being able to put off the task of de- ciding till then, that I felt quite a load off my own mind at seeing him so much relieved. He only came back three times after that, - once to ask if he might leave his parcel in my office till he called the next day. Then, on my consenting to this, he returned to know whether I thought it would rain any more, because if I was of opinion it would n't, he would ask permission to leave his umbrella along with the parcel. This, as I pronounced that I thought it was going to be fine, he proceeded to do, but came back again in a minute or two to fetch it, saying that he was sorry to differ with me, but he thought I was mistaken about the weather, and that it would most certainly rain. With this he departed, though I saw him afterwards-through the glass-door - revolving upon the top of the steps in an agony of indecision whether he should return again or no, and I think if it had not been time for the office to close he-would never have got away at all. I have only to add to this description of my first interview with Mr. Smallchange, an announcement of the fact that by an extraordi- nary coincidence, Mrs. Smallchange turned out to be, on the whole, though quite unaware of the fact, rather more irresolute and inca- pable of seeing what was the right thing to do, than her husband. I became acquainted with this excellent lady through a circumstance   THE SMALLCHANGE F'AMLY.          89 highly characteristic of that unpunctuality which formed an impor- tant ingredient in her husband's nature. Mr. Smallchange wrote to ask me to call upon him on the subject of the investment at a certain hour. Having made this appointment, it was only part of my clients character to be out of the way, as a matter of course, at the time on which he had originally decided to receive me. The first person I saw, on entering the house, was Mrs. Smallchange. "You have called about the investment, Mr. :Kershaw?" said the lady. "Mr. Smallchange has just stepped out. The fact is, he can't quite make up his mind about anything. We are always moving and always changing servants, - always living in houses to let, with people going over them when we are at our meals, or Mr. Smallchange shaving. Mr. S. never knows his own mind,-never knows whether he ought to do a thing or not till he 's done it, and then always finds he ought not. Five moves in two years! Eleven housemaids in the same short time, and twenty-two cooks, and only one out of the number who could send up a dinner. - Well, Jane, what is it?" This was addressed to a lady, who, from a certain flushed irrita- bility of aspect, gave me the impression of being a member of the profession just alluded to, and who, entering the room at this moment, appeared to be waiting eagerly for an opportunity of cutting in, in the conversation. "If you please, mem," said the person, "'ave you tnade up your mind about the dinner?" "No, Jane ; I can't speak to you just now." l If you please, mem, the time is getting on, and if the dinner is late it will be no fault of mine." "Very well, then, we'll have the veal cutlets." With this the artist appeared satisfied, and commenced-a some- what hasty retreat, as if with a propheticdread of being called back again. If she had any such foreboding, it certainly proved to be tolerably well grounded. "Stop, Jane, said lMrs. Smallchange, as that functionary was about to close the door, - stop! your master does n't like veal."  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6536-00000048"/> 90          GOOD STORIES. The artist remained at the door, holding it in her hand, and wear- ing an expression of countenance which boded no good. It was a combination of aggression and pronounced patience, with a dogged unsuggestiveness. She was evidently expected to offer a little kindly advice as to what had better be done, and was equally evi- dently determined to do nothing of the kind. So she remained silent, holding the door, as I have said, in her hand, and looking up - people always look upwards when they intend to be offensively resigned-at the highest discernible bricks of the house on the opposite side of the street. "I 'm sure I don't know what we'd better have," said poor Mrs. Smallchange, in a tone that would have melted ally breast but a cook's. The artist slightly lowered her head, and, raising her eyes at the same time, managing by these means to get a higher row of bricks within range. Having succeeded in this, her resignation and pa- tience were a sight to behold. She also slightly creaked the door. "Well, I suppose," said Mrs. Smallchange, desperately, " we must have a haricot of mutton." It was a well-conceived and well-executed plan of insult on the part of our artist, that, when this order was given, she did not stir or alter her position. It said so plainly, "What s the use of my attempting to go; you know youll call me back again before the door is shut." " And yet I don't know," resumed Mrs. Smallchange, " the worst of haricot mutton is that it always gives me the hearthurn. I think it 'sowing to the bits of turnip.' Here was an opportunity for any woman but a cook to have sug- gested, " should she try a haricot without turnips." Our artist was, however, far too much absorbed in the study of the habits of the sparrow (a specimen of which tribe was now touching up his feathers upon the sill of one of the upper windows of the opposite building) to put forward this or indeed any other elucidation of the difficulty. At length this view of the case seemed to present itself to the distracted mind of Mrs. Smallchange, who thereupon proceeded - to deliver herself as follows :   THE SAIALLCITANGE    P1 3IIL.  " Suppose we were to try a hraiicot without turnips, cook." No answer from that functionary, with the exception of an offensively patient smile. (0 Mrs. Smallchan,,e went on, "And yet I don't know that that would be of any use, for I rather suspect that it 's the grease that makes it disagree with one." This proved an unfortunate remark, and the change on the part of the cef de cutstne, who, from wearing an appearance of patience which gave her a false air of Griselda, suddenly appeared in the character of a much injured bbut little enduring and retortive Fury, was both remarkable, -and to any one who had been less expects ant of it than I was, instructive. -"Grease," with a short laugh'-"grease; well, it was the first time sjhe'd ever heard of greas n her cooking, which Mr. Swal- lowfat, a true gentleman, at her very last place, he sent down 'ord to say as never in his life had he seen cooking free from grease like hers. And Mrs. Sparerib, which grease and fat was good for her by the doctor's orders, being in a fast decline, would hask her often saying, 'Your dishes, Jane, is hall so free from fat that I shall never get no flesh on my bones with you for cook I knows,'-but what's the use of talking to them as does n't k now their own opin- ions, and much less how a dinner should come up. Why had she ever come amon  g such people, with Mr. Swallowfat a begging her to stay, and Mrs. Sparerib in strong hysterics when she left, she might have know'd that them as could n't keep a cook a month was not the masters or the missuses as she could live witl,-no." "There now," said poor Mrs. Smallehange, as the infuriate artist made her exit at the conclusion of this remarkable speech, and banged the door behind her, " that 's a specimen of how  I'm served continually." I expressedm sympathy as well as I could, and promised, if I heard of a good cook, to send her without delay to Mrs. Small- change. That lady then, with   a happy versatility of mind which was one of the characteristics of her disposition, appeared to forget entirely the unpleasant scene which  had j est s taken place, and turned at once to something else.  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6536-00000049"/> JLI The investment that could not be settled, and the servants that could not be kept, were not the only domestic questions on which Air. and Mrs. Smallchange found a difficulty in deciding. They had more room in their house than they wanted; and doubts had beset them, for months past, as to the propriety of increasing their income, and their family circle, by taking in a lodger. Having shown myself so politely anxious to be of use in the matter of the cook, I was now applied to on the subject of this new perplexity. ition Anxiety to escape as fast as possible from my unexpected position of family adviser, led me to give my opinion positively, without an instant's consideration, in favor of letting the spare apartments in the house,- to- a single gentleman, of course. Profoundly impressed by the instantaneous character of my decision, Mrs. -Smallchange agreed with me on the spot. A single gentleman,- yes, that would be the very thing--she wondered she had not thought of it before. And she was so enamored with the idea? that the housemaid was sent to a neighboring stationer's, and before l Twas out of the house, a card, with an announcement of Furnished Apartments, was put up in the window. The ultimate results of this proceeding were, it must be acknowl- edged, as remarkable as they were characteristic. The single gentleman, to secure whom was the object of Mrs. Smallchange's ambition, as it is of all matrons who havre lodgings to let, turned up almost as soon as he was required, and proved a most unexceptionable and desirable specimen of his class. Punctual, middle-aged, precise, and methodical in all his habits, and rigidly exact in his payments. He might be a little irritable and fussy perhaps, at times, but we all have our faults. Then, -bless him, -he had that wonderful advantage that he was not too much at home. His situation as clerk in the office of a Canal Company involving a daily absence from home of eight hours' duration, as the clock struck nine he left the house in the morning, and at the moment when the hands pointed on the dial to five in the afternoon, - his knock -- none of your latch-key lodgers this - was heard at the door. When it has been further stated that Mr. Pluffers, for that   was his name, was short and comfortable in figure, and scrupulously neat in his attire, enough has been said in. description of this model lodger. NTow it will doubtless be asked how it was that a person, so precise and particular in his ways as this gentleman, was contented to remain in an establishment which one would be prepared to believe would be so ill-conducted as that of our friend Mdrs. Small- change. And this does at first sight appear a puzzling question, though the solution is in reality a simple one enough. How is it that you, my young friend, who are now engaged in reading these annals of the undecided, how is it, I ask, that you, who cannot stand long stories, go every evening and sit' (an example of respectful attention) listening to the protracted narrations which emanate from the lips of that outrageous old bore, Longyarn? Or you, sir, who are old enough to know better, and are so good a judge of music that you will not allow your dear sisters to sing in your presence because they are not of the force of Madame Alboni, or M1ademoi- selle Piccolomini, how is it that you are content to spend night after night in raptures under the performance of the elder Miss Tym- panum, who startles the echoes with an organ like that of a pea-hen, and a perception of tune such as might be found in the asylum for the incurably deaf? What is the reason of these things, I ask? Is it not because, in the first instance I have mentioned, the niece of Longyarn, who takes charge of the old boy's household, has soft dark eyes and wavy hair, and a complexion like a rose, only prettier, and in the second, because the youngest Miss Tym- panum, Fanny by name, has been endowed by nature with a tight and buxom figure, and is as comely a little body, from the topmost hair on the crown of her head to the extreme tip of her uncommon- ly pretty foot, as you will meet with between Berwick-upon-Tweed and the Lizard Point in Cornwall? Is it not, in a word, because you are in love? Well, and Mr. Pluffers was in love, - and with Miss Anna Smallchange. Anna Smallchange, the eldest daughter of our undecided couple,  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6536-00000050"/> "          GOOD STfORIES. was just eighteen, and certainly, as far as personal qualifications went, amply justified the admiration which her elderly lover be- stowed upon her. She inherited the family indecision, however, and with it a certain insouciance which, while it kept her perfectly happy under any circumstances in which she might be placed, and caused her to acquiesce in everything that was proposed to her, rendered it extremely unlikely that she wsould respond very ardently to the passion of Mr. Pluffers, or indeed of any other Mister that wore a head. Mr. Pluffers was in love, then, - and it was because Mr. Pluffers was in love, that he endured, as he did, the trying eccentricities which occasionally showed themselves in his landlady's conduct. Thus, when, as would happen sometimes, Mrs. Smallchange had so engaged the servants in executing- I was going to say-her orders, but,.on reflection, her counter orders appears a fitter term, - when the servants had been so completely occupied all the morn- ing in not fulfilling their directions, that Mr. Pluffers came down to breakfast and found neither fire nor tea-things prepared, -the expected storm might, I say, at such times, be always averted by the simple process of sending Miss Anna .up stairs with the break- fast things. Upon which occasion she would arrange them with such a winning gracefulness, and, dropping down upon her knees, and putting on a pair of gloves and an apron, would insist upon lighting the fire herself, with such a mutinous and pleasant air, that other fires were lit besides that within the grate, and the heart of Mr. Pluffers, well fortified, as one would have expected, by years, obesity, and business habits, was so completely reached by Miss Anna's charms, that, though mentally resolving that the first step in his married life should be to step out of his present place of abode, he yet determined that hle would not leave Mrs. Smallchange's roof alone.  And so, one morning, when Miss Anna dropped on her knees before the fire, it happened that Mr. Pluffers might have been observed-had anybody been present besides the cat-to drop upon his knees before Miss Anna, and then and there to make her an offer of his hand and heart.   IZ     THE SM1ALLCHANGE FAAILY.           95 "I 'm sure I don't know, Mr. Pluffers," said the young lady, as the excellent gentleman, having captured one of her hands, pro- ceeded to kiss the somewhat coally glove which encased it, and which in his rapture he was too agitated to perceive; "Im sure I don't know - lor! what a smudge you ve got upon your nose, - here, let me wipe it off with my apron --I 'm sure I don't know, but I 'll speak to Maamma about it." Well, Mamma was spoken to about it, and Papa, too, and cer- tainly if Miss Smallchange was uncertain what to say about it, it was quite clear that both Mr. and Mrs. S. were still more com- pletely incapable of forming an opinion on the subject. So that when Mr, Pluffers returned from his place of business,-where he I had made so many mistakes that the head official had remarked to one of the shareholders that Pluffers was getting old, he found that, so far from his fate being finally decided, things were very much where he had left them in the morning. It was then that that remarkable series of letters, known so widely (in the polite circles) as the Pluffers correspondence, com- menced.   It begins with a note from Mr. Pluffers, who, unable to touch food in his present condition of suspense, writes as follows:- No. 1.] STREET, First-floor, April 31st, 18-. "Mr. Pluffers presents his compliments to Mr. Smallchange, and begs  to be informed, per present messenger, whether Mr. and Mrs. S. have come to any decision upon a subject nearly concerning Mr. P.'s peace of mind." [No. 2.] "-- STREET, Parlors, April 31st, 18-. "Mrs. Smallchange has been in consultation with Mr. Smallchange,. upon the subject mentioned in Mr; Pluffers's letter, all day, but they are  unable, at present, to give a final"answer." [No. 3.] -"STREET, First-flool, April 31st, 18-. "Mr. Pluffers begs to acknowledge Mrs. Smallchange's favor of the 31st instant, and respectfully to inquire the grounds of her unwillingness,  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6536-00000051"/> 96           GOOD  STORIES. and that of Mr. S., to give Mr. P. an answer at once. Do they consider Mr. P.'s means insufficient?" [No. 4.] " STREET, Parlors, April 31st, 18-. "Mrs. Smallchange is not actuated, nor is Mr. S., by pecuniary consid- erations. Mrs. Smallchange will give her daughter to any man who will fondly cherish her." INo. 5.] "- -STREET, First-floor, April 31st, 18-. "Mr. Pluffers acknowledges Mrs. Smallchange's second favor of the 31st instant, and begs to intimate, in reply, that he is prepared fondly to cherish Miss Smallchange. He therefore hopes for an early and favor- able answer to his application. Mr. P. also begs to inform Mrs. S. that he has not tasted food since the morning, nor will he do so till an answer in some degree final has reached him on asubject nearly concerning- as mentioned in first letter - Mr. P.'s peace of mind." [No. 6.] -STREET, Parlors, April 31st, 18-. "Mrs. Smallchange is of opinion, and so is Mr. S., that Mr. Pluffers's last letter is, in many respects, a satisfactory one; and Mrs. S. strongly recommends him to get some dinner immediately, as she can give Mr. P. no more conclusive answer than this just at present." With this reply, which somewhat raises his hopes, Mr. Pluffers is obliged to be, for the present, satisfied, and proceeds to swallow as much tepid Irish-stew as he can conveniently get down. Some idea may be formed from the letters which we have quoted above of the nature of Mr. Pluffers's courtship.  Two or three times a day his fate was altered; and, as Miss Anna was perfectly passive in the matter, and declined to interfere with her destiny, it seems probable that if Mrs. Smallchange had not been goaded into decision at last by the superior indecision of Mr. S., the wedding- day would never have been fixed at all. Mr. and Mrs. Smallchange were sitting in their parlor on the eve of the day which it had been settled should at last put a period to the sufferings of the unfortunate Mr. Pluffers. They had had a leg of mutton for dinner which had been half boiled and half   THE   SMA LL CHA NGE  FAML Y.     97 roasted, being indebted for this singular form of cookery (which caused the twenty-third cook to give,instant warning) to doubts which had arisen in Mrs. Smnallchange's mind as to the best mode of preparing the joint in question,- doubts which had resulted in favor of the roasting process, only, unhappily, when the mutton had been some hour and a half in the boiling water. They were sitting there, and digesting this cheerful meal as rapidly as might be, when the following startling conversation took place:- "My dear," said Mr. Smallchange, "is this wedding really to take place? "Well, I suppose it must, now, Mr. Smallchange," replied the lady. Here there was a short pause, and Miss Anna, who was making wedding-favors, loolked up for a moment and then went on with her task. "My dear," Mr. Smallchange recommenced, "I am not at all sure that I like this match. Isn't Mr. Pluffers much older than Anna?" "Why, of course he is," said Mrs. Smallchange. "Have you only just discovered that?" (Mr. Pluffers was fifty-five if he was a day.) "It never struck me before," said Mr. Smallchange, meditatively. "Well, you know that will never do. Can't anything be done to stop it?" "Why, how CAN anything be done now?" replied Mrs. S., "all the preparations are made, and the people invited for to-morrow. "And the thing must really go on, then?" asked Mr. Small- change, helplessly.  "Not if you disapprove of it, Mr. Smallchange," replied the lady. The chronic indecision was beginning to work in HER now. "Not 4 if you disapprove of it." "O! it is n't exactly that I disapprove of it, you know," Mr. Slmallchange answered; "I should be very sorry to say that I disapproved of it." 'Whether you say it or not, I am quite sure that you do No. 2.     7  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6536-00000052"/> 98 G'GOOD STORIES. -disapprove of it," said Mrs. Smallchange, " and under those circum- stances, I cannot but feel that it is my duty-averse as lam to un-  settle what has once been decided on -to put a stop to this 11-   A sorted union.  O, dear me! continued the good lady, plaintively,  "why did we ever go and decide that such a wedding should take  place?" "O dear me!" echoed Mr. Smallchange.  "At all events," said Mrs. Smallchange, valorously, "I am deter-  mined that it shall not come off to-morrow."           - At this moment Miss Anna, having just completed a favor, pro-  ceeded to place it in the basket along with the others, and taking a  new supply of ribbon, began to make a fresh one.          "My dear," said her excellent mamma, perceiving this, you    X need n't make any more favors."  "Very well, mamma,' replied the young lady, cheerfully.  "Have you not heard," continued Mrs. Smallchange, " that your i papa and I have decided that the wedding is not to take place?" j "Yes, mamma."                         j "Then why, my dear, do you go on with the favors?"  "Because, mamma, I thou(ght perhaps you might alter your  minds about it." "No, Anna, no; I never alter MY mind. Mr. Smallchange does,  it is true; but tell me, my child, I suppose YOU have no objection  to this change of affairs?"                    "O no, mamma," replied this dutiful girl; "but what's to be- come of the favors, and my wedding-dress, and the breakfast which  is all prepared?" L Why, my dear," replied Mrs. Smallchange, " with regard to  the favors and the dress, there's no telling how soon you may want them' yet, and they will keep well enough; and as to the breakfast, as the things are all cold, I think it would be a very nice plan to pack them up in a hamper, and go and have a picnic, to-morrow, at Hampton Court." "Or Richmond," suggested Mr. Smallchange. ' Yes; or Kew," said Mrs. Smallchange.   THE SLMALLCHANGE FAAII -Y.        99 6 Or, perhaps, Chisw -"? "At all events," interrupted Mrs. Smallchange, "  we 'll go some- where, and then we shall be out of the way; and the carriage which was to have taken us to church will just do; and then Mr. Pluffers will have time to cool down a little before we meet; and the people who are asked to the breakfast must be told when they come that unavoidable circumstances - yes, that's the expression -have cornm pelled us to postpone the marriage, and so," continued this excellent lady, quite in spirits at a reprieve from the necessity of taking so decided a step as had been contemplated on the morrow; "and so we shall have time to think what is to be done next." "Poor Mr. Pluffers," said pretty Miss Anna, complacently, "what will he say when he hears of'all this?" "At all events," said Mrs. Smallchange, as she lit her bedroom candle r at all events, - we 'll sleep upon it." Now Mr. Pluffers, upon the wedding-day being settled, had, as a matter of etiquette, been incontinently hustled out of the house; and, upon the eve of the day in question, especially, had been forbidden to show his nose on any pretence whatsoever. A practice which, I am told, must ever be observed on such occasions, on pain of an in- fringement of all the canons of decency and propriety. It happened, therefore, that the excellent gentleman was all this time in happy ignorance of the changes which were going on in his destiny, and spent the evening in trying to get on a pair of white gloves which were several sizes too small for him, and in learning the whole of the marriage service (the clergyrfian's part included) by heart. The next morning, Mr. and Mrs. Smallchange, manifesting a most unusual decision of character, perhaps because it was exercised in carrying out an act of INdecision, found themselves still bent upon putting a stop to the wedding. So, when the coach which had been hired to convey the whole party to church, where they w'ere to meet the bridegroom, arrived, the hamper was hoisted in, and closely followed by the whole of the Smallchange family. And the last thing that was seen of them that day by my informant (cook num- ber twenty-four) was at the corner of the street, where every mem-  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6536-00000053"/> 100         GOOD STORIES. ber of the family -including the youngest child, who might be about three years old - leant out of the window in turns, to give the coachman contrary directions. The methodical Mr. Pluffers was at the church punctually at fif- teen minutes past eleven, which was the appointed hour. Here he remained till ten minutes to twelve, passing the time in polite but incoherent conversation with the clergyman and clerk, and in reading from beginning to end the epitaphs on the different monumental tablets with which the walls of the edifice were decorated. It is indeed doubtful in the last degree whetherth hese mural biographies conveyed ally very distinct idea to his distracted mind beyond a vague and general feeling of wonder as to how it happened that, though all people who die are possessed of the whole of the cardinal  virtues, and every quality calculated to make them unexceptionable members of society, and faultless in all the relations of life, there yet  happen to be here and there one or two very unpleasant people in the world. At ten minutes to twelve, it being evident that something must  have lappened, Mr. Pluffers left the church and rushed with deliri-  ous haste to the abode of the faithless Miss Anna. But to tell of :J the effect upon this injured gentleman of the disappearance of the  bride, and upon the invited guests of the disappearance of the  breakfast, would be to harrow unnecessarily the feelings of the read-  er, who yet, if he insists upon having his sensibilities thus lacerated,  is hereby referred for a more powerful description of such a scene  than the present writer could furnish, to any one of those paragraphs - which appear (during the autumn season of the year) in the differ-  ent provincial newspapers, and which are usually headed, Singular  Scene at a Wedding.  Whether the excellent Mr. Pluffers was ultimately made happy  by the possession of Miss Anna's hand, I am unable to affirm with  certainty, but rumors have reached me to the effect that one morn-  ing, after it had been definitely and finally settled overnight by Mr. and Mrs. Smallchange, that they never would or could part with   THE SMALLCII4NGE FAMLY.         101 their eldest daughter during the term of their natural lives, -I have heard it vaguely rumored, I say, that the next morning the whole party adjourned to the parish church, and that, at the conclu- sion of the ceremony which converted Miss Anna Smallchange into Mrs. Pluffers, and during wlich Mr. Pluffers had, from his accurate knowledge of the service, caused considerable confusion by putting his oar in in parts of the ritual in which the voice of the officiating clergyman ought alone to have been heard,-it was at the conclu- sion of the ceremony, that Mr. Smallchange was heard to whisper to Mrs. Smallchange as they left the building: "I suppose nothing could be done to stop it now?"  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6536-00000054"/> T02          GOOD STORIES.  THE SCOTSMAN'S TALE. CLAUDINE. 1,. "So shall I court thy dearest truth,  When beauty can no more engage: So, thinking of thy charming youth, I 'II love it o'er again in age." PRIOR. A MAN may travel a good many miles without meeting with an adventure. Nay, if he be a man of business the chances are ten to one that he may never meet with such a thing at all; except, indeed, it be a bankruptcy or a broken bone. The latter was near  falling to my lot as I was travelling at my ease at the pleasant pace of about three miles an hour, in a commodious carriage composed, I apprehend, of a certain number of planks clumsily put together by some clumsy joiner, and supported by two crazy wheels. This post-wagon, as it was termed, drawn by horses, one of which was blind and the other lame, seemed, at the rate we drove, to require  some ingenuity to overset it. That business, however, was accom-  plished. I was picked up in no condition to thank my benefactors, as the blood flowed plentifully from a wound in my head, which,  though it did not dispossess my brains, threw them at least into  such a state of disorder as required some hours of repose to set them  right. There are, indeed, certain of my acquaintance who affirm  that they never have been right from that time: but these are mere  calumniators. My disorder since has lain in my heart; and is,  therefore, of a nature which only the infected can judge of.  The moment I thoroughly recovered my senses I began to recon- noitre my situation. It was no bad one for a man who had been jumbled in such a conveyance as that Hhad quitted, could the ex- change have been effected with less hazard to my bones. I found   THE SCOTSMANYS TALE.          103 myself in a neat bed, furnished with white curtains. It-is to be ob- served that I always had a particular predilection for white curtains especially in foreign countries, for reasons unnecessary to detail. , My chief attendant was a respectable, middle-aged woman, who seemed most kindly officious in assisting my recovery: - but truth must be told; my gratitude was not sufficiently just to direct itself principally to her, for I saw at different times several other females pass and repass my chamber, some of whom were almost children, and the eldest of them not apparently above eighteen. They were X. all slight, blooming, and generally distinguished by the bright, polished skin and fair locks, approaching the golden, by which the lasses of the northern hemisphere are mostly to be known. As a Scotsman I ought to have admired this complexion beyond all others; but Scotsmen can sometimes be perverse: nay, though I know that the contrary has been maliciously asserted, they can even fail to be national. Among these pretty girls there was one then who appeared to me no less remarkable for the superiority of her charms than for the different character of her countenance. She had dark eyes, and curls of shining, black hair fell almost into them over her forehead; while the longer locks were twisted up in a sort of tress infinitely graceful. Her features, I am told, were not alto- gether perfect: but for my life I never could get further in the scrutiny than her eyes: yet they were ungrateful eyes, too 1! for they rarely, indeed hardly ever, would meet mine. But when they did -  O then - "The large black orbs, filled with a sprightly light, Shot forth a lively and illustrious night!" * From being over head and ears in the mire I was almost as quickly over head and ears in love.

Not I mean by any decided act of libertinism; for I found them sufficiently well educated and decorous in their habits to put that out of the question; but even by sullying the genuine purity of their minds with gross flattery or worldly address. My eyes and my heart, nevertheless, turned towards Claudine with that decid- ed preference which makes itself alike understood either in simple or sophisticated life.  Thus agreeably circumstanced, I took care not to recover from  the effects of my accident too hastily: nay, it is not at all clear to me when that recovery would have been perfected, had not an anxious letter from my father, who Was equally alarmed for tlhe health of his son and for some particular commercial concerns, roused me from my dream of idleness and felicity. I well knew, in fact, that I had no business in Sweden at all. I had been sent to St. Petersburg on an affair of consequence to my family, and nothingo but the levity and busy curiosity of two-and-twenty had led me out of my way, to explore copper-mines and herbalize upon mountains. The man who turns from his road at all, stands a chance of going much farther than he calculates: such was my case in every par- ticular; and how to get into it again, in truth, I hardly knew. My letters had been forwarded to me from Russia: should I say I had remained there, or should I acknowledge my wanderings? I chose to dissemble, and experience showed me I chose wrong. I sent to my correspondent at St. Petersburgcr such letters as I wished trans- mitted to England: I enjoined him faithfully to conceal my real abode, and I prepared to stay awhile longer with my host and his charming family. To this arrangement, however, I had, as it ap- peared, nobody's consent but my own: for the good man, who was a Lutheran priest,-frank, well-instructed, and a more strict ob- server than I supposed himn to be of the characters and feelings of those around, - no sooner discovered, by my despatching letters to St. Petersburg, that I did not intend yet to go thither, than the tone of my reception entirely changed. I shut my eyes, nevertheless, to this for several days, at the expiration of which time my host invited me to walk after breakfast with him bone morning in his   TIIE SCOTSMAN'S TALE.         105 garden. I had a disagreeable presentiment of what was to be the subject of our conversation, and I would, therefore, very willingly have declined it; but the thing was impossible. It was a fine, sunshiny day. Nothing could be more delightful than the scene. A balmy air just stirred the leaves of the flowers that were distributed around us ; and the dew, hot being yet exhaled, caused them to send forth that pure and exquisite fragrance which seems the immediate breath of heaven. The cottage of the pastor was situated in a wild and almost savage country, the rough fea- tures of which, softening as they approached, presented within its immediate precincts an-inmage of tranquillity everything seemed to realize. The sea, like a broad blue belt, skirted the distances ; and a good eye might even occasionally catch the outline of the larger vessels as they steered through the Gulf of Bothnia. With all this flowery description, however, which my recollection has since obtruded upon me, nobody could be further from relishing the beauties of nature than I was at that moment; at least such as then presented themselves to my eyes. To hear me, nevertheless, you would have concluded me an enthusiast. It was impossible to speak more fluently, or with more eloquence than I did upon them: I remember I was particularly inspired upon the subject of bees, of which my host had a large provision in his hives; and it was true that their soft, but busy murmur, really contributed in no small de- gree to the species of rustic voluptuousness his garden otherwise afforded. I was even enteringr into an exact inquiry concerning their domestic economy and regulations, when my companion inter- rupted me. "My good young Englishman," said he, -which, by the by, was a misnomer, for I was a North Briton, - "I perceive you are very ingenious in evading the question on which I wished to speak with you. But with your leave, I must be permitted to intrude it. It is evident that you are not disposed to quit us and I may tell you, without flattery, that I shall be no less sorry on my side to part with you. There is something of simplicity and nature in your character that pleases me. Unhappily, indeed, it is too natural; for  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6536-00000056"/> you have stumbled upon an old-fashioned error which the combina- tions of society have almost exploded. You are fallen in love, as  it is termed: that is, you have seen a pretty girl for whom you have a tender preference, and who indeed justifies it, as I believe her  mind to be no less innocent and charming than her person. But  have you considered what you are about? You are apparently a  very young man, - dependent, if I understand you rightly, on your y father: your country is at war with that of Claudine; and, were  it even otherwise, it is extremely improbable that your parents At should sanction your attachment to a young French emigree who has neither family nor establishment on which she can rely. I  know the English are a generous nation: but I also know human  nature to be, under various modifications, the same everywhere; f and I cannot, therefore, be of opinion that your choice will obtain  the sanction of your friends."  The discourse of the good man opened a new light upon me. I  spoke French fluently it must be owned; so too did all his family; j but I had a true British accent, and my ear had not been nice  enough, or my eyes had monopolized the power of my other senses, j to discover that Claudine was a native Frenchwoman. To my  worthy friend's harangue I could only observe in answer, "That young men seldom did consider what they were about when they fell in love, or they would possibly never do so at all. That I had, besides, been taken at an unfair advantage, since my senses were not my own at the time; and that I verily believed they never would be so again, unless I were happy enough to possess Claudine. That he was perfectly riaht with regard to my dependence on my father; but that I was blest with' the most affectionate parents in the world, who would not, I was persuaded, be tempted by any con- sideration to destroy the happiness of their son; and that, with respect to my future steps, it had been my intention maturely to consider before I ventured upon them." I did not pronounce the latter part of my discourse so emphati- cally, or with half so good a grace as the first: for my conscience told me that, to say the very best of it, it 'as but half true. Not,   s THE SCOTSMAN'S TALE.          107- certainly, that I suspected my parents of being willing to destroy my happiness; but till fathers and sons agree more exactly in what happiness consists, I am afraid the expression will always be a little equivocal between them. .My sincerity was even more ques- tionable in the concluding sentence; since, far from having resolved maturely to weigh my future steps, I had never looked into the future at all. My love was yet in its infancy; or rather in that progressive state of the passion when the present is all-sufficient to happiness; when the new and delightful sentiment is just awakened in the bosom, and has not yet given one .ingle jog to that long train of doubts, jealousies, desires, and disquietudes, which render it ever e afterwards so troublesome. My host, howevr badotee--t ness completely for me. From the very hour he and I talked together, I found that love was no such sport' of the fancy as I had hitherto imagined, and I began, indeed, to-/look to the future with an anxious eye.          / I presently discovered that the birth of Claudine was noble: this I was sorry for, because mine was not. Her story was simple, and, in fact, the history of thousands. She had lost her father, who had fallen a sacrifice to his political opinions, at a very early period of the French Revolution. Her mother, in escaping from France, had. been shipwrecked in lher voyage to St. Petersburg, and, from the consequences of fatigue and suffering, had soon after left Claudine an unprotected and impoverished orphan. Fo his I was no less sorry than for the circumstances of her birth; for I suspected that it would be my lot to be too opulent; and I began, like my good host, to doubt the concurrence of my family in the step I was meditat- ing. My calculations on this head have proved erroneous, however. It has not yet been my lot to be very rich, and it probably never will; but my mind is made to my fortune, and I do not envy those who boast a more splendid one. My first effort at thinking was not at all successful. I saw no point on which I could reasonably build; and I therefore grew fretful, - consequently fancied myself indisposed. I was indeed really ill for two or three days. My host perceived lit, and insen-  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6536-00000057"/> 108         GOOD STORIES.               I sibly relaxed the rigidity of his muscles. What was much better, Claudine perceived it too; and I had the exquisite happiness of be-  lieving that-I was not indifferent to her. Sweet, though transitory moments that enliven existence, how precious is your recollection to  a tender mind!  The first use I made of my returning health was to impart to Claudine the sentiments with which she inspired me; and I received j from that grateful and generous girl such a hearing as made an  indelible impression upon my heart. Claudine, however, was so  entirely the child of nature, and so wholly unskilled in the ways of the world, that to have consulted her upon those difficulties and i probable inconveniences which her reverend guardian had conjured  up to my imagination, would only have doubled them. She was, besides, not much more than seventeen, and had seen little beyond i her mother's house and the walls of a convent. I was, therefore, thrown entirely upon my own fund of sagacity and prudence: and, to say truth, when I consider with how small a principal I set out, I must confess myself, in the commercial phrase, to have made no bad speculation. I learned from Claudine that she had a brother who served in the army of the French princes, and whom her mother hoped to have joined at St. Petersburg. She had herself reason to suppose she might learn tidings of him at the court of the empress, although the obscure condition of the family with which she resided, and their distance from St. Petersburg had rendered the vague inquiries they had hitherto been able to make totally fruitless. The opportunity, it must be owned, was most tempting to a lover, -a poor fellow who saw himself constrained to depart with a heart half broken, and a head not quite healed. I weighed secretly with Claudine the possibility of prevailing on her reverend protector to suffer her to depart with me in search of her brother: it was plain that we were novices in the ways of the world, or such a plan could not possibly have entered the head of either; but among the few peculiarities that marked the dear girl's character (and she had none that were hnot graceful lnd becoming) was an anxious desire to be restored to nur9rtu 'UNur   THE SCOTSMANYS    TALE.      109 her family, and an opinion that she had no right to dispose of her self without the consent of this brother; who, being' by many years the elder, she had been taught by her mother to look up to as the arbiter of her fate. She had, besides, long felt that her continued residence in Sweden was a burden on her benefactor, whose scanty income ill allowed him to exercise the generous feelings of his heart; and Claudine, brought up in affluence, had not yet been able to image such a genuine picture of poverty as should incapacitate her brother from receiving or maintaining her. Alas! she little knew the condition of many of her countrymen. I was not myself much better informed on the subject; and, to say truth, had I even been so, I fear 1 should have preferred the delightful idea of having Claudine my companion at St. Petersburg to all the sober objections that reason could possibly have presented to me. We were not gone so far, however, in love or Arcadian simplicity as to conceive the idea of her accompanying me alone. Chance presented her a suitable protection in the society of a Swedish mer- chant and his family, to whom she was known, and who were to embark in the same vessel with myself. After much hesitation, then, I ventured to communicate our mutual wishes to my kind host. He looked extremely grave on the project, although I had dressed it up in colors as soberly simple as fancy and love would permit me. I found an auxiliary,however, where I did not expect one,- in the person of his wife; who, being a good economist, and a woman of no great expansion of mind in other particulars, was not, I believe, sorry to seize the opportunity of freeing herself from a person whom she conceived to be an encumbrance in her domestic arrangements. To be short, the lovely Claudine was committed to my protection, -but under the superintending eyes of a female Argus, who promised to watch carefully. over her. On, my part I faithfully swore either to place her in the care of her brother, or to make her my wife, at every hazard of circumstances, should she consent to become such without waiting his concurrence. In the- interim I en- gaged to lodge her in the house of my own correspondent at St.  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6536-00000058"/> lnO         GOOD STORIES.

The clear beauties of a northern hemisphere 'in summer ared only to be known by those who have witnessed them. The sun, hardly  setting left throudchout the whole night a gentle twilight, which,  illumined by the aurora borealis, presented new and innumerable charms both in the heavens and the ocean. The merehas family,  Claudine, and myself, often sat upon the deel during the greater part of these nigh tts; and her sweet voice, in unison with the voices of some other female passengers, would frequently chant a sort of national and simple music, so perfectly hYrmo .izin. with the scene before us as to fill the senses of every hearer with nearly equal delight. Never did the charming features of Claudine appear to more advantage than when seen by this soft and shadowy light. For my part, I almost wished my whole life was to be a voyage; and was truly sorry when we cast anchor in the harbor of Cronstadt. Here all was in contrast to the tranquillity we had been witnessing, and the bustle of trade and shipping would have driven away almost any sentiment less vigorous than love before the potent genius of gain. Our plans at St. Petersburg were, I quickly discovered, in no immediate way to be realized. The traces Claudine had of heir brother were so very imperfect, and so many chanes had taken place in the distribution of the French regiments there, that it was extremely difficult to pursue our inquiries concerning him. I con- tinued to make some, however; and, in the interim, I had now the   THE SCOTSlMAN'S TALE.         " double satisfaction of keeping in view the business my father had intrusted to me, and of enjoying daily the society of the woman I adored. Claudine, on her side, was anxiously employed in acquire ing the English language and accent; and such was the delicacy of her organs, or her ear, perhaps aided by the inspiring influence of her tutor, that I have never since heard it spoken by any foreigner with equal purity. Although I had fulfilled with the strictest fidelity every engagement into which I had entered concerning her, she was yet by no means satisfied with her situation. Not that it was any way objectionable on the score of propriety; for she had every protection and accommodation that could be demanded. She was, besides, embosomed in an affluent family, and had dress, pleasures, in short, all the advantages that affluence itself could bestow; but it was to me that she owed them, and the delicacy of her mind taught her daily to revolt more and more from the nature of the obligation. Vainly did I represent to her that she had received the same, at least in the proportion of worldly circumstances, from her former protectors, - that she was, in fact, my affianced wife, - and that all I could offer her would be only what she had a claim to. Young as she was, she felt the difference of the relative situations; and such was the soft and retiring propriety this consideration gave to her manners, that, though I complained, I could not but love her the better for it. But although Claudine was, on the whole, self-denying and dis- creet in the extreme, she was too gentle, young, and lovely, to be always proof against solicitation. I delighted in showing her beauty, and I, therefore, took every opportunity of leading her into such scenes of elegance as might display it to advantage. The approach of winter in the northern courts is the signal for a species of festiv- ity unknown in milder climates; and the amusement of driving en traineau is practised with a luxury and splendor that to a stranger is singularlyr dazzling. I was myself an expert performer that way, and, therefore, extremely ambitious of exhibiting at once my own talents and the charms of Claudine. She was, for a long time, averse to this proposal; I nevertheless extorted her consent, and I  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6536-00000059"/> provided an elegant traineau, in which I placed my fair charge. Nothing can exceed the brilliancy and gayety of this kind of diver- sion. Numberless carriages, fancifully ornamented, all in motion at once, and flying over the snow with the velocity of fairy cars, car- rying their beautiful enchantresses along with them, form a coup d' ail altogether delightful. Claudine was in high spirits; nor was I less elevated, though I cannot impute even to the giddiness of my pleasure any blame as to the accident that followed.      X We had already made our course, and were on the point of re- turning home, when a more numerous succession of carriages than before caused some slight apprehension from probable entangle- ments or embarrassment. Among the traineaus that lately entered was one guided by an officer; the lady who sat in it seemed, by the X splendor of her appearance, and the rich furs in which she was wrapped, to be of very considerable rank; and her conductor, with more zeal than skill, threatened destruction to every carriage that came within his vortex. Unfortunately mine happened to be of the  number. I remembered my last accident, and I was not willing to i try the thickness of my head a second time. I was, besides, anx- ious for Claudine's safety, and I therefore exerted my jockeyship in making over the danger to my antagonist. I was but too success- ful. We had a rude shock that threw us both into confusion. On his part the danger was imminent, and it was the chance of a mo- ment that both he and the lady with him did not suffer material ' injury. His resentment burst out into an intemperance of languaage  I was not at all disposed to endure. Our contention, therefore, soon amounted to little short of defiance on both sides. A general dis- order ensued; and such was the overbearing insolence of my adver- sary, that it would have been difficult to have foreseen the event v between us, had not a party of guards interposed, and put an end to the tumult. We were separated; and I was, by authority, en- joined to return home. Claudine, who had during this scene been ready to faint with fear, now drew great consolation from a circumstance which cer- tainly afforded me none,--that of my being put under arrest tinly ' 11ode e oe   THE SCOTSMAN'S TALKE.  within the house for several days. Her apprehensions for my per- sonal safety left her no sympathy for the i dignity to which I thought myself subjected. I was not so calm, though I found it necessary to seem so; and the first care of both, though for different reasons, was to inform ourselves of the name and rank of my antagonist. He was called, it appeared, the Count St. Victoire. Nothing more was necessary to assure Claudine that it was her brother. St. Victoire had quitted his country before the death of his father; he was, indeed, among the first of that ill-informed or ill-judging part of the nobility who sought safety or revenge in a foreign one. His sister was at that time a child, and immured within the walls of a convent. The duties of the service into which he had entered, as most of the young nobility of France were accustomed to do at a very early age, had not permitted him to be much at Paris; and she had, therefore, seen him so rarely that it was not at all surprising she did not recognize him, clothed as he was in furs, too, for the occasion, and under the circumstances of terror and agitation on her part in which they at length met. The alarm I experienced on this discovery was little short of that felt by Claudine herself. Of all men living her brother was, perhaps, the one I would most have wished to serve: he was cer- tainly the last I would willingly have offended. Yet I felt that, after what had passed, it would be difficult, to say the least, for either to conciliate the good-will of the other. There was something in the manners of St. Victoire that announced him at first sight to  be what he really proved; and I conceived from that moment an evil presentiment concerning him. I left Claudine to take her own measures in making herself known to her brother, and I waited impatiently to see what would be the event of our quarrel, as soon as it should be ascertained that my temporary restraint was at an end. This happened sooner-than I expected. On the second day my arrest was taken off; but an express order from court forbade either of us to testify further resentment against each other, and enjoined what it Ivas not in the power of any court to enforce, -a total forgetfulness of the past. On my side I was obliged to enter No. 2.     8  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6536-00000060"/> "4          GOOD STORIES. into a sort of recognizance that should secure my obedience; which I was contented to do as I found St. Victoire lay under a restric- tion from his commanding- officer little inferior to mine. I had afterwards reason to know that the argument made use of to induce his easier compliance with what was required of him was the dis- proportion of rank between himself and his antagonist. I was far from suspecting this at the time; otherwise I am not sure my Caledonian blood would have patiently tolerated it. While peace was thus apparently restored between us, Claudine had not been wanting in any effort, on her part, that might render it either permanent or sincere. St. Victoire was at first greatly surprised at discovering his sister, and much struck with her beauty, as well as with the native charms of her character. The dear girl, I doubt not, spared no eloquence to make him a convert to mine; but she was not so successful as, I will venture proudly to say, she deserved to be. St. Victoire could not, indeed, deny that I appeared to have acted both generously and delicately towards his sister; but he took care to invalidate the merit of my conduct by representing the probability of its proving, in the end, to be either uncertain or insidious. I burned with resentment; but I had no resource. I could not again embroil myself with the brother of Claudine; and, had I done so, I should not have remedied my misfortune; for, although she lamented his injustice as much as I did, she could not be prevailed upon absolutely to revolt from his authority. She was, besides, much under age, and had no power, either according to the regulations of her own country or of those in which she resided, to set him at defiance. - And now I believe we both bitterly re- gretted Sweden, our good old friend there, and the tranquil happi- ness we had enjoyed under his roof. St. Victoire, however, after some days of deliberation, constrained himself to render me personal thanks for the protection I had afforded his sister. He did it so proudly as to convince me that he meant to discharge both himself and her from the obligation; but I had not much leisure to ruminate upon his intentions, for he presently announced to me " that Clau- dine was now become his care,-that it was his purpose immedi-   X               Af    '         al "1- stIm -     THE SCOTSMAN'S TALE           1 "5 ately to remove her from the very respectable hands in which I had placed lher to a situation more suitable to her country and her con- dition in life,-that he should be very happy to acknowledge my civilities in every mode that lay in his poer; and he hinted at any pecuniary demands which I might be entitled to mae." This put me out of all patience. I knew him to be poor and I believed my- Ior and I believed my,; self to be rich enough to have bought half his regiment; but it was not the question of poverty or riches that lay between us: honor, sen- sibiity, and everything dear to a noble mind was included i it. I told him plainmly, and at once, the mutual engageme ha subsisted between myself and Claudine. I professed before Heaven there was no affluence I could have offered that deserving and lovely girl which I should have thou ght equal to her merits; but I could not conquer myself so far as to forbear adverting with disdain S to the pecuniary indemnification hinted at in his speech, whether I considered the offer merely, or the resources of him who offered it. I concluded with, a protestation that nothing, should tear Claudine from me; and I  referred him to herself, to know whether she would be prevailed upon to give me up. I had now made things a thousand times worse than they were before.  St. Victoire commanded his pride, indeed, so  tar as to answer me in terms of decent civility ; but I could easily perceive that I  had exasperated and nettled him to the very soul.  He made extremely light of my reference to his sister, affecting to consider ber as a child who was  incompetent to judoe of hler own wishes. -e gave  me very clearly to understand that he had influence enouoh at court to defeat any that I  miaht flatter myself with possessing; and very civilly insinuated that the son of a merchant could never, under  any circumstances, either of wealth  or poverty, be a  match for the sister of the Count St. Victoire. Nothing more, could be made of our conference, unless it had come to a serious and hostile appeal; w ich, for various reasons, each was unwilling it should do. We  parted mutually out of humor, and mutually resolved to carry the future our own way. Claudine was overwhelmed with grief when she learned the event  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6536-00000061"/> "6         GOOD STORIES. of our conversation. Both she and I had been so deficient in knowl- edre of the world, and so little used to calculate the various points of view in which circumstances appear to various characters, that it had never at any moment occurred to either of us to doubt our re- ception from her brother, or his approbation of the measures we had pursued. How great, then, was our disappointment to find the event we had so much desired now threatening to prove an insuper- able obstacle to our union. I had even cause for additional chagrin, on reflecting that my own indiscreet wish of exhibiting my fair -ch hrge had exposed us mutually to this unforeseen mortification. I had, nevertheless, entertained hitherto so clear a conviction that the sentiments I cherished for Claudine were such as, while they con- tributed to her happiness, would also place her out of the reach of those worldly sorrows and carking cares which corrode the sweetest buds of youth, that I experienced something like astonishment at the new ligyht St. Victoire's opinions had thrown upon the whole busi- ness. They were not altogether so irrational, however, as my sit- uation naturally inclined me to believe them. I even felt that they were not so, though I was unwilling to acknowledge it, even to my own heart. In spite of that air of levity and nonchalance with which he affected to speak of his sister, it was evident to me that he was much struck with her beauty, and built secretly upon it, as a certain means of procuring her a brilliant establishment. To say truth, I was not without an internal conviction of the same nature; and it was this which was my scourge. Perhaps we were both blinded by our partiality towards her;- so, however, it was. Claudine entertained no such views or feelings. She conceived herself bound to me by every tie of gratitude or love, and she vin- dicated both my behavior and intentions with the dignity of a mind that feels itself above misconstruction. She did not indeed think herself entitled either by years or experience to determine her own conduct; but though she submitted that to the temporary authority *     of St. Victoire, she did not fail to tell him that nothing short of the conviction of demerit onmy part would ever induce her to violate the engagrement between us: and she peremptorily refused to shock   THE SCOTSMANS TALE.          17 or exasperate me by returning any of the gifts I had lavished on her. "Nothing fortune could bestow," she tenderly declared ' would be in her eyes so dear or honorable as those lastingr memo- rials of poverty on her side, and of the most unalloyed generosity on mine."  These were refinements quite out of the way of St. Victoire. He had concluded it to be a matter of justice that, in taking away his sister, he should guard against my suffering any other loss. Alas! he had no conception of those feelings which, in certain cases, render acquittal an insult, and degrade us in our own eyes, by forcing us to discover that our best actions have been deemed venal and selfish!-" O, consent to be obliged to me!" have I been ready on other occasions to exclaim, when I have seen the proud and too susceptible heart shrink distrustfully from the tender offices of a kindness it feared it could not return. "Prove that you esteem me enough to believe that I am rewarded in the action of serving you!" St. Victoire, in fine, lilke a true man of the world, concluded that W  his sister loved the baubles I had presented her with. He, therefore, , gave up the contest, satisfied to gain his chief point her way, since he could not gain it his own; and he removed her that very night from  the house in which she had hitherto resided to that of the Marchioness de  S-, a   young Frenchwoman of considerable rank, whose husband had emigrated some  time after St. Victoire, and was in the same regiment with the latter. The finances of the Marquis de S---- were said to be in better order than those of his friend; but he lived expensively, made a great figure, and indulged his wife in the same habits of dissipation and high play they had both formerly pursued at Paris. St. Victoire was by no means behindhand in extravagance.  Through that mist of disappointment and chagrin which clouded my present prospects, I was not, there- fore, without a ray of hope that the whole establishment of those high-toned noblesse was upon so uncertain a base as mioht bring Claudine once more within my reach, without any violent struggle on  my part. How sweet to me was the idea that she would neither feel humbled nor degraded by such a circumstance, but would do  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6536-00000062"/> g18         GOOD STORIES. me the justice to understand me. I had an interview with the dear girl on the evening before she left the house of our mutual friend. Her tears, her endearments, her protestations of unshaken constancy, calmed the burning indignation of my heart. I could deny nothing to her solicitation, and I, therefore, promised to attend the future with a degree of moderation I was not at first disposed to show. The house in which Claudine now resided was one where I, of course, had no access; and, in spite of my promises, a few days rendered this constraint insupportable to me. I weighed maturely every possible motive of interest, kindness, or even hostility, by which I might hope to act upon St. Victoire; but in vain. HHe was a man so entirely out of may sphere both as to character and con- nections, so wron,-headed and cold-hearted, that I found no medium throuLh which I could reach him, I was a thousand tilues tempted to have recourse to the most desperate; but to what purpose? We were both, in the first place, under the immediate cognizance of authority: an attempt to defy it might occasion the most serious ill consequences, not only to ourselves, but to our countrymen. St. Victoire was, besides, unquestionably brave; and we could, there- fore, at best meet only on a footing of equality. How, if fortune gave me the advantage, should I be benefited by it? In truth, the only benefit it appeared to me I could possibly derive from such a rencounter, was that of dying. I had a little of tho Anglo-mania in me, and there were moments of im potent rage and grief when I was inclined to think that no despicable resource. A man, however, must take more than one bitter dose of disap- pointment, I believe, before he really comes to such an extremity: at least that was my case. I now endeavored, under the auspices of my correspondent at St. Petersburg, to apply myself more assiduously to business, in order to lighten my cares. I had soon reason to suspect that it would, in fact, only increase them. I was seized with alarm at some critical circumstances that occurred, and censured myself for a remissness which yet, I believe, had had no material influence over my father's concerns, though in the moment of surprise I was disposed to think otherwise. My friend now also   THE SCOTSANIYS TALE.          119 communicated to me some particulars relative to our affairs in England,  which my correspondents there had, through kindness, forborne minutely to relate; and I perceived that whie I had been solely occupied in lamenting griefs, some real, some clhimerical, but all of them wholly selfish, an evil of the most serious nature impend- ed over my family, and threatened to bring my own mortifications to their climax. I now exerted myself to retrieve lost time, and to recover certain debts, the amount of which had not hitherto appeared so material in my eyes as I found it ought to have done. My zeal, however, was too -late : it could not have saved us, had it been earlier awakened; but it would have acquitted me to my own heart, which ever painfully throbs at the recollection; and I should have been better prepared to encounter what followed :- the first ships that arrived frorm England told me that my father had been declared a bankrupt. I cannot even yet think of the circumstance without a renewal of those afflictingy sensations by which I was at the moment stunned and overwhelmed. Here then was an end of my towering  hopes, my high-spirited affluence and independence. Here was such a termination of every claim with respect to Claudine as it would not be in her power even to counteract. For tlough she had been willing to bestow herself upon me, could I accept her? It seemed, on the contrary, that honor and justice commanded me to free her from her engagements, and thus give her those chances in life on the event of which her brother had been so sanguine. From him my heart now revolted more entirely than before. I'could not endure the triumph I believed he would have over me, or the opportunity he would take to exult to his sister in the superiority of his own judgment and prudence. I made no doubt but he would be little- minded enough to conclude that I had foreseen the misfortune that was likely to fall upon my family, and that I was aware I slhould make no sacrifice whatever in securing the possession of Claudine. Nay, it was not even clear to me, that, in the excess of his vanity and self-love, he would not suppose I had built something upon the advantages of such a connection. These, and similar reflections,  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6536-00000063"/> together with various additional chagrins resulting from my situa- ' tion, made me now in reality almost weary of existence. But I owed the care of mine to those dear relatives who were suffering with me, and who had not, like myself, youth and health to combat with difficulties. It became highly necessary that I should return to England; but, although I meditated so doing without taking leave of Claudine, my resolution, nevertheless, failed me as the time drew near. I will own, however, that, among my objections to seeing her, the sit- uation in which I now stood was one. My mind, unlike hers, was not sufficiently self-poised to avoid finding a humiliation in poverty; or possibly the recollection of her brother was blended too inti- mately with that even of herself- and O, how different were they in their natures! --to admit of mnay being governed by a gen- uine and unmixed feeling. The cruel hour of separation at length arrived. Claudine and I parted as most lovers part, with many tears, many protestations, and some caresses. She was never very lavish of those; yet I know not how it was, but she had the art of convincing me that no want of love occasioned her reserve. -She had little reason I found to be satisfied with the situation in lwhich her brother had placed her. It obliged her daily to see a number  of giddy young officers, none of them in circumstances to realize the sanguine expectations of St. Victoire, though sufficiently sus- ceptible or gallant to be troublesome to his sister. Nevertheless, so great a blemish does the want of fortune cast on beauty, that I did not learn Claudine had any decided admirer of rank or affluence enough to expose her to persecution. In fact I gathered nothing of all this from herself: for of herself, except when the question of duties or affections arose, she seldom or never spoke. But my  -- good friend, the merchant's wife, with whom she had resided,  reserved for me constantly all the information it was possible to '  collect; and when that proved insufficient to fill up our conversations  on the subject, we had a supplementary fund of conjecture that was  never exhausted.  I did not fail to relate faithfully to Claudine, before we parted,    1ra^ AlX OUT8l!SMAV'S tTALE.      i21 the misfortunes in which I found myself involved, and those future ones I apprehended. Claudine, however, I quickly perceived, had not yet attained-any distinct idea of poverty. She, indeed, conceived very clearly what it was to lose the luxuries of a spacious apart- ment and a numerous train of domestics, to have nothing but a hired carriage at command, and to be restricted by prudence in the purchase of a trinket. All this she daily felt; therefore she under- stood it;- at her age we rarely look deeper. But such was the character of her mind, both for genuine simplicity and rational pleasures, that she was not able to make herself any giefs out of these and similar losses. Her humblest ideas of indigence extended to a plain, and sometimes scanty meal, like that of our good pastor; a cottage too like his, more calculated for utility than ornament, and certain common domestic occupations which the narrowness of' his circumstances necessarily imposed on his wife and daughters. How   many people picture poverlty in the way Claudine did! Ah! should such be carried into the miserable hovels where real indigence resides!-should they there see their fellow-creature, possibly their equal, stretched out in sickness and hopeless misery! -should they see, not privation, but famine ;- not disappointment, but despair;-babyhood without playfulness, manhood without vigor, and age without nourishment; how would their erring but tender and humane hearts, suffer under the spectacle! Let us not deceive ourselves - Extreme and abject poverty is, vice excepted, the most deplorable condition of human nature!-It carries not, as the more acute sufferings of body or of mind do, a balm or a termination in itself. No! - it is like water poured drop by drop upon the brain of a criminal, till the whole man groans under ex- cruciating torture! - Should I expose the dear girl I loved, even remotely, to the experience of so cruel an evil?-My whole soul revolted from the idea. "Listen to me, my dear Claudine!" said I, as we were parting. "When I offered you my hand and my heart, I believed that I could add to them the blessings of independence at least: it has proved otherwise, and your brother was more correct in his calculation of  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6536-00000064"/> the chances of life than we supposed him to be. I will never rob the sister of the Count St. Victoire, or rather I will never rob my own Claudine, of such real advantages in it as she has a right from her merit or charnms to expect; though I would, without scruple, have permitted her to sacrifice to our mutual attachment those ideal goods, those factitious substitutes, for all that is really valuable and honorable in human nature, to which common minds bow down with so implicit a reverence. While you love me, however, dear- est Claudine! you are, and can be only mine; but should you cease to do so, the bond between us is from that moment broken, nor shall an injurious thought, much less a reproach, pursue you on my part." These were high-sounding words; but I have on reflec- tion believed them not so sincere as they then appeared to be. There was certainly a little of the chicanery of love in them. I softened her soul by the idea of my approaching departure; I won over every tender and grateful feeling of her mind by the recollec- tion of the past; finally, I subdued her sensibility by the extravagance of my own; and when her enthusiasm was at its highest, I then said to her, "( Claudine, if your heart mlrakes another choice, re- nounce me." All this was perhaps at last only an ingenious artifice of self-love Hbut when a man does not know he is artificial, I think he may be pardoned. Nevertheless, if it was really my intention to extort fresh protestations of constancy from Claudine, I was disappointed; for she made none. She wept bitterly, however; and her expressive eyes, while she listened to me, rendered lan- guare unnecessary. I embraced her once more, and immediately after embarked for England. This voyage was not like the last. I no longer found any charms either in the heavens or the ocean; and my thoughts wandered incessantly over the past and the future with the most painful anxiety. We had not been long at sea before a heavy gale arose that rendered our navigation even less pleasant than before. When I heard the sailors talk of the danger of-the breakers, and saw, though at a distance, the horrible prospect they presented, I thought of Claudine and her unfortunate mother, flying, like many others   T'IE SCOTSMAl  N'S CTALE.       128 of their countrywomen, from their native land, from all that wras dear or familiar, to contend with elements no less inhospitable to them than the human race. After beating about some days, we ran at length for security into a small Swedish port. I was tempted to land, in order to set my foot in the country where I had first seen Claudine, and to make a sort of love-pilgrimage towards the very spot. However, I resisted this impulse of romance; and it was lucky I did so., I should otherwise have lost my passage; for the wind became fair a few hours after, and it was not long before I landed in England. I found my father's situation there even more perplexing than I had expected it to be. His concerns had been so multiplied and so various, that it required the most persevering assiduity to disentangle them, or reduce the chaos to order. This was in a great measure my employment: my days were necessarily devoted to it; and, after immense application, I returned home spiritless and exhausted of an evening, to rise the ensuing morning to the same painful occupations. People to whom life is a plaything know nothing of such cares as fill up the hours of one half of the community, and too often unfit them, not merely for its frivolous, but often its social intercourse; yet these apparent favorites of fortune, like spoiled children, often become weary of their toy, while those in whose hands it is like an engine of either privrate or public utility, have always within themselves a source of honorable satisfaction; and such, in the midst of my vexations, was mine! My father was a man of strict probity and deep intellect; but his manners were not ingratiating, and his understanding was of that biting and repulsive kind which makes few friends. He had a decided love of scheming; and his plans had, for the most part, been both sagacious and successful. A concurrence of circumstances had now rendered them far otherwise. The consequence was that he became bitterly censured, and even indirectly calumniated. He was too proud to endure this, and too helpless to remedy it. His constitution sunk under the conflict; and I found him, on my arri- val in England, far gone in a malady that had every appearance of  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6536-00000065"/> 124         GOOD STORIES. proving mortal. It is in the hour of sorrow, sickness, or poverty that we learn how to estimate our natural affinities. Placed on the pinnacle of health and prosperity, man stands a sort of independent and self-possessed being, whom the ties and affections only touch at certain points; reduce him fromn this station in society, and he will at once become sensible of his own insufficiency. It is then he will, perhaps, best learn the value of those friends with whom nature has providently furnished him, and whose habits, tastes, affections, nay even weaknesses, most in sympathy with his own, calculate them to take place of all others. Never were my parents and myself so much attached as at this juncture; yet it was a sorrowful one, and I still cannot remember without a pang the hour when I lost my father. In addition to this heavy calamity, my mother had the grief of seeing her only brother alienated from us some months be- fore by the circumstances in which our late bankruptcy had involved him. He was a man of considerable property, and therefore stood the shock; but he did not easily forgive the person who exposed him to the hazard, and all intercourse between him and my father had been consequently broken off. On the death of the latter he came to visit my mother; but he expressed no desire to see me, and I was too proud to obtrude myself upon him. I had now neither hope nor dependence in life. The narrow income my mother's settlement enabled her to rescue from the wreck of our affairs was barely equal to her support. I had myself received too many indignities, or at least what I conceived to be such, from the few who called themselves my father's friends, during the progress of our misfortune, to place the smallest reliance upon them; and I was torn to pieces between the claims of nature and those of love. Claudine was ever first and last in my thoughts, amid all my cares and torments; but I saw no chance of calling her mine. I could even hear from her but seldom; and although her own letters, nhen they reached me, breathed the most unchanged affection, my friend, the merchant's wife, failed not to supply her husband with little re- ports, which, if they did not absolutely excite my distrust, yet created something in my bosom so nearly allied to jealousy as severely to   I             - .'             !j  THE SCOTSM3ANY'S TALE.              125i increase my incidental chagrins. His manner of relating them was, besides, so cold and laconic, that I hardly knew what to conclude or gather from his hints. To say truth, I have since had reason to   believe that the chief object of both these well-meaning, though I  misjudging people, was in unison with what they believed would be the wish of my friends, - to break an engagement that threat- ened only ruin to either of the parties concerned. I, like Claudine, was not without some natural or acquired advantages; and the worthy man at St. Petersburg, therefore, concluded that, if detached from her, I should most probably settle with some commercial family in England, marry, as he had done, one of the dauthtelrs, and step in for as large a portion of the goods of this world along with her as I honestly could contrive to do. This might, perhaps, have happened,-and, indeed, my affairs went on in a train that seemed not to make it unlikely, - but I had no taste for the project. I revolved many, although that was not among the number, without being able to fix on one. I had secretly a strong desire to plunge into some adventurous scheme abroad; but I was fettered by two opposing sentiments, which were fated by turns to engross my life and my heart. My mother's health was daily declining; she had neither support nor consolation but me; and the period of Iher existing there seemed likely to be so short, that I could not resolve to abbreviate it. I, like Gray, had found out that " a man can never have more than one mother"; and mine  had, from very childhood, retained a strong interest ill my affections. I never in my life saw a creature so perfectly feminine, without being insipid or weak; yet she had neither a very lovely person, nor a highly cultivated understanding; but she was so gentle, so indulgent, so truly conjugal and maternal, so admirably calculated to soothe the bitter moments of life, and to enjoy without intoxica- t{ion its modest and genuine .pleasures, that my heart, even in man- hlood, was almost as much hers as though she had been amongst the most dazzling of her sex. While I was in this anxious state of indigence and indecision, a proposal was made me from a house with which my father had had  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6536-00000066"/> -Jl-   1-a          GOOD STORIES. some commercial connections, that promised to be in the end suffi- ciently advantageous to merit consideration at least. DMy mother was urgent with me to accept the overture. She did not at the moment confide to me all her reasons, because she feared they might prove visionary; but I could easily see she had the matter deeply at heart. The situation was not such as I should myself have de- sired; but I knew that T had- the reputation of indulging a proud and-almost a rebellious spirit, as far as the world was concerned, the energy of which had been increased by my education and habits. I took, therefore, a sort of malicious pleasure in disappointing the plodding calculators of my fathers acquaintance who had affirmed I had no useful abilities; and I half resolved to prove to them that what I could resolve to undertake I could execute, with talents far beyond their methodical dulness. This was again the project of a young man; but I never could feel a half-interest in anything. My pride, as well as my future advantage, was deeply staked upon that before me; and I consequently turned my attention towards it with a zeal that not only astonished others, but, to say truth, surprised even myself. Behold me, then, doomed for my offences, whatever those were, -and my conscience, I own, did not reproach me with many,- to spend the greater part of the day on a high stool, and go through all the drudgery of a counting-house,-busy with invoices, &amp;c, &amp;c.,-and at intervals execrating French aristocracy, Russian traineaus, and English speculation. I saw my mother only of an evening; but I saw her countenance lighted up at those meetings with an unusual degree. of complacency and softness; even her health seemed to amend; and if I was at some moments disposed to break my chain, I never visited her without finding fresh mo- tives for enduring it. Our meals were necessarily frugal, and our Indulgences few;$ yet my income, though narrow, was a consider- able addition to hers; I therefore daily perceived the impossibility of alienating it. On feeling the lightness of my own purse, my conduct towards- St. Victoire, nevertheless, sometimes came home to me.' I remembered the half-disdainful hints I had thrown out   THE SCOTSMAIN'S TALE.          127 on his poverty; and although they were certainly extorted by no small degree of insolence on his side, I became sensible that I had degraded my own character by returning it. It was now my part to be indigent. I did not feel myself at all the less proud on that account; and I therefore learned to make allowances for him. Yet I saw, with half-despair, that I was further removed than I had been at that period from all chance of conciliating his regard; since it was not even a concession like that I made to my own heart that would have done it; and it was very clear that the man who had despised a rich merchant would at all times utterly shut his door against a poor one.  Claudine and myself were, however, both growing older, and I concluded that, if we could but contrive to grow richer too, we might at length reasonably set his authority at defiance. In spite of the mystery my mother had thought it prudent to observe, it was not long before I penetrated into the motives of her conduct. When chance sent me home to her: lodgings at an unex- pected hour, I more than once encountered my uncle coming fromn them. Our meeting appeared at first to disconcert him; by degrees he seemed to accustom himself to it, and at length bestowed on me a half-gracious salutation. I returned the civility, but made no overtures towards improving it. I learnt, however, from third per- sons, that his visits were pretty frequent; and had I not done so, I should have known by a certain number of additional comforts and conveniences I observed my mother to possess lately, and which I knew our limited means would not have allowed her to indulge in, that some more certain resources than our own were concerned in them. This was every way balm to my heart; not from its flat- tering any views that immediately respected myself, but as I knew that the returning kindness of her brother was, of all possible events, the most grateful to hers, and could not fail to be in worldly circum- stances infinitely advantageous. In law I was eventually my uncle's heir; but he had cut off both my mother and myself, by a will made several months before the death of my father; and as his fortune was his own to bestow, we could, under -these eircumstances,  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6536-00000067"/> claim nothing but the little stipend which his fraternal regard had induced him to allot his sister. A reconciliation might still, in- deed, incline him to change the disposition of his worldly concern's; but I now knew too much of life to have any great reliance upon this hope, and too much of the dilatory nature of most men not to doubt whether mere indolence might not defeat his purpose, should it even be favorable towards me. I made no doubt, however, but my mother formed a thousand chimerical projects, the first step to- wards the accomplishing of which would be to associate me in my uncle's- commercial undertakings ; and as she was most sanguine in her opinion of my personal influence and abilities, to whatever point they were directed, I was sure she secretly persuaded herself that I should in time prove the sole manager, and, finally, the heir of his wealth, My plan was far different; but I seemed to shut my eyes to what was passing, and permitted her to follow her own in the manner she deemed most judicious. In fact, I earnlestlyr wished her to ac- quire such a share, both in the heart and domestic concerns of her brother, as would make her accede with less reluctance to any bolder project I might adopt towards my own establishment in life; for, in spite of the external show I continued to make of content and ap- plication, my very soul was secretly weary of the uniform and mechanical sort of existence I now endured; or perhaps it was the restless spirit of love that thus undermined my quiet, and rendered me at heart thoroughly averse from a sort of occupation, which, had I possessed a disengaged mind, my early acquirements and habits ought to have fitted me for. What led me to suspect this was, that my plans, begin at what point of the compass they would, always, in the end, pointed towards St. Petersburg; and though, reasonably speaking, it was of a11 places on the globe the last where I could have submitted to appear in any subordinate situation, some- thing relative to it was ever uppermost in my fancy. Even while meditating a voyage to India, I detected myself thinking of the snows of the north; and winter, all unlovely as it was," proved, from the association of ideas, to me a season of enjoyment.   r           1 jll9 Whatever was to be the event of mny plans, my mother's, at least, seemed in a way to be slowly successful. biey uncle invited me several times to dine with her at his house; and although I had no great cause to be flattered by rny reception there, for he still con- tinued to show me very little distinction or regard, I was, on the whole, better pleased with this sort of conduct than if he had conceived a strong personal liking for me. I did not, in fact, believe he had any; though his indulgence towards his sister induced him to put a constraint on himself; but I was, nevertheless, a little - stagered when I learnt, from a mutual friend on whose veracity I could rely, thlat, however cold his manners were to me when present, hehad spoken of me, when absent, in such terms as hardly any but a father would have used. I began myself to suspect that a gleam of sunshine w as lilkely to burst remotely upon my path ; and tlou h I could not altogether shape my expectations into ally form wholly gratifyting, I felt the burden I had imposed upon myself be- come daily less heavy. Mine, grievous as it seemed to me, was, nevertheless, far short of what I continually saw fall on others. Among those whom the con- cerns of business threw in my way was a young Frenchman of tile name of Vraudreuil. He had been recommended by an eminent house of Eouen, and was engaged for the foreign department in ours. His talents for business seemed to be moderate, but his in. dustry and application were unequalled; so was his temperance. He lived on air: never tasted wine, nlor shared in any conviviality whatever. Contrary to the general character of his countrymen, he was serious in the extreme. His manners were thought proud; and, as he was known to be poor, he was of consequence little liked by those with whom he was in some degree obliged to associate. I had, for Claudine's sake, a slight partiality for those of her country ; and I occasionally manifested it towards him. It was increased when I found that he had been despatched from Rouen to St. Petersburg, before he was sent over to England, and had seen Clau- dne herself. It was not at all probable that his condition in life should have allowed him to mingle in her circle; but I nevertheless No. 2*    9  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6536-00000068"/> 1.iU        - us JL/ U .1 UI11 tJt.  took pleasure in talking with one who had even seen her only. I found him extremely agreeable when I came to converse with him , and I suspected that he had not been always a man of business. This, however, was a confession I never could extort from him; and his reserve naturally created the same sentiment on my part. Once the extreme narrowness of his circumstances obliged him to have recourse to me for a pecuniary assistance; and I could see the excessive pride of his soul by the tears it forced into his eyes. As this event, however, did not seem to increase his confidence in me, it naturally threw a still greater check upon every attempt I might have been .inclined to make towards acquiring it. I think we esteemed each other more than before; yet a sort of coldness grew up between us, - the natural consequence of a feeling which, by some opposing principle, is not permitted to act with the force it demands. One more powerful, and even torturing, was awakened in my bosom by a very simple accident, and it related to Vau- dreuil. We had engaged to go into the country together on a particular dlay, as much to satisfy ourselves on a point of curiosity as pleasure. I had promised to call upon him. He was not quite dressed, and I went into his room. While conversing with him there, I hap- pened to cast my eyes upon a black ribbon which was at his bosom. It seemed to me as if a picture ought to depend from it, and I was seized with a singular fit of curiosity to ascertain whether there was one or not. I kept my attention earnestly directed towards the ribbon, and at length was gratified. I saw it was indeed, a picture; but my heart suddenly bounded, and my pulse throbbed, for I believed it to be that of Claudine. I had now the eye of an Argus, and I had more than one accidental opportunity of reconnoitring the portrait. It was, beyond doubt, either that of Claudine, or of some person strongly resembling her. In a broken and irresolute tone I strove to rally Vaudreuil on the sub- ject. He made no answer, but he sighed deeply, thrust the picture into his bosom, and buttoned it up there. I had now room for meditation more gloomy than any I had ever yet indulged. I recol-   THE SCOTSMAN'S TALE.          13i lected all the hazards that attended my engagement with Claudine, and the indirect release I had proffered her when we parted. How could I be assured that she had not availed herself of it? Vaudreuil might be nobly born and highly bred. I saw nothing against this supposition. He had been to Petersburg. He might, for aught I knew, be the most intimate friend of St. Victoire, and in his eyes, therefore, however poor, not exceptionable as the husband of his sister. Claudine's country, her habits of thinking, time, distance, and the influence of her brother, might have wrought a change in her affections; and while I was waiting the slow aid of the future to assure my happiness, the past might already have undermined it. While I think of the tragical moments I endured in consequence of all these conjectures, I cannot help admiring how ingenious man is in tormenting himself, and how much a little common sense would on certain occasions befriend him. As our party was composed of several persons, it was not possible for me, throulghout any part of that day, to bring Vaudreuil to such conversation as might enlighten my doubts. I passed, therefore the most anxious and miserable of nights, one half of which was spent in writing to St. Petersburg; and I arose almost with the dawn, determined to satisfy myself on the subject which agitated me. Alert as I was, Vaudreuil seemed no less so; for at a very early hour in the morning I received a note from him, expressed singularly well, but with a tone of depression that, in spite of the suspicions which haunted me, excited the deepest interest in his fate. It contained a request for a small sum of money, and an urgent entreaty that it might, if possible, be sent by the bearer. Vaudreuil had acquitted himself of his former obligation to me in a manner highly honorable to his feelings, though in reality grievous to mine; for I was sure that nothing but the most painfully rigid economy could have enabled him to do so. Yet what he would not acknowledge delicacy forbade me to wring from him; and I had, therefore, contented myself with obliging him by every indirect method I could possibly devise. Though he did not notice this, I had seen, on many occasions, that it sunk deeply into his soul, and<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6536-00000069"/> 132         GOOD STORIES. I believed it had rendered him even more reluctant to demand aily service from me. I had no doubt that. something critical had occurred that induced this application, and I, therefore, without inquiry or hesitation, sent him a larger sum than he requested, reserving my explanation with him to a late hour of the day, when I: hoped the exigency that had thus suddenly occurred would be settled. I found the time insupportably long, in the interim. It did not at all surprise me that Vaudreuil failed to appear to execute his daily employment; but I was thunder-struck on being informed that he had thrown it up. This, however, was not altogether true. He had, indeed, stated to his employers that it would not be possible for him to attend, during a period the extent of which he could not decide; but it was by no means clear, from the tenor of his letter, that he would return to it no more. I flew to his lodgcr- ings ; but I there learned only a confirmation of my chagrin'; for he had discharged them the moment he received the money from me; and the persons of the house could give me no other account of him than that he walked towards the city to find out some pub- lic conveyance by which lie miglht leave London. Had I been sure Claudine was his companion, I think I could hardly have been more enraged. In the first transports of surprise and indignation I at once concluded that he had observed my emotion at sight of the picture; that he was perfectly aware of the interest I took in the original; and that he had basely practised upon my credulity by making the supply I had sent. him the means of extricating either her or himself, or both, from my resentment. Nothing, however, was less likely than any of these suppositions. Vaudreuil did not seem the man who would shrink from any person's resentment, - much less take advantage either of genierosity or cre- dulity. It was improbable in the extreme that Claudine should be in England; and it was perfectly absurd to suppose that he had shipped himself off, at an hour's notice, for St. Petersburg. J was not without an inclination to ship myself off, nevertheless but I grew cooler as I continued to reflect. The picture, after all, might   THE  SCOTSMAN'S   TALE.       133 not be that of Claudine. Vaudreuil might have concerns that called him thus suddenly away, without any reference to love; and, above everything, there was internal evidence in the style of his letter, and my knowledge of his character, that he would, under ally circumnstances, return. My reason was tolerably satisfied; but the aching demand of my heart was not appeased. More events, however, are sometimes comprised within a few hours than at others pass in years. While I was thus racking my imagination on the subject of Claudine and Vaudreuil, my mother's patience, and her messenger's, had been wearied in seeking me. I was found at last; and I learned, not without a strong emotion of anxiety and surprise, that I had been sent for to my uncle, who was taken with an apoplectic fit. I has- I tened immediately to his house, where I found my mother; by whom I was informed that every effort to recover hm had been fruitless. As he had never been sensible from the moment she saw him, she had had no opportunity of strengthening his good-will towards me; or of influencing him in the disposal of his worldly affairs by the sight of her own tenderness and grief. All her highly cherished lbopes, therefore, were suddenly blighted; and, in addition to a very afflicting calamity, she had a disappointment to encounter for which she was wholly unprepared. That I felt was very small. I had never relied on my uncle, and had been, in fact, more afraid of his entangling me by some half-kindness, that would have rendered him the arbiter of my actions, than sanguine in my expectations from his generosity. My mother knew, however, that she should in some degree benefit by his will (though resentment towards my father had excluded me from so doing); and we were accordingly present when it was opened. The first thing that excited our attention and surprise was the date, which was more recent than we expected. Being a bachelor, he had no immediate relatives, ourselves excepted, on whom to bestow his wealth. He gave a considerable number of legacies, however, to many of his friends ; hle settled a large portion of his personal for- tune on my mother: - but both she and I looked at each othier with  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6536-00000070"/> : 134         GOOD STORIES. astonishment, when we found the residue was allotted to me. This residue included a commercial property to some extent, together with an estate which he had purchased in his native country, La- nerkshire. Never shall I for-get the look my mother gave me, - it was so sweet an approbation of the sacrifices she, believed I had made to moderation and to her tranquillity, - it conveyed to my soul so tender an assurance, that she was persuaded I owed to my own self-government the good fortune I had thus unexpectedly en- countered, that it was more flattering to me than if I had received the wealth of the world. On her side, I believe, the acquisition of half of it would have been less delightful than that of her 11 simple native vale." The romantic "falls of the Clyde had been the scene of her earliest and tenderest recollections; it was in that neighbor- hood, too, I was born $ and the spot was endeared by a variety of nameless local charms, congenial to the most insensible bosom, and peculiarly so to those of my country. I also was not without my little hoard of hopes and recollections; but they were somewhat damped by the vague doubt I had lately cherished with regard to Claudine. My mother easily discerned I had something struggling in my mind beyond even those emotions natuzally excited by the occasion. She had long entertained a surmise that I had some attachment; but she naturally concluded that it was subdued by prudence, and, therefore, waited tranquilly till the impulse of my own heart should induce -me to confide it to her. This was not the moment to do so. I could not prevail on myself to let her see that I doubted the fidelity of Claudine; and, in truth, the circumstance on which I founded myvdoubt, however perplexing to the imagina- tion of a lover, was in itself so puerile and uncertain, that I knew not how to reveal it. I waited impatiently the return of Vaudreuil $ for I was persuaded that he would return, or that I should at least hear from him, though it were. only in discharge of the pecuniary obligation/-be- tween us; and I was necessarily obliged to employ myself, in the interim, in the regulation of my uncle's concerns. I did this with the more alacrity, as it was my intention, the moment they were in    THE SCOTSMAN'S TALE.          135 any safe train, to embark for St. Petersburg, bear the news of my own change of fortune to Claudine, decide by her looks and her reception of me upon the interest I still held in her heart, and, if I found that unchanged, prevail with her to withdraw, either openly or in secret, from the authority of St. Victoire, and accompany me to England as my wife. A long and cruel fortnight passed, how- ever, without any tidings of Vaudreuil., During that period I could hardly at intervals forbear smiling, to see those who now called themselves my friends imputing the indifference and half- melancholy which hung about me to a hypocritical sorrow for my uncle's death. I believe I was looked upon by these men of the world as a complete dissembler; and so far were they from calcu- lating what passed in my heart, that I have no doubt they thought me secretly overwhelmed with exultation and joy. I had been so indefatigable in my exertions as soon to prepare everything for my approaching departure. I meditated in what manner I should, without saying too much, communicate to my mother the nature of the business that carried me abroad; and I was walking, deeply engrossed with my own reflections, along the Strand, when, happening to cast my eyes upon a hackney-coach that passed me, I saw Vaudreuil in it. It was driving very fast, and beyond my reach, before I had recollection to stop it. I could entertain no doubt, however, that it was --him, for he bowed to me smilingly as he passed. His countenance was more lighted up, and, from the glance I caught of him, I thought he seemed better dressed than usual. This was a mystery, the unravelling of which at once engaged all my attention. That Vaudreuil should be in London, should know himself to be my debtor, yet neither write nor call upon me, - should be aware that he'stood exposed to the most degrading suspicion, yet coolly bow to me from a hackney-coach,- seemed almost beyond belief. I went to his former lodgings; but he had not been heard of there. I then hastened to the counting-house where he had been used to attend; but no tidings of his return had reached any of the- clerks, A letter, however, was put into my charge, addressed to  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6536-00000071"/> il,  tmais nacta oeen sent thither by the people with whom he had lived. I knew it instantly to be the hand-writing of Claudine, and I could, therefore, no longer doubt it to be her picture which he wore. All my suspicions again recurred. I was on the point of tearing open the letter in order to satisfy them; but Iremembered I had no claim over Vaudreuil but one I should have blushed to profit by; and that, if he had even robbed me of Claudine's affec- tions, it was sufficiently probable that he never knew I had engaged them.  No other acquittal but that of the petty money concern d between us was, in the apparent state of the business, necessary on  his part; and such was the confidence inspired by the kind of char- post; it was from Hull. My voya e to Peersburg would then be fruitless. Claudine was evidently not there. The appearance of Vaudreuil would be, perhaps, alike useless to me. She would Probably have bestowed herself upoti him before we met; for, if there was no treacherous motive in her voyage, why did she not writetome?  Ihad noteven heard from her for a considerable time  before. But this circumstance I had hitherto imputed to some accidental failure of her letters that before me announced a different "aI corme," said lene, ate I ig towars m me annoudced a differn- reason for her silence; and I had the torture of supposing she was at that very moment in London, yet as far out of the reach of my penetration as if in the wilds of Siberia. I returned home extremely melancholy, and, to my great surprise, found waiting for'me there the very person I had been over half the town in search of, - in other words, Vaudreuil himself. In my hand I held Claudine's letter, which I had taken possession of, leaving word where it was to be found; and I advanced towards him with a turbulence and impatience of which he did not seem at all sensible. His countenance was, indeed, as it had appeared to me in the coach, animated and cheerful: in a Word, he looked happy, and that was enough to make me miser- : able.                 to    d  r c- I come, said he, stepping towards me, "to demand your con-   gratulations, and to announce a piece of good fortune in which you will sympathize with me." "Spare yourself the relation," said I, sullenly; "I know the good fortune that has befallen you, without its being told. You are married, -or on the point of being so. And, to show you that I am better informed of your affairs than you suppose, I can even name the faithless woman who has bestowed herself upon you." "When I do marry," said Vaudreuil, laughing, "I hope it will not be a faithless woman, at least. You are, in truth, a most in- genious guesser; and after you have pointed out the fair one who means to do me the favor of bestowing herself upon me, I shall know what portion'of gratitude is due both to you and to her. In the interim, however, assure yourself that it is not matrimony, but that which has of late engrossed a much greater share of the thoughts of mankind, - politics,--which is in question with me. I have re- ceived undoubted information that the new government in France will allow me to recover at least a considerable portion of my family claims and property there. I have never borne arms against my country; and should I prove successful in my application, I shall be enabled to serve a brother who is less fortunately circumstanced, and a sister inexpressibly dear to me." "You have a sister!" exclaimed I. Undoubtedly I have," returned Vaudreuil, smiling archly. "And you wear her picture -" "At my bosom!" and he drew it from thence. Ah, it is Claudine! - my Claudine, - my own Claudine," cried I, snatching and kissing it rapturously a thousand times. Vau- dreuil could not forbear smiling at an etourderie so foreign to all he had yet seen of my character. "I am ignorant how soon she is to be your Claudine," said he, at length, gently disengaging the portrait; " but I know she is at present mine; and I am not quite assured that she will permit me to au- thorize such violent caresses. Let us be seated, my kind friend," he added, recovering his usual interesting gravity of tone and man-  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6536-00000072"/> ner; "and if you can command these transports of yours,-so     little in unison with our ideas of English phlegm, --I well tell you  what I am sure you will have real pleasure in hearing, - I will tell  you that your generous interposition rescued Claudine and both her  brothers from a state of half-despondency; that your pecuniary  kindness supplied with necessaries and comforts the proud spirit and  quffering frame of St. Victoire; finally, that it has afforded Clau-  dine herself the means of coming up to London, and of thanking you  in person. These, believe me, are not dreams," said he, perceiving  me stare with astonishment. "It is but very lately that I have  known the history of my own family: such as it is I will relate it i to you. I need not tell you that I am much younger than St. Vie-  toire; there is, in fact, only the difference of two years between i Claudine and myself; but I look older, for I have suffered," he  added, sighing. "From the time I had any use of reason, it unfor- tunately happened that my opinion on political subjects did not ac- cord with those of my family. I was, therefore, an early outcast  from it, and remained in France when my relations quitted it, with- out their deigning to take the smallest interest in my after fate. My name was prohibited to Claudine's lips, as attaching disgrace to her own; and it was the constant habit of suppressing it that prob- ably prevented its reaching your ears. I was not much more for- tunate, however, in my political career, than my father and my brother had been. The fickle and too enthusiastic nation of which I was an individual, became sanguinary, and disgraced the noblest ailn of humanity. I was nearly a victim to the guillotine; but a friendly banker at Paris concealed me, and by his assistance I passed in safety to Rouen.  I was not without abilities, and am among those of my countrymen who think it no disgrace to use them. I applied myself, under a borrowed name, to business; but I did not find that I was wholly safe from persecution, and was, therefore, advised to quit France. My heart fondly turned towards St. Petersbulrg, where I believed I should find my mother, nmy brother, and my sister. As I was now rather more unfortunate than themselves, I  conceived that my offences would be expiated    THE SCOTSAIAN'S TALE.         139 in their eyes; and I accordingly embarked. I soon found that I had had the misfortune to lose one of the three, without being happy enough to recover the other two; for my reception from St. Victoire was neither brotherly nor generous. It was, indeed, such as deter- minled me to meet him no more; for I was not without some share of the family pride when it-was roused. I saw Claudine acciden- tally for a quarter of an hour,. but he would not permit me to converse with her freely. I wrote to her, however ; and I requested from her my mother's picture, as a memorial of my family. She did not possess it, but she sent me her own, together with an earnest entreaty to see me again. No doubt she thought me very unkind;  for I was so circumstanced that I could not enter the lists with St. Victoire on that subject, and he eluded my address when I attempted to send her another letter, I therefore quitted St. Petersburg without having an opportunity of vindicating my sentiments to her, and came over to England; where, by the continued assistance of my worthy friends at Rouen, I obtained an employment, in the course of which I was fortunate enough to meet with you.

Vaudreuil spoke this with an energy and seriousness that was extremely affecting; or else its being my own panegyric caused it extremely to affect me. - He spoke English tolerably,; but on this occasion he expressed himself throughout in French; and I know not how it happens, but my translation seems to have lost all the fire and spirit of the original. -Nothing now appeared necessary  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6536-00000073"/> "O         GOOD STORIES. towards my felicity but to see Claudine. I told him as much; and at the same moment, recollecting the letter of hers I still possessed, I offered it to him. - I have conversed with her since it was written," said he, putting it in his pocket, " and, therefore, know its contents. St. Victoire is at this moment extremely fatigued, and in no condition to receive you. Claudine, who has not been many hours in town after a most rapid journey, will herself be the better for a short repose ; and as she cannot calculate that I should meet with you so soon, she will probably find it. You do not yet know by what means I became possessed of your secret. Have you no curiosity? - or are you so inhospitable that you are already solicitous to get rid of me?"  Vaudreuil was not wrong in his surmise. I could with great pleasure have taken him by the arm, and led him out of my house towards that in which I should find his sister. I had not the least curiosity to know how he became acquainted with my secret, as he called it. It appeared to me that the story would have done equally well at- any time, and, in plain terms, that he could not have found one more mal a propos for telling it than that present; but I had my measures to keep. Vaudreuil had generously humbled both himself and his family too much before me to allow me any liberty of action where they were concerned. I had, therefore, nothing for it but patience, and I endeavored to collect myself to a decent attention. I was restless, however, at first, but the subject was still Claudine and her brothers; -it therefore again insensibly interested and tranquillized me. "I had not been long in England," said Vaudreuil, "before I wrote to St. Victoire. We had parted from each other in high dis- pleasure; but when I recollected that it might be perhaps for the last time, I could not resolve. to leave him and Claudine without any traces of me, or myself without a place in the remembrance of either. I thought it vain, however, to write to her; as he would, doubtless, again suppress my letter. Without being circumstantial, I gave him to understand that, on my arrival in England, I had fallen upon a plan by which I might secure myself from the horrors   THE SCOT1&amp;SMA.'S TALE.         141    of penury. To say truth, I was afraid of explaining the nature of my employment, lest I should irreparably offend his aristoeratical ideas; but I made it plain that I solicited nothing from him but brotherly good wishes and regard. I exhorted him to allow Clau- dine at least sometimes to write to me, and gave him my address for that purpose. I received no answer to this letter; as indeed I hardly expected I should. "A considerable time passed away, every hour of which added to * my melancholy, as I began to believe that I was fated to be always an alien from my family and connections, when, on the evening or rather night, of that day on which you and I had been in the coun- try together, I returned late to my lodgings, and, to my surprise, found a letter lying there for me directed in a female hand. It was from  Claudine, who wrote, at the desire of St. Victoire, to request my protection and assistance. They had landed together fromn a Russian merchantman at the port of Hull, driven abruptly from Petersburg by the indiscretion of St. Victoire. Claudine will give you the particulars of his quarrel with a Russian officer of distinction. - They had a meeting in consequence of it, when both were wounded, - the Russian severely. My brother, notwithstand- ing his own  suffering was put under confinement; and death or exile to Siberia seemed the punishment that awaited him. The recovery of his antagonist, however, and an interest he had the ad- dress to create for himself in the heart of a female favorite, mitigated his sentence. He  was commanded to quit the Russian territories within a  limited time, and to return thither no more under pain of death. The period allowed him to prepare for his departure was extremely short: his sickness, together with his extravagance, had left him totally unprovided with money, nor could his friend the Marquis de S--  assist him; for he had been himself obliged  9 withdraw from St. Petersburg some little time before; and his wife, from distress of circumstances, had retired to her father, the Duc de C---. In this exigency, without assistants, advisers, or friends, St. Victoire and Claudine could think of no better plan than that of coming over to England and throwing themselves upon  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6536-00000074"/>   "2         GOOD STORIES. me, - Me! - whose miserable and impoverished state you are so well acquainted with! The calculation they formed of it was, how- ever, very different from the truth. In writing to St. Victoire, I had forborne to draw it in its worst colors, both for the reasons I have before given you, and the fear lest he should suspect me of wanting any pecuniary service from him.' This delicacy on my part was the source of their error: they embarked full of chimerical hopes. Claudine has since told me that, although she dared not hint as much to St. Victoire, there was yet another heart in your island on which she relied even more entirelybthan on mine,- how justly, I bave since had ample occasion to prove! Their pas- sage was rough. My brother's wound, which had been too hastily closed, opened again; but for Claudine's knowledge of English they would have been totally helpless; and such was altogether their situation soon after they landed, that no resource remained but to write to me, and exhort me to come and extricate them from it. Alas! I had no means to do so; and Claudine's letter was, therefore, a stab to'my heart. At the moment I received it I neither possessed a single guinea, nor the means of raising one. - You were the only human being to whom I had ever applied on a similar occasion, and I now ventured- to throw myself a second time upon you. By an effort better suited to the liberality of your mind than to your circumstances, you sent me a more considerable sum than I had requested.

As to de'ar Claudine, she and I bad soon cause to regrret that we had not earlier understood each other's heart. Nothing, could be more delightful than this first intercourse between two beings so nearly allied in blood, yet hitherto strangers. Your conversation and habits of thinking, had enligphtened her mind too much to allow of her 'cherishing the prejudices which had origi- nally disunited me from my family;$ and I was no less delighted with the cultivation of her judgment than -with the charms of her person.

Claudine, on her part, was not less frank. She related to me all the secrets of her heart, and bespoke an interest ina mine for the man she loved. Imagine our' mutual surprise - our lively and exquisite Pleasure - when we found that we had in reality been talking of one and the same person There was nothing after this discovery so much the wish of either as to reach London wit} all possible despatch. Claudine had already written a long letter to you, in order to account, by a relation of the late events that had befallen St. Victoire, for a silence that had exceeded her usual limnits. At my desire she suppressed this letter. I hardly entertained a doubt hut on the receipt of it you would have come to us at the hazard probably of great inconvenience to yourself; and, to speak frankly, I also promised my own heart an indescroable satisfaction in bein r the first to announce to you those delightful sensations in which I was certain you- would sympathize. Claudine did not, I assure you, make the sacrifice I demanded of her without some regret; but she did make it, - and the rather as we had reason to suppose St. Victoilre's health would amend rapidly enou  gh to allow of our setting off without much delay. In faet you will perceive by the time of my absence that we made all possible speed. Our circmstances, nevertheless, did not allow us to choose the most commodious method of travelling, and my brother is of consequence ill and exhausted. Dy first business was, indeed, by Claudine's express desire, to seek you; nor was there more than one interest in the world that could have detained me in the pursuit of you. It was precisely that, however, which happened to occur.

If, in addition to this, I should be happy enough to recover a my family property, how joyfully shall I share my affluence with the man who was the friend of my poverty!" Vaudreuil had spoken so long, that I really began to apprehend he never intended to conclude. He was no talker in general, andA therefore I wondered the more at him. But his heart was full of his subject, as I could see in his eyes, and I believe he felt an abso- lute necessity for thus pouring it out. In spite of my impatience I had not failed, however, at intervals, to be both flattered and touched by his recital; and under any other circumstances no gratification would have been greater, perhaps, than that of listening to it. H had just then, however, a much greater in view, and I therefore hurried him away. I had gathered from- the conclusion of his dis- course that he was yet ignorant of my uncle's death, and the change it had occasioned in my worldly concerns. This was not surprising; since that I should have become, during his absence, either a guest or even a constant resident in my uncle's house, was among the occurrences of life that might naturally happen. It was now time to explain my situation to him. I could see that he was much struck with it, and felt as though Claudine and himself were sud-  denly rendered bankrupts both in fortune and in love. But the  native dignity and candor of his mind made him quickly recover from the surprise, and he rejoiced in my prosperity. "Poor St. Victoire!" said he, smiling, as we entered his lodgings;  "his pride will not even have the consolation of believing that he? is going to take an impoverished man to his bosom!" I was far from being sure that St. Victoire's pride was of so generous a nature: on the contrary, I was strongly inclined to suspect that my affluence would be the only consoling circumstance to him under a   THE SCOTSLfAN'S TALE.     -    145 the mortification of having me for a brother-in-law. I made no comment, however, on Vaudlreuil's speech; nor indeed had I time. Claudine was before my eyes,- she was in my arms, -more lovely, as it appeared to me, than ever; for that pure pleasure which springs immediately from the heart embellished her features; her person was in reality improved.  She was grown taller;- her figure, without losing its slightness, was more formed; and she had a decided character of countenance. A scene of the most unalloyed transport succeeded, and it was not immediately that I could recol- lect myself enough to think at all of St. Victoire. When I did, I was not unmoved by his paleness and apparent depression. His arm was still in bandages, and the loss of blood which he had sus- tailned had altered him very considerably. The ground between us had been rendered perfectly smooth by the kind offices of his brlother and sister. We therefore saluted each other with some degree of cordiality; and both studiously avoided all reference to the past. As the house I had lately come into possession of was spacious, I earnestly entreated the whole family to take up their abode there; and this was the more necessary, as the situation of the invalid demanded comforts and an attention he could not so well receive elsewhere. "'It seems only a question whether we shall live with you, or on you, my good friend," said Vaudreuil, perceiving my proposal had given birth to some scruples. "For my part, I think it is very clear which we ought, for our own gratification, to choose."  To this decision Claudine and St. Victoire, without much difficulty, acceded. I stayed several hours with them, and then returned home to give my mother notice of the visitors she was so soon to receive. Her surprise was at first very great. She questioned me abundantly concerning Claudine; and I could easily discover that she secretly regretted my not having chosen an Englishwoman; thou-gh even in that case, I felt that one of her own country would have been still preferable in her eyes; but she was too indulgent and too deeply interested in my happiness to raise alny obstacles to my present plans, and on my part I was persuaded that she had&#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6536-00000076"/> "6         GOOD STORIES.               * only to see the woman I had chosen in order to be convinced no other was so well worthy to be my choice. Before evening everything was in readiness to receive our guests. %My mother herself accompanied me at a very early hour to fetch the lovely Claudine to that home of which she was soon to become . the mistress. My uncle's carriage, as he had been old and infirm, was a conveyance perfectly convenient to St. Victoire, and he ar- rived at my door without much fatigue. "It is the fate of our family to be overwhelmed with your bounties, monsieur," said he, as I gave him my arm to mount the stairs. I thought it was said proudly, too. He was sufficiently a man of the world, however, not to overlook that portion of its goods with which I was surrounded. I saw him eye the apartment we sat in, which had been indeed somewhat expensively furnished by my uncle, and I could fancy I heard him say to himself "Humph ' This then is the house of an English merchant!" Vaudreuil and Claudine, on the contrary, saw not a mirror or a carpet it contained. That dear girl's spirits soon rose in sympathy with mine, and we became a pair of the most giddy, laughing lovers that can easily be imagined. To look at us, indeed, anybody would have supposed we had never known a sorrow or a care; and Vaudreuil, who had hitherto seen nothing in his sister but a pretty pensive young X woman, or in me but a sombre man of business, was perfectly aston- ished at the metamorphosis in both. We quickly seduced him, in spite of his habitual seriousness, into a participation of our mirth. And St. Victoire himself, though a little starched at first, yet, be- fore the evening closed, forgot his indisposition, his pride, and his prejudices, and condescended to have more than one hearty laugh along with us. I was very sorry when the hour of parting and repose came. Nevertheless I slept soundly, foi I was certain of seeing Claudine again in the morning; and, in return, she has since t assured me she never had a more delightful slumber than that she X enjoyed under the protection of my roof. I had judged rightly with respect to my mother: she felt herself i the happiest of creatures on being thus suddenly embosomed in a X   THE SCOTSLMAN'S TALE.         147 youthful circle, each individual of which looked up for her approving smile to sanction their own. The ingenuousness, the youthful gay- ety, the sweet playfulness of Claudine's character and manners completely won her affections, and she soon lived in her sight nearly as much as I did; nor did the former fail to cultivate this tender regard by ev ery office of duty and attention on her part. Our first business was to make a little establishment for St. Victoire that should insure the recovery of his health, and then to forward those measures that promised to be favorable for Vaudreuil. We were successful in both instances. The applications made by the latter were approved by the men in power of his own country, and he had very soon the satisfaction of learning that he might return thither without danger, to say the least; but, in fact, he had every reason to believe that he should be reinstated in great part of his rights. This was certainly no music to the ears of St. Victoire; nevertheless it was better than that the whole family should be proscribed; and the generous character of his brother left the Count no cause to doubt but he would derive his share of advantage from the return of the former to France. Nice as this business was to settle, Vaudreuil and I contrived to arrange it be- tween us. For, in spite of his political opinions, he was not without a delicate but strong repugnance to the dispossessing an elder branch of the family of his rights in life. As to Claudine, she was out of the question. I was rich enough for both, and I1 therefore, lent no ear to anything that could be said on that subject. She was now, alas! not so ignorant of the real sufferings of poverty as she had been; and this knowledge, which I had at one time so deprecated and earnestly endeavored to shield her from, became in the end an affecting monitor that taught her to feel for others when she ceased to have anything to feel or fear on "that head for her- self.

How sincerely did we all lament that the tide of human affairs should separate beings united by every principle of affection or intellect! . How gloomy was the - consideration that the human race at large, accustomed to blood, should forget in mutual animosity that sacred tie common to all!

My mother, good woman, often looks at us, and observes "that  marriages are (according to the old proverb) certainly made in  heaven."

St. *Victoire has entirely recovered the ill consequences of his  wound, and lives at no great distance from us on a pension remitted bim by his brother, who has retrieved great part of the family for- -tune. The former has not yet, however, forgotten his passion for noblesse, and is a little inclined to drop my acquaintance if we  happen suddenly to encounter each other in Bond Street or Pall  Mall. I forgive him; for he keeps the first company, and is a fine man. Vaudreuil's circle is smaller, and he, I am assured, is a very  happy one. His happiness, indeed, as well as mine, is of that tran-    THlE SCOTSMAtl  S TA-LE. "9 quil nature at which men of the world will wonder.

TRHE BLACKSMTHS OF HOLSSBY. CHAPTER     I. 'TH-E L'UCKY FIND. OF th e few trades which are carried on -successfully in villages, not one is more steadily lucrative than the blacksmith's, or, to speak more correctly, the general smith's, for the tany callings into which the business branches out in towns are here united; and the mnan who shoes the Squire's horse in the morning will hang his bells and repairhis lamps an hour afterwards, or exercise no small amount of veterinary skill in - the stable and kennel, when a favorite animal is ill or injured. The baker and butcher, the grocer and linen-draper, must pit the small debts contracted by their poorer customers against the more  certain payments of the resident gentry; beside competing with the travellers of town tradesmen, who, in irreproachable costumes and  smart traps, make their regular appearance with c articles at Lon- don prices"; recommending their goods so perseveringly and in-  sinuatingly that the female heart-rarely proof against politeness and a bargain combined-is easily subjugated; and the gayly-  painted van passes from door to door to the increased percent(age of  the dashing driver, and annoyance of the less fortunate owner of  the village shop. But the smith has little to fear from competition; i the few calls for credit made upon him by the laboring classes are  usually arranged on the receipt of their earnings; and his services  are so constantly in requisition among his wealthier neighbors, that i he can be, and generally is, a prosperous man.  And a steadily thriving one was old Ralph Thorley of Holsby.    &#xD;<pb n="-151" xml:id="VAC6536-00000079"/> I 9 \                  ' '   THE BLACIKSMTHS OF HOLSEBY.        15 Thle clinking of the hammers at his forge was the first sound that broke the stillness of the dawn, nor did it often cease until a late hour in the evening as Ralph and his strong-limbed son John- long after the usual hour for closing-labored together at some task requiring too much skill and care to be intrusted to the hands of an ordinary workman, or forged the glowing metal into horse- shoes, with a grim pleasure in rendering themselves independent of the services of the travelling shoers, who wander in pairs from smithy to smithy, returning again and again when they calculate upon a decrease of stock securing them the three or four days' em- ploymnent and high wages they demand. Year after year the father and son thus toiled on unceasingly, deeming no exertions too great which brought fair profits, and en- abled them to add to the hoard over which - like-minded in this unworthy passion-they gloated and pondered; not unfrequently murmuring the while, that, with all their endeavors, it accumulated so slowly. The elder Thorley was a widower, and a busy, noisy dame, whose industry and frugality alone reconciled the two men to her presence, had long superintended their household affairs, and at- tended to the heterogeneous stock of'ironmongery into which a part of the little dwelling was converted. But circumstances suddenly deprived them of her services, and, after an abortive effort to do without the help of womankind, Ralph's only daughter was hastily summoned home to fill her place.    . Annie Thorley was comparatively a stranger at Holsby; a sister of her dying mother had received her from the maternal bosom, and for a very small pittance - grudgingly paid - had willingly clothed and fed the motherless child, until a certain lady residing in her vicinity, attracted by the modest manners and pretty face of the little maiden, had first invited her as a guest, and subsequently kept her as a companion, until this imperative call dissolved the pleasant ties And very tearfully they parted; the elder, now dreading soli- tude, to take up her abode with some friends, and Annie to assume the duties of housekeeper to a parent she had scarcely learned to  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6536-00000080"/> love, and a brother whom, from some inexplicable feeling, she al-  ready dreaded.  Trade, however, happened to be unusually brisk; the new-comer  was economical, and her gentle ways and readiness to oblige won so  many approving speeches from the ladies who sometimes stayed  their pony carriages at the door to give orders, or negotiate for a, new watering-pot, that the critical John found few opportunities of complaining; and Ralph himself occasionally paused to bestow an encouraging word, or a pat on the cheek of the quiet, thoughtful girl who hovered about him with the tender assiduity and soft gray eyes of her dead mother; or when he lit his pipe at night, and, bending over the fire, sat mentally counting the gains of the day, would draw her chair close to his, and gliding a hand into his roughened palm, with the Bible open on her knee, would read by  the dim light some chapter before whose searching truths and warnings his own greed and worldliness momentarily sank into in-  significance; and wishes as fleeting crossed his mind that he could fling off the carks and cares furrowing his brow and cankering his heart, and, with Annie for his stay and comfort, begin the search after happiness in a wiser and holier spirit.           The smithy and adjacent dwelling stood in the centre of the vil- laae anglewise, thereby commanding the two straggling streets which composed it; but except when detained there by her-avoca- tions, Annie best loved to be in the large, roomy kitclhen, opening as it did into a carelessly cultivated but extensive garden, soipping down to the bank of a small river. It was here on a rough bench under a fine pear-tree that she often sat with her work, listening to the brawling of the mill-dam close by, enjoying the sweet scents borne on the summer breeze from the heathy hills arising in the distance, and learning to distinguish the various notes of the birds who sang amidst the boughs of the giant trees in the beautiful park on the other side of the stream. And it was in this pleasant spot that she was loitering one balmy morning, when her own name, loudly and impatiently pronounced, drew her back to the house, where John and his father had already taken their places at the neatly arranged breakfast-table.    THE BlACKSMTHS OF IIOLSBY        153 "Come, come, my maid," said Ralph, cheerfully, " we 're, a bit hurried, for we've a journey before us, and a long day's work to do." "A journey? and where to?" asked Annie, as she nimbly obeyed her brother's imperative gestures. It was John who testily replied. "Where? why, where I don't feel at all inclined to go, for I don't see that there's aught haginqg to it. We 're only made a convenience of because the London locksmiths ha' disappointed 'em. I'd like to know why I'm goina to be dragged there. I wanted to go another way to-day, and you knowed that. Wouldn't one o' the chaps ha' done just as well as me? and he looked reproachfully at his father, who answered pa- cifically, "Well, well, boy, it shall be just as ye like. I'll go an' fetch one on 'em while ye finish yer meal"; and he slowly arose from the table. 4' No," dissented John, peremptorily. "I 'I go myself now, but I can tell ye I'm getting downright sick o' this sort o' life. It's come here, go there, at everybody's beck and bidding, and when ye,'ve done, what for? Why, half a day's slavery in an empty house four miles off! Talk of free-born men, indeed!" "Nay, boy," observed Ralph, soothingly, " may be it'll lead to something better." " Ay, so you always say," was the ungracious retort; and, push- ing his plate away, the young man went out to hurry and swear at the sexagenarian, who, too old and feeble for the laborious occupa-- tion in which his vigor had-been expended, now pottered about the smithy for a trifling wage, to harness the horse, blow the bellows, and execute as well as he could the multifarious commissions hourly poured upon him from the masters down to the youngest and sau- ciest of the apprentices. "It 'll be late, may be, when we get back," said the elder Thorley to his daughter, as she brought him his hat and coat, " for I expect, from what the messenger said, that they're getting the house in trim for new-comers, and we 'll have lots of odd jobs to see to." Annie now ventured to inquire their destination. "The Manor House at Oakshade; and a   rare place it is, with  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6536-00000081"/> 154         GOOD STORIES.  tapestried rooms and secret staircases, and curious ins and outs that  'most puzzle a body. If John warn't a bit contrary to-day, I'd  like to try an' take you with us to see it. It 's been close shut up of late years, for the old Major that's been living there had got queer ways wi' hin, an' did n't like to see strangers about. Would ye like to go, my maid?" Before Annie -all her romantic tendencies aroused by such a description - could answer in the affirmative, her brother threw the door open rudely. '-Do ye mean to start this morning, father, or not? Just say, for I'm getting sick o' waiting for you." Without another thought of his daughter, Ralph shuffled away i and the next moment the wheels of the cart rattled sharply down the street, and Annie, for the first time, was left to pass the day alone. It was as the elder blacksmith had predicted, long after nightfall when the well-known trot of the sturdy Welsh pony was heard in the distance, and the lonely watcher, who had grown weary of soli- tude, and nervously awake to every unusual sound, hurried to fling open the outer door, and, holding a lantern high above her head, looked smilingly forth into the dark and tempestuous night. "How late you are!" she cried in glad tones; how weary you must be! it lightens, too, fearfully!" "Chut!" answered John, sharply, as he sprang out of the vehi- cle; " goin doors an' be quiet, can't ye? Do ye thinkwewantall the parish to turn out an' see us come home?

Mortified and indignant at such uncalled-for rudeness, Annie re-   ITHE  BLACKSMTHS   OF HOLSBY.    155 treated to the kitchen, and resumed her needle-work, listening the while with some surprise to the movements of the twain, whoi per- folrmed for themselves the offices in the stable usually delegated to the " old man ; and finally entered the house, locking and barring the entrances and shutters with an excess of caution unusual and uncalled for in a rural spot where the crime of burglary was al- most unknown. But a reason for these precautions was soon apparent. Care- fully wrapped in the horse-cloth they carried something weighty, over which they whispered earnestly, as they deposited it on a .dis- tant table, - whispering with an air of triumph and curiosity, and many a sharp backward glance, as if they still feared that some crack in a door or. casement would permit a prying eye to watch their movements. Of Annie's presence they were either careless or oblivious, until, her attention excited by their mysterious be- havior, she joined them, uttering a cry of astonishment and admi- ration as she beheld the object over which the absorbed men were bending. It was an iron chest, of workmanship rare enough to have been fashioned by the cunning hand of Quentin Matsys himself, and as they again scrutinized the intricate lock which had hitherto defied their efforts, she demanded whose it was, and from whence it came. "Peace, peace," muttered her-father, startled to find her so near. "Peace, I say, or we shall have some one hear ye. It is mine,- that is, ours, - mine and John's; we found it hid away in a secret closet in the room where the old Major died, and by the weight it must be full of treasure. - A lucky find for us, my girl! a- glorious find!" and he chuckled and rubbed his hands together with a glee that was, as his son sharply told him, somewhat premature. "True," said Ralph, instantly sobering, and hurriedly turning over the tools they had brought in with them. "True-it is; but see here, we'll soon know the best or the worst; stand aside, boy!" Avarice, however, deprived him of his usual skill; his breath  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6536-00000082"/> came quickly, his limbs trembled, and with a sigh he relinquished the task to John, standing over him with a candle, and prompting and watching him with feverish impatience. Annie's low tones unpleasantly broke in upon his - visions of wealth.  But, father, dear, - but, John, - is this right? Has not this chest an owner? It is to him that it should be given up." With an impatient murmur, her brother flung off her restraining fingers, and continued his efforts; but Ralph's flushed face paled, and he shifted about uneasily, surprised and annoyed at the unex- pected objection. "The 'owner's dead,"-he said, with a half-laugh,- dead and gone long -ago, and findings is keepings in our country, my maid. Besides, the' thing's been hidden years and years; and the house has changed hands over and over again in my time. Who can have a better right to it than we, eh? Is it yielding yet, boy? An- other turn will do it. That is it, that's it! Well done, well done! Catch hold o' the light, girl; and now -  John wiped the perspiration from his heated brow, and, bidding Annie keep back, he roughly chided the old man, who was eagerly diving into the chest for gold, and then with great deliberation lifted out the articles it contained. At the top lay a small roll of papers, tied up with extreme care, and around it some old trinket boxes, which, on being examined, were found well filled with valuable gems, in settings discolored and tarnished by the length of time they had apparently lain there unused. In a casket of more modern date, rows of pearls from Ormuz were mingled with the massive ear-rings and armlets of some Oriental beauty. These Ralph weighed and examined with gloating eyes. M Ioney's worth!" he muttered,-" all money's worth! A lucky, lucky find 1" A few packets of old letters -still retaining a faint odor of patchouli-twere then carelessly tossed aside with some knick- knacks, doubtless preserved less for their value-than for the mem-   THE BLACKS1I THS OF HOLSBY.        157 ories pertaining to them; and, lastly, the searchers discovered a canvas bag, curiously labelled in crabbed letters, "The fruit of Birdie's Rose-tree." This, on being opened, was found to contain coins of all sizes, ages, and descriptions, from the well-preserved sestertii of the Roman emperors, to the sovereigns and half-sover- eigns of the present epoch- and a pocket, contrived in the side of the bag, was stuffed with bank-notes, varying in value from five pounds to a hundred. As the blacksmiths sat down rejoicing to sort out and count their gains, the grieving, dissatisfied Annie again interfered. "There is some mistake here, father; this chest cannot have been hidden so long as you imagined; see, these sovereigns have not left C3W V             CDII1LIG ^VZC' U "I the flint more than three years." He did not appear- to hear her. "Dearest father, you will try and find out whom it belongs to, will not you? it would be- dishonest to keep it." "Are you a born fool?" demanded John, snappishly. "If the box had an owner, hain't you heard that lhe's dead and buried, and strangers come into the property? Would you ha' us go out into the street, and tell everybody what we've got, and ask 'em to walk in and take a share?" "I would have you do what is hzonest and right, " she answered, firmly. The father interfered to avert the burst of wrath he saw im- pending. "Of course, my maid, of course; that's what we mean to do; we know what we're about, so go you to bed at once, and leave us to set things straight. You're a good girl, Annie; a well-meaning, trusty girl, that would n't do a wrong thing; of course not; no more would we; only ye see, my maid, if the things have been hidden and forgotten years and years, it can't harm no one if we do keep 'em; and your poor old father won't have to work so hard as he has done; and may be there 'll be a handsome presents for his dar- ling, eh?" But she shook her head with the air of one still unconvinced.  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6536-00000083"/> "You know, dear father, they cannot have been hidden for any  length of time; and then there are the papers; if we examine those, they will tell us all that we want to learn*" She hastened to seize them, but John's stalwart arm was in-    stantly extended to prevent the act, and Ralph himself caught up  the roll and buttoned it inside his coat, saying, as he did so, -  c Not to-night, my maid, not to-night; it's late, and we re tired.  Some other time will do just as well, so do you go to bed. I wish it, - I insist on it." Further remonstrance was so utterly unavailing that she pre- pared to obey. The father kissed and blessed her with unusual tenderness.  "You'll keep this a secret for my sake, won't ye, dear! Just till we've made up our minds how best to settle it, eh?" "She 'd best do so," interposed John, knitting his stern brows  ominously. "I'll not be hauled off to prison through her blabbing, I can tell ye." To prison! The words sent such a thrill through her whole frame that she was obliged to lean on a chair for support.  To prison! For God's sake run no such fearful risks! Take it back to the place where you found it; pray take it back! Money got like this will surely bring a curse with it." "Confound the girl!" exclaimed John, starting up in a fury, c she 'll rouse the place with her foolish preaching. Are we to be dictated to by her? Take care," he continued, with a menacing gesture,-" take care, I say; I'm not the man as 'll be talked to, or spied over, by you; take care, I say!" His attitude was so threatening that Annie permitted her less de- monstrative but equally determined father to draw her from the room, and at his request she retired to her own chamber, there to lie and listen to the occasional chink of gold below, and the deep voices of her relatives, until sleep overcame her,-but only to bring back, in dreams replete with horror, the covetous looks and grasping hands of old Ralph, and the fierce threats of John, towards whom the shrinking fear she had so long entertained was now deepening into mingled terror and aversion.   - Ace   jICAce1Y11luS 1 wj HOL SBY.   159 -CHAPTER     II. SCHEMNG. WITH the following morning all traces of the " lucky find " dis- appeared, and when the anxious Annie, seizing the first opportunity of being alone with her father, souoht to ascertain his intentions, he evaded her queries with the smiling craftiness inherent to his nature, and inet her timid warnings and entreaties with unmeaning t ods and afirmatives, and then slipped away in spite of her efforts to detain him. Many days passed by without the subject being adverted to, or any apparent change taking place in their home intercourse; yet Annie knew, although it would have puzzled her to define how and when it was, that a barrier was steadily arising between her and those the legality of whose acts she had ventured to doubt and question. Her attentions were still accepted, but the nightly readings of the Bible were discontinued on the plea that a violent cold rendered it diffitcult for Ralph to hear them with pleasure, and tete-a-tetes with his son, from which she was sedulously excluded, usurped their place. She had, too, a galling conviction, that, although John seldom addressed her, his eye was upon her continually. If a gossipina neighbor paused to accost her, he would find'some employment in the shop that enabled  him to linger near enough to overbear all that passed; Her letters to her aunt, and the good old patroness from whor they had sunmoned her, unaccountably disappeared from the shelf where they lay,  awaiting the coming of the lad whose business it ,Inas to convey them to the post-office; and twice, when she   had put on her bonnet and shawl to seek in a briski country walk relief from the oppressive atmosphere of home and her own thoughts, Ralph called her back on some trifling pretext or other, and detained her by his side until it became too late to go.  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6536-00000084"/> GOOD STORIES.  *Itasbto evident that they doubted and feared her.

Once at their journey's end it would have been difficult to feel a regret on the subject, and the vast expanse of the waters, the broad solitary beach, and the delight of watching the receding tide, proved so very attractive to the maiden that it was with great difficulty she could quit the glorious scene for the rest and refreshment provided for them at a secluded cottage which stood in a nook among some rocks, and was better built, and tenanted by a family a grade higher than the dwellers in the wretched huts, half a mile lower down, which constituted the village. The celerity with whichl an excellent dinner was set before the travellers was so marvellous in this out-of-the-way place, that even Annie, usually so unobservant, commented on it, laughingly asking their hostess if a fairy had announced their coming, a question at which John frowned and her father looked uncomfortably confused; but the woman made some unmeaning reply; and, too happy to be disconcerted just. then by the surliness of her brother, she soon coaxed Ralph back to the beach, to. aid her researches after shells and sea-weeds. With basket and handkerchief filled to repletion, Annie at last seated herself on a large stone to sort and arrange her ocean waifs; but the old man, with a restlessness for which she playfully chided him, wandered to and fro, his head studiously averted from John, who lay on the sands at some distance, apparently reading, but in reality impatiently surveying their movements. By and by, in obedience to a signal from .his son, Ralph slowly approached his unconscious daughter, but moved away without addressing her, as -her voice softly raised in song fell upon his ear. Again John whistled, and, sighing heavily, his father returned to Annie, and, sitting -down beside her, put an arm caressingly around her. "Do ye like this place, my maid? - would it please ye to stop here a bit?" 6 All, yes! how nice it would be if we could!

I long to climb to the highest point of them!" "Then it really would please you to be here, would it? Well, you deserve the treat, and you shall stay for a week or two; I will fetch you home myself. " She looked up gratefully, but shook her head. "You are very kind, dear father, but I could not wish that; to be here with you would be real enjoyment, but to remain alone would not afford me the slightest pleasure." a Icould not stay, " cried Ralph, hastily; " you talk nonsense, my maid. I could not neglect business to hunrt for shells; but it's a different thing* wi' you; and I shall fetch you home in a fortnight or three weeks, at the furthest." Annie now dropped her sea-weeds, and endeavored to meet his wandering glances. "You speak as if your mind was made up, to leave -me here.' "Yes, yes, - as you wish it so much." The color instantly faded from her cheek. To leave me here - alone - and where? with whom?" He eagerly entered into explanations. At the house where they had dined, the people were civil and obliging; they would provide her with a comfortable room, &amp;c. a It is already arranged then!" cried the startled girl. "I see it all now; this was planned before I arrived! John was away a whole day last week; perhaps he came here then. O father, what does it mean?" He drew her back to the stone from which she had risen. "Now do hear reason, my child; sit quietly down and listen to me. If I have panned your staying here, why, 'tis foryour own good and comfort. John and you don't get on well together, and we're thinking of making a great change at home. Perhaps he'll marry, - it's likely he will, - marry and leave me, and then you 'll come back and read to me, as you used to do, and we too will be very cosey and comfortable together, eh? Hush, dear, it's only for a week or so thatel want you to keep quiet, and let him'have his own way, - only for a week or so."

CHAPTER III. THE AYMER FAMLY. TEE two or three weeks which were to have been the limits of Annie Thorley's sojourn at the fishing village had lengthened into months, and still she remained there, apparently forgotten, except that the stipulated sum for her board was punctually forwarded. Her letters of remonstrance were unanswered, or merely received a few words of reply, and tlhose. transmitted through her keepers; and their purport was always the same,-that Soon, very soon, her father was'coming to fetch her, and she was to be quiet and Patient. In the mean time use had partly reconciled her to a lot at first too terrible to dwell upon; and, kindly treated, and permitted to go where she would with but sright restrictions, she inwardly acknowl- eged that even this state of things was better than being a helpless and disapproving witness of the uses to which the contents of tile iron, chest were doubtless applied. Still, at the beste it was but a sad and sorry life to which their guilty fears had condemned her, and she was fast sinking into a morbid state of mind, when accident -the trifling circumstance of sheltering beneath a rock, during a ^^             ^'      rf   THE BLACKSMTHS OF IOLSBY.         165 heavy shower, with the inmates of a pretty cottage half a mile nearer the town -gave a new zest to existence. Annie's acquaintances were a brother and sister, imbued with too muchl courtesy and humanity to betray the belief they shared, in common with all others, of her lunacy, and full of a generous de- sire to ameliorate the misery of such an affliction by all those little tendernesses which their sympathy prompted, and their small income and scanty leisure permitted. Her heart expanded beneath the gentle influence of their unex- pected courtesy; she gladly received the smiling invitation of the pretty Grace to visit her, and thankfully accepted an offer to in- itiate her into the mysteries of fabricating curious baskets, &amp;c., from the sea-weeds and shells they rambled to amass, and which Grace frankly confessed she made to sell at the fancy repositories of a fashionable watering-place a few miles distant. This first visit was followed by many; and the brother and sister, when conferring together, quickly agreed, that, whatever the malady might have been that first brought their-calm, self-possessed visitor into the neighborhood, there were no traces of it remaining, and that at the present moment she was undoubtedly as sane as themselves. And as Annie herself offered no explanations,-making no al- lusions to her former life, - they wisely abstained from any curiosi- ty on the subject; sharing with her their few and simple enjoy- ments, welcoming her whenever she came, and permitting her to repay them in her own way, and vent the gratitude with which her naturally loving nature overflowed in tender assiduities to their only surviving parent; the ailing mother, whose flickering lamp of life her children watched and tended with a devoted affection that thought no toil heavy, no sacrifice a pang, if it soothed the suffer- ings so long and patiently endured. There was about this family an innate refinement which seemed to hint that they had once known fairer prospects, and they pos- sessed a few articles of luxury which strongly contrasted with the homely furniture of their dwelling; but, whatever their circum- stances might have been, it was now very evident that they wholly  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6536-00000087"/> depended on Arthur's salary as clerkc at the County Bank in the town already referred to, and the earnings of his sister, whose taste- ful trifles were, as is too generally the case wth female hanaiork  miserably renumerated.                 t Not a sighing allusion to the past, not a murmur against the NotZ               t ihn i" ',6^ c ruly unselfish;, and present, ever crossed their lips. They were truly unselfish; andj though Annie had sometimes -seen Arthur's head droop on his breast when he believed hilmself alone, and Grace's tears fall fast as she bent over her employment, they had always a sile and a  cheerful word for each other; and Mrs. Almer was often lulled a into temporary forgetfulness of wakeful nights and weary day, as they alternately read, sang, or conversed beside her easy-rehair, ex- thanging triumphant glances when they won, a smile to her pallid hanglip, or beuiled the grave Annie into a fit of merriment, -a feat so diffieult as to be frequently attempted, and itssuccess de- Ighted in.                    oe  n Unaccstomed to male society until her return home, and treaccusthered asancsaybttoublesm   apedage, to whom it  rould be ridiculous to pay the commonest courtesies of daily life, the attentions which Arthur's natural politeness prompted towards the , attentions which Arthur1s natta first with01',   wondering gentle friend of his sister were received at first with w ondering blushes, and subseqently with modest pleasure, and a shy hope, scarcely confessed to herself, that they we induced by deeper n   than mere friendship; and the intensity of delight with directed towards her can scarcely be comprehended save by those who have had as few to prize them, or whose ties of kindred have been as suddenly and entirely rent.  The winds of winter now began to creep mournfully around Mrs.  Aylmer's cottage, and heavy rains threatened partial interruption  to Annie's frequent and welcome visits; te pens to w hose are she was intrusted considering themselves happily freed from the trouble of guarding her, and, while she came and vent at stated hours, refrtning from an undue interference with her actions. And daily her presence at the cottage became more eagerly looked   for and more useful; for Mrs. Aylmer's illness increasing with th e inclemency of the weather, she was frequently confined to her chamber, and the cares and occupations of Grace so much in- creased, that it was only by robbing helrself of rest she could make up the amount of those earnings now needed, in their necessarily frugal household, more than ever they had been. And here it was that Annie came to the rescue, sometimes filling, the place of the anxious daughter in the sick-room,-sometimes completing the work Grace had almost despairingly laid aside. In the innumerable ways, and with the delicate tact a woman's thoughtful nature brings to the task, she became an invaluable helper to each and all of them; and felt herself doubly repaid for every effort by a word of earnest thanks from the grateful Arthur, or the warm kiss and the " dear, kind Annie," of his more demonstrative sister, They were sitting together one chilly evening in December, when the weather and Mrs. Aylmer's increasing weakness com- bined to render their attempts at cheerfulness abortive; and Arthur was reading aloud mechanically, with but a poor appreciation of the merits of the work he had selected when the silence which reigned without was suddenly broken by the unusual sounds of car- riage wheels and a loud ring at the gate-bell. Before either of the surprised trio could reply to the summons, they heard a light step run rapidly up the little garden; the latch was lifted, and on the threshold appeared a young girl, the opera- cloak which she threw back with an impatient movement but half concealing her glistening ball-dress and jewelled arms and throat. The rain had dishevelled her long fair hair, and excitement had deeply flushed her delicate cheek, while large tears hung on the lashes and filled the soft blue eyes which,-dazzled by coming suddenly into the light, - she hastily shaded with her hand as she gazed around. But Arthur's exclamation, "Good God! Ethelind!" no sooner met her ear, than, with a glad cry, she sprang forward, and was instantly clasped to his bosom; looking up for a moment to fling an arm round Grace, and again hiding her blushes and tears.  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6536-00000088"/> 168         GOOD STORIES. Before Annie could rally her bewildered faculties, Ethelind raised herself, and, after an earnest and sorrowful perusal of the faces bending so tenderly over her, exclaimed, reproachfully,- "Cruel Arthur! Cruel Grace! Why did you not write to me? Have you, too, conspired to keep me in ignorance of your misfor- tunes? or have you been led to believe me as indifferent as the rest of the world? But no," she continued, impetuously, " you could not doubt me!  Indeed, indeed, they have sedulously concealed it all from me, and when I wondered and fretted at your not meeting us at Paris as we agreed, they soothed and deceived me with a false tale, basely concocted for the purpose. We only reached home last evening, and, an hour ago, while dressing for a ball, at which they I?  had allowed me to suppose I should meet my dearest friends, my aunt hesitatingly confessed the truth, and - and - I told her how I hated her for her treachery! How dared she -how dared my uncle- Her passionate emotion checked-her; and Arthur gravely spoke. You must not judge your guardians thus, harshly, Ethelind. They may have erred in not acting more candidly with you; but I cannot cavil with their wisdom in separating us, when they knew that I had lost all hope of ever calling you mine. Your uncle appealed to my honor, and I voluntarily promised not to see you again." Tears now streamed down the eloquent features raised to his. "You could do this, Arthur Aylmer, and without seeing or con- sulting me? Had you then ceased to love me?" He averted his head in silence. She wrung her hands, and sobbed passionately. "Don't tell me that, Arthur! I can bear anything but that. It can't, it can't be true!" Unable to resist the piteous appeal, the young man suddenly turned and drew her back to his bosom. "Love you, Ethie? as my life! Love you? ah! too well to make you the partner of such hopeless poverty as ours!

"Do you know," she faltered, " that I am homeless?-that, unless you afford me the shelter of your roof, I know not where to turn my steps? You look incredulous, but it is the truth. My uncle solemnly vowed that if I sough't you this night, my foot should never again cross his threshold , -that he would renounce me frol that moment; and-I cane."

THiREE days passed heavily away;   and, truly compaininf  of violent pains in her head, Annie confined herself to her chamber; but the afternoon of the follo wing one brought Grace Aylmer to  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6536-00000089"/> inquire the reason of her lengthened absence, and to pity and regret the ilness under which she was evidently ie  after     seein sieik attnden soluoe'o^  ta With the mistaken idea of enlivening her sick and solitary friend,  Grace threw off her shawl and stayed to tal over the events hich  occupied her own mind, little dreatming what pans she inflicted when dilating on Ethelind's beauty, her devotedness, and the cer- tainty of Arthur's union with her taking place immediately, if the - family ofstothur't uis on w nlaa         Aylmerde s appeal to her uncle's forbearance, counelled by Mrs Aylmer, remained unanswered.

It is so unpleasant, and indeed so worse than useless to dwell on such incurable grievances, that I rarely care to enter on the subject; but now you shall know all. Will it tire you too much to hear a long story?"                 l Satisfied with Annie's assurance to the contrary, Grace rapidly related the events of her childhood,-the sudden death of her father, the subsequent indigence of his widow, and the generous assistance instantly proffered by a bachelor cousin, an ex-major of the East Indian army, who, after ama ssing considerable wealth in the East, had returned to end his days in his native country. Eccentric in all his habits, the major led the life of a recluse, seldom visiting the relatives he befriended, or permitting them to visit him; but he allowed 'Mrs. Aylmer a handsome yearly income, and educated her son in a style befitting the heir of the property which he openly declared his intention of bestowing upon him at his death. But this occurred in a fit of apoplexy, and the careful search repeatedly made for the will, which his solicitor and confiden- tial servant both averred. to be in existence, proved unavailing.

J JL * j  Worse than all, a few days before the appalling seizure, he had shut limself up in his own room, and, as if with a presentiment of  approaching dissolution, had been employed for several hours in ;orting and arranging his papers, of which he had got through a    i very large, pile. Could the testamentary document have been amongst those so carefully destroyed? and, if so, from what motive? It was true hat in his last letter to Mrs. Aylmer he had pettishly complained f Arthur's neglect of some commission he had intrusted to him to execute; but the complaint was accompanied with a set of diamond  ;tuds to refresh the young man's memory, and a jesting allusion to  he fascinating Ethelind, to whose protracted -absence on a Conti-  iental tour he chose to attribute her lover's forgetfulness. Thus, wholly unable to substantiate any claim to the inheritance ie had been taught to expect, Arthur had been obliged to make vay for the heir at law, and to view life under a very different tspect. His mother, always delicate and nervous, sank beneath this reverse of fortune, and became dangerously ill; and her son, ilarmed for himself, and assured by a physician that sea air alone :ould afford her relief, thankfully accepted a clerkship in the town )n the Sussex coast, procured for him through the intervention of a riend; there, manfully stifling his own sorrows, he endeavored to ;ink into obscurity with the same unmurmuring patience as the warm-hearted, brave-spirited Grace, whose utter self-abnegation lad early shamed him into a show of resignation; and in assuming he virtue, he had almost succeeded in possessing it, when the ippearance of the long-loved and deeply regretted Ethelind had Iroused his dormant affection into all its former ardor.

This you will say was but a jesting speech and might not mean anything; but the old valet, who had been with him for many years, declares that his master had a canvas bag la- belled, ' The fruit of Birdie's Rose-tree,' in which he frequently- Are you faint, dear Annie? thoughtless creature that-I amI my silly chattering has mhade you worse!" Groaning and shivering, the unhappy girl gasped out an assurance that she should be better alone, and after vainly proffering simple remedies, and begging the mistress of the house to be kind and at- tentive, Grace reluctantly withdrew. Who shall attempt to trace the workings of a mind so distracted as Annie Thorley's? - All the unmerited sufferings of the Aylmers, all the guilty consequences of her father's ill deed, oppressed her; and what steps to take she lay unable to surmise. To permit Ar- thur to be wronged any longer was out of the question but how procure the restitution of the packet of papers which assuredly con- tained the missing will? Perhaps - and she started up in dismay- they were no longer in existence. Poor Grace's fortune was un- doubtedly spent; and the jewels-possibly sold. This must be ascertained, and immediately;$ but how? Written appeals, experience had already taught her, would be worse than useless; nay, would, in all probability, lead to the instant flight of the guilty men. "I must escape from here, " she cried ; "I must go home. My father is not wholly bad; he loves me; lhe will listen to me; I shall regain my old influence over his heart, and he will-as far as may - lie in his power - restore the contents of the chest. Who knows but that he is already repenting its unfortunate discovery, and will joyfully hail this opportunity of flinging off the oppressive secret?" Aroused to fresh strength by these reflections, she hastily dressed,  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6536-00000091"/> and began to plan an immediate fight. The small sums Grace had taught her to earn, some impulse had induced her to keep carefully concealed, and these she now joyfully drew from their hiding-places. There was but just enough to pay the railway fare to London; but, once there, Annie feared nothing; and, eager to feel herself free, she assumed her bonnet and shawl, and, telling the surprised woman of the house that she fancied a walk on the beach would relieve the violent pains in her head, leisurely strolled away in the direction of Mrs. Aylmer's cottage. To. pass this unnoticed was usually easy enough, for Grace was too busy, and Mrs. Aylmer too ill, to take heed of occasional foot- steps; but now a light figure was flitting up and down the path, or lingering at the gate to watch for Arthur's return, and Annie sick- ened as she crept by the happy possessor of the love at which she despised herself for aspiring. Once away from the familiar objects, her courage returned, and with assumed ease she threaded the streets of the town, awaited in secret terror the appearance of the next train, and at last, with inex- pressible relief, found herself safely deposited at the London terminus, penniless, but buoying up her weakened spirits with hopes that a greater experience of human nature would have taught her to be. very insecurely based. It was now evening, and to reach Holsby that night, and on foot, was impossible; so, after a long inward debate, Annie wended her way towards her aunt's, expecting there, at least, to meet with a cordial reception. But a sickening disappointment attended her coming; the kindly bosom into which she had at last determined to pour the whole of her anxieties, the upright mind from which she would have obtained good counsel in her difficulties, was closed against her forever. This second mother to her infancy was dead, and the wonderings of the neighbors at her ignorance of an event of which her father had been made cognizant rendered the shock doubly painful. Indeed her distress became so overpowering, that a good-natured woman   led her into her own homely domicile, insisting upon keeping her there until the morn.? there until the rorning; and Annie, whose small modicum of strength had been sorely taxed by the excitement and sorrow of the last few days, was only too thankful to comply.  CHAPTER V. THE RETURN     TO HOLSBY. THE fires in the smithy at Holsby were gleamning through the thick mist and flinin, their rays here and there into the gathering darkness of a wintry twilight; and men on their way home from field-work paused to bask awhile in the inviting warmth, and to jest and gossip with the brawny smiths as they gathered round the anvil to weld the tires on some huge ag on-wheels, when a weary-look. in   mdbsa ',Z                    o in, mud-bespattered female cautiously peered in, alndafter some minutes succeeded in catebinff   ; Y   :^       a    f I   minute s su e in   n the eye of " Old Billy who, uttering one or two rough exclamations of surprise, left his employment and then hobbled out. " Why 't aint you, is it  7 they said you 'd gon6 abroad!  "Where      are they r?" cried Annie; "m y father-John-tller . are strangers in the house! where are they gone ?  " " Eh! gone ? what, don't ye know, then? why, where la' ye been all this long while  ?"then ? why                 e ha     e bee " Where are they?     O . do tell me, pray tell e!

John was mnarried, then! "Tell me how far it is to this farm, and which way I must go", she urged, ignoring his questions.  With much circumlocution the garrulous old man at length sup- plied her with the necessary directions, and, bidding him farewell, Annie walked out of the village where she dreaded fulrther recognition -as briskly as her wet' clothes and aching limbs per- mitted; and Bill resumed his place at the bellows, to tell his curious mates the particulars of this interview, and to go over with them, for the hundredth time, the strange circumstance of the Thorleys becoming rich men so suddenly expatiatingir the while on their in- creasing greed and niggardliness,. The trim farm-house on the hillside, with its white walls and ex- tensive outhuildings, was visible in the pale moonlight long before  Annie reached the newly painted gates; and the view of its rural opulence, the lowing of the many cows, the bleating of the carefully folded sheep, sounds and sights at which under other circumstances  she would have rejoiced, now filled her with indignation ; and it was  with a firm step and almost defiant look that she stepped into the well-furnished sitting-room, and suddenly presented herself to the  astonished party cosily seated at the tea-table. Ralph was the last to perceive her entrance. His chair drawn close to the fire, his hands oni his knees, the appearance of that bent  form and those grizzled locks touched the heart of his child with a feeling of pity; and, unheeding the "What brings you here? ' of John, she went to the side of her father, and, luttingt her arm round his neck, besought him to bless and welcome her. Young Mrs. Thorley, the tall, dashing daughter of a wealthy inn- keeper in the country town, drew nearer to her husband, and asked in an audible whisper if this was the sister who was-; and Annie heard him reply in the affirmative. But she had not come to remonstrate, or demand justice for herself; it was for Arthur that she must plead and conciliate, and if possiblej-and--now as   1"r -LAcIKSMTHS OF HOLSBY.         1" she scrutinized their hard, worldly faces, hope began to fade,- awaken in them those better qualities supposed to be dormant in all. It"An -  an   ^"teaies supposed to be dormant in all. "And-and," said Ralph, at last, taking courage at her passive- nessc and what has brought you here, my mnaid? I as coming to r have business with you and John, she answered, quietly, "that admitted of no delay." The men cast a furtive glance at each other, both possessed with the same idea,-that Annie, wearying of her in- come to propose some terms to them, and perhaps intended to rid them of her presence forever; and influenced by this thought, with extraordinary graciousness John bade his wife pour out some tea for their guest, and asked how she came. "I have walked from London" she replied, recalled by the query to a sense of extreme fatigue. "Humphl" said John, "6 I s uppose you must stay to-aight. "If you please said Annie, meekly. 3lrs. Thorley coughed significantly; but her husband did not ap- pear to notice the signal, and a long silence ensued, du w the anxious girl carefully perused the deepened lines on her father's  fae, and at ast asked him if it had not pained him to give up his I haeerful if laborious calling.          g Ralph heaved a sigh, and the young wife hastened to reply, "Yes, it is dull for Mr. T. here, very dull indeed. If his business had not been such a dirty, low sort of trade, Mr* John Thorley and my- self would n't have wished him to give it up; but my relations are so highly respectable! O. it 's awfull for him there, and  it re do wonder," her voice sunk a tone, " that, having such a nice row of pleasant houses of his own just out of London, he don't go and have in one of them. It would be a great relief to us to see him comfortably settled." So he was already in the way; and he knew it, for his eyes varaed vindictively under their shaggy brows, and he shrugged his As Mrs. Thorley removed the tea equipagre she beckoned her  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6536-00000093"/> husband out, and Annie, whose ears were open to every sound, heard her passionately declare that she neither could nor would sleep under the same roof with a madwoman; that it was enough if she endured the presence of Mr. Thorley's father; but that, if this additional annoyance was to be inflicted upon her, she could go home.  With the cool retort that she had better do so, he would fetch her when he wanted her, John sauntered away; and, without con- descending to offer the slightest apology to Annie, his passionate wife proceeded to put her threat into execution. One of the farm lads harnessed a horse, the clhaise was brought out, and long before Mr. John Thorley returned to receive the angry message left for him, she had departed, little dreaming that her absence was pre- cisely what her husband most wished for, while the presence of his sister rendered the betrayal of his secret a remote possibility. Thus left to themselves, with a voice that gathered strenath as she proceeded, Annie simply but pathetically described the Aylmer family, from her first acquaintance with them to the arrival of Ethelind, and her, own discovery that the contents of the iron chest would restore them to affluence. She dwelt strongly upon the ge-n- erosity of Arthur's disposition, and her conviction that a frank avowal of the circumstances under which they were tempted to possess themselves of the hidden treasure would disarm what anger he might justly express; offering to be herself the, mediator, and ending her recital with an earnest appeal to both men to lay aside all worldly passions, and, as they themselves hoped for God's mercy, to make instant restitution to the innocent and worthy young man on whom this one sinful act would entail so much sorrow and penury. "But- but you forget- you forget that he had looked for the will and could not find it; that all search had been given up when we found the box; that if John and me had n't hit upon it as we did, it would have lain hidden forever." Thus argued Ralph. And will sudch a poor plea as this satisfy your conscience, father?" asked Annie, kneeling beside him, and looking earnestly   into his face, " Is this acting as man should act to man? Are you happier for the possession of this money? No, no, I see you are not. And think, father dear, if death should come,-as come it must,-the horror of dying with such a load upon your heart! Father, John, be merciful to yourselves; it is not too late! Restore Arthur Aylmer to his rightful inheritance, and if you would be rich, let it be by honest toil." Ralph bent his head on his hands, and John walked to and fro, his brow growing darker and darker. He stopped before the still kneeling Annie, and asked abruptly,- "Does Mr. Aylmer know of your coming?" No." "Does any one? or have you hinted this affair to any one?- on your honor?" ' On my honor," said Annie, " no." He looked keenly at her.  "You seem strangely interested in this young man, -ready to do anything for his sake." The blood rose on her cheek, but she replied, firmly, - "Anything but betray you." ; And if we refuse to compromise ourselves, what course do you intend to take, eh?" She raised her hands entreatingly. "Put not such a fearful alternative before me! On the one side, the fair fame, the safety, of those nearest to me; on the other side, i the right. What could I do? God help me, and save me from  such a strait!"  John strode forward and fiercely grasped his father's arm.  "In defiance of my better judgment you have kept those ac-  cursed papers ; where are they? Produce them, I say!I "Safe, boy, safe," said Ralph, writhing in that powerful clutch.  "Are wte safe?" his son retorted, significantly. "Can we :be safe until-" He pointed towards the fire.

Annie won't do aught to hurt her oo o ld fathe r, and may be she  think better of it after a night's rest." He persisted in avoiding her reproachful glance; and after a mo- mentary struggle between anger and prudence, John flung himself into a chair. WhileAnnie was hesitating whether it would be wiser to wait, or to resume the subject at once, Ralph hobbled awayfor a light. "Now, my maid, you're tired; I 'll show ye where you're to sleep." She rose and twined her arms round him. "But, father, you will not let me go to bed without some hope? Tell me that you will think seriously of what I have been urging, and pray for Divine guidance, will you?" He hastily put her away from him. -"To-morrow, my maid; to-morrow." "And why not now?" she still pleaded, but only to receive the same evasive reply; so, depressed and very doubtfulof what that morrow would bring forth, she followed him up a staircase leading to a small servants' room over the kitchen.   Here he bade her good night, and moved away; but while she still stood where he left her, almost overpowered with emotion and weariness, yet excitedly blaming herself for not having pressed the matter more closely and eloquently, a returning step smote on her ear. She drew nearer the door, and listened; the key. was outside, and Ralph was creeping back to lock her in. As he gently seized it his daughter confronted him. "No, father, you shall not make me your prisoner! Shame upon you" Muttering something, she knew not what, the old man retreated, and, her suspicions thoroughly awakened by- this act, Annie re- solved to return to the room below, and stay there for the rest of the night. John and his father had now drawn their chairs into the chimney- corner, and, leaning over the dying embers, were conversing in whispers. So absorbed had they become that her approach was unheard, and she was hesitating whether to advance or retreat, when her own name, coupled with words of terrible significance, arrested her, and, shrinking down on the lowest stairs, she breathlessly en- deavored to hear more. By and by they spoke with less caution. "It's all true enough, boy; but she "s my own child, an' I can't abide the thoughts on it." "Can you propose anything better ?' "We 'll may be talk her over," suggested Ralph. "Bosh! " cried John. 1" Can't you see she 's over head and ears in love with this young chap, and that she 'II not let anything stand in her way to serve him ? I tell ye we 're in the toils, and there 's no other way of saving ourselves." "But how could ye do it? There 's doctor s certifkies to get; and then, mind ye, I won't have her ill used; nor I won't have it done till I 've tried to make her give in to us quietly." "What good will that do?" asked John, contemptuously. ;'I tell ye, father, once for all, you imust and shall do one thing or t'other at once.

' Annie was no heroine; of her brother she had always stood in awe; and now, as his brawny hands held her with a vice-like te- nacity, her utter helplessness appalled her. He saw the advantage. "Will you swear?" "Never!" cried Annie. "Father, father! save me! Can you sit by and see me so cruelly used?" But Ralph was deaf to the appeal. "You will not swear?"' said John, deliberately. "Father, come here." He rose in obedience to the imperative call. Our lives are not safe with a madwoman in the house. Call up one of the shepherds, and bid him go to the town for a fly.

"'No, no!" shrieked the overwrought girl, exaggerating in her alarm the real perils of her position.  Come back, --come back! O father! John! have mercy upon me!" "Swear!" said John, relentlessly; and still held by his cruel hands, menaced with his ruthless eyes, and overcome with fatigue and misery, Annie at last repeated the fearful oath  The reaction came  instantly.

Which would - turn the scale, - his child, or his money? Ralph rocked himself to and fro, and ran his withered hands through his hair. "It's a hard thing to do, -a hard thing!

"Leave it all to me, " cried his son, " and by this time to-mor- row -" Unable to restrain herself any longer, Annie now rushed for- ward:  "No, no, you cannot, - shall not do it!

She ran towards the door, but ere the bolts yielded to her efforts, John had seized and brought her back. The old man, abject and trembling, cowered closer to the fire. ' Listen to me, Annie.

CHAPTER VI. DARK DAYS. A HOT June afternoon, in one of the poorer suburbs of the me- tropolis, where rows of six and eight roomed houses, all bearing a wonderful similarity in their staring red-brick nakedness, cover acres and acres of what were once well-cultivated gardens, and up and down the strangely named Pleasant Retreats, Prospect Places, and Bellevue Cottages, a couple were wandering and scrutinizing those dwellings - and they were many--where cards in the windows proclaimed that the tenants had "Apartments to Let.," It was no easy task, however, to find such a domicile as they re- quired. At some places the rent demanded was too high, at others the slatternly appearance of the landlady, or the miserable want of accommodation, compelled them to turn away. At last both simul- taneously paused. "Well, Arthur, where next?" He looked hopelessly round. "We must give it up, Grace, for to-day, at least." She shook her head. - . "And stay another night at that extravagant hotel? No, my brother, we must not give it up yet. Have we tried this street? or that turning? See, the houses there are respectable. Come, cour- age, mon frere!" He followed reluctantly.   "Poor Ethelind will be wearied to death with the children." Grace hesitated; but the thought of another day's search was so disheartening, that she said, with a coaxing smile,- "Give me one more half-hour, and then we will turn our steps homeward." To this he assented, and, quickening their pace, they again vainly traversed several streets, till their attention was attracted by the efforts of an old man to affix a limp paper to the middle pane of a parlor window with some sticky wafers. The house looked unusually clean and neat for a London tene- ment. The ledges of the casements were filled with flowers, - not rare, but choice of their kind, and carefully tended,-and the morsel of garden was gay with blossoms. "Let us try here, " whispered Grace, and Arthur stepped for- ward and raised the knocker. The wheezy cough of an asthmatic, and the shuffling step of old age, were instantly heard in the tiny hall. But with all their rev- erence for the hoary head, neither the brother nor sister could resist a sensation of repugnance as they met the eager, avaricious glances which disparagingly scanned their well-worn habiliments, and rudely scrutinized their faces. They made their errand known, and inspected the rooms. Grace shook her head at the rent asked for thlem, but Arthur impatiently closed with the aged landlord, and proceeded to arrange for their immediate occupation. At this the man demurred. The persons who had been tenanting them had but just removed, and his daugh- ter and housekeeper, who had accompanied them to assist in ar- ranging their new abode, would not be home till late. He did not like letting a parcel of strange men into the house on pretence of bringing in furniture, unless he had somebody to help watch and see that they took nothing away with them. Grace, however, succeeded in removing this scruple, and her spirits rising as her troubles vanished, she negotiated the payment in advance that was demanded so greedily, made what few arrange- ments were necessary, and smilingly nodded a farewell, as she. hur-  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6536-00000097"/> 186         GOOD STORIES. ried away to superintend the removal of Arthur's wife, family, and furniture from the railway hotel where they were temporarily lo- cated. It was not till the next morning, when Grace, in a coarse apron and rolled-up sleeves, was preparing an early breakfast, that she -encountered the daughter of the landlord. The recognition was mutual. "Grace! Good heavens! Grace Aylmer!" "Annie! is it possible? How glad I am! my dear, dear An- nie!" With hands clasped they stood gazing at each other. Six years had altered them; for the brown curls of Grace were thinner, and a thread of silver shone here and there; her once round rosyr face had lost its youthful bloom, and her figure its flexibility; but the smile on her lip was as sweet as ever, and if wrinkles prematurely showed themselves on her broad low forehead, they were forgotten in the pleasant light still beaming from her hazel eyes. Of a surety Grace was still the stay of the household. And Annie, -how had time touched her? So lightly, that at first Grace declared her unchanged, but the next moment she felt that a great change had taken place in her friend, although how or what it Iwas she could scarcely divine. Ah t she knew not the long struggle with the darkness that had been the lot of the tortured girl! The constantly recurring thought that her weakness had undone all the good she had hoped to effect, and the sense of utter inability to cope with the villany of her relatives, that had combined to make her a despairing, heart-broken woman! But those hours of anguish were over,-the morning had broken. Annie had learned to recognize the guiding hand of our All-merciful, All-wise Creator, and to yield to His will implicitly. There were still many sad reveries regard- ing the fate of those she loved; still much to cope with as her father became daily more miserly and more inaccessible to the better feel- ings she strove to instil; but she hadfaithA and hope. Above every sorrow, every mysterious dispensation, shone the bright light of Divine love ; and Annie had grown calm and patient,   THE BLA CKSMTHS     OF IIOLSBY.    187 always hoping, always believing, and walking the narrow "way to which her filial duties confined her steps, so gently, so lovingly, that many a curse meant for the miserly father was converted into a blessing on the merciful daughter, who gave her time, her help, and her prayers to all who needed- them ; and whose intervention had saved many a distressed family from the harsh measures which Ralph Thorley's avarice prompted, when the weekly rent was not forthcoming on the day he demanded it. To the many inquiries poured forth by Grace, her replies were curt. She was residing, she said, with her father, who owned some of the houses, and collected the rents of others, in the vicinity; and she began in her turn to ask for information. Grace's mourning-dress was worn, as Annie surmised, for her mother, on whose loss she could not trust herself to dwell, but, dash- ing away a tear, began to expatiate on the beauty and lovableness of Arthur's children, the dearest little creatures that an Aunt Gracie had ever owned. Her face clouded when she came to speak of their reason for seeking a new home. The bank at --- had failed, and Arthur was waiting for fresh employment, -their sole dependence until he obtained it the small remnant of Ethelind's little fortune. No reconciliation with the relatives of the latter had been effected; and after forwarding her clothes and the three hundred pounds which was all she could legally claim, they had sternly refused to hold any further communication with her. Annie longed to know if Arthur was happy; but Grace was now forced to hurry away, and it was only by slow degrees that she learned how entirely Ethelind had failed to be the comforter and the hope-inspirer he had expected to find her. And yet she was not so much to blame for this. Who can wonder if the hot-house flower withers when the frost breathes on its fairest blossgms, and the hail nips its tenderest shoots? Poor Ethelind loved her husband dearly, and fully appreciated his tender consider- ation and the sacrifices he continually made for her comfort and pleasure, but she could not rise, as he did, superior to the petty an- noyances and defects of a household where the most rigid economy  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6536-00000098"/> 188          GOOD STORIES. was hourly necessary; or, with Grace, bend all energies to making the best of things, and wearing a cheerful face, let the day be as dark as it would. She succumbed to every trifling sorrow; passionately upbraiding the hard-heartedness of her relatives, continually lamenting the un- merited misfortunes of her poor Arthur, fretting at her own useless- -   ness, and lamenting the sad prospects of her infants, until her beauty faded, her health became impaired, and the patience of Arthur and his sister was severely tried by the nervous fancies and hysterical attacks to which she became a prey. And yet Ethelind at heart was as devotedly attached to her husband as when, with a beaming face and without a fear for the future, she gave him her hand at the altar; and he, sensitively alive to the knowledge that it was for him and through him she had thus wrecked herself, sedulously con- cealed even from Grace how deeply he mourned and repented the weakness that had expected all from love, without first ascertain- ing whether strength of mind to endure, as well as to propose, lay under the surface-warmth of a great resolve, to nourish it into growth, and to bring forth the green leaves of an undying attachment. It was difficult to believe that the pallid-lipped, hollow-eyed, carelessly attired woman who lay helplessly on the sofa, now queru- lously scolding the romping children for their noisy play, or shrieking and half-fainting when they hurt themselves, and weeping in con- vulsive terror when Arthur failed to return to the moment he was expected, could be the dazzling and beautiful creature whom Annie had first seen sparkling in all the added charms of dress and ornament. She no longer wondered that the face of Arthur had grown furrowed and prematurely old, but set herself quietly to improve his lot to the best of her poor abilities, and blessed God that He had directed the wanderers there; for that some hidden purpose lay beneath the apparent chance she was firmly conviced, and she yearned and thirsted for the hour when all should be revealed, even while trembling with horror lest her father, her gray-haired, miserable father, should meet the' punishment his misdeeds justly merited.   THE BLACKSMTHS    OF HOLSBY.      189 At her earnest request, Grace promised to -conceal from Ralph her earlier acquaintance with his daughter, and to Annie's great relief the name of those he had injured had wholly escaped his memory.  For Grace lhe evinced some liking, dogging her steps when household duties brought her into the basement, to confide to her the strange change that had come over his unnatural daughter. "Once," he said, she had been contented with the large sums she earned with her needle; but now she insisted on receiving a regular salary and better food, and when he remonstrated with her for such selfishness, threatened to leave him unless he complied. He was a poor wretched old man," he groaned; * neither of his children cared what became of him; John had been a scoundrel to him, and they were both daily wishing him dead. This was the reward of his affection for them. O, it was cruel, cruel! Grace tried to be sorry, but was always glad to escape, for with all her readiness to think well of everybody, there was something about old Thorley which repelled and disgusted her; and she some- times wondered to Ethelind how Annie endured with such meekness the harsh and taunting speeches levelled at her on the most trivial occasions; never replying hastily, even when called idle, unfeeling, and false-hearted, and accused of robbing him to lavish his hard- earned money on the vile and undeserving. When Grace overheard such speeches as these, her ears would tingle and her eyes seek the -ground, for she knew that it was on Ethelind and her children that Annie bestowed the little she had to give. Often her pride prompted her to refilse gifts which cost the donor so dear; but stern necessity enforced her silence. Arthur had not yet been successful in his endeavors, their small resources were daily decreasing, and the cup of jelly or light pudding, so acceptable to the delicate appetite of the invalid, were now luxuries which Grace dared not trench on their slender purse to procure. Autumn came and went, and, with the exception of a few days' occasional employment at a law-writer's, Arthur was still seeking a situation, and' battling against the morbid fears of Ethelind, - who daily prophesied starvation,-and.. his own inward misgivings.  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6536-00000099"/> Grace tried to procure needle-work; but when, through Annie's intervention, she was successful, the care -of the children, and the still greater demands upon her time made by their thoughtless mother, left her but little leisure to execute it. Ralph Thorley's angry voice had sunk into a low wail as he lay tossing about on the bed to which old age and his increasing ail- ments now generally confined him, and filling up the long hours with ceaseless complaints of Annie, to whom he was obliged to intrust the weekly task of collecting his rents. It was a most unthankful office, and dire was the abuse heaped upon her as often as the receipts fell short of what they should have been. Vainly his daughter urged the coldness of the season, the high price of provisions, and her own inability to press for payment where real distress met her view. Ralph had no such lenity in his flinty composition, and he frequently threatened to send for John, and place his affairs in the hands of his son. But at this threat Annie secretly smiled. She knew that her father disliked and mistrusted the close-fisted money-getter, from whom he with difficulty wrung the annuity he had extorted when they parted, and who never sent it without a murmur, about the failure of crops, the badness of the season, &amp;c., although common report told of his continually increasing possessions and fortunate speculations. A rumor of Ralph's illness, however, by some chance or other, reached Bickley Farm, and John, alive to everything which con- cerned his own safety, hurried up to London. Annie, who never saw her brother without feeling all her worst passions aroused, retreated to the kitchen, intending to occupy herself there until he departed. But in a few minutes her fathers bell rang loudly, and running up to the back parlor, which, on account of his infirmities, was used as his bedroom, she found him violently agitated, and foaming with a fury his son was endeavoring to moderate. "Come here, girl; I won't be left alone with this viper - this -this unnatural vagabond! --he wants to wrong me out o' the little there 's left me; but he sha'n't, - he - sha'n't - and shaking   XTHE BLACKSMTHS OF HOLSBY.        191 his clenched fist in John's darkening face, he sank back quite exbausted. "What does this mean? asked Annie, sternly. "Tut, nothing," answered her brother. "I was but sayingr how hard it is upon me, now times are bad, to have to pay an annuity. Father can't want it, with the rents of all these houses coming in, and no one to keep but himself and you." "But I do want it!" screamed the old man, as soon as he recov- ered his breath, - " but I do want it, an' I'll have it. It's my right, Annie knows it is."  She shook her head sorrowfully. "Alas! father, what right have you or John to anything you hold? God help you both! You hlave bound me to silence; but you cannot still your own reproving consciences." "Ay," interrupted Ralph; "he's been at me again about that will; but ye sha'n't have it; I'll hold it to spite ye, scoundrel!" This roused his son's ire. "Then I'll pay the annuity no longer. I'll go about with a sword over my head no more. There!" Ralph sprang up in the bed. "But you must pay it, an' ye shall pay it. I dare ye to refuse the next time it's due." "Give me the papers, then," said John. "Am I a fool?" retorted his father. "Ye 're under my thumb there, and I 'll keep ye so. Now will ye pay me my annuity?" "You shall come across the sea for it," muttered John. "Look ye here, father; it's o' no use our quarrelling; if you die, whose hands will them papers fall into?" "I 'm not going to die," said Ralph, glaring at him uneasily; "an' if I do, they're safe." "But why not let me feel myself safe too?" urged John. "Because," his father bitterly retorted,- " because I can't trust ye; an' I  won't trust ye; an' now go, for ye won't ha' them." With a furious execration, John obeyed. "Come here, girl," moaned Ralph. "I'm worse for his coming. Gi' me  some brandy, and tell nie if ye think he's right. Am I going to die?"  . T1 b p                           C, A.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6536-00000100"/> not, with such a crime on your soul unrepented. O father!- father! it is not yet too late!" He feebly repulsed her. "Ye 're both alike, - longing to get rid o' me, that ye may squander what I've scraped together; but I'm not gone yet, an' I won't gi' them papers up to you no more than I would to him. What I've got I'll keep as long as there's life in me. Now go and make me some tea." She rose to obey; he called her back. "Annie, them Elmers up stairs, write out a notice for 'em to leave me. They hain't paid their rent these three weeks. D' ye hear?" "You 'll wait another week, sir; they are honest." "I wun't; I 'll ha' my money; tell them so; d' ye hear?" "Not to-day, father," she answered, resolutely,-" not to-day." And leaving him to scold and anathematize her scandalous neglect of his interests, she hurried away to debate on her knees, with clasped hands and streaming eyes, whether even the fearful oath exacted from her, or the ties of relationship that bound her to the guilty ones, justified her in withholding from Arthur Aylmer the fact that Major Welwyn's will was in existence. But the document itself, - where was it? And without that to prove the truth of her assertions, of what avail would be such a confession? There were still no remedies but patience and faith, and Annie, after a long and arduous wrestle with the temptations to doubt and despair that assailed her, rose from her knees, comforted and strengthened, murmuring the quaint saying of Melanchthon, "Trouble and perplexity drive us to prayer, and prayer driveth away trouble and perplexity."   CHAPTER VII. AT LAST! IT was Christmas eve. Up and down the narrow streets merry voices resounded, and busy feet were hurrying, as the poorest attempted to make some provision for the great festival of the year. Arthur Aylmer's eldest boy had occupied himself for hours long- ingly surveying the movements of a large family residing opposi, who were preparing to "'make a merry night of it "' and as he saw them  decorating their Christmas-Tree, adorning the walls and pictures with holly, eetting out a table with pastry and fruit, which looked tempting even at that distance, and, finally, was shut out from the enticing view by the cosiff of the red curtains, he plied his aunt and father with a child's natural inquiries why he also had not a cake and some visitors; and how it was Aunt Gracie did not stone plums and wash currants for a Christmas pudding It was not easy to answer or evade the little complainer, and his mother, who had moped about despondingly all day, and made many sio hing comparisons between her er present position and the gay parties in which her unfeeling relations always indulged, at this 'festive season, fairly broke down, and, sobbinglyrdeclarillO that it was the most miserable Christmas eve she had ever spent, retired to bed with the dull and fretful childl en. Arthur, wo   had returned home wet and weary with a long and unsuccessful walk in reply to an advertisement in the "Times," had endeavored to meet her murmurs with his usual equanimity; but the anxiety and suspense of the last few weeks, aided by the want of sufficient food and warm clothing, was telling on him, mentally 'as well as bodily; and when, as he stood moodily watching the dying fire, -  which Grace always carefully raked out as soon as her sister- in-law was in bed,-a  band of strolling musicians suddenly struck up a  gay polka, to which he well -remembered whirlin g round the&#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6536-00000101"/> 194         GOOD STORIES. pretty fairy of his boyish admiration, the contrast was beyond endurance; and catching the eye of his sister raised towards him full of sad and tender meaning, he snatched up his hat and fled the house, unheeding, or more probably not hearing, her calls to Is him to stay. Grace ran to the door, and endeavored to trace his progress down the dimly-lit pavement, but he was already lost to view; and she gave herself up to the wildest fears, conjecturing everything that was horrible from the overwrought state of mind in which he had departed. When Annie descended from the chamber of the little ones, under whose pillows, to afford them one pleasurable surprise in the morn- ing, she had been slipping some simple gifts, and heard the cause of her friend's agitation, her own almost equalled it; for the usual calmness of Mr. Aylmer rendered this outhreak doubly alarming. For Grace's sake, she tried to hide her own feelings, and speak soothingly; but no arguments she could advance had any effect on the mind of the affectionate sister, who continued to wander about the house, unable to settle herself to any occupation, but listening to every step that sounded familiar, and chafing with unusual im- patience as the harsh cough and peevish voice of Ralph Thorley ever and anon broke the silence that reigned in the house. As often as Annie came to her side to whisper hope, his angry summons recalled her, for she was now closely confined to her father's sick-room; the access of frenzy induced by the presence and demands of John having left deep traces in his increased weak- ness, and a degree of suspicious irritability which rendered the task of waiting uponi him a most arduous one. At last he dozed, and his daughter gladly seized the opportunity of seeking Grace, who, with a shawl thrown around her, was stand- ing at the street door, shivering with dread, and uttering prayerful ejaculations for the safety of the one nearest and dearest to her on earth.

"Do not frighten yourself so much, Annie; there is not tlhe slightest cause for it; Mr. Thorley is merely walking in his sleep,- the consequence, probably, of some unpleasant dream. I have seen several cases of somnambulism, and if we are quiet you will see him return to bed in a few minutes." She could not command her voice to reply, and they watched the old man in silence, until, after some futile efforts to remove a loose board close to his own door, he turned towards the stairs leading to the kitchen, and began to descend them. Was it there that the papers were concealed? As the thought crossed his daughter's mind, she started, and attempted to follow him, but Arthur gently detained her. "You are not fit to go; let me; I believe it is dangerous to awaken a person in this state, but I will see that he meets with no accident. Do you stay here with Grace." And Mr. Aylmer softly pursued Ralph's feeble steps; but as he reached the kitchen he found Annie beside him. The cold hands grasped his. ' Promise me," she cried in. half-choked accents, - promise me that, whatever happens, you will not injure him! Remember how old and infirm he is. Promise me that you will leave his punish- ment to his Maker!  "Injure him? I? Why should I?" asked the astonished man. "Promise! O, promise!" she still prayed so urgently, that he acceded; and they entered the kitchen together, accompanied by Grace, Who was curious to see what had brought the old man there.

Arthur had too much generosity to press the point, and with the same tearless composure that marked her demeanor during the inter- view, she ascended to the apartment where Ethelind, - her bloom rapidly returning, her blue eyes shining with renewed lustre,-- was playing merrily with her children. Over these she bent to give them a parting caress, and was caught to the bosom of Grace. "Why did you leave us, dear Annie? Do you think we doubt your ability to exonerate yourself?" But a kiss on the cheek, one fervent pressure of her hand, and Annie was gone.  They saw her no more. To trace the future career of the Aylmer family is scarcely ne- cessary. The faithful Grace is the wife of one who values her as she deserves; and the lessons of adversity have borne fair fruit, as the good deeds of Arthur and Ethelind continually testify. Nor was Annie Thorley's life an unhappy one. The reward of unruffled happiness in this world is not so commonly meted to us as novelists might lead their readers to suppose; but the deeper and truer bliss of looking forward to a home where there shall be no more weeping is within the reach of all; and perhaps among the many-all honor be to them for their self-denial and Christian love! - who devote themselves to ameliorating the condition of our sick and sorrowful poor, no one more fully appreciates that certain hope, or walks more humbly and trustingly along the path of duty, than the gentle, unassuming woman once known as the Blacksmith'.

I went several times to the Exposition 'after this " lighting up" of the Koh-i-noor. I confess that my chief inducement in these repeated visits was the strange attraction of these precautions for the preservation of the gem,-far greater, I repeat, than the at- traction of its equivocal beauty. The precautions and devices seemed to defy the ingenuity of man. I was fascinated by them. I could not help speculating as to how they might be defeated. Why not? The world was fill -of clever people, some of them rogues; and what the fine skill of one man could construct, the equally fine skill of another man might circumvent, - the treasure that one acute locksmith migtlt secure, an equally acute picklock might, carry away.  If a fortress was impregnable from above ground, there were generally means of getting at it from below, by a good deep burrow; thus, by a masterly manceuvre, at once compromising and turning to waste all the cunning calculations of the upper works. These thoughts took such possession of my imagination, that I was literally haunted by them. Wherever I went, whatever I was doing, they constantly obtruded themselves. I -vigorously strove to concentrate my attention and speculations on other objects of inter-  est in the Great Exposition. I called to mind the gigantic Astro- nomical Telescope, and wondered how large a star would loolr through it, - Mercury, for instance, the god of thieves,-and sud-  denly the Koh-i-noor appeared shining at the other end, escaped from its cage! I bethought me of the various agricultural and other machines at rest and in motion; but it always ended in one of them boring-a deep hole underground, into which I put one foot, and drew it back suddenly, checking myself with a "( Forbear." I really felt ashamed of all this; but do what I would, r could not   &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6536-00000105"/> shake it off. The immense blocks of coal outside, what were they but " black diamonds," - the crude, unconcentrated, unpurified, raw material of mines, from which the Koh-i-noorfamily were lineally descended? I rushed back into the Crystal Palace, and the next moment found myself, as if by a fatal fascination, standing in front of the iron cockatoo cage, with its policeman lounging beside a  barrier rail, quite stultified with the dull monotony of his duty. There I beheld the illustrious captive shining on a platform or stage, which is evidently an iron safe, one (or more) of the panels of which has a deep and curious keyhole, which panel, being opened, no doubt allows you to creep along in the dark, beneath the " moun- tain of light." Aha - not so impregnable - not so impossible to be got at--by no manner of 'means impossible. I could imagine several ways. I did, indeed, imagine several ways,--several extraordinary ways. I fell into a habit of sitting in an arm-chair every day after dinner, and indulging in long reveries, in which I exhausted my ingenuity in devising and following out schemes for carrying off the Koh-i-noor. The thing had taken so thorough a possession of my imagination, that I verily believe (and this has not unfrequently happened in the history of mechanical inventions) I should have gone mad, had not the extremes found a vent and a cure in one of those after-dinner reveries which terminated in a deep slumber. But, if reduced to a state of insensibility to all outward impres- sions, how active, vivid, and- coherent were all those which I experi- enced within! I have since thought that my brain must have been in a high state of fever. To prowl at: night round the outskirts of the Crystal Palace, watching a favorable time,--say about two in the morning, or three, if not too light, - and then mount by a very light ladder to the first division of the roof, would be perilous, and attended with many difficulties, some of which, perhaps, could not be foreseen. No,--this would not do: some other scheme must be adopted. One gting extremely needed was precisely the one thing of all others which, at the same time, I most wished to avoid,-an accom-   A LTENITENArT CONFESSION.        20 plice.

On the other hand, there wras a palrticularly stupid chap, who had been a farm-servant of my uncle's,- -seiAb:raham Wip orpe Sparks,-in Somersetshire, and was dis- owing some Gypsies to steal a donkey-load of turnips in two panniers, in-return for having his fortune told by one of the women while the panniers were loading. Thisfellow now, who combined both rogue and fool, might serve as a handy instrument and be quietly dismissed, and sent away into the country, or out of it somewhere, for a small consideration, when done with. Yes, this fellow- Bob Styles was his name-   would do very well. He was a great lout. Not that I would trust him too far, or, indeed, at all, as to my secret. What I wanted was confidential manual help. So I sent for Bob Styles, and bought him a bnev fro  a  iln im. a  new frock-coat and highlows and a  drab hat, the same evening. -e grinned, and thrust his tongue in- his cheek, when he came into the room- in his; new things. He   was a precious lout. But he would serve my purpose. A  mine, -a burrow underground,-that w ets the true and sen- sible means of getting at the Great Prize. A contest with Chubb- above ground was the very place where he had calculated the grand assault would be made, if at all; whereas, it was extremely unlikely that he should have had the genius to foresee that another genius might construct his plans of attack entirely on the under- ground principle. I sold out stock in the Three-per-Cent Consols, where my little property was chiefly invested ; and, having put myself in possession of a  few hundred pounds ready cash, I commenced  my operations. Bob Styles was a  great help to me. He ran about carrying heavy packages and boxes for me to N o  .- , * * Street, Hyde Park, where I had taken a house as close as was  prudent to the Crystal Palace.<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6536-00000106"/> The cellars were of course my grand field, - the dusky region of my arduous operations. I had the entrance to the back cellar, which was in fact the coal-cellar, so contrived by a passage from the front cellar, fitted up with my own hands, by means of some old wainscot and planks, that the mind would presently become con-  fused as to the latitude of the back cellar, and the point at which the burrow beneath the earth was advancing. If any conjecture could be formed at all, it would be that it was in a straight line  towards St. Paul's; whereas it was accurately directed, from " bear- ings"I had taken with a compass, in a line with Mr. Chubb's " iron cage" in the Exposition of the Industry of Nations. Into the front cellars I made Bob Styles convey all my delving, boring, and burrowing apparatus. One of the tools (though ihe seemed much puzzled with the shape of the shovels) attracted his especial notice. It was one of the probes,--my own invention. "Be this thing a squirt?" said he. The mistake delighted me. "Yes, Bob," said I; "it is to soften the earth as we proceed." He said he thought "how it wor likely to be a very good zoftener." What a lout he was! But all the better. I should not omit that I had thought it best just to tell him that I was engaged by one of the Gas Companies to make some investigations, in consequence of a law-suit with the parish, and he must not, therefore, say a word of what we were about to any soul breathing, or the company might lose the action, and perhaps we should be sent to prison for boring holes underground without leave. This seemed to frighten Bob very much. He swore never to say a word to mortal man. The earth that accumulated .from the borings we conveyed in bushel baskets into the-front kitchen, and shot it up in one corner. As I did not wish to fill the cellar, especially as I wanted room for my tools, machines, and general apparatus for the whole business, I sent Bob with a cart-load of it, as soon as it amounted to that, in the dusk of the evening, with orders to proceed to some unfre- quented spot in the suburbs, or where new houses were being built, and, watching his opportunity when nobody was near, tilt up the cart, and shoot out the contents with as little noise as possible. If    1l-vla yNT CONFESSION.         2 205 spoken to, he was to say he was one of Mr. Cubitt's men, and pretend to be drunk. I pass over athe many difficulties and obstructions which we sur- mounted. I fear did considerable damage to many a sewer, gas and water pipe. We were now underneath the 'carriage-drive in front of the South Entrance. Other difficulties occurred; but I will not pause to particularize them; in fact, as I approach the grand dvent of my narrative, I feel h--h an excites entd or lib alsth       d such an excitement that my pen seems to hurry me on with the record, rather than to obey the direction of my fingers. The event ful night arrived, whei, with compass-box in hand and my plan be- fore me, the result of the calculation I made showed that we were just under the iron safe of the Illustrious Stranger. So great was my joy, or rather excitement, for it was too painful a pleasure to be termed merely "joy," that I ran down to Bob who was still at work at the further end of the burrow, and, showing him the figures of my sum, --the quotient, -cried out exultingly, "We've done it, my boy! The Gas Company will gain their action." "Glad to hear on t, said he. He was too stupid to be really excited at anything. We had now to make an upward movement. This was a nice process, as it would not do to come abruptly upon the Diamond. I vas afraid to give a sudden blow to the iron safe, or whatever' was inderm'ost in Mr. Chubb's arrangement, lest it should disturb the Koh-i-noor in its bed, or liberate some safety-spring or cunning rap that would increase my difficulties. Upwards, therefore, we worked, till gradually we arrived at a rather hard, gritty, stony sub- tance, the ddb'rs of which looked like clay and sand that had been aked into a sort of sandstone. I ground my way up, and in a very short time made a hole in ie substance, and 'found I had arrived at a hollow space. Icau- ously thrust my hand into the dark hole above me, and felt about. could feel nothing. I thrust my arm up slowly askigh as the oulder. Still it encountered nothing but empty space. I enlarged e hole till I could get my head in, which I raised very cautiously  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6536-00000107"/> indeed, and stared about; but all was vacancy and darkness. I hoisted a light at the end of a stick, and lifted it at least five feet above the aperture; but it only displayed a sort of upright stone vault. Finally I made the aperture larger, and by means of a short ladder I ascended. Was I in an upright sarcophagus? or was I in the antechamber and waiting-room of the Koh-i-noor? Was I not? yes, I was,-it must be so. I had made a mistake in a figure, I had got into the great Spanish Wine Jar. It was not so bad a calculation, after all. The Diamond was not many yards distant. It was a curious position to have gained. I saw at once that it might be used as an auxiliary to my design. If I could bore an extremely fine hole or two through the sides of the Jar, so as to peep through while the holes remained imperceptible, because so utterly beyond suspicion, I might derive a fund of useful knowledge., With this intention, and, indeed, with this discovery of my whereabout," Hwas of course resolved not to acquaint Bob. I merely told him that we had come upon strange ground, and that it might be dangerous for him to explore the bad atmosphere of this aperture with me, as he was not a chemist; he must, therefore, on no account ascend, for fear of gases, which were valuable to our Gas Company, but might be deadly to him. I succeeded in drilling five minute holes in the Wine Jar, begin- ninga. with the size of pinholes, and ending by enlarging them to something more than the size of pins' heads, though a slip of tlhe hand with one of them made it almost as large as a pea. This was effected in the night; and when I ascended next morning into the -Jar, and saw the light from the interior of the Crystal Palace shine through into the interior of my place of concealment, I sank back against the opposite side, and almost fainted away. O, if I had overturned the Jar! Recovering myself, however, by a powerful effort of will, I Pepered and speculated for some time through this hole, till at length I fairly made out the exact position of my works undergroumd with reference to the Koh-i-noor. They were not very wide of the mark, considering all things. Renewing my labors with increased ardor, I soon brought my tunnel end rirht under VV YRIV yyy       )f   - Z1 X s I yj 1 I L IIU^SSION.    207 -Mr. Chubb's iron safe. Here I at once made an enlargement, as a chamber for final operations. I was in such a state of ecstasy that I embraced Bob Styles with both arms, much to the lout's wonder- nment; and that fsame day, after our work was done for the night, I invited him to a good supper with me, of several delicacies I had procured, and gave him as much wine to drink as he liked, and beer too, of both of which he drank like a dolphin. I had great trouble to get him to-bed.  The brute almost frightened we to death by slanting to sing a song at two in the morning; and he so far forgot himself as to challenge me to fight him " for a fi-pun no'!" He was totally unfit for work all next day. Not so myself.  I alone, with bended back, and shovel, lamp, and barrows, tunnelled beneath the Prodigy, and marked it for my fook. Ah! if I could but touch it with the instrument I had made for the last effort,-viz. a long handle of steel, firnished at the other end with a  compound action of hook and forceps,-people might talk of the Koh-i-noor vanishing, but it would surely vanish into my custody.  What were my turquoise- and my cairngorai to this?  Mere nothings,-absolute nothings. I  had had a small Jollification on the strength of arriving beneath the earth that sustained my  Prize; but what would that be to the festive scenes I would have, -the classic and romantic "games "I would institute among a   select circle of friends? I should tell them I had been excessively lucky at the Derby. Yes; the day -my Derby day was at band. Alone in the gloomy little cavern at the end of my works, I sat Ppon the largest-of my zinc barrows, looking upward at the excavated I earthy roof that frowned close above me, on which my lamp cast its  sullen  gleam, and a thought came across me of the -innocent days of childhood, when, upon a certain occasion I had played at hide and I seek in one of the master's cellars, and- sat alone, trembling with  ; iervousness, among the damp beer-casks, with their mouldy, mi - lewed sides, ando rusty, oozing hoops. Ah, how different were  my xereblings now! !  What took place on this eventful night-this night marked with  .    &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6536-00000108"/> a finger of dazzling fire -on my life's horoscope-I cannot pretend in, any measured form of regular sequence to relate. I was in such a state of preternatural elevation, that I really consider it as a delirium. How I first got up into the Wine Jar, and listened at the round hole, holding my breath, then descended with clasped hands,-how I bored my way up beneath Chubb's iron safe, till I felt the cold iron, - how I drilled a small hole in the lower iron plate, into which I inserted my instruments, and gradually cut an aperture big enough to enable me to thrust half my face in, - how I stuck up a lighted taper inside, - how, as I was raising myself to insert half my face and look'up and about (feeling that the moment was now at hand), half another face was protruded through the aperture, and' looked down and about! 1 -thought I should have died on the spot. I wonder I did not. Of course, the horrible appearance must have been a delusion of the'senses, - the senses acted upon by my conscience. - I looked again, and it was gone. It came no more. I took a dram of brandy. I felt sure that my nervous imagination had played me this awful trick. But could I proceed? It was my fate. I took a little more brandy, and went to work again, cautiously cutting another hole in the ironrL ate next above; and while I was gently extracting the piece, down fell to   something which struck me a hard, sharp blow upon the bridge of the nose, and, bouncing against the glass of my lamp, broke through and extinguished it, leaving me in utter darkness and excessive firight. I was completely bedewed with a cold perspiration, and-I also found my nose was bleeding profusely.  Recovering myself, I lighted a lucifer, and, proceeding to re- illumine my lamp, what should my startled eyes behold but a great mass of the sparklings and arrowy cross-fire of diamond rays, lying at the bottom of the tin frame! Was it! - -could it be! -did my eyes -deceive me? They had deceived me about the horrible " half- face " looking downs - were they deceiving now? The Koh! - no -nb - it could not - fond fancy, drive me not to madness - it could not be! But thered lay the brilliant thing, at which I con- tinued to stare fixedly with open mouth!  .        k       .  .      .i   A PENITENT CONFESSION.          209 At last I ventured, with a shaking hand, to take it from the bottom of the lamp. Yes - yes -it was - it was the Illustrious Stranger himself!his Imperial Brightness was lying in the dewy palm of my aspen hand! The cunning spring intended to cause him to dart downwards and disappear at the least touch, devised by the subtle brain of Mr. Chubb, had no doubt been the very cause of his sudden descent upon the bridge of my nose. It is thus that great locksmiths, and others, outwit themselves. Like vaultingambition they pitch over on the other side. These were after-reflections,- for, at the moment, I could do nothing but pant and stare, and stare and pant.  Then I listened with consternation,-but it was at nothing. My greatest present fear was lest Bob Styles should come down to work and meet me in my excited state. I secreted the Prize, and hurried of wildly to my bedroom, and double-locked the door, and put a chair against it. It was late before I awoke next morning, as I had been up the whole night listening, and continually changing the place where I had hidden the invaluable Mountain.  I dressed myself with trepidation,- all quite natural under the circumstances. My hand shook so I could scarcely hold the razor. At breakfast I could not eat a morsel, and I did all sorts of absurd things. My first anxiety was to get rid of Bob Styles, and to leave the house. I called Bob to me, and telling him, with a gayish air, that we had quite succeeded in discovering the gas-pipe, and I was very much obliged to him, I put six sovereigns into his hand, which I said was a present from  the Gas Company, as I  had engaged him by the week, and he had always drawn his money,-and then I   told him we had no further need of his services at present, so he might now return to Somersetshire. He   took the six sovereigns slowly, and looked at them in a way I did not like. He said he did not much think he should go to Zummerzetshire; he thought as -how  he liked Lunnun best. I was. not in a frame of mind to argue the question with him, or to hold further parley, so I wished him good day; and when he had made up his bundle, I wished him good luck and shook hands with him, which -he received -in a heavy, ungrateful    &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6536-00000109"/> -        -          :   '        GOOD STORIES. way, and lounged off with a dissatisfied air. How glad I was to see the back of him i                  For - Now t-leave my house. This was by no means-so easy. how could I risk the discovery of my isubterraean work? The entrance to the burrow must be blocked up, and, in fact, bricked up, and concealed in the most careful way. I saw that I must remain a short time in the house, at least till the mortar was dry, -but I  did yearn to be off. Where to hide the oh-i-noor, in the mean time, - this was a constant fever to me. No place seemed safe, or'beyond suspicion. Hide it where I would, I was obliged to change its place the next hour. I engaded a charwoman to come every morning to attend to my domestic wants, and a boy to live in the house. I workedathrick- ing up the entrance to my underground secrets all night, and locked up the cellars' during the day. Findinor that the bricks and mortar would continue to look fresh and suspcio , schatanding all the dirt and dust I threw up and suspicious notwith  In        th bricksdid no against the new wall I had built, and also that the bricks did not look very regular and workmanlike, I pulled them all down. A much brighter thought had struck me. I built up a termination wall, some eight feet from the entrance, and then fitted shelves and bins of old wood in the recess, so that it looled like an additional wine-cellar. I instantly ordered in six dozen of old port, and six of sherry, six dozen of elaret in pints and magnums, and twelve dozen of empty bottles; and all these I pacned away in a very regular manner, and with a profusion of saw-dust, and chalk-marks, and old dusty cobwebs which I collected from the corners of the cellars. It looked so well when it was completed, that I thought it even worthy to serve as a hidinlg-place for the "Illustrious," and l actually thrust him, enveloped in the thumb of a kid glove, into the neck of a magnum of claret, and corked him safely down, waxed and all, and so left him for nearly two days; but I fancied one night that that particular bottle looked at me,-so to speak,-and I feared the eye of a detective officer might see a something special in its appearance; so I knocked off the neck of the bottle, after trying   A PENITENT    CONFESSION.      21 in vain to draw the Illustrious with a corkscrew, and transferred him to the inside of an old German sausage, having held the part to the fire where the incision had been made, till the fat began to run, and so healed the wound. I then hung it up in the larder beside a piece of bacon,-also a good place to slip him into,- though a gooseberry tart, if it would keep, would perhaps be better still. O, what a world of care and sleepless anxiety all this cost me, no words can relate! Let nobody imagine that my days were thus spent ingloriously in the mere question of hiding my prize ; no, - there was another equally, indeed a still more important subject that demanded the utmost reach of my intellectual faculties. I had got the greatest Treasure of the earth, -but what on earth was I to do with it? The more I thought of this, and the more schemes I devised, the more difficult, dangerous, and almost impossible did it appear. It had been declared to be worth two millions of money, -that was its reputed value, though many said that it was priceless, and no sum could be affixed. Now I had quite made up my mind not to be greedy and exacting on this score. I would take one million for it. Very well. The next things was, - Who had a million to give? It must be purchased, then, by some great prince, or by several great jewellers. Perhaps a Company might be formed- No; all this was wild and visionary. I knew-not what to do. I had, one night, walked up and down in front of Rundle and Bridges for three hours, looking most wistfully at the house, and at every window, with a vague sort of hope that some good thought might come to me. I at length fell into a deep revery, near the street door, when, the door suddenly opening to let out a visitor, I instantly took to my heels in a panic of dismay. My mind, it was clear, was too vivid and apprehensive to have embarked in such a business as this alone. I ought to have been associated with some one of colder and more phlegmatic temperament. This same night, - it was about half past twelve by the time I reached my house, - I found Bob Styles sitting on the step of the door) smoking. I spoke rather sharply to him, but he made no  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6536-00000110"/> 212         GOOD STOPRIES. answer for some time. He then took the pipe from his mouth, knocked out the ashes, and said, with his tongue thrust into his cheek, 'I tell'ee what it is, Mister Zimeon Sparks, I wants a underd poun', - and that's all about it." "A hundred pounds!" said I. "A underd poun'!" says he. "Then" said I to myself, "I 'm a lost man!"It was not the amount of the demand,-for what was a mere flea-bite of a hundred or a thousand pounds to a man who was the possessor of a jewel worth two millions, or say one million, or even half a -million? No; it was that this demand came -like a threat, and how should a lout like this threaten if he had not some means of vengeance? and what could this be but some suspicions about me of a kind which I too well knew would not bear investigation? I gave him a check for the money. I told him I considered myself robbed; but he did n't seem to pay much attention. Looking over my accounts, I found that by my expenses for the house, instruments and tools for burrowing, living, sundries, and Bob, I had already got rid of the sum of fifteen hundred pounds. I was resolved to do something conclusive as soon as possible. I sold out the remainderof my property in the Three per Cents, and the very next morning found me on the road to Paris. The minute descrip- tion of my person in my passport alarmed me. "Wears a large turquoise ring, a garnet and topaz ring, a cairngorm watch-seal, two gold chains, with a cut steel guard, - and has a red excoriation across the bridge of his nose." I forthwith deposited my jewelry in their cases, and covered the red mark on the bridge of my nose with two strips of black sticking-plaster. The morning after my arrival in Paris, I dressed myself with great care, - new summer palet6t, glazed boots, kid gloves, and all that, - and betook myself to Messrs. * " a, whose exquisite jerw- elry argued, of course, an equally extensive capital, and a thorough knowledge of the enormous prices that extraordinary diamonds command in the market. I had quite come to my senses on the question of price, and had determined on making a tremendous   A PENTITENT CONFESSION.         213 sacrifice. It may look like weakness, but I knew what I was about and had now, deliberately, resolved to sell the Illustrious Mountain- at the reduced sum  of half a million, - money down. It was in vain to go on trifling, with timne in 0so serious a business any longrer. My feelings could not bear it. I had already lost flesh, and all my good looks to a painful extent. Hdid not take the diamond with me: much too cautious for that. I obtained an audience with the head of the firm. I had asked for a private room. After considerable circumlocution,- and I1 believe he must have observed my agitation, for my knees shook and my teeth chattered,-I made known my business, -that I had a wonderfully large diamond, of the first water, to dispose of; that I was aware it was worth two, or, at least, more than a million sterling; but that, as it was far too costly for me to wear, or, indeed, any private gentleman, I had made up my mind to part with it,- he would excuse my being a little nervous. The reduced scale on which I offered it would no doubt surprise him  but I was resolved to let him have it for half a million, or there- abouts. Monsieur eyed me with a penetrating look, - quite a freezer,- and then, glancing at my card, read aloud, "Mr. Simeon Sparks, H6tel d'Espagne."   Another look at me, and then, "Half a mil- lion?" said he. "Pray, what is the name   of the diamond? - you, of course, have got its pedigree, vouchers, &amp;c. &amp;c.? Half a  million?-is it the Rant Das,-the Sing Lal Door, - or the Spanish Solitario Ponmposo?" I replied, with increased trepidation,. that I had forgotten its ex- act name. I did not believe it was the Lal Door, or the Spanish Pomposo, -but it was a very surprisingly large diamond; and, in short, if he would conclude the bargain at once, I would not stand particular as to the precise amount of half a million. He would see, in a twinkling, what it was worth. "Where is it?" demanded Monsieur, rather abruptly. "Iwill go and fetch it," I replied. "I merely wished, first, to ascertain if you were open to such a purchase." Monsieur bowed with a se-  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6536-00000111"/> 214          UUU1Ll UilltH. vere grace, and I bowed most obsequiously; and then I hurried out of the room, and then out of the house; and, as the outer door was closing behind me, I heard Monsieur say in a hasty voice, to some- body, something dreadfully like appellez - officier. "Ha!" ejacu- lated I,- "call an officer of police! -death and destruction!" Away I scudded, - jumped into the first public vehicle I met,- told him to drive to the Chlamps Elysees,-then to Perela Chaise, -where I got out, and ran about among the graves till I was utterly exhausted. To be brief, I dodged about here and there till dusk, and then returned to my lodgings, (for I had had the precau- tion to give a false address, and the Hotel d' Espagne was a long way to the northwest of my abode,) where I threw myself upon a sofa, more dead than alive. Was it for this I had passed so many sleepless nights, - labored so hard, - sold out my little property, - spent two thirds of it, - and now to be obliged to fly, and hide with my treasure, and have no means of disposing of it without the chance of being apprehended, and cast into a dungeon, - perhaps guillotined, - or handed over to the English Ambassador, and sent back to London to be hanged? I saw what to do. Fertile in resources, I sent out a lad, who cleaned shoes for the lodgers, to buy me a hammer. I was deter- mined to settle this business by a grand coup-de-matre. I would break up the Illustrious MAountain into several good-sized " hills of light," and then sell them one at a time. This I could easily do, as all identity would thus be destroyed. It was a thousand pities, -so unique a gem, - but was I to be tortured in this way, after all my trouble? The hammer was brought me, together with some nails (that was an ingenious "blind"), and I fell to hammering up the sides of a leathern portmanteau, having no box; but I knew that the French lad would set it down as an English caprice. We do such odd things on the Continent. As soon as I was alone, and had fastened  the door, I took out the Doomed One, and looked at it regretfully. But what else could I do? My bane and antidote were both before me,-both in one. I raised the hammer,-took aim,-turned   A PENITENT CONFESSION.         215 my face aside, - and administered a heavy blow upon the devoted gem. It instantly flew into the air, - -a smash was heard, - the Diamond had vanished, and, looking round -and round, I saw a large irregular hole in one of the window panes! The priceless treasure had escaped! I threw open the window. It overlooked a yard. With a wild ejaculation, I flew down stairs, and after sev- eral wrong turns, which brought me abruptly among different sets of people, who all started up at my suddenly bursting in among them, I found the yard, and saw the Diamond in the hands of a child of nine or ten years old, with two other children looking at it. "That's mine!- that belongs to me!" cried I; whereupon the urchin that had it instantly put it into its mouth, and denied all knowledge of the thing. Seizing the little imp, and endeavor- ing to extract it, the other children set up a scream, and the mother of the child seeing me struggling with it, and its face all red, and its eyes staring, thought I was trying to strangle it, and flew to the rescue. The scene that followed is too provoking and humiliating to relate. Suffice it to say that, after all manner of entreaties, apologies, explanations, and giving the mother and the urchin all the money I happened to have in my pocket, I recovered my infer- nal Treasure, and, hurrying away with it, never returned to the house, but left all my luggage to pay for the little I owed, as I could not risk the danger of staying a moment after such an ad- venture. I made my way direct to Calais. On the route, I thought I would go to Germany; but no, -  Germany was not rich enough to deal with me, even on my very reduced terms of five hundred thousand pounds,- for this was the figure to which I had now made up my mind to reduce my expectations. Four or five hundred thousand pounds would remunerate me very well, and anything for peace of mind. But to what market should I go? Would Spain answer my purpose?  It might; but no, - there was the Inquisi- tion. Italy? Too poor. Austria or Russia? They might do; and yet this would be dangerous. Despotic countries, like those, might take away my Moluntain, and send me to the mines of Siberia for  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6536-00000112"/> 21#6 GOOD STORIES. life, on pretence that I had obtained it by dishonest means! They would assume this; and I should suffer for a mere conjecture. O, how wretched were all these conflicting thoughts! Fate decided for me. On arriving at Calais, in a very per- plexed state of mind, I went to stand behind a bale of goods near the Custom-House, to be out of the heat of the sun, and was con- sidering if it would not be best to go and live some weeks in Bel-  gium, there to meditate calmly on this most arduous part, as I now discovered it to be, of mly whole- enterprise, when I heard a voice say, in English, "You haven't seen a scared-looking English gent, with two strips of black sticking-plaster across his nose, pass this way, have you?"I listened with pricking and shooting ears for the reply. ' Yes," said somebody, also in English, 1 I think I saw him just now, and he is gone on board the boat for Ostehd." "Thank you," said the first speaker, and hurried away. As soon as I dared to breathe, I issued from my hiding-place, and made my way straight on board a boat for Dover. I have no clear knowl- edge who it was that was in search of me; but it was evident that somebody- wanted me," and that was quite enough, - English 'po- lice in league with French 'police, I make no doubt. Me mis- erum! "Scared-looking," too! Ahl, no doubt but I did look so, for I felt it immensely. I had left my house at Kensington in charge of the charwoman, who was to live there, as I could not prudently give it up till I was ready to depart from England for good, or at least till the loss of the Koh-i-noor had blown over. It was evening when I reached KIensington. I had written to the charwoman from Dover to say I was coming. Directly she opened the door, O sir!" cried she, flinging both hands up and down, "I'm so glad you're come, for there's a fellow here, hark!-that's him! -I couldn't keep him out of the house,- he has frightened me almost out of my wits! As I stood in the passage I heard a voice in the back cellar, singing, as loud as he could bawl, -   --.I, : , il:'- W^^if11(aL,!j,^,^^ A PENITENT CONF ESSION.         217 "Oi drink zuckzess to the Barley-mowe; Zuckzess o' the Barley-mowe!"

I stopped in the passage. y blood was boiling. Was I never to be released from -the persecutions of this brute beast? I rushed into the back cellar. There he sat, with a bottle of old port in his hand, right in the entrance of my additional cellar, where the opening to the burrow had been hidden by the bins and bottle-racks. Instead of moving when he saw me, he only grinned, and, pointing significantly to the recess behind him, again fell to singing,- * "Oi drink zuckzess to the Barley-mowe, Zuckzess to the Barley-mowe! The pint, the bottle, the big quart, the - (ic ) Zuckzess o' the Barley-mowe!" "Ha! ha! Mizter Sparks, -glad you be comed hoam. I wants zome more money, yer know." I  darted at him. "Villain!" exclaimed I: "you shall have more than you want,-much more,"-and I     knocked him fat upon the  ground! He scrambled  up; but I went in at him, right. and left, and down he went, wallowing among the bottles that were torn out by his fall. Up he got, and came at me. My blood was in a perfect fever, and I am a pretty good sparrer. We had a reg- ular set-to, almost in the dark, all slipping about in long streams of port-wie, and the charwoman screaming on the stairs. But though I hit the- ruffian about the face in first-rate style, he was so tough that it did n't do him much damage; and when he did manage to make one of his swingeing blows reach me, it knocked half the breath out of my body; and I  think I should have been banged to a biffin, if the charwoman had not valiantly rushed in to my assist- ance with a mop-handle, which she rattled to such good purpose about Bob's skull, that, thick as it was, he was fain to make good his retreat up stairs; and I finally thrust him floundering into the  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6536-00000113"/> street, and bolted the door.

I was now obliged to raise money by selling a little farm I had in Somersetshire, -the last of all the property I possessed. I let my house in Kensington forthwith, at a much lower rent than I had it for (on a lease of three years), reserving the right of locking up the back cellar, on account of the choice old wine I had there. I went int o lodgings in the vicinity of Somers Town ; and, while here, I made several other attempts at selling the diabolical Diamond, which I forbear to particularize. It had already brought-me to the brink of ruin ; yet I was no nearer to success, although by this time I had actually reduced my terms to the pitiful sum of fifty thousand pounds, or less. I was soon brought to my last shift for money to go on with, as the very nature of mny position obviously required a constant outlay, - a common case with all great undertakings. I was compelled to part with my turquoise. It cost me a severe pang. And soon afterwards, my large cairngorm seal, my watch and its gold chains, and all my other elegances had to follow; - all, all my pretty ones had to be immolated at the shrine of this Moloch of Light, whose baleful lustre had led me on to destruction, and, I may now say, to despair. The end draws near. I pass over several intermediate interviews, each more unsatisfactory than the last, and now bring my confession down to the actual purchaser. I had retreated to an attic, - a good front one, having a flat roof and two windows, - as it was absolutely necessary not to seem in want. Two gentlemen of the Hebrew persuasion visited me here one day, having heard, though I never could make out by what means, - their fine scent, I suppose, - that I had a diamond of good wa- ter to dispose of cheap. I told them that the Diamond I possessed was of immense value, though not to me*; but they should have it at a great bargain, as I had a particular need for a few thousand pounds, having been a considerable loser at the last Derby.  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6536-00000114"/> a220        -GOOD STOxUKlXAS. Directly the two Jews got it into their hands, they ran with it to one of the wind6ws, close up against the glass, eacl holding on by an end, with their eyes close down to it. Then they ran, with a sidelong shuffle, to the other window,-never letting go, -then back again, in the same crab-like way, to the other window; and so on several times. After turning it about in all possible ways, now close to the light, now up in one corner in the dark, they came up to me, and told me that it was a very nice stone, pretty stone, and worth money, - but it was not a diamond! At this vile and nefarious announcement, I was so astonished that at first it superseded the rage and indignation I very quickly felt and expressed. I snatched it from their clutches, locked it up, and bade them instantly leave my apartments. They bore all my re- proaches very meekly, and went on talking, and explaining, and reasoning; and though I refused to listen to them, they would not go out of the room. There they stayed, haggling and- tormenting seven hours, till, being utterly exasperated and disgusted with them, with myself, and with the infernal Stone, I sunk down on my bed, offering to talke a thousand pounds for it. As they were going out at the door, one of them lingered behind, and, fixing his black vulture's eye upon me, said, in a hoarse voice, between that of an old-clothes' man and one who " has a devil" and is about to cast it out, "Take care!" (here he held up one long dirty finger, which had a long dirty-pointed nail at the top) "take care of yourshelf! - shell the stone before the Gas Com- pany arrest you!" He toolk one end of his neckerchief, held it up straight and tight in the air, and, blowing out his cheeks, he made a hideous strangling face, and shut the door. I closed my eyes, and remained, if not insensible, yet quite un- able to move for the next hour. I had been betrayed by the villain, Bob Styles. He had told all he knew, and the Jews had made out enough to hang me. I endeavored to spring up, intending to leave my lodgings that very moment; but my limbs refused their office. I was all streaming with a dew of dismay. IMy powers were par- alyzed. I squeezed my eyelids together, and, clasping my hands tightly on my breast, lay there awaiting my fate.   A PENITENT CONFESSION.         221 I was silent, and continued so during the rest of the day. " O, that infamous Bob Styles!" thought I. "Was this the good fortune the Gypsy foretold for him, while he allowed my uncle's turnips to be stolen? Could nothing else but the destruction of his wronged master's favorite nephew satisfy his remorseless villany?" I also called to mind the story I had -heard of the great Indian Prince who once had the fatal Stone, and, in order to hide it, had it built up in the middle of a wall, and then killed the mason. If I had done -   But Heaven forgive me!            ; While I thus lay thinking and bemoaning myself, and wondering if I should be well enough to effect my escape in time, a gentle rap sounded at my door. I listened. Another very gentle rap, - and then the door opened, - and a venerable Jew, very old, wiith a lone, dark gabardine, and a large gray beard flowing down it, slowly en- tered the room, making me a salutation with one hand. He had small dark eyes, with overhanging bushy eyebrows, a large hand- some forehead, a great nose, wore a thick gold ring with an en- graved red carnelian in it, and had an air of mildness and dignity, mixed with caution and commiseration. "NMy tear," said he, "I am come to do you shervice,-I speak at once to the point, my tear. I am come about the Stone." I sat up on the bed. Approaching with slow step, the venerable man looked at me a moment with a parental air, and then seated - himself on a chair by the bedside. He requested permission to look at the Stone. I produced it. He calmly drew forth his spectacles, examined it with great care, and then returned it into my hands. In the most delicate manner, and all in Oriental allegory and parable, he gave me to understand that he was acquainted with the Stone, - that is, he knew where it came from, - and he very much pitied me. He saw what I must have gone through; and the worst of it was that my life might paty the penalty, - and all for a mis- take! I asked, what mistake? He waved that question, and begged to relate to me a little story. He said the history and adventures of  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6536-00000115"/> all the great diamonds were a sort of romance. Take the history, for instance, - only for instance, he said, -of the one called the Koh-i-noor. He then went a long way back into the East, and told me all sorts of things about it. But finally this:-It was in the possession of an old Indian Chief,-the treasure of his eyes. Well- this aged Chief was conquered by the Sikhs, and the Sikh Prince demanded the Koh-i-noor as his ransom. The old chief, after much hesitation, at last brought it himself to the Sikh camp, - took it from a fold in his sleeve, shed tears over it, gave it up, and then fainted away! This was the story that was brought over with it. Did it look quite true, - or did it look a little like a scene in the Adelphi Theatre? Was it not probable that the old chief had- a duplicate stone, very good, and cut exactly like it, - and, if so, would he not have first tried if the Sikh Prince would accept the counterfeit? Yes, - he would first try this; and as the Sikh had accepted the stone, without further thought or question, the infer- ence was open to reason. This was the stone that the English general seized, and sent over to England. It had never been tested. The way to test a diamond was to subject it to the action of the blow- pipe, by means of which, if a true diamond, it could be all blown away in a gas. With these words the old Hebrew gentleman produced, from be- neath his gabardine, a short bit of candle and a blow-pipe. "But, good heavens! ' I exclaimed, " what 's the good of finding a fact, if the fact itself is blown away in the process?" He calmed my apprehensions*. He only wished to try it at one angle. The least product of the required gas would prove it a diamond, and he would be satisfied. So he lit the bit of candle, and began to blow away with a wise and careful countenance. He blew till he was out of breath, but no gas had been produced. He tried several times. The stone was not a diamond. I fell back upon the pillow. I had risked my life, - passed un- numbered days and nights of thought and labor and anguish, and reduced myself to beggary, - and all for a counterfeit. Yes, for this very counterfeit I stop an hourly chance of being seized, tried,    A PENITENT CONFESSION.          223  and banged. The sooner I got rid ofit, the better. I told the Rabbi so, and he comniended my prudence. He slipped a bank- note into my hand, in a delicate way, and Igave him the Stone, with which he departed. Tle note was for fire pounds. Perhaps I acted foolishly ; but Nemo morgcllzm omniPus roris sapit,-no- body who commits a theft knows very well what he is about. I was not in my proper mind. Besides, how could I contend with this learned old Hebrew,--such knowledge of life, such experience, achildidoh What chance had I with such a man? I was like a child in his hands. I continued ill for several weeks; and, when I was able to leave My bed, being reduced to utter destitution, I was obliged to go into the workhouse. O what thoughts I had of the last brief period of my life, which seemed longer than all the rest put toaether; and how I bemoaned myself as I lay on my back in the little workhouse truckle-bed! I could hardly help laughing at some things; but I was a miserable, broken-hearted man. One day, while I was out in the roads, scrapig up mud, I saw a gig coming along with a large, gray, high-trotting horse. As I was moving out of the way a little, I saw that the man driving it was no other than Bob Styles, in a new white silk bat. He  wore a scarlet tie, and a bright silk waistcoat, with two gold chains across it, and a large cairngorin watch-seal dangling about. Hehadaring one finaer of the whip-hand. It was my turquoise How did he ob- tain these?- O. O how should I know ! As he passed me he leered down, with his tongue thrust in his cheek. At the same moment- one wheel passed over the iron part of my mud-scraper, and jarred me all up the elbow, which, by a simultaneous movement, I seemed to strike upon the hard wooden arm of a chair"-*" and I awoke.
