PREFACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
where freedom of speech is tolerated, and where uni-&#xD;
versal education renders every one more or less familiar&#xD;
with passing events and the topics of the times. But&#xD;
those who have freely mingled with that class of Loui-&#xD;
sianians who still cling to the faith of Jeff. Davis, will&#xD;
not be surprised to learn that Macpherson's philosophy&#xD;
was so much in accordance with theirs, and that his&#xD;
exaggerated style of speech was so faithful a copy of&#xD;
secession bombast, that the "great Confederate Philos-&#xD;
opher" was, for some weeks, quite a favorite with the&#xD;
hot-headed rebels of the Crescent City.&#xD;
Many of the incidents which the author attempted&#xD;
to ridicule in these-" Letters," were too local in their&#xD;
character to be understood by a reader not familiar&#xD;
with the facts. So far as practicable, these parts have&#xD;
been omitted in this publication, and such explanatory&#xD;
notes have been prefixed to each chapter, as seemed ne-&#xD;
cessary to give the general reader an understanding of&#xD;
its import.&#xD;
The author will state that when he commenced the&#xD;
publication of these letters, he had no expectation of&#xD;
writing but one ; and to that he signed the first name&#xD;
that occurred to him, without reflection. He was not&#xD;
then aware that an officer named James B. McPherson&#xD;
held a commission in the United States Army,-an ig-&#xD;
norance due, probably, to the :fact that for many&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
months the author was in service where newspapers&#xD;
seldom reached him. But the officer in question, by&#xD;
his gallant conduct on many hard-fought fields, has&#xD;
made a national reputation for skilful and daring gen-&#xD;
eralship, and his name is as familiar as househlild&#xD;
words to all who have read the story of Vicksburg,&#xD;
and of the various movements of the noble army of&#xD;
General Grant.&#xD;

NOTE.-Madisonville is a town situated on the Tchefuncta river,&#xD;
near Lake Pontchartrain, and was within the rebel lines at the time&#xD;
these letters were written, as it is, in fact, at the present time. The&#xD;
people were known to be destitute of many of the necessaries of life,&#xD;
and the secessionists of New Orleans made a strong effort to induce&#xD;
the authorities to permit free trade across the lake, on the ground&#xD;
that humanity required it, and that the people were non-combatants.&#xD;
The Daily Picayune advocated this theory, and a writer, signing&#xD;
himself " Observer," published a communication in that paper urging&#xD;
its adoption by the authorities. The notion appeared too absurd to&#xD;
be treated seriously, and the author attempted to exhibit it in this&#xD;
light in the following letter, which appeared in THE ERA, February&#xD;
17th, 1863.&#xD;
MADISONVILIE, LA.,&#xD;
sunday Evening, February 15.&#xD;
Sm:-I have a wife a        welve children, all of them&#xD;
sons except the wife. Nine of them are in the Con-&#xD;
federate service, and so am I.    The other three are not&#xD;

By all means let some one lend Mr. Observer the capi-&#xD;
tal if he hasn't got it, for there is no reason why non-&#xD;
combatants shouldn't be fed.&#xD;
Yours, sincerely,&#xD;
JAMES 3. MACPHERSoN.&#xD;
P. S.-While you are about it, tell Observer to bring&#xD;
me an English rifle, with a cartridge-box, and a hun-&#xD;
dred rounds of ammunition.&#xD;

old, but he will probably be old enough to join the&#xD;
army before the United States are crushed. Another&#xD;
one has lost a leg in the war, so that he can't march;&#xD;
and the other one is idiotic. I am home on a furlough,&#xD;
and find my wife and three sons bad enough off. They&#xD;
are destitute of many of the necessaries of life, and for&#xD;
yav part I don't know what they will do.&#xD;
think the United States ought to supply them with&#xD;
food. They are non-combatants, and there is no chance&#xD;
hat any of them will ever fight except the youngest;&#xD;
ad Kilulatn i nmiht be made that he should not e t&#xD;
any of the food sent over, if that should be deemed e-&#xD;
esa ry.&#xD;
So long as I and the nine able bodied boys stay in&#xD;
the Confederate army, it will be necessary to have the&#xD;
re't of the family receive supplies from INew Orleans;&#xD;
n  humani y and philanthropy demand that trade&#xD;
should be allowed.&#xD;
I was pleased to read in this morning's P'iecayune, a&#xD;
communication from Mr. Observer, on this point. lie&#xD;
proposes to send salt and other indispensable articles,&#xD;
and says lie would go into the business himself, if he&#xD;
had the means, and could get the necessary authority.&#xD;
I hope lie will go into it at once, as we need the salt&#xD;
much, and the indispensable articles would also come&#xD;
handy. le can make a good thing of it, as we are&#xD;
willing to pay a large price for salt, flour, quinine,&#xD;
clothing, cotton-cards, etc., all of which will bring a&#xD;
larger price here than Observei' will have to give for&#xD;
them in New Orleans. I would pay a large price for&#xD;
what my family needs, as I could fight a great deal&#xD;
better if I knew the folks were comfortable at home.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
MR. MACPHERSON HATH HOPES FOR HIS IDIOTIC BOY.--HE&#xD;
DECLARETH HIMSELF TO BE A GOOD UNION MAN.-COR-&#xD;
RESPONDENCE, AND THE WAY TO SEND IT.-THE TRUE&#xD;
PLAN OF CONCILIATION, ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-Coplfederate prisoners who were to leave New Orleans on&#xD;
p(arole,were discovered to have contraband letters sewed into their&#xD;
clothing.&#xD;
MADISONYILLE, LA.,&#xD;
February 21st, 1863.&#xD;
SI R:-I find that TnE ERA published my letter, in&#xD;
which I showed that the United States ought to sup-&#xD;
port my family as long as I am in the Confederate ser-&#xD;
viee, and that the destitute people on this side of the&#xD;
lake should be permitted to trade with New Orleans.&#xD;
When I saw that letter in TImE ERA, I experienced all&#xD;
the pleasure of a man who, for the first time, sees his&#xD;
name mn print. I looked at it two or three hours, and&#xD;
then handed it over to my Idiotic Boy.&#xD;
I could not restrain my tears, when I thought of the&#xD;
unhappy fate of that youth, doomed never to write a&#xD;
letter for the newspapers, nor to realize the blissful&#xD;
feelings which swelled in his father's heart at gazing&#xD;
upon his own name in small-cap letters.&#xD;
"Cheer up, my dear,' said my wife. "James, to be&#xD;
sure, is an idiot, but idiots does sometimes write for&#xD;
le wspapers.&#xD;
Immediately she handed me "Observer's" letter in&#xD;
Sunday's Pcayune, and I became calm. Whenever I&#xD;
look at that letter I believe fully my wife's remark.&#xD;

As I told you before, I am home on a furlough, and&#xD;
so long as I remain away from my regiment, at Port&#xD;
iHudson, I consider myself a non-combatant, and I de-&#xD;
miand from the United States government all the rights&#xD;
of a neutral. I wish, while my furlough continues, to&#xD;
take a hand in trade across the lake, and as Observer&#xD;
promises to go into it if anybody will furnish funds, I&#xD;
now definitely offer him my assistance, and promise to&#xD;
invest my last three months' pay as a private, which I&#xD;
have just drawn from the paymaster in Confederate&#xD;
treasury notes and Madisonville butchers' tickets, and&#xD;
three dollars of which awor1tmee cents in coin.&#xD;
What I want now, s, to make arrangements for get-&#xD;
ting all the newspapers across the lake, and to gain in-&#xD;
formation in regard to the Union soldiers in General&#xD;
Banks's Department. So long as I am a neutral, I have&#xD;
a perfect right to know what is going on, and the in-&#xD;
formation thus obtained I could sell to my General for&#xD;
a high price, which would do much towards feeding my&#xD;
destitute family, and helping on our speculations. You&#xD;
will therefore please forward to me immediately a full&#xD;
statement of the number of troops in the Department&#xD;
of the Gulf, where the camps are located, the quality of&#xD;
arms, the number of guns, the amount of ammunition,&#xD;
the number, strength, and position of the gunboats, the&#xD;
maps and plans of future operations by land and water,&#xD;
and any other small matters which would be of interest&#xD;
and use to me, and which can do no harm so long as I&#xD;
am a non-combatant. If, however, the military author-&#xD;
ities should differ from the Picayune and me' in these&#xD;
matters, please sew all necessary letters into the collars&#xD;
and cuffs of the coats of Confederate soldiers, bound&#xD;

only by a parole of honor, and stuff all the newspapers&#xD;
you can find into the legs of their breeches.&#xD;
But there can be no possible objection to permitting&#xD;
free correspondence with me. I am, in fact, a good&#xD;
Union man, and boldly proclaim my Union sentiments&#xD;
among my comrades. My doctrine is, that the United&#xD;
States ought to lay down their arms at once, and then&#xD;
ask for an armistice, preparatory to a recognition of the&#xD;
Southern Confederacy. Such a step would place the&#xD;
Confederate States under great obligations to the United&#xD;
States, and would engender a sentiment of friendship.&#xD;
It would, to be sure, result in the complete success of&#xD;
the Confe:d rate cause ; but it would heal all feelings&#xD;
of wounded pride on our part, and perhaps ultimately&#xD;
restore thlinen. I, for one, would then go for a re-&#xD;
establishment of the Union, on condition that all the&#xD;
Nor th1emi men who do not agree with inc should be hung&#xD;
or expelled from the country. If the United States&#xD;
would consent to this, and purge itself effectually of all&#xD;
men of opposite politics, I think we might be reunited&#xD;
and live together in peace. But so long as any one&#xD;
favorable to the United States government is tolerated&#xD;
in the North, I, for one, am opposed to the Union, and&#xD;
will urge the Confederate army to fight, and make all&#xD;
I can out of it. Let the United States government&#xD;
pursue a conciliatory policy and hang all its friends,&#xD;
however, and I believe then a happy peace will dawn&#xD;
upon this land, and the advocates of war will skulk&#xD;
away in terror and disgrace.&#xD;
Yours, truly,&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE GREAT SECESSION DEMONSTRATION IN NEW -ORLEANS,&#xD;
AS DESCRIBED BY Louis T. WIGFALL MACPHEIIsoN.&#xD;
NoTE.-On the 20th February, 1863, a large number of rebel pris-&#xD;
oners left New Orleans to be exchanged. They were to have been&#xD;
taken on the steamer Empire Parish; but that vessel met with some&#xD;
accident before she got ofl 'The departure of these prisoners was&#xD;
made the occasion of a grand demonstration on the part of the seces-&#xD;
sion women of the city, who thronged the levee by thousands, to cx-&#xD;
press their sympathy for the cause of treason. The prisoners all&#xD;
went away wiath new suits of clothes, furnished by rebel women in&#xD;
the city, and would have carried other suits had the authorities per-&#xD;
mitted it. The a-sembly became so noiy and insolent, that a regi-&#xD;
ment of soldiers finally cleared the levee.&#xD;
MADnSONvILLE, LA.,&#xD;
February 28th, 1833.&#xD;
SIR:-I now forward a copy of the letter of my son&#xD;
Louis T. Wigfall, of the Confederate Army ; and here&#xD;
I deem it proper to state that I am a 'descendant of&#xD;
revolutionary sires, and consequently that I named my&#xD;
sons after the greatest lights of American history.&#xD;
They are: George Washington, Louis T. Wigfall,&#xD;
Thomas Jefferson, Roger A. Pryor, Ben. Wood, John&#xD;
C. Breckinridge, Andrew     Jackson, Toussaint l'Ouver-&#xD;
ture, and Horatio Seymour. Those are the names of&#xD;
my nine boys in the army. The idiot I have named&#xD;
James Buchanan Floyd, the cripple Braxton Bragg,&#xD;
and the infant Mason Slidell. Having premised thus&#xD;
much, I will proceed with the letter:&#xD;

Louis T. Vigfall .ilapherson's Adventures in New&#xD;
Or1eans.&#xD;
Louis T. Wigfall Macpherson writes:&#xD;
"I've had the biggest kind of a time sense you hurd&#xD;
from Me last. I was took prisoner by the Yanks. I&#xD;
had sworn never to surrender alive, and I never would&#xD;
have done it, only My back happened to be turned at&#xD;
the minit, and so they got Me and sent Me to New&#xD;
Orleans with the rest. They locked me up for a while,&#xD;
but 'then they let Me out on payroll in the streets, and&#xD;
I had the fredum of the sitty.&#xD;
"Well, as I went saunchering along the streets I met&#xD;
a lady whose dress and proud bearing told, me at once&#xD;
she belonged to the alight, and so it proved. She&#xD;
stopped and looked at me inquiringly, and finally bend-&#xD;
ing her proud head towards me, she says: 'Pardon&#xD;
Me, sir, but isn't you a Confederate. soljur ?' Says I:t.&#xD;
'Yes, miss, I is.' Says she to Me: 'I thought so by&#xD;
your proud and hauty bearing, and by your dilapidated&#xD;
gray garments, which is dearer in my eyes than the&#xD;
vestments of a monarch, or the costly robes of the&#xD;
Prince do Joinville.' Then I bent my hauty head to-&#xD;
wards her and said : 'I thank you, miss; you do Me&#xD;
proud.' Then says she : ' Come and see us;' and says&#xD;
I : 'Where do you live;' Then she told me, and I&#xD;
went to see 'em that very night.&#xD;
"I found that the family belonged to the alight, and&#xD;
was all of the wright stripe. The lady had ate dau-&#xD;
teis, seven of them grown up, and all of them lovely&#xD;
and charming as rose-blossoms, and all as secesh as&#xD;
Lovell or Vallandigham. The old lady had a stick&#xD;
&#xD;
about two feet long, which she had saved from the&#xD;
rebel flagstaff at Fort Jackson ever since our victory&#xD;
there over Farrigut. It was beautiful to see her wave&#xD;
this stick over the heads of her obediunt dauters and&#xD;
hurrah for the Confederacy.&#xD;
"Says all of them to Me : 'Make this your home as&#xD;
long as you are in New Orleans.' Says I: 'Thank&#xD;
you, kind ladies, I will do so;' and I did. I staid in&#xD;
that house until I was exchanged, and it was beautiful&#xD;
and romantic to see the devotion of them lovely dauters&#xD;
of the South. I was as ragged as Lazarus, and liadn't&#xD;
a red, and so the old lady sent for a Confederate taylor,&#xD;
and had him make Me a sute of close-a nice ;gray uni-&#xD;
form; and then they took Me up to the photographic&#xD;
gallery and had My likeness took, Sut this wouldn't&#xD;
do, and each of the ate dauters had a sute made, and&#xD;
each one of them presented me with a Confederate uni-&#xD;
form complete.&#xD;
"Purty soon the time cum to be exchanged on the&#xD;
Empire Parish, and then I put on my whole nine sutes&#xD;
at a time. I felt grand and looked like the Irysh jiunt,&#xD;
only not as tall. Says they all: 'We are sorry to lose&#xD;
your society, but the Confederacy needs your services,&#xD;
and we must let you go.' Then they all cryed.&#xD;
"It was now time to go down to the boat, and these&#xD;
lovely ladies was determined to show their devotion to&#xD;
our hoely cawse. So the old lady took her stick, and&#xD;
she with the ate dauters, all wearing. seceshun flags&#xD;
around their wastes, formed a holler square around Me,&#xD;
and I marched in the senter with them as a escort of&#xD;
onur. As we was going to the levee we met a Yank&#xD;
soljur, who shouted out: 'Go it, grayback !-you need&#xD;

insult from a Yank !' and then she knocked him down&#xD;
with the peace of the flag-staff allewded to; and I ap-&#xD;
plawded her and the dauters laft. It was a beautiful&#xD;
site to behold that woman bend her proud and hauty&#xD;
head and raise her delicate white snowy arm in the&#xD;
cawse of her country, and to see those lovely dauters,&#xD;
so alight, smiling sweetly upon her.&#xD;
"There was a glorious time at the Levee. Holier&#xD;
squares kept coming in, and all true to the cawse; and&#xD;
in order to show em I was not afrade to fite, I knocked&#xD;
a lig mngger Of the wharf into the river. Just as I&#xD;
wa   on      orteodld          lpe    Me On the&#xD;
w  s g i g a  oad  th  ol  la y sa  ed  M  on shoulder;  but I  didn't feel it, her  hand  was  so  delicate&#xD;
and I had so many sutes of gray close on. But says&#xD;
she: ' There's one thing I've forgot.' Then she ripped&#xD;
open my cufps and collers, and sode in a catalogue of&#xD;
Farra'ut's ships and General Banks's troops, saying:&#xD;
That's for Jef. Davis.' Says I: 'Miss Im on my&#xD;
payroll of onur not to do so.' Says she : 'A Confeder..&#xD;
ate payroll is not wuth a red,' or words to that effect;&#xD;
and so after they had put a newspaper and a plug of&#xD;
tobacker in each pocket, they all kissed Me, and the old&#xD;
lady said: 'Brave son of the Confederacy !-the alight&#xD;
of the cty has come to see you off and to shour on your&#xD;
heads the blessings of patryotic matruns and spotless&#xD;
mades, and to fill your pockets with letters and to-&#xD;
backer. Axcept these toakuns of our patriotic devo-&#xD;
shun, and think of us when you are far above Baton&#xD;
Rouge!   Says I: 'Thanks, miss, to you and your ate&#xD;
alight dauters for your patryotic wishes for the tobacker&#xD;
you have bestowed on my unworthy head, and for&#xD;
&#xD;
teaching me the value of a Confederate payroll of&#xD;
onur.'&#xD;
"Then I went aboard, and the old lady she swung&#xD;
her stick and we all give three cheers for Jeff. Davis;&#xD;
and then I fell off of the paddle-box into the river, over-&#xD;
cum with the manly emotions which swelled in my&#xD;
bosom. A Yank pulled me out, for I had so many&#xD;
close on I couldn't stur. If I ever meet him in battle&#xD;
I'll ring his neck for him.&#xD;
"I was so heavy with wet close and things that it&#xD;
took the whole ship's crew to pull me out. They set&#xD;
me on the paddle-box, and I was so heavy that the&#xD;
whole concern broke down, and they had to put us on&#xD;
another ship.&#xD;
"As soon as we got up to Port Hudson, I sold all my&#xD;
close for $800 a sute, bringing me a total of $7,200,&#xD;
and now I'm perfectly destitute-haven't got a decent&#xD;
sute to put on. Send my order to the United States&#xD;
for a new uniform, and invest my money in salt and&#xD;
ship it up to Port Hudson on a flag-of-truce-boat im-&#xD;

I now wish to make a few remarks on the subject of&#xD;

and am dead set against having them enlisted as soldiers&#xD;
in the service of the United States; and I regard such&#xD;
enlistments as inhuman, wicked, barbarous, and damn a-&#xD;

you come to make them Confederate soldiers, I, for&#xD;
one, am in favor of it; and if nine regiments are&#xD;
raised, I mean that each of my sons shall be a Colonel.&#xD;
I will then get my furlough cancelled, and take the field&#xD;

FROM JEFF. DAVIS.-A GOOD CONFEDERATE LAD rWITH&#xD;
YANIEE BOAuDEns.--A GROSS INSULT TO THE CONFEDER-&#xD;
ACY, ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-Many secessionists in New Orleans took the oath of alle-&#xD;
giance to the United States, merely to save their property from con-&#xD;
fiscation. It was .not uncommon for them to boast that such was&#xD;
their only motive, and that they did not regard the oath as binding&#xD;
upon their consciences. This was true of some who gained their&#xD;
daily bread by boarding Federal officers. It was not an unusual&#xD;
spectacle to see ladies cross the street rather than pass under a flag&#xD;
of the United States ; this was one way in which they exhibited&#xD;
their hatred of the Union, and their sympathy for the rebel cause.&#xD;

request that my furlough might be extended ; and in&#xD;
reply I received, by telegraph, the following:&#xD;
Letter from Jeff. Davis.&#xD;
"RICHMOND, VA., March 3.&#xD;
"My DEAR MACPHERSON :-I have received from&#xD;
time to time the copies of THE ERA containing your&#xD;
wise and patriotic letters, which I have read with ever-&#xD;
increasing pleasure.  The sufferings of your family and&#xD;
the destitution which prevails among my subjects have&#xD;

oath is binding upon the conscience of a Confederate,&#xD;
unless taken before a Confederate magistrate. Having&#xD;
eaten enough to last you until your next visit, and&#xD;
made such observations as will be useful to the cause,&#xD;
you will return on the first flag-of-truce-boat, and im-&#xD;

obtain. Also, bring your satchel full of edibles for&#xD;

I was proud enough, the Lord knows, when I first&#xD;
saw my name printed in THE EEA ; but what shall I&#xD;
say of my feelings when I received the above letter?&#xD;
"Is it possible," I cried aloud, clasping my hands and&#xD;
raising my eyes impressively, in a manner which would&#xD;
do credit to Vining Bowers; "is it possible that the&#xD;
President of the new nation, the anchor of Southern&#xD;
independence, the fag-staff of our proud stars and bars,&#xD;
the chiefest demigod of Confederate mythology, has&#xD;
condescended to write to me in terms of fraternal en-&#xD;
dearment ?" I clasped my Idiotic Boy to my bosom,&#xD;
waved my letter aloft to heaven, seized my satchel,&#xD;

when he first espied the United States treasury build-&#xD;

ilacpherson's manly Struggle with his Conscience.&#xD;
The first encounter I had was with my own con-&#xD;
science. Said conscience to me: "Macpherson, re-&#xD;
member.that thou art the descendant of revolutionary&#xD;
sires, the proud representative of an honorable house&#xD;
and name, the great light and mirror of Madisonville&#xD;
chivalry, and, more than all, the confidential agent of&#xD;
Jeffi Davis, the greatest man that ever trod in Confed-&#xD;
erate shoes, worth $300 a pair. Then how canst thou&#xD;
O Macpherson, lover of honor and hater of Yankees,&#xD;
raise thy hand to heaven and swear allegiance to a&#xD;
flag which, to thine illuminated mind, is the symbol of&#xD;
ungodly power and basest tyranny? and how canst&#xD;
thou consent to eat the bread of Yankees, gotten under&#xD;
the false pretense that thou art faithful to their flag?&#xD;
o Macpherson! pause and go home !"&#xD;
But I told my conscience to dry up. Did not Daniel&#xD;
eat the bread of the pagan king, and was not Daniel&#xD;
bold as a lion? "I will take the oath," said I, "but&#xD;
there is not Spaulding's glue enough among living&#xD;
men to stick me to it !"&#xD;
.acpherson takes the Oath of Allegiance.&#xD;
Well, I went and took the oath. It was a matter of&#xD;
compulsion, because it was the only way I could get&#xD;
side the lines without becoming a prisoner ; and when&#xD;
a man takes an oath under compulsion, he is allowed to&#xD;

the oath of allegiance, I asked the Yankee officer if he&#xD;
would have the goodness to let me look at the Bible&#xD;
before I swore. He kindly assented, and looking at&#xD;
the imprint I found it had been published in Boston,&#xD;
and was a regular abolition concern; and then con-&#xD;
science gave way, and said I could swear to any thing&#xD;
I chose on a Bible printed north of Mason and Dixon's&#xD;

think of now ; but one of the points was that I would&#xD;
never bear arms against the United States. But to&#xD;
this I mentally added the words, "so long as my fur-&#xD;
lough lasts," and my conscience went to sleep as sound-&#xD;
ly as though it had been soothed by twenty whisky-&#xD;
skins at Marble Hall.&#xD;
Macpherson fnds a good Confederate lady.&#xD;
As I expected to remain in town most of the week,&#xD;
I resolved to find a boarding-house with some good&#xD;
Confederate who had taken the oath of allegiance. I&#xD;
soon discovered such a place--a house kept by a Con-&#xD;
federate lady, whose husband and three sons are in our&#xD;
army, boldly fighting for Southern independence, and&#xD;
who has taken the oath of allegiance to save the prop-&#xD;
erty from confiscation. I found this good lady to be&#xD;
true blue.  "Macpherson," said she, when I applied&#xD;
for board, "have you taken the oath of allegiance to&#xD;
the Abolitionists ?" I blushed all over, from the crown&#xD;
of my Confederate head to the soles of my Confederate&#xD;
shoes, as I replied, "Yes."  "Well, then," said this&#xD;
brave lady, "if you have done that git out of this&#xD;
house! Them as leaves the army when they ought to&#xD;
&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
be bearing the burden and heat of the Confederate day,&#xD;
musn't come sneaking around this house for shelter.&#xD;
If I was a man, do you think I would be here? No&#xD;
sir-ee. I would have a Jeff. Davis musket on my shoul-&#xD;
der, and would be sending death and blood abroad&#xD;
among the Yankees as a besom of destruction. Where&#xD;
is my sons and husband ?. Isn't they doing their duty&#xD;
to the Confederacy on the bloody field, and one of them&#xD;
in the commissary department ! Oh! I hate cowards&#xD;
and traitors, and a man as leaves the Confederacy and&#xD;
comes over to live on Yankee bread is all three com-&#xD;
bined in one mean hateful critter, who can't find no&#xD;
encouragement nor shelter under this roof! Git out of&#xD;
here, James B. Macpherson !-or I'll have my nigger&#xD;
kick you into the gutter !"&#xD;
As she gave utterance to these noble and patriotic&#xD;
sentiments, her tall form was erect, her eyes flashed&#xD;
with Confederate fire like the bolts of Olympian Jove;&#xD;
her fists were clenched in the very ecstasy of anger,&#xD;
and cowering before her for mercy, I could but feel&#xD;
that I was in the presence of a goddess.&#xD;
"Minerva of Louisiana !" I exclaimed, kneeling be-&#xD;
fore her-"iPallas Athen6 of the Confederacy! let me&#xD;
explain to you the manner and meaning of my visit.&#xD;
Allow me to-"&#xD;
Just at this stage of my address, the good lady's nig-&#xD;
ger, in obedience to a wave of her hand, came stealthi-&#xD;
ly behind me, opened the door, and seizing me by the&#xD;
collar, kicked me out of the house, landing me square&#xD;
in the gutter.&#xD;
I sat there a considerable time, when suddenly a&#xD;
Yankee officer approached, and he asked me into his&#xD;

room. To my astonishment, he walked into the very&#xD;
house from which I had just been so summarily ejected.&#xD;
I sat down and wrote an explanation of my position,&#xD;
and sent it to the good lady. In five minutes she sent&#xD;
for me, said she was delighted to see me, proud to have&#xD;
me under her roof, and that I needn't pay. a picayune&#xD;
for board as long as I staid there. She then had the&#xD;
nigger whipped for kicking me out, and from that mo-&#xD;
ment we were fast friends.&#xD;
I found that her house was full of Yankee officers,&#xD;
except two beautiful young ladies who boarded there,&#xD;
and were true as steel to the Confederacy.&#xD;
"How comes it, madam," I inquired, "that a woman&#xD;
of your proud and patriotic spirit ever consented to&#xD;
take the oath of allegiance, or to have your establish-&#xD;
ment supported by Yankee officers ?"&#xD;
"Because," replied the good lady, "necessity is the&#xD;
mother of invention, and being a mother myself I can&#xD;
appreciate it. As to taking the oath of allegiance, that&#xD;
don't amount to nothing. The oath never went&#xD;
through my teeth ; it was necessary to save my proper-&#xD;
ty, and I say it boldly, I have no more respect for that&#xD;
oath than I have for the President of Ilayti. As to&#xD;
the Yankee boarders, the times has been when there&#xD;
wasn't Confederate treasury notes enough in Jacob&#xD;
Barker's safe to hire me to feed a Yankee officer ; but&#xD;
times has changed, and finding that I could live on&#xD;
Yankees and hate 'em at the same time, I yielded to&#xD;
the mother of invention."&#xD;
If Mrs. Macpherson could have looked into my heart,&#xD;
as the good lady gave utterance to the above honorable&#xD;
and patriotic sentiments, I fear she might have been&#xD;

jealous of the lively admiration with which the good&#xD;
lady inspired me. But whatever emotions were rising&#xD;
in my heart were suddenly overwhelmed by a great&#xD;
event.&#xD;
The two young ladies referred to previously, came&#xD;
into the room, trembling with excitement and pale with&#xD;
ghastly anger.&#xD;
"Has it come to this !" cried the beautiful maiden.&#xD;
"Are we to be insulted at our very doors !"&#xD;
My chivalric Madisonville blood was aroused by the&#xD;
sight of suffering beauty. "Haste me to know it !" I&#xD;
cried, springing to my feet, "  that I, with wings as swift&#xD;
% s meditation or the thoughts of love, may have the&#xD;
vile ruflian whipped. Where is the big nigger that&#xD;
kicked me out of dodrs ? Madam, bring him hither,&#xD;
that we may avenge the injuries of your house !"&#xD;
"Such insolence !" cried the beautiful maiden, "and&#xD;
at our very door! I never !".and she stamped her deli-&#xD;
cate foot upon the carpet, as though she would crush&#xD;
the United States beneath it.&#xD;
"What's the matter ?" demanded the good lady, in&#xD;
tones of angelic thunder.&#xD;
But the beautiful maiden could not answer. She be-&#xD;
came speechless with patriotic rage, and fell to the&#xD;
earth, pointing to the door and gasping with her faint-&#xD;
ing breath-&#xD;
"The flag !-the flag !"&#xD;
Hastening to the door, we beheld a loathsome spec-&#xD;
tacle. The man living near our door, a citizen of New&#xD;
Orleans, had displayed a United States flag from his&#xD;
dwelling. A more gross insult to the Confederacy and to&#xD;
the good people who have taken the oath of allegiance to&#xD;
&#xD;

save their property, could not be imagined. As the&#xD;
good lady gazed upon that detestable emblem of tyranny&#xD;
and bloody despotism, to which she had taken the oath&#xD;
of allegiance, she ground her teeth together, so that&#xD;
you could hear them around the corner. Then we shut&#xD;
the door, and all fainted.&#xD;
As soon as we recovered, we held a family consulta-&#xD;
tion, and it was discussed whether to leave for the Con-&#xD;
federacy or to commit suicide. The beautiful maiden&#xD;
argued in favor of the latter course, as a sentimental&#xD;
way of serving the Confederacy. " How romantic !"&#xD;
she exclaimed ; "what a splendid subject for a Confed-&#xD;
erate Sylvanus Cobb !-what a touching picture for the&#xD;
artist of Harper's Weekly or Frank Leslie's ]l1us-&#xD;
trateci I-Oh! let us commit suicide, and be first in the&#xD;
book of Confederate martyrs, as a lovely matron and&#xD;
maid, who died rather than live under the flag to which&#xD;
they had taken the oath of allegiance, to save their&#xD;
property ! I wish," she added with a sigh, which moved&#xD;
me to tears, "that the whole Southern Confederacy&#xD;
would commit suicide I"&#xD;
This noble and patriotic sentiment would have pre-&#xD;
vailed, only we wished to preserve the property and&#xD;
make some more money out of the Yankees; and so&#xD;
we decided that every time we went out of the house,&#xD;
we would go bolt across the street and walk on the&#xD;
other side until we had passed the hateful flag, and then&#xD;
recross the street, thus omitting to walk under it. And&#xD;
the ladies went and took down the name and number&#xD;
of the man who had committed this outrage against the&#xD;
Confederacy, and I immediately sent the memorandum&#xD;
on to Jeff. Davis, asking his protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
Just before leaving New Orleans, I got very drunk.&#xD;
In that state I went to the telegraph office and got&#xD;
Bulkley to send the following dispatch to Jef. Davis:&#xD;
"DEAR JAvIs :-Honor report drunkenness alarming&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
MACPHERSON, JOURNEYING TO AIADIsONYILLE, SEES THE GREAT&#xD;
CONFEDERATE CROSs IN THE IIEAVENS.-IE IS SEIZED BY&#xD;
ARIZONIAN GUERILLAS, AND TAKEN TO TIE PLACE o' Ex-&#xD;
ECUTION.-IIS ESCAPE FROM DEATH, ETC.&#xD;
NoTE.-The New Orleans Picayune, of March 7th, contained the&#xD;
following extraordinary announcement of a great phenomenon in&#xD;
the heavens:&#xD;
A CRoss IN THE IIEAVENS.-A well-defined cross was seen in the&#xD;
sky over Kingston, N. C., some two weeks since. A correspondent,&#xD;
writing from that point to the Wilmington (N. C.) Journal, gives the&#xD;
following description of the phenomenon:&#xD;
"The moon rose cloudless. At a little before seven o'clock, two&#xD;
bright spcts, some twelve degrees (Qr. in extent?) were visible, one&#xD;
North and the other South, and immediately thereafter a cross was&#xD;
seen in the heavens, the moon joining the four arms of the cross.&#xD;
About half-past eight o'clock the Northern light went out, but the&#xD;
cross and the spot to tile South remained until past ten, when I re-&#xD;
tired. Can any one tell when the cross appeared before since the&#xD;
days of Constantine, when the letters of I. H. S. accompanied the&#xD;
Sign ?"&#xD;
Sibley, it is known, commanded a body of Arizonian cavalry ; and&#xD;
a detachment of these wild and irregular troops one day "gobbled"&#xD;
a correspondent of THE ERA. He was made to follow them nineteen&#xD;
hours, when he was released in consideration of his gold watch and&#xD;
fifty dollars. The Memphis Appeal was in high favor with the seces-&#xD;
sionists of New Orleans, and its reports of rebel successes were about&#xD;
as truthful as the account contained in Macpherson's letter. The&#xD;
guerillas were much given to destroying the telegraph within our&#xD;
lines.&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
February 14th, 1863.&#xD;
SIR:-I approach my subject with awe and supersti-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
I am the illuminated Confederate who saw the Great&#xD;
Cross in the Heavens, described by the Wilmington&#xD;
&#xD;
Journal, and reverently believed by the New Orleans&#xD;
Picayune.&#xD;
It will be remembered that, on the occasion of my&#xD;
recent visit to New Orleans, where I took the oath of&#xD;
allegiance to the United States, in order to get some-&#xD;
thing to eat, I left that city in a state of beastly intox-&#xD;
ication. In one pocket of my breeches I had a bottle&#xD;
of whisky, and in the other a copy of the Picayune,&#xD;
of the 7th inst.&#xD;
As I crossed the line and set foot upon the sacred&#xD;
soil of my beloved Confederacy, I cried aloud : "I ail,&#xD;
sweet Confederacy 1-land of my ancestors 1-land for&#xD;
which George Washington was shot at by an Indian&#xD;
seventeen times, in a single battle !-for which Jackson&#xD;
fought at New   Orleans - for which Burgoyne sur-&#xD;
rendered at Saratoga Springs, as thousands have done&#xD;
since !-welcome thy faithful Macpherson once more to&#xD;
thy Confederate bosom ! What graphic recollections&#xD;
of hunger and thirst crowd upon my patriotic mind, as&#xD;
I tread again thy consecrated soil with a newtpair of&#xD;
shoes ! For thy sake, I see Ethan Allen demanding&#xD;
the surrender of Ticonderoga, Columbus prowling&#xD;
around in search of the New World, and the Pilgrim&#xD;
Fathers building huts in the wilds of New England!"&#xD;
Narrow Escape from Death.&#xD;
Just at this stage of my apostrophe, I was startled&#xD;
by a loud crash, and a flashing line of fire from the&#xD;
thicket in my rear, followed by a voice which cried:&#xD;
"Die, base Yankee dog !"   The Confederate picket&#xD;

Fathers and New England, and, supposing I was a&#xD;
Yankee, had fired upon me a whole volley of Confed-&#xD;
erate musketry. Overcome by a strong emotion of&#xD;
fear, I fell prostrate upon the soil, and was left for dead.&#xD;
But gathering myself up, I soon discovered that I was&#xD;
as alive as ever, and that the only result of the volley&#xD;
had been to deprive me of a considerable portion of my&#xD;
pantaloons.-&#xD;
Grateful for my deliverance from premature and un-&#xD;
natural homicide, I fell into a train of serious reflection ;&#xD;
and conscience, with a heavy hand, chastised me for&#xD;
approaching my native land in a state of beastly in-&#xD;
toxication. I therefore fell upon my knees, and took&#xD;
the pledge of perpetual temperance. I vowed in the&#xD;
most solemn manner that never again, while life should&#xD;
last or the Confederacy endure, would I, under any cir-&#xD;
cunstances, taste, touch, or handle one drop of spirituous&#xD;
or malt liquors, wine, Louisiana rum, or cider. I then&#xD;
danced a double-shuffle, and chanted the Bonnie Blue&#xD;
Flag,with a snatch of Stonewall Jaeckson's Grand 2JfarcJ.&#xD;
Overcome by patriotic emotions, I determined to&#xD;
modify my temperance pledge so far as to take one big&#xD;
swig of whisky. And as I had now come within sight&#xD;
of Madisonville, I sat down by the fence, and taking&#xD;
the bottle from my pocket, cried aloud: "0 Bacchus !&#xD;
son of Jupiter and Semel6, thou the victim of Juno's&#xD;
unrelenting hatred, who didst cause the women of&#xD;
Thebes to run wildly through the woods like Confed-&#xD;
erate Gorillas, to thee I dedicate my last parting drink 1"&#xD;
I then took the biggest swig of whisky I ever took in&#xD;
my life, and the effect was so pleasing, that I kept&#xD;
drinking until the bottle was empty.&#xD;
&#xD;
MACPHERSON'S VISION.         37&#xD;
&#xD;
The Vision.&#xD;
In this frame of mind, and while still seated by the&#xD;
highway, under the fence, I imagined myself at home&#xD;
in my own room. I trust I shall be excused for allud-&#xD;
ing to the subject, but the truth of history requires me&#xD;
to state, that under this strange inwression I undressed&#xD;
myself and went to bed, hanging the remnants of my&#xD;
pantaloons on a fence post, believing it to be a chair.&#xD;
Little did I imagine that my bed was Confederate soil,&#xD;
and my shelter the brave o'erhanging firmament, the&#xD;
majestical roof fretted with golden fire. Yet, so it was,&#xD;
and there, upon the all-nourishing bosom of the Con&#xD;
federacy, there on the highway, in the sight of the&#xD;
spires of Madisonville, I lay down under the fence and&#xD;
slept the sleep of intoxicated innocence, dreaming of&#xD;
Jeff. Davis, the Confederate States of America, Con-&#xD;
stantine, Temperance, Bacchus, and Macpherson.&#xD;
Now it was that a wonderful vision broke upon my&#xD;
bewildered gaze, which I fear the English language is&#xD;
too feeble to describe. Nevertheless, I will try.&#xD;
Nor erat. The moon arose cloudless. At a little&#xD;
before seven o'clock two bright spots, about twelve&#xD;
degrees, were visible, one north and the other south&#xD;
and immediately a cross was seen in the heavens, the&#xD;
moon joining the four arms of the cross.    About&#xD;
half-past eight o'clock the northern light went out,&#xD;
but the cross and the spot to the south remained&#xD;
until past ten, when I became too drunk to look at&#xD;
it longer, and retired again to the soil of the Confed-&#xD;
eracy.&#xD;

As I have already stated, the northern light went&#xD;
out at half-past eight o'clock, and by casting his eyes&#xD;
at the above diagram of the vision, the reader will per-&#xD;
ceive that the northern light was Jeff. Davis.&#xD;
Having gone to sleep at half-past ten, I turned un-&#xD;
easily on the soil and partially awoke, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Heaven sends miraculous signs whereby it maketh&#xD;
known its approval of the Confederacy. I will imbrue&#xD;
my hands in Yankee blood, and do such sanguinary&#xD;
deeds as will make the name of Macpherson synony-&#xD;
mous with human gore. My new shoes shall become&#xD;
slippery with homicidal claret."&#xD;

Advnt of the Arizonian Gorilla.&#xD;
Just at this stage of my patriotic address, I was in-&#xD;
terrupted by a voice like that of Mars, when he roared&#xD;
amid the ranks of the contending Greeks and Trojans,&#xD;
far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. It said :&#xD;
"Death to the 'American fanatic and the blind and&#xD;
vindictive Unionist!t'"&#xD;
"That remark," I replied, arousing myself, "is a-&#xD;
quotation from the True Delta's editorial of the 12th&#xD;
inst. Allow me to inquire to whom you refer in that&#xD;
noble and patriotic expression ?"&#xD;
"To you, vile abolition renegade !-you, 'American&#xD;
fanatic and blind and vindictive Unionist !'-you, impu-&#xD;
dent hireling of Abraham Lincoln, a bloodier despot&#xD;
than Nero-a man whose shameless and sanguinary&#xD;
deeds, compared with those of Caligula or Helioga&#xD;
balus, stand black as a Congo African beside a spotless&#xD;
maiden !"&#xD;
"Allow me to inquire," I responded, "to whom I am&#xD;
indebted for the expression of these noble and patriotic&#xD;
sentiments, at this lonely hour, while the celestial vision&#xD;
whispers peace to my Confederate bosom ?"&#xD;
"I am the Arizonian," he shouted; while the woods&#xD;
trembled with the roar of his beautiful voice ; "I am&#xD;
the Chief Gorilla, whose will is Confederate law. I&#xD;
am the bloody avenger of my country's wrongs-the&#xD;
gobbler-up of Yankee emissaries and ERA correspond-&#xD;
ents, whose purpose to tear out thy vile heart is as&#xD;
relentless as destiny. I am Don Antonio Maria de&#xD;

howled.&#xD;

"Pardon me," I replied, "for interrupting you ; but&#xD;
allow me to inquire if you have the latest news through&#xD;
Southern sources&#xD;
He then drew from his pocket the latest lMfempshi&#xD;
Appeal, and read as follows:&#xD;
"We have to record a great Confederate victory over&#xD;
the Hessians, at Madisonville, but the lateness of the&#xD;
hour and the scarcity of rum will not permit us to give&#xD;
full details. Suffice it to say that Gen. Bragg passed&#xD;
through Madisonville on the 12th inst. with a force of&#xD;
four hundred thousand volunteers, and after marching&#xD;
forty-five miles encountered the Yankees with greatly&#xD;
superior numbers. The fight lasted eighteen hours, and&#xD;
the Yankees were totally routed.&#xD;
"On the first discharge of our musketry, fifteen thou-&#xD;
sand Ohio troops fell dead. At the close of the en-&#xD;
gagement we buried two hundred and eighty-seven&#xD;
thousand of the enemy's slain. Not a man was hurt on&#xD;
our side, notwithstanding we were exposed to a terrible&#xD;
and destructive fire from the enemy's batteries for a day&#xD;
and a half.&#xD;
"Nine hundred batteries, two hundred thousand&#xD;
prisoners, a million stand of arms, nineteen major-gen-&#xD;
erals, and thirty thousand commissioned officers are&#xD;
among the spoils of our victory. The commissioned&#xD;
officers will be turned over to Gov. Moore for execution,&#xD;
and the privates will be offered double pay and com-&#xD;
missions to join the Confederate service.&#xD;
" Gen. Bragg will reach New Orleans on the 13th&#xD;
inst., at daylight.&#xD;
"Stonewall Jackson is at Madisonville with eighty-&#xD;
four thousand prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
Latcr.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not one of the enemy survived. Those who were&#xD;
not killed were mortally wounded.&#xD;
"England has recognized the Southern Confederacy,&#xD;
and a French fleet has blockaded New York and Phil-&#xD;
adelphia. Lincoln is a prisoner.&#xD;
Still Later.&#xD;
"We regret to learn that Gen. Bragg's victory was&#xD;
not so decisive as at first supposed. He has fallen back&#xD;
upon Madisonville, and thinks he will be able to hold&#xD;
his position.&#xD;
latest.&#xD;
"The enemy is in full possession of the field, and has&#xD;
advanced two miles. It is believed that Gen. Bragg's&#xD;
loss is but little more than that of the enemy. Full&#xD;
particulars in our next edition."&#xD;
As the Gorilla read the above reliable intelligence, I&#xD;
had an opportunity to survey the extraordinary person&#xD;
before me. his brow was dark almost to blackness;&#xD;
his shoulders were as broad as those of Hercules; his&#xD;
breast was covered with a shaggy Confederate blanket,&#xD;
and his breeches were made of leather. his beard and&#xD;
hair nearly swept the ground, while his head was sur-&#xD;
mounted by a hat with a broad and dilapidated brim.&#xD;
He carried a lasso in his hand, and hurling it with&#xD;
Arizonian agility, he caught me round the neck and&#xD;
drew me to his horse's feet with the'strength of Dr.&#xD;
Windship. He then ordered me to prepare to march&#xD;
immediately to the place of execution.&#xD;

The Vision Eeplained.&#xD;
As I took my unmentionables from the fence, I found,&#xD;
much to my astonishment, that the two arms of the&#xD;
cross disappeared, and I discovered that the fence stake&#xD;
on which they had been hanging, formed the upright&#xD;
part of the great celestial vision and that the moon,&#xD;
shining through the large hole in the above-mentioned&#xD;
garment, had given it the appearance of joining the&#xD;
four arms of the cross, while the Greek inscription and&#xD;
the cabalistic letters were easily accounted for by the&#xD;
vividness of my imagination, and the presence of the&#xD;
Picayune in one of my pockets.&#xD;
"Idiot !" shouted the Gorilla, "mount a steed and&#xD;
make haste, for to-morrow thou shalt die."   I obeyed,&#xD;
and we started off, the squadron all singing a song of&#xD;
which I remember only the following:&#xD;
"I am the bold Gorilla;&#xD;
I wears a ragged shirt.;&#xD;
My face is like Attila,&#xD;
All covered o'er with dirt.&#xD;
Upon the Mississippi,&#xD;

"We've stolen many chickens,&#xD;

This beautiful and patriotic song was interrupted by&#xD;
the sight of a telegraph pole, which immediately in-&#xD;
spired the Gorilla and his followers with uncontrollable&#xD;
&#xD;
rage. "Cut the connection !" was the shout, and dash-&#xD;
ing boldly forward in line, they demolished the tele-&#xD;
graph pole, and cut the wire in thirty-five pieces with&#xD;
their sabres ; after which we resumed our march, over&#xD;
rough and dangerous roads, impenetrable swamps, and&#xD;
impassable bayous, occasionally stopping to turn a&#xD;
family out of the house, or to rob a hen-roost.&#xD;
In nineteen hours we arrived at the place of execu-&#xD;
tion-a beautiful and romantic spot, surrounded by&#xD;
mud and overhung with cypress-trees. "Now," said&#xD;
the Arizonian, "prepare for instant death !"&#xD;
"Is there nothing," I asked, '  that will change thy&#xD;
relentless purpose ?"&#xD;
"Nary," he replied. "I am a patriot, and no base&#xD;
considerations move me. I despise the Yankees for&#xD;
their speculations-their mean tricks of traffic ; I hate&#xD;
them, because they may be approached with bribes,&#xD;
and will sell out for gold or greenbacks. But, as for&#xD;
me," lie continued, haughtily smiting his bosom, "I&#xD;
am swayed only by chivalric devotion to my country.&#xD;
I was educated at West Point, at the expense of the&#xD;
United States, and think I got the best of the Yankees&#xD;
whei I turned against them, notwithstanding their&#xD;
shrewdness. So did Beauregard. But to what didst&#xD;
thou allude, Macpherson, when thou didst ask if any&#xD;
thing might not change my purpose ?"&#xD;
"I alluded," was my answer, "to the condition of&#xD;
the exchequer. I know that such patriots must live,&#xD;
and that Confederate hen-roosts are much exhausted,&#xD;
and on condition that you spare my valuable life, I&#xD;
will contribute to your financial resources."&#xD;
".Hast a gold watch ?" asked the unselfish patriot.&#xD;

" I have."&#xD;
" Hast greenbacks ?"&#xD;
"I have."&#xD;
"Greenbacks," quoth the Gorilla, " are not as good&#xD;
as New Orleans shinplasters and car-tickets. I prefer&#xD;
ragged three-dollar bills cut in two in the middle, for&#xD;
'they remind me of charity concerts, the proceeds of&#xD;
which are used to clothe Confederate prisoners."&#xD;
"Thy wish shall be gratified, most noble of patriots !"&#xD;
I answered; "I will give thee my gold watch, and$50&#xD;
in cut bills, in exchange for my valuable life."&#xD;
"I consider I have got the best of the bargain," said&#xD;
the Gorilla, as he smilingly appropriated the money&#xD;
and watch. "Macpherson, thou hast paid more than&#xD;
thy life is worth."&#xD;
I then returned to Madisonville, thinking of the&#xD;
noble patriotism of those men, actuated only by the&#xD;
love of the new nation, and longing in my heart to&#xD;
kill a Yankee or destroy a telegraph pole.&#xD;
Yours, perseveringly,&#xD;

C!CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT MACPHERSON FESTIVAL AT&#xD;
THE HOUSE OF THE NOBLE WOMAN, IN NEW ORLEANS.&#xD;
NOTE.-Previous to the departure of the British war-vessel Rinal-&#xD;
do from the port of New Orleans, in the spring of 1863, a party was&#xD;
given to the officers of that ship at the house of a secessionist, in&#xD;
great secrecy. The officers had, on every occasion, exhibited their&#xD;
sympathy for the rebel cause, and the party was composed only of&#xD;
faithful secessionists. The toasts, songs, and all proceedings were&#xD;
of the worst rebel description. A flag of the United states was&#xD;
thrown under the table, where all present trampled upon it, and the&#xD;
rebel colors were displayed and honored. -  The tickets of the New&#xD;
Orleans City Railroad Company are used for small change, their&#xD;
value being a picayune-five cents.-At the time this letter was&#xD;
written, the secessionists confidently expected "Stonewall" Jackson&#xD;
to capture the city. Indeed, the race of those who expect to see the&#xD;
rebel power re-established in New Orleans, is not yet extinct ; but as&#xD;
the armies of the "Confederacy" are driven back and defeated by&#xD;
our forces, the rumors of large rebel armies, just ready to dash in&#xD;
upon the city, become more vague and less frequent.&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
March 21st, 1863.&#xD;
SIR:-I arrived in New Orleans on Saturday, ac-&#xD;
companied by my Idiotic Boy, and had scarcely regis-&#xD;
tered my name at the St. Charles, when I was imme-&#xD;
diately surrounded by a great crowd of admiring&#xD;
friends, who thanked me for .my able defense of the&#xD;
Confederacy, and for my brilliant assaults upon the&#xD;
United States. I replied, that the Confederacy alone&#xD;
was worthy of our devotions, and that I received their&#xD;
kind remarks, not as a compliment to me, but to the&#xD;
Confederacy I represented ; and they admitted that&#xD;
such was the fact. I had long believed that I was a&#xD;

descendant of German ancestors, and in order to settle&#xD;
the question definitely, I measured heads with a Dutch-&#xD;
man, and as our heads were exactly of the same size, I&#xD;
considered my Gothic descent fully established.&#xD;
But the principal object of my visit to the city was&#xD;
to accept the- invitation of a Noble Woman-a widow,&#xD;
whose husband has lost his life in the cause of the Con-&#xD;
federacy. This lady, charmed both by my patriotism&#xD;
and my literary abilities, had begged that I would visit&#xD;
her, in company with my Idiotic Boy, and promised to&#xD;
give me a grand dinner and festival if I should accept;&#xD;
and I will now give you a full account of&#xD;
The Great fMaepherson Festival.&#xD;
I found, on entering the house, that the most elabo-&#xD;
rate preparations had been made for my reception, and&#xD;
neither time, car-tickets, nor labor had  spared to&#xD;
make the occasion worthy of the great purpo&#xD;
A mammoth hoop-skirt had been manufactured ex&#xD;
pressly for the banquet, so large that it filled the whole-&#xD;
room. This was spread over the table and surmounted&#xD;
by a Confederate flag a hundred and sixty feet long,&#xD;
the whole forming a beautiful and spacious canopy.&#xD;
The Noble Woman and her daughters had a Confed-&#xD;
erate flag in each breadth of skirt, while a miniature&#xD;
flag-staff had been fixed into the back of their h ads,&#xD;
from which gracefully streamed the emblem of the new&#xD;
nation, and saucy rebel rosettes covered their craniums,&#xD;
beautifully mingling and contrasting the Confederate&#xD;
colors with the darkness of their shining raven locks.&#xD;
The concave of the spacious canopy was decorated&#xD;
&#xD;
MACPHERSON s RECEPTION.          47&#xD;
&#xD;
with appropriate mottoes and inscriptions, painted in&#xD;
beautiful red ink, which would make a column of the&#xD;

to-wit :&#xD;
"Oh, welcome, great Macpherson!&#xD;
Our hearts no more are light ;&#xD;
We breathe a bitter curse on&#xD;
our Yankee foes to-night."&#xD;

As I entered the house, followed by my IdioticBoy,&#xD;
the Noble Woman advanced, and bowing in a stately&#xD;
and inviting manner, said : " Welcome, great Confeder-&#xD;
ate !-Literary Light of Madisonville and New Orleans !&#xD;
-you who have defended us when our rights were in&#xD;
peril, and stood up to the scratch when Lovell sold the&#xD;
city to Farragut !-we wish to pay a tribute to your&#xD;
great abilities, which is only equalled by your devotion&#xD;
to the Confederacy." To which I replied, that I did&#xD;
not regard this as a compliment to me personally, but&#xD;
to the Confederacy I represented. A nigger fiddler,&#xD;
who had been hired for the performance, now struck&#xD;
up Beauregard'$ ifarch, and we all danced a jig around&#xD;
the table.&#xD;
A retired and secluded residence had been selected,&#xD;
and the door was locked, double-bolted, and chained,&#xD;
while the windows were barricaded with empty barrels&#xD;
and cotton bales, to hide the light and prevent the&#xD;

THE NOBLE WOMAN'S ADDRESS.        49&#xD;

noise being heard outside.  "These precautions are&#xD;
necessary," said the Noble Woman, "because the peo-&#xD;
ple of New Orleans live in a condition of abject bond-&#xD;
age. We are not permitted to arm ourselves against&#xD;
the United States, nor to keep heavy ordnance in our&#xD;
houses preparatory to a Confederate insurrection, nor&#xD;
can we have Confederate processions unless we attend&#xD;
funerals, nor boldly hurrah for Jeff. Davis."&#xD;
"Unhappy people !" I exclaimed, my heart wrung&#xD;
with the deepest pity; "you remind me of Prometheus,&#xD;
the son of Iapetus, and the instructor of mortals, who&#xD;
is said to have surpassed all men in sagacity. For&#xD;
having brought fire from heaven to earth in a hollow&#xD;
cane, lie was chained to a rock with an eagle to prey&#xD;
upon his liver. Even so, enslaved ones, are you bound&#xD;
to an unbappy destiny, with bands of iron and hooks&#xD;
of steel, and the American eagle is gnawing out your&#xD;
vitals. But let not your hearts be filled with despair,&#xD;
for in thirty thousand years Hercules, the son of Jupiter,&#xD;
hastened to his relief, snapped asunder his bonds, and&#xD;
he, Prometheus still, arose clothed with all the dignity&#xD;
of Southern independence. And as promptly as 11er-&#xD;
cules hastened to the relief of Prometheus, shall Stone-&#xD;
wall Jackson come to snap the Yankee bonds which&#xD;
chain this enslaved people to an unhappy destiny, and&#xD;
you shall arise and shine in the light of the Confed-&#xD;
eracy! He may be expected Anno Domini 31,863, if&#xD;
nothing happens, meantime, to prevent. Were it not&#xD;
for the scarcity of provisions existing at Madisonville,&#xD;
I would invite the enslaved populace to visit that classi-&#xD;
cal town, and extend to all the freedom of the city in&#xD;
a box. But at present that is impracticable."&#xD;
&#xD;
A great many guests had been invited, male and&#xD;
female, and all of them first-class Confederates, and&#xD;
neutral citizens and foreign subjects. No small-fry were&#xD;
present, I assure you.&#xD;
I was introduced to each one, and they all compli-&#xD;
nented me until I blushed; but I told them I did not&#xD;
consider it a compliment to me personally, but to the&#xD;
Confederacy which I represented.&#xD;
At last the time came for dinner, and we formed a&#xD;
procession in the parlor and marched in under the&#xD;
magnificent canopy. _ As I entered the room, the nigger&#xD;
struck up, "Hail to the Chief!" when the whole assern-&#xD;
bly gave three cheers for Macpherson and Jeff. Davis.&#xD;
I replied: "I thank you for these manifestations of your&#xD;
kindness, but I do not consider it a compliment to me&#xD;
personally, but to the Confederacy which I represent."&#xD;
Whereupon we all sat down.&#xD;
Two niggers then entered the room with a United&#xD;
States flag in a miniature coffin. It was taken out and&#xD;
spread under the table, and we all tramped on it. Then&#xD;
the nigger played the ]Mansfield lovell Quikctep up&#xD;
the Jackson Railroad, when the Noble Woman'said :&#xD;
"Ladies and gentlemen--we have assembled this night&#xD;
to honor the great light of Confederate literature, Lames&#xD;
B. Macpherson. [Deafening sensation.] I have erected&#xD;
this hoopskirt canopy as an appropriate emblem of the&#xD;
courage, valor, and daring deeds of the Confederates&#xD;
who still reside in New Orleans. For, to the disgrace&#xD;
of the United States be it said, such is the uninterrupted&#xD;
and infamous tyranny under which we groan, that the&#xD;
brave sons of the Confederacy who now inhabit this&#xD;
unhappy city, and even French subjects and British&#xD;

THE REGULAR TOASTS.             51&#xD;

sailors, are compelled to seek protection and safety&#xD;
amid the skirts of our beautiful women ; and here alone&#xD;
it is, in secluded places, with double-bolted doors and&#xD;
barricaded windows, with hushed voices and throbbing&#xD;
hearts, stimulated by champagne and nigger-fiddling,&#xD;
and overshadowed and concealed by a mammoth skirt,&#xD;
that we are permitted to trample upon the flag of the&#xD;
United States, that detestable emblem of despotism,&#xD;
whose stripes are painted with innocent Confederate&#xD;
blood, and whose stars are more malignant than Sirius !"&#xD;
As the Noble Woman uttered the closing sentence of&#xD;
her eloquent invective, an electric shock of patriotic&#xD;
rage ran around the table, similar to that which one&#xD;
would experience holding on to a galvanic battery or&#xD;
grabbing the electric eel, and rising to our feet we swore&#xD;
eternal and undying devotion to the Confederacy. The&#xD;
Noble Woman then said that as I had not had any thing&#xD;
to eat for several days, I had better proceed uninter-&#xD;
ruptedly with my dinner, and speak afterward. To&#xD;
which I replied that I did not regard it as a compli-&#xD;
nent to me personally, but to the Confederacy which I&#xD;
represented. Having eaten, the cloth was removed, and&#xD;
then it was that the fun commenced. The first regular&#xD;
toast was given by the Noble Woman. It was:&#xD;
" MACPIRsON."&#xD;
The whole assembly arose, and I was drunk standing,&#xD;
when the audience called out: "Speech!"  To which&#xD;
I replied : "I thank you, enslaved citizens of New Or-&#xD;
leans, lovely women with shining locks, and eyes radian\&#xD;
with beauty, countenances rivalling those which come&#xD;
to us in our dreams of fairy-land-brave and stalwart&#xD;
men, devoted to the Confederacy, but prudently wait-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing for the coming of Stonewall Jackson before you&#xD;
risk your lives in the glorious cause--French subjects&#xD;
and English mariners, justly abusive towards the United&#xD;
States, and enjoying its protection--I thank you all for&#xD;
this spontaneous and undeserved manifestation of your&#xD;
good-will, but I do not regard it as a compliment to&#xD;
me personally, but to the Confedegacy I represent."&#xD;
The second regular toast was then announced:&#xD;
"DEATH TO THE YANKEES.,&#xD;
Drunk standing, and music by the nigger.&#xD;
Third regular toast: "CONFUSION TO FARRAGUT."&#xD;
At the mention of this name the whole assembly&#xD;
turned pale, except the nigger, who instantly struck up&#xD;
the Bar Hollins Polca. Unable to restrain my rage,&#xD;
I emptied two bottles without stopping.&#xD;
Fourth regular toast: "JEFF. DAvIS AND THE SOUTH-&#xD;
ERN CONFEDERACY-may they float over the North&#xD;
American continent, so long as a loyal Confederate is&#xD;
hunting for the last ditch."&#xD;
Air: Braqg's Xfrfreesboro' Lament.&#xD;
Pifth regular toast: " THE PRESs OF NEW ORLEANS."&#xD;
Response by my Idiotic Boy, James Buchanan Mac-&#xD;
pherson, Jr., whose noble and patriotic address was re-&#xD;
ceived with shouts of applause; and the moment my&#xD;
Idiotic Boy sat down, he was surrounded by the great-&#xD;
est secessionist, of the . city, and by foreign subjects,&#xD;
who shook him by the hand, and told him he talked&#xD;
much like their greatest sages, that he ought no longer.&#xD;
to be called an idiot.&#xD;
But a chap who hadn'tsaid much previously, but had&#xD;
sat reading the newspapers, approached me and said:&#xD;
"Mr. Macpherson-for your genius and patriotism I&#xD;

&#xD;
have the greatest respect ; but as for your boy, he is a&#xD;
humbug. The speech which he palmed off on the&#xD;
audience is not original, but was stolen bodily from the&#xD;
Picayune's editorials of the 17th and 19th inst., with&#xD;
a few alterations for the better ; and for my part, I con-&#xD;
sider the young man's idiocy fully established." He&#xD;
then handed me copies of the papers referred to, and,&#xD;
upon exmnn        ine, I found that my poor boy had&#xD;
copied his speech, word for word, from them, with some&#xD;
trifling alterations, and I ordered him to leave the&#xD;
house. "The name of Miacpherson," I said, "is the&#xD;
synonym of honor, and the undying antagonist of pla-&#xD;
giarism, and I do this to show you that the man whom&#xD;
you this night feed, will sacrifice paternal endearment&#xD;
to the principles of integrity."&#xD;
Volunteer toasts were now called for, and arising&#xD;
with my most fascinating bow, I proposed, "THE&#xD;
LADIES."  To which the Noble Woman responded:&#xD;
"The ladies of this City, that is, them that deserves to&#xD;
be called ladies, is true to the Confederacy ; for the&#xD;
moment that a female is decently civil to a Yankee, she&#xD;
should, and in my estimation does, forfeit the name of&#xD;
lady. I hope the time will come when, like the royal&#xD;
Saxons, from whom we have descended, we may drink&#xD;
champagne from the skulls of our enemies; and when&#xD;
the freedom of speech and of the press shallbe restored,&#xD;
so that those who whisper Union may be hung to a&#xD;
lamp-post."&#xD;
As the Noble Woman uttered these sublime and&#xD;
patriotic sentiments, I was animated with overpowering&#xD;
admiration, and springing to my feet, I cried: 'o&#xD;
Hebe ! step-daughter of cloud-compelling Jove, and&#xD;
&#xD;
spouse of serpent-strangling Hercules, now indeed do I&#xD;
believe that Jupiter dismissed thee from the skies, and&#xD;
sent thee to New Orleans! Such elevated sentiments&#xD;
as the beautiful being before me has expressed, could&#xD;
not have emanated from lips wholly mortal, and verily&#xD;
do I believe that the sweet orator who just took her&#xD;
seat is the Hebe of the South, crowned with immortal&#xD;
youth!"&#xD;
Champagne now flowed down the table in torrents,&#xD;
and the scene became one of unalloyed enjoyment.&#xD;
Youth, beauty, genius, there mingled together in songs&#xD;
of sweet accord to the Confederacy, until one by one&#xD;
the guests disappeared, leaving me alone beneath the&#xD;
spacious canopy, with an unfinished bottle before me.&#xD;
I tried to think of a subject for my next letter, but all&#xD;
was dim, uncertain, and confused. As clouds driven by&#xD;
the winds chase each other fitfully across the pale&#xD;
moon's face, even so flitted the thoughts and visions of&#xD;
the undersigned; and as the hollow sea at last engulfs&#xD;
the wrecked mariners struggling vainly for life, even so&#xD;
were the thoughts of Macpherson, vainly struggling&#xD;
for shape, form, and consistency, lost in the wide ocean&#xD;
of unconsciousness.&#xD;
And in conclusion, let me warn young men never to&#xD;
drink any thing intoxicating ; for now it was that the&#xD;
name of Macpherson was first brought into disgrace.&#xD;
I fell under the table in a condition of drunken insen-&#xD;
sibility, from which I was partially aroused the next&#xD;
morning by a scream from the Noble Woman and her&#xD;
daughters.&#xD;
They, in fact, entered the dining-room the next&#xD;
morning after the great festival, and there discovered&#xD;

about my person, as I had mistaken it for a Confederate&#xD;
blanket. Incensed at an insult so gross, the Noble&#xD;
Woman and her daughter without giving me time to&#xD;
arouse and explain, fell upon me with broomsticks and&#xD;
pokers, driving me into the street. I was still too&#xD;
drunk to real ize what had happened, and actually&#xD;

the folds of that detested flag, exciting the admiration&#xD;
of all Yankees, the indignation of Confederates, the&#xD;
grin of darkies, and the loud yells of a procession of&#xD;

CUSS.-MAC PHERSON CAPTURED BY DURYEA'S ZOUAVES.--&#xD;
INTERVIEW WITH THE "SOUTHERN SOURCE" ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-It is well known that "thechivalry" were accustomed, be-&#xD;
fore the war, to claim for themselves superiority of blood, culture,&#xD;
and refinement.--The reader will need no instruction to recognize&#xD;
in the "Unhappy Cuss," a representative of that class of Northerners&#xD;
who used to come to the South, and change their principles with the&#xD;
climate ; and who were prepared to change them as often as their&#xD;
pecuniary interests required.-Contraband trade across Lake Pont-&#xD;
chartrain was carried on to a considerable extent, and at great risk;&#xD;
the cargoes frequently falling into the hands of the military. But&#xD;
when the rascals succeeded in eluding the military and getting their&#xD;
cargoes into the market, they realized rich returns.--About the&#xD;
time this letter was written, Pontchatoula, a village in Eastern&#xD;
Louisiana, was captured by an expedition under Colonel Clark, con-&#xD;
sisting of the Sixth Michigan regiment and the Second Duryea's&#xD;
Zouaves (165th New York).--" News through Southern Sources,"&#xD;
was the title under which the secession press of New Orleans was ac-&#xD;
customed to publish the mild sensation reports of rebel victories&#xD;
that were sent from Jackson and Mobile, to comfort the faithful seces-&#xD;
sionists of the Crescent City. These reports were frequently without&#xD;
the slightest foundation in truth, and the "Southern Source" became&#xD;
the synonym of unblushing mendacity.&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
March 28th, 18G3.&#xD;
Sm :-It was a cloudless and lovely afternoon, and a&#xD;

of my Hospitable Abode. half asleep. N y mind wandered&#xD;
back to Plato, the greatest philosopher of the Greeks, and&#xD;

56          THE MACPHERSON LETI ERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
I therefore determined to set up as a Confederate Philos-&#xD;
opher. It was not long before an opportunity of enter-&#xD;
ing upon this new and honorable career presented itself;&#xD;
for my Idiotic Boy approached and asked me what a&#xD;
Yankee is. I replied: "An abolitionist."&#xD;
"What is an abolitionist ?" inquired the imbecile&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
"A Ijessian," I answered.&#xD;
"What is a Hessian ?" persisted the youth.&#xD;
"Sweet Idiot !" I said, "the human family is divided&#xD;
into two great classes-Scutherners and Yankees. The&#xD;
Southerners are a superior race, and inevitable gentle-&#xD;
men. On the other hand, all who are not born inside&#xD;
the Confederate lines are Yankees, Abolitionists, and&#xD;
Hessians, which, in the Confederate lexicon, are synony-&#xD;
mous terms.   The Yankees are .an inferior race by&#xD;
birth, and are forever unfit to associate on terms of&#xD;
social equality with Southerners. My advice to all&#xD;
future generations is, Be born in the Confederacy.&#xD;
Otherwise, they will lack that chivalric and indescri-&#xD;
bable grace which belongs to every white man born in&#xD;
the Confederacy-that charm which clings to your re-&#xD;
vered father, and which,, thank heaven, I can visibly&#xD;
trace in thee, my poor, Idiotic Boy."&#xD;
Actvent-of the Unhappy cuss.&#xD;
The Idiot wept for joy, and clasping him to my bosom&#xD;
in a glow of paternal pride and fondness, we mingled&#xD;
our Confederate tears together, when the touching and&#xD;
beautiful scene was interrupted by the approaching&#xD;
footsteps of a stranger, whose grief-stricken countenance&#xD;
unmistakably indicated that he was the Unhappy Cuss.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Who art thou? whence comest, and whither goest ?"&#xD;
I inquired.&#xD;
"I am," he answered "a victim of the greatest mis-&#xD;
fortune that can fall to the lot of articulate-speaking&#xD;
men!"&#xD;
"Alas! wretched one," I answered, "make known&#xD;
the cause of this calamity, and I pledge my assistance."&#xD;
"Thanks, generous and sublime Macpherson !" quoth&#xD;
the stranger, "great and admired Confederate philoso-&#xD;
pher, for thy proffered help ; but, alas ! my malady is&#xD;
beyond mortal aid !"&#xD;
" Unhappy Cuss !" I exclaimed, in a tone of meek&#xD;
pity; "Despair is the twin-brother of Death, and the&#xD;
system of philosophy I am about to bring to light, em-&#xD;
braces this great principle, that when a man won't&#xD;
stand by himself, no one is longer obligated to stand by&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Wisest of all Confederates !" responded the Un-&#xD;
happy Cuss, "greatest of living teachers! thy maxims&#xD;
of philosophy may place thy name on record as the&#xD;
Confederate Plato, but they cannot heal a bleeding&#xD;
spirit, nor bind up a wounded heart. My malady is of&#xD;
the blood; I inherited it at birth; I inhaled it with&#xD;
the air I breathed, and no medicine in the world can&#xD;
do me good."&#xD;
"Explain," I said, "this leprous distilment which&#xD;
hath blighted thy young hopes.   Speak, Unhappy&#xD;
Cuss !"&#xD;
"I will unfold to thee the great secret of my life,"&#xD;
quoth he ; "but let me whisper it, for I. have not the&#xD;
courage to pollute the air with these fearful words.&#xD;
He then rolled over three times in the dirt, and placing&#xD;

t&#xD;
.&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
his lips close to my ear, while a look of ghastly despair&#xD;
ilitted across his protruding under-jaw, whispered these&#xD;
fearful words :&#xD;
"Ia kTVc P  nee blood n 'myve insI"&#xD;
As the Unhappy Cuss said the above words, he was&#xD;
seized with spasms, and fell rolling in the dust pt my&#xD;
feet. The Idiotic Boy, who had been a silent but tear-&#xD;
ful spectator of the scene, immediately threw a barrel&#xD;
of ran  water upon his prostrate form, and I rubbed his&#xD;
head with an inlikstand until consciousness once more&#xD;
returned.&#xD;
Is'tory qf the Uit apply (Juss.&#xD;
le then proceeded to unfold his woful tale. "I&#xD;
am," he said, "a native of Connecticut. My ancestors&#xD;
came from England in the Mayflower. They were, in&#xD;
fact, adherents of those detestable Puritans and iRound-&#xD;
heads, who had the insolence to overthrow a King, and&#xD;
cut his head off to boot. I was taught to believe in&#xD;
those bloody wretches for saints, and I also thought&#xD;
that the American Union was the greatest monument&#xD;
of wisdom and liberty ever erected by the hands of&#xD;
mortal men. Every 4th of July I was drunk for a&#xD;
week in honor of George Washington and the United&#xD;
States, and 'Yankee Doodle' was my favorite air.&#xD;
"Fortune at last decreed that I should leave my&#xD;
native land and come to New Orleans. As I stood on&#xD;
the deck of the vessel, and saw the hills of New Eng-&#xD;
land sink in the distant horizon, my eyes were filled&#xD;
with tears, and I vowed that never, while life should&#xD;
last, would I prove recreant in thought or deed, to&#xD;
those great principles of national unity which were so&#xD;
&#xD;
impressed upon my affections. But the moment the&#xD;
warm breezes of the South touched me, I began to real-&#xD;
ize a change. It seemed to me that the Roundheads&#xD;
ought to have been whipped by the Cavaliers, and that&#xD;
virtue triumphed with the restoration of Stuart's cavalry.&#xD;
"The instant I set foot on the levee at New Orleans,&#xD;
the scales fell from my eyes, and I was seized with&#xD;
shame for my Yankee blood. I swore that I hated&#xD;
Yankees, and this patriotic sentiment grew day by day&#xD;
until it goaded me on to deeds of bloodshed and theft.&#xD;
I carefully studied the habits of Southern society, and&#xD;
carried a revolver in each breeches pocket, and a bowie-&#xD;
knife and corn-cutter in my belt. I knocked down a&#xD;
nigger and cursed the Yankees at every public gather-&#xD;
ing; and when secession got under way, I hung three&#xD;
Union men to a lamp-post with my own hands, stole&#xD;
five thousand dollars in cash, and out-confederated the&#xD;
Confederates in niy devotion to Southern independence."&#xD;
As the Unhappy Cuss closed his narrative, a glow of&#xD;
Confederate pride overspread his features, and my class-&#xD;
ical mind arose to the full height of the sublime occa-&#xD;
sion. "Benignant stranger !" I exclaimed, "such is&#xD;
the glory of the Confederacy that its light strikes dumb&#xD;
every Yankee who sets foot upon its sacred soil, and he&#xD;
cannot wag his tongue except in praise of the Confed-&#xD;
eracy. I hail thee, Unhappy Cuss, as a Confederate&#xD;
Yankee. But you will excuse me if I decline to in-&#xD;
troduce you to Mrs. Macpherson; for while I admit&#xD;
the great worth of. a man who is, ready to fight and&#xD;
steal for the Confederacy, I cannot welcome him on&#xD;
terms of social quality, if he has Yankee blood in his&#xD;
veins."&#xD;

60          THE MACPHERsON LETTERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Macpherson now entered the house and turned&#xD;
up her nose at the Yankee Cuss, and remarked that the&#xD;
person could sit down at the second table.&#xD;
The next day was Jeff. Davis's fast and humiliation,&#xD;
and the Cuss and I went to church. The parson&#xD;
preached from the words: "Hold fast." It was very&#xD;
convenient, for we had nothing in the house to eat, and&#xD;
I could starve the guest without a violation of the laws&#xD;
of hospitality. We both got drunk, however, as a Con-&#xD;
federate humiliation, and the Cuss opened to me a&#xD;
great plan of speculation.&#xD;
"I have," he said, "a scheme of wealth, which will&#xD;
make us both richer than Judah P. Benjamin. Phi-&#xD;
losophy is good in its way, but let me tell you, Mac-&#xD;
pherson, that philosophy don't pay. Hast thou Con-&#xD;
federate treasury notes ?"&#xD;
"I have only $95,000 by me at present," I replied.&#xD;
"That is just the amount I want," answered the&#xD;
Cuss. "I have run the blockade with a satchel of&#xD;
quinine and salt, which cost me $150 in New Orleans,&#xD;
and which I have already disposed of for $150,000. I&#xD;
want $95,000 more, which will enable me to buy a&#xD;
schooner and load her with cotton, and with this I will&#xD;
run the blockade and sell it in New Orleans, and will&#xD;
divide the profits, which will be perfectly enormous."&#xD;
" Give me thine honest hand !" I cried aloud.&#xD;
"Give me thy treasury notes I" responded the Un-&#xD;
happy Cuss.&#xD;
I gave him all the money I had in the world, and we&#xD;
immediately started for Pontehatoula. We hid in a&#xD;
swamp, and waded in the water above our knees for&#xD;
twenty-four hours, in order to escape observation, until&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
. we found a man who was ready to. deal with us, and it&#xD;
was not long before a schooner was filled with cotton&#xD;
ready for shipment. I noticed that the Cuss made the&#xD;
purchase entirely in his own name, and did not recog-&#xD;
nize me at all, except to make me run of errands.&#xD;
When I required an explanation of this, he replied in&#xD;
the following noble and patriotic words:&#xD;
"You, Macpherson," he said, "are too great a nian&#xD;
to mix yourself up with the affairs of material wealth.&#xD;
That occupation belongs wholly to the Yankee mind.&#xD;
You, who are a great philosopher, and in whose veins&#xD;
courses only Confederate blood, should not bend the&#xD;
gigantic intellectual energies of your mammoth brain to&#xD;
any such grovelling object. No, no!--leave that to me,&#xD;
and I'll fix the thing for you."&#xD;
As he was paying this just tribute to my intellectual&#xD;
worth, the earth suddenly trembled beneath our feet,&#xD;
as if suffering in the throes of mortal agony ; while a&#xD;
howl of terror and frenzied panic rolled through the&#xD;
swamp in which we were situated. A whizzing noise&#xD;
penetrated the branches of the trees, and pale with&#xD;
abject fear, we saw the Gorillas dashing wildly through&#xD;
the woods in confusion, crying out in tones like those&#xD;
of Stentor, the Grecian warrior whose voice was, louder&#xD;
than the combined voice of fifty men:&#xD;
"The Yanks ! the Yanks are upon us !"&#xD;
On they flew, like the winds, while the Unhappy&#xD;
Cuss and myself, were transfixed to the earth, with&#xD;
amazement and fright. Soon the woods around us&#xD;
flashed with the fire of musketry, and the highivay&#xD;
swarmed with the red-breeches, which, in my terror, I&#xD;
believed to be devils, like those in the opera, who carry&#xD;

off Don Giovanni, as he is taking a drink of champagne.&#xD;
The next thing in the strange chapter of my adven-&#xD;
tures, I was surrounded by a squad of the red-breeches,&#xD;
with fierce looks and flashing bayonets, who demanded&#xD;
an immediate and unconditional surrender to Duryea's&#xD;
Zouaves. I replied that the proud chivalric blood of&#xD;
Macpherson, was at any time prepared to be shed for&#xD;
the Confederacy, but that while I had a leg to stand on,&#xD;
or an arm to smite with, I would never surrender to a&#xD;
Yankee.&#xD;
i.faepherson a captive.&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks !" replied the Zouave, rapping me on&#xD;
the head with the butt of his musket. My hands were&#xD;
then tied behind me and I was carried to the command-&#xD;
ing officer, a prisoner of war. But let it be known to&#xD;
all men forever, that I did not make any formal sur-&#xD;
render.&#xD;
I then looked around me to learn the destiny of the&#xD;
Unhappy Cuss, and expected to see him hanging to a&#xD;
limb. I knew that the Yankees prosecute this war on&#xD;
a plan of such bloody and barbarous ferocity, that&#xD;
neither of us had the slightest chance of life. Imagine&#xD;
my amazement, therefore, when I saw the Unhappy&#xD;
Cuss seated on a log, side by side with a Yankee officer,&#xD;
taking a drink, and conversing in the most friendly&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you here," I heard him say to the&#xD;
vile Yankee. "I have a load of cotton here ready to&#xD;
be shipped to New Orleans, and I have been waiting&#xD;
my opportunity for several weeks to slip off with it, and&#xD;
now I shall be able to do so. I hail you as a deliverer&#xD;
&#xD;
from the cruel oppressions of the traitors ; there is not&#xD;
an impulse in my heart which is 1iot true to the flag of&#xD;
the Union. Let's take a drink !"&#xD;
"Liar ! Base dog !" I exclaimed, "the cotton is mine,&#xD;
and you are a Confederate according to your own con-&#xD;
fessions."&#xD;
"Who is that ?" asked the Yankee officer, pointing&#xD;
to me.&#xD;
c A crazy man whom I hired by the day to watch&#xD;
my cotton," replied the Cuss, "but I discharged him&#xD;
for evident insanity."&#xD;
Reader ! are you human? Has your compassion&#xD;
been eviscerated? Think of such an insult to me, the&#xD;
great light of Confederate literature, and the Plato of&#xD;
Madisonville, and weep with pity for the depravity of&#xD;
man. My hands were untied, and I was told to go&#xD;
home, for the Yankee commander said he pitied an in-&#xD;
sane man ; to which the Unhappy Cuss responded that&#xD;
for this reason he pitied the whole Confederacy.&#xD;
"Good by, Macpherson," he said. "I am grateftil&#xD;
for your hospitality, and I admit the inferiority of the&#xD;
Yankee race."&#xD;
"Liar !-swindler !-thief !-traitor !-villain!" I re-&#xD;
plied, and started for home.&#xD;
Interview with the Southern Source.&#xD;
As I was going along, I saw a chap dodge from be-&#xD;
hind a tree in the swamp, and wave his hand to me. I&#xD;
approached, when in a mysterious tone he whispered:&#xD;
"I am a Southern Source!"&#xD;
"What's new, my honest friend ?" I asked him.&#xD;

"Much," he said, at the same time waving a news-&#xD;
paper before my eyes.  I reached out to look at it,&#xD;
when he suddenly slipped off and put the paper in his&#xD;
pocket. "Seven hundred and ninety dollars," said he.&#xD;
"The brokers in New Orleans will give me $800, but&#xD;
I will take $790 here."&#xD;
"I must first know whether the news is worth the&#xD;
money," I answered.&#xD;
"Did ever a Southern Source deceive the publicaV"&#xD;
he inquired. "Is not my name and reputation for&#xD;
veracity a shield against such base imputations? But&#xD;
I will give you one little item to show that the paper&#xD;
is worth it. It contains an account of Jeff. Davis in&#xD;
New York."&#xD;
"Jeff. Davis in New York !" I exclaimed, raising&#xD;
my hands in gratitude; "then is Pontchatoula aveng-&#xD;
ed !"  I borrowed the money, and the Southern Source&#xD;
disappeared, legging it through the woods when last&#xD;
seen.&#xD;
I proceeded to examine the paper, when I discovered&#xD;
that it was of the 29th October, 1858, and contained&#xD;
an account of Jeff. Davis's speech at a democratic&#xD;
meeting in Palace Garden, New York. Let me tell&#xD;
you that the man who sold that paper upon false pre-&#xD;
tenses, is a disgrace to Southern Sources; for the char-&#xD;
acter of these Sources is above reproach or the sus-&#xD;
picion of falsehood ; and whatever you read in a Con-&#xD;
federate newspaper you can safely accept as the unadul-&#xD;
terated gospel of truth.&#xD;
I must draw my letter to a close. I have once more&#xD;
reached my hospitable abode at Madisonville, and, as I&#xD;
write these closing sentences, I look back upon the ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
perience of the past week with a philosophic eye.&#xD;
I have been shamefully swindled by the Unhappy Cuss&#xD;
and the Southern Source, but my faith in the Confed-&#xD;
eracy is not dimmed. The light of victory shall flash&#xD;
upon our banners, and I pledge my word that if the&#xD;
base Yankee foe ever takes possession of Madisonville,&#xD;
he will first walk over the prostrate and mangled body&#xD;
of&#xD;
Yours, philosophically,&#xD;

APOSTROPHE TO THE TCHEFUNCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE GREAT CHARITY FAIR.&#xD;
NoT.-Mr. N. 0. J. Tisdale, formerly President of the New Or-&#xD;
leans City Qas Company, and a well-known registered enemy of the&#xD;
United Staves, who finally left the city and went into the "Confede-&#xD;
racy," held a fair at his residence, professedly for the benefit of the&#xD;
Protestant Orphan Asylum, but really, it was generally believed, for&#xD;
the purpose of raising funds with which to clothe the rebel prisoners&#xD;
then in New Orleans. In the name of charity, tickets were sold to&#xD;
all who would purchase, and many Union men and women purchased,&#xD;
not suspecting the true character of the entertainment. The fair was&#xD;
a full-blooded secession demonstration ; the rebel colors were dis-&#xD;
played, rebel airs were played on the piano, and certain rebel poems,&#xD;
printed secretly, were sold at twenty-five cents apiece. These poems&#xD;
were entitled respectively, "The Battle of the Handkerchiefs," and&#xD;
"The Battle of the Fair."  The authorship is attributed here to Mac-&#xD;
pherson's Idiotic Boy ; but they were really written by a young lady&#xD;
of New Orleans, who has composed several ingenious secession poems,&#xD;
and who sometimes signs herself Emily M. Washington. Mr. rTis.&#xD;
dale was arrested, and his trial, which continued several days, at-&#xD;
tracted great attention in New Orleans, and was the subject of com-&#xD;
ment in the Northern papers. While witnesses were brought by the&#xD;
prosecution who swore positively that "The Bonnie Blue Flag" was&#xD;
performed, and other secession demonstrations made, Mr. Tisdale&#xD;
brought. witnesses in large numbers, who swore that they neither&#xD;
heard that air, nor witnessed any thing indicating sympathy for the&#xD;
rebel cause. The court, in its decision, acquitted Mr. Tisdale, on the&#xD;
ground that these negative witnesses for the defense were present all&#xD;
the evening, and that it was a moral impossibility that they should&#xD;
not have heard the air had it actually been performed.  The ar-&#xD;
rest and punishment of the Idiotic Boy for hurrahing for Jcff. Davis,&#xD;
was intended to exhibit the folly of the light punishment of such of-&#xD;
fenses, which at one time consisted of a small fine. It was currently&#xD;
reported and believed that every fine imposed for such offenses was&#xD;
promptly paid by the secessionists, and a little purse given to the&#xD;
"martyr" as a bounty on impudent treason. It is said that this&#xD;
bounty was sometimes as high as fifty dollars ; so that one who&#xD;
&#xD;
should hurrah for Jeff Davis could do so without expense to himself,&#xD;
and make a handsome little sum out of it besides.  The author&#xD;
cannot close this note without expressing his admiration for the bold&#xD;
and able manner in which the prosecution in the Tisdale case was&#xD;
conducted by the City Attorney, Mr. L. Madison Day.&#xD;
MADIsoNVILE, LA.,&#xD;
April 4th, 1863.&#xD;
SIR: It was midnight, and the pale beams of the&#xD;
heaven-traversing moon shone down upon the pellucid&#xD;
bosom of Lake Pontchartrain, and streamed through&#xD;
the crevices of my Dilapidated, Hospitable Abode, and&#xD;
silence and slumbers prevailed among living men. But&#xD;
I, moved with pity for the wrongs of the Confederacy,&#xD;
and, like much-planning Ulysses, revolving many&#xD;
thoughts in my mind, was no more able to sleep than&#xD;
was Calypso, inconsolable at the departure of her Gre-&#xD;
cian hero. Therefore, I arose from    my lofty couch,&#xD;
and in gloomy meditation, walked to .the banks of the&#xD;
Tchefuncta, whose beautiful, muddy water, seemed to&#xD;
be a reflex of my own sombre and philosophic thoughts.&#xD;
Seating myself upon the all-nourishing earth, I thus&#xD;
poured out my soul to the noble river :&#xD;
"0 Tchefuncta'! thou, whose beautiful mud is as&#xD;
clear as the hopes of the Confederacy, listen to the&#xD;
moans of thy philosophic son!     Tell me, ye lonely&#xD;
depths of dirt ! whether in a time of national calamity,&#xD;
with the stars and stripes floating over the blood-stained&#xD;
heights of Pontehatoula, a philosophic mind may devote&#xD;
itself to the pursuit of occult truth, or whether it be not&#xD;
the duty of every Confederate, even though like me, he&#xD;
be gifted with a mammoth brain, to bare his arm in the&#xD;
cause of his country ? I pause for a reply."&#xD;

Ii&#xD;

f' E&#xD;
&#xD;
noble river, I fell partially asleep, when I heard a mys-&#xD;
terious voice, crying from the depths:&#xD;
"Bare the arm! bare the arm!"&#xD;
"I will !" I responded; "for in that voice I recog-&#xD;
nize a Confederate sign and miracle, surpassing in won-&#xD;
der the dreams of the Picayune; and I shall forthwith&#xD;
proceed with my long-cherished design of forming a&#xD;
Congo Body Guard."&#xD;
I then went to sleep, when I was suddenly aroused&#xD;
by a kick in the back, which sent me headforemost into&#xD;
the muddy depths of the sluggish Tchefuncta.&#xD;
"Spirit!" I exclaimed, "who but recently spake to&#xD;
me from these waters, unless, indeed, my eyes were&#xD;
bent on vacancy, and I with incorporeal air did hold&#xD;
discourse, receive thy son, and assist him to reach dry&#xD;
land !" I then waded back, comparing myself to&#xD;
Venus, who rose from the sea, while the moist-blowing&#xD;
west wind wafted her in soft foam along the waves,&#xD;
and the gold-illeted Seasons received her on the shores&#xD;
of Cyprus, clothed her in immortal garments, placed a&#xD;
golden wreath upon her head, and led her to the assem-&#xD;
bly of the gods. And as I wallowed in the mud of the&#xD;
noble river, I exclaimed: "I am the Venus of Madi-&#xD;
son ville, arising from the Tchefuncta, and waiting for&#xD;
immortal honors !"&#xD;
I then stepped upon the bank, when a wild mule&#xD;
kicked at me and brayed, and I found that I had mis-&#xD;
taken the mule's familiar voice for a Confederate mir-&#xD;
acle, and that the heels of the said animal had given&#xD;
me midnight baptism. Nevertheless, I accepted the&#xD;
advent of the mule as a celestial sign, and immediately&#xD;
mounting the same, I started for New Orleans.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Solitary Horseman.&#xD;
I had proceeded seventy-five rods on my journey,&#xD;
when my attention was attracted by the clatter of a&#xD;
horse's hoofs, and soon the Solitary Horseman, whose&#xD;
appearance and history have been fully described by&#xD;
the late Mr. James, burst upon my vision. Immedi-&#xD;
ately I apostrophized him as the Confederacy, for the&#xD;
seal of the New Nation is to be a Cavalier, and I found&#xD;
the Solitary Horseman to be the bean ideal of a Confed-&#xD;
erate gentleman.&#xD;
No sooner had I spoken, than he dismounted his foam-&#xD;
ing steed, and embracing my knees, exclaimed:&#xD;
"At last I behold thee, Confederate Plato, Venus of&#xD;
Madisonville, and chiefest light of Confederate letters!&#xD;
I am the delegate of three thousand citizens of New Or-&#xD;
leans, who have charged me to express to you the pro-&#xD;
found respect which they entertain for your august&#xD;
person, and invite you to attend a Grand Charity Fair&#xD;
to-morrow evening, at the residence of a gentleman&#xD;
whose heart is as true to the Confederacy as is Jacob&#xD;
Parker's to his safe. Charity," continued the Cavalier,&#xD;
"like the dews of heaven, falls upon the lowly and the&#xD;
poor ; and when I think of th hard lot of the unhappy&#xD;
orphan, cast upon the heartle world without a guiding&#xD;
and protecting hand, my heart is torn with a thousand&#xD;
pangs of agony, and the hot blood goes rushing wildly&#xD;
through my swollen veins.   0 Macpherson ! let us&#xD;
weep for the unhappy lot of the poor and debased&#xD;
orphan !"&#xD;
The Solitary Horseman burst out in a fit of inconso-&#xD;
lable tears as he uttered this sublimnely charitable sen-&#xD;

mine, when the Wild Mule gave an awful kick which&#xD;
frustrated my affectionate design. The brave Cavalier&#xD;
then mounted and we dashed furiously along the high-&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Is this Fair political ?" I asked.&#xD;
"It is charitable, charitable, Macpherson,"ihe replied&#xD;
-   a Fair in behalf of the Protestant Uniform Asy-&#xD;
lum, an institution for the manufacture of graybacks,&#xD;
where the weary Confederate may find rest, and the&#xD;
naked Confederate may become clothed."&#xD;
" Who hath contril)uted thereunto ?" I inquired.&#xD;
Much to my astonishment, the tender-hearted Cava-&#xD;
lier burst out in a fit of uncontrollable laughter, which&#xD;
arose far above the clatter of his horse's hoofs. "That's&#xD;
the joke !" he shouted, as his beautiful laugh rolled&#xD;
through time lonely swamp ; "that's the joke !-the&#xD;
Yankees have contributed ! Tickets were sold for ten&#xD;
cents apiece, and in the blessed name of Charity, sweet&#xD;
mother of the helpless, we sold many tickets to Union&#xD;
men and women, and Yankee officers !"&#xD;
Reining in my Wild Mule, I cried aloud : " Then&#xD;
indeed do I wash my hands of this matter ; for I will&#xD;
take no part in a Fair, even for Charity, if base Yankee&#xD;
gold is mingled with the spotless currency of the Con-&#xD;
fed eracy !'&#xD;
The Cavalier whistled, as he drew from his pocket a&#xD;
Richmond Examiner, and read the price of gold, $5.25,&#xD;
and an advance of two hundred per cent. in a week.&#xD;
" Be not too hasty, Confederate Plato," he observed.&#xD;
" You are aware that the end justifies the means; and&#xD;
in the present instance the great end to be achieved is&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
to clothe the Confederacy. To rob a Yankee or to&#xD;
deceive a Yankee is the highest virtue of the Confed-&#xD;
eracy. And since the grinding tyranny of the United&#xD;
States will not permit us to operate openly, we invoke&#xD;
the broad mantle of Charity, which we will cut up and&#xD;
make into Confederate uniforms !"&#xD;
"Give me thine honest hand, sweet messenger of be-&#xD;
nievolence !" I exclaimed.  " Charity, indeed, shall&#xD;
cover a multitude of sins ; and the mantle of Charity&#xD;
is gray in the Confederacy."&#xD;
It was night before we reached the city, and as the&#xD;
mud of the Tehefuncta still adhered conspicuously to&#xD;
my person, I determined to go to the St. Charles and&#xD;
take a bath before attending the Fair. But as we were&#xD;
riding towards that massive structure, the Solitary&#xD;
Horseman suddenly reined in his steed, and pointing&#xD;
to a palatial abode, said : "This is the place-listen !"&#xD;
A confused din of lovely voices, strains of angelic&#xD;
music, and trippings of the light fantastic toe cane to&#xD;
my ears, grateful as the odor. of Louisiana Rum to a&#xD;
thirsty Confederate; for I knew that every lovely&#xD;
voice was a Confederate voice, every strain a Confed-&#xD;
erate strain, and every light fantastic toe a Confeder-&#xD;
ate toe.&#xD;
Jifacpherson's Extraordinary Advent at the Fair.&#xD;
I was about to hasten to the baths, when my Wild&#xD;
Mule kicked with extraordinary violence, liftingme&#xD;
clean from his back, tossing me over the fence and&#xD;
through the open door of the palatial abode, and land-&#xD;
ing me in the hall on my face, with a force which&#xD;
caused the blood to ooze freely from my nostrils, and&#xD;

72           THE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
mingle its crimson hues with the mud of the Tche-&#xD;
functa, which still adhered conspicuously to my person.&#xD;
The hall was crowded with beautiful Confederate&#xD;
girls; and as I arose from my recumbent posture,&#xD;
with my classcial mind slightly confused by the vio-&#xD;
lence of the concussion, I imagined myself in a Vestal&#xD;
temple. I therefore cried aloud: "0 lovely Confeder-&#xD;
ate Vestals, who attend the sacred flame, fear not me,&#xD;
for I am the Venus of Madisonville; and my only re-&#xD;
gret is that, placing her hand upon the head of Jupiter,&#xD;
your goddess swore perpetual celibacy."  The Vestals&#xD;
then joined hands and danced around me, to the en-&#xD;
livening strains of the Pomtohatoula Quickstep, and the&#xD;
Great Host approaching, bade me welcome to the&#xD;
abode of Charity.&#xD;
"Allow me to inquire," I said, "whether you have&#xD;
obtained permission to hold this Fair ?"&#xD;
"I did not deem it necessary," he replied, "for I&#xD;
consulted a gentleman who has held a similar concern&#xD;
at his house, and he assured me that permission was&#xD;
not necessary. I trust the time will soon come when&#xD;
we can worship the Confederacy according to the dic-&#xD;
tates of our own consciences, with none to molest or&#xD;
make us afraid ,and when the ladies can spit in the&#xD;
face of Yankees in the streets with impunity."&#xD;
"Amen !" I responded to this noble and patriotic&#xD;
prayer.&#xD;
The Great Host lovingly took my arm, and, conduct-&#xD;
ing me to an obscure corner, pointed in a mysterious&#xD;
manner to a pile of publications. " To you," he said,&#xD;
"the great light of Confederate letters, I need not ex-&#xD;
patiate upon the beauties and blessings of literature ; 1&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFEDERATE TRACTATES.&#xD;
&#xD;
73&#xD;
&#xD;
need not tell you of the- power of the press, which en-&#xD;
ables us to poison the public mind, and inundate the&#xD;
land with Confederate principles."  He then handed&#xD;
, me two beautiful Confederate tracts, one them entitled&#xD;
" The Battle of the handkerchiefs," and the other&#xD;
" The Battle of the Fair," and informed me that the&#xD;
price was two bits each, which sum I gladly paid as&#xD;
he informed me the proceeds of those two beautiful&#xD;
and patriotic publications would go towards clothing&#xD;
the Confederacy.&#xD;
"Perhaps," he remarked, "you would like to see&#xD;
the author of those great works of genius and patri-&#xD;
otism."&#xD;
"I should rejoice to know him," I relied; "for&#xD;
herein I find the evidences of that peculiar genius and&#xD;
grace wjich belongs, in a greater or less degreeto&#xD;
every thing Confederate."&#xD;
"You shall be gratified," he answered ; and he im-&#xD;
mediately led me face to face with my Idiotic Boy!&#xD;
"There he is !" said the Great Host; "look upon&#xD;
the author of those beautiful productions of the human&#xD;
intellect."&#xD;
My double surprise may be imagined. I supposed&#xD;
the imbecile, youth was quietly sleeping in his mother's&#xD;
arms ; but to find him there, surrounded by a galaxy&#xD;
of youth and beauty, and to learn that he was a full-&#xD;
fledged Confederate author, overpowered me with&#xD;
amazement and gratitude. "Happy father of such a&#xD;
son ! I exclaimed, clasping him to my muddy bosom,&#xD;
"who in early life devotes the energies of his idiotic&#xD;
brain to the true path of rectitude, and contributes the&#xD;
efforts of his intellect to the great and heaven-ordained&#xD;

&#xD;
behests of Charity, by furnishing mental pabulum to&#xD;
the followers of the naked Confederacy !"&#xD;
Just then the Idiot dodged behind me, and pointing&#xD;
to a lady across the room, said: "Shield me, for the&#xD;
love of heaven !"&#xD;
What is the row, sweet Idiot ?" I inquired.&#xD;
"It is my misfortune to know that lady," he replied.&#xD;
"I have eaten at the same table, drank wine from the&#xD;
same bottle, played whist and euchre with the same&#xD;
cards. But she is a Union woman, and it will be a&#xD;
disgrace to recognize her here."&#xD;
"Well said, dear Idiot," I responded. "But show&#xD;
yourself worthy of your revered father and of the Con-&#xD;
federacy you represent."&#xD;
"I will !" he exclaimed, tearing his hair with vehe-&#xD;
nent determination, and then walking coldly by the&#xD;
Yankee woman, without recognizing her. Afterwards&#xD;
he watched his opportunity and winked at her, in order,&#xD;
if possible, to save her good opinion without compro-&#xD;
mising himself.&#xD;
"Sir !" I said with a frown of Confederate displeas-&#xD;
ure upon my features, and addressing myself to the&#xD;
Great Host: "You are a registered enemy of the&#xD;
United States, and I was not prepared for'the affront&#xD;
put upon me by the presence of a Yankee woman."&#xD;
"Gas !" responded the Great Host, his eyes gleam-&#xD;
ing like two burners, "you are over zealous. It is pos-&#xD;
sible that the vile tyranny under which we groan, will&#xD;
summon me to answer for this night's business, and&#xD;
the presence of a few Yankees is a shield against sus-&#xD;
picion."&#xD;
I now proceeded to examine the spacious apartments;&#xD;

and at every step I found something to gladden my&#xD;
Confederate heart. I learned that beautiful maidens&#xD;
of tender years had worked with the mothers of the&#xD;
city, day after .day, and night after night, in manufac-&#xD;
turing miniature Confederate -flags, which they brought&#xD;
here and sold at high prices, the proceeds all going&#xD;
into the Confederate treasury. I saw, also, Confeder-&#xD;
ate doll-babies, Confederate roosters and hens, Confed-&#xD;
erate pigs made of sugar, Confederate dogs, and Con-&#xD;
federate alligators, all manufactured by fair hands in&#xD;
obedience to the dictates of charity. But the princi-&#xD;
pal feature of the evening was a Confederate donkey,&#xD;
gayly caparisoned, on which sat my Idiotic Boy, wav-&#xD;
ing the proud banner of the New.Nation, and winking&#xD;
at the girls.&#xD;
1w Great Confederate Seal.&#xD;
" That Donkey and th 't boy," remarked a bystander,&#xD;
"are the proper and fitting emblems of the Confed-&#xD;
eracy. I see that our Congress is discussing the pro-&#xD;
priety of adopting a Cavalier as the seal of the New&#xD;
Nation; and I for one recommend Macpherson's Idiotie&#xD;
Boy mounted on a Donkey as the most expressive and&#xD;
appropriate Boy and Beast that can be found to repre-&#xD;
sent the Confederacy."&#xD;
It was suggested that I myself, mounted on my&#xD;
Wild Mule, would do better ; but the opinion of the&#xD;
audience was in favor of the Idiot, and so I yielded my&#xD;
claims gracefully, soothing my disappointed, ambition&#xD;
with the gushing stream of paternal pride.&#xD;
During all this time the piano was sending forth its&#xD;
angelic strains, the keys thereof being thumbed by&#xD;

&#xD;
snowy delicate fingers, whose gentle touch upon the&#xD;
temples might soothe a tiger's rage, or thaw the cold&#xD;
heart of a conqueror. The Bonnie Blue Flag was&#xD;
played, as the most popular air ; but whenever that air&#xD;
was struck, I observed that twelve persons immediately&#xD;
left the room and put cotton in their ears. I demand-&#xD;
ed of the Great Host the cause of this extraordinary&#xD;
proceeding, which appeared to me to be an insult to&#xD;
1         the Confederacy.&#xD;
The Great Host applied his forefinger to the side of&#xD;
his nose, giving the end a twist and winking as he re-&#xD;
plied;,&#xD;
"Witnesses !"&#xD;
"What witnesses !' I inquired.&#xD;
" You see, Macpherson," he replied, "that my case&#xD;
may come up in court, and it is possible that some who&#xD;
are here may have the baseness to testify that The&#xD;
Bonnie Blue Flag wAs performed on that piano.&#xD;
In such a case it will become necessary for me to prove.&#xD;
that it was NOT played. So I have arranged to have&#xD;
twelve witnesses be present through the whole perform-&#xD;
ance and not hear it. If the tune was actually played&#xD;
it is morally certain that these twelve persons must&#xD;
have heard it ; and these witnesses live in a Christian&#xD;
community, and are, as you will perceive, p     of&#xD;
the highest respectability. Cotton will do it, Mac-&#xD;
pherson-cotton will do it !"&#xD;
"Cotton is king," I answered; "and your case is&#xD;
sure to succeed. When I was justice of the peace in&#xD;
Madisonville, a case came up precisely like yours.&#xD;
Citizen Jenkins accused my nephew, Peter Macpherson,&#xD;
of stealing a pig, and brought three creditable witnesses,&#xD;
&#xD;
who swore positively that they saw Peter steal him.&#xD;
But Pete brought four men of the highest respectability,&#xD;
over from New Orleans, who swore quite as positively&#xD;
that they did not see him steal the swinish animal; and&#xD;
on this testimony I was, bound to acquit him. Negative&#xD;
testimony is sure to win in courts that take a proper&#xD;
view of events, particularly if the magistrate is an&#xD;
uncle of the accused, as in the case referred to."&#xD;
The night wore away, and our delightful Confederate&#xD;
communion strengthened our weary souls. At a late&#xD;
hour I Wvas called on for a speech, and wishing to ap-&#xD;
pear in my true character, as a Confederate philosopher,&#xD;
I proceeded to deliver an original phrenological dis-&#xD;
course, on one of the most important bumps which the&#xD;
human head contains.&#xD;
Macpherson on memory.&#xD;
"Ladies and gentlemen," I said; "proud children of&#xD;
our great Confederate parent, and you of the rising&#xD;
generation ; as mile-boards are set up on the highway&#xD;
to indicate the direction in which the roads run, so&#xD;
hath nature built bumps on the human cranium, to in-&#xD;
dicate the bent of character, and the destiny of man.&#xD;
"The most important of these bumps indicates the&#xD;
organ of Memory ; and in looking around on this audi-&#xD;
ence I see by a glance at that bump that you are all&#xD;
Confederates. The Confederate bump of Memory is&#xD;
peculiar in this, that it has the gift of remembering&#xD;
every thing to its own credit and interest, with the&#xD;
most wonderful distinctness. Indeed, it remembers&#xD;
more than the facts will justify. At the same time it&#xD;
is wholly incapable of remembering any thing contrary&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6747-00000040"/>&#xD;
If&#xD;
a'&#xD;
II&#xD;
4I&#xD;
&#xD;
to the plans, wishes, principles, and interests of the&#xD;
Confederacy. For instance, it remembers that George.&#xD;
Washington was a Virginian, and a slaveholder ; but&#xD;
*it forgets stubbornly and hopelessly that he was a&#xD;
strong Union man, and freed his slaves on his death-&#xD;
bed. It remembers that gold arose in New York to&#xD;
173, but it forgets that it tumbled down faster than it&#xD;
rose. It remembers that the Mississippi was sunk at&#xD;
Port Hudson, but it forgets that the Hartford and Al-&#xD;
batross went by. It remembers that Beauregard won&#xD;
the battle of Manassas, but it forgets that the Yankees&#xD;
whipped the devil out of us at Fort iDonelson. Such,&#xD;
ladies, gentlemen, c d rising generation, are the char-&#xD;
acteristics of the Confederate bump of Memory-char-&#xD;
acteristics of which I am proud, and which I see per-&#xD;
vade every head in this great charity fair. Were you&#xD;
called on to swear to-morrow before a Yankee court,&#xD;
whether a Coifederate flag was displayed here to-night,&#xD;
could you remember seeing it? No! Were you asked&#xD;
whether the Bonnie Bue Flag was played on that&#xD;
piano, could you remember that you heard it? No !&#xD;
Were you asked whether any disloyal sentiment has&#xD;
been expressed here to-night, could you remember hear-&#xD;
ing it? No !-for you are all loyal to the great princi-&#xD;
ples of the new nation, and may God bless you, and&#xD;
the Confederate bump of Memory forever !"&#xD;
Arrest of the Idiotie Boy.&#xD;
This speech was received with loud applause, and&#xD;
we were about to separate, when a clamor arose in the&#xD;
street. "A Confederate rising !--to arms !-to arms !"&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
78&#xD;
&#xD;
A MARTYR OF FREEDOM.             79&#xD;
I shouted ; ' the day of deliverance has come !"-Stone-&#xD;
wall Jackson has arrived with nineteen hundred thou-&#xD;
sand patriots !" With this exclamation I rushed into&#xD;
the street, the excited assemblage following at my heels,&#xD;
when I found that my Idiotic Boy had been arrested&#xD;
for hurrahing for Jeff. Davis publicly, and basely im-&#xD;
prisoned in a Yankee jail. "Martyr .of freedom !" I&#xD;
cried; "Iam proud that the spirit of the Macphersons&#xD;
has not been crushed, and I resign thee to a glorious&#xD;
death and a crownof martyrdom !"&#xD;
I found, however, that the penalty for the offense&#xD;
was $2.50, and soon a purse of $200 was made up, the&#xD;
fine paid, and the boy released, with the balance jing-&#xD;
ling in his pocket. As he left the court-room he set up&#xD;
another tremendous roar for Jeff. Davis, when he was&#xD;
immediately arrested again, and fined $2.50 more. "I&#xD;
appeal to the Confederates," I said, "to assist my son&#xD;
to get his release from the vile Yankee tyrants." Im-&#xD;
mediately another contribution of $200 was made up,&#xD;
the fine paid, and the boy released, with a clear balance&#xD;
of $395 in his pocket; and with this we immediately&#xD;
returned to Madisonville.&#xD;
I must now conclude my eighth epistle to THE ERA.&#xD;
What is writ is writ. Would it were worthier. The&#xD;
winding up reminds me that I am mortal; and as that&#xD;
is a subject I do not like to reflect upon, I turn my&#xD;
philosophic eye to the unfading glory of the Confeder-&#xD;
acy, and there I behold unending power and immortal&#xD;
honor. The stars shall fade, but the Confederacy shall&#xD;
endure forever.&#xD;

THE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
P. S.-Since writing the above, I have received the&#xD;
following letter from my son Louis T. Wigfall:&#xD;
PORT HUDSON, April 2.&#xD;
"DAD:-Give My love to the Great Hoast, and to the&#xD;
bewtiful ladies which attended the Charity Fare. I&#xD;
have received the uniform they sent Me, and it's the&#xD;
only rag of close I've had sense I sold the nine sutes&#xD;
which was given Me by the ladies as I left New Or-&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE CONFEDERATE ARITHMETIC.&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
April 11th, 1863.&#xD;
Sm:-On Tuesday last I sat on the bottom of an in-&#xD;
verted brass kettle in my door-yard, training up my&#xD;
Idiotic Boy in the way he should go, and rejoicing to&#xD;
find his den ented brain so capable of absorbing the&#xD;
ideas whi h mderlie the Confederacy. "I am," I said&#xD;
to him, "the Confederate Archimedes.  Never, since&#xD;
this great planetary system was called into existence,&#xD;
has there been a nation whose glory and power could&#xD;
compare with the Confederacy which I represent.&#xD;
Wherever the glorious flag of the new nation floats,&#xD;
freedom of speech and of the press prevails to an alarm-&#xD;
ing extent.&#xD;
"The resources of the Confederacy are inexhaustible.&#xD;
Ever since the formation of the Union, the South has&#xD;
supported the North; and therefore it was, that as soon&#xD;
as the South withdrew from the concern, the North&#xD;
was reduced to poverty and famine. Grass now grows&#xD;
in Broadway, and in the Central Park of New York.&#xD;
A reliable gentleman who has just returned from that&#xD;
place, assures me that he pastured his horse in front of&#xD;
the Astor House, during his sojourn in that deserted&#xD;
and ruined city.&#xD;

&#xD;
the Confederate Arithmetic-principles of the greatest&#xD;
simplicity, yet productive of astounding results.&#xD;
" The Confederate Arithmetic has two rules, Multi-&#xD;
plication and Subtraction. Multiplication is only em-&#xD;
ployed in the affairs of the Confederacy, and Subtrac-&#xD;
tion in the affairs of the Federals.&#xD;
The Confederate fultiplication-table.&#xD;
"The Confederate multiplication-table, my Sweet&#xD;
Idiot," I continued, "employs two numbers-0 and 50.&#xD;
0 multiplied by 50 equais 50. 0 represents the basis of&#xD;
Confederate currency, and by multiplying it by 50 you&#xD;
get $50 in cash. Multiply this by 50 again, and you&#xD;
have $2,500; and this once more multiplied by 50,&#xD;
gives you $125,000; and this again multiplied, gives&#xD;
you $6,250,000; and so on, until the Confederate Treas-&#xD;
nry groans beneath its enormous and insupportable&#xD;
burden of cash.&#xD;
"The rule here laid down also applies to military&#xD;
operations. A Colonel sends out a Captain on a scout-&#xD;
ing expedition, and 0 represents the number of Yankee&#xD;
prisoners actually captured. This the Captain multi-&#xD;
plies by 50, and reports to the Colonel that he has&#xD;
bagged 50 Yankees. The Colonel then multiplies by&#xD;
50 in his report to the Brigadier General; the Brigadier&#xD;
General multiplies by 50 in his report to the Division&#xD;
General; the Division General multiplies by 50 in his&#xD;
report to the Commander of the Department; the&#xD;
Commander of the Department multiplies by 50 in his&#xD;
report to the Secretary of War ; the Secretary of War&#xD;
multiplies by 50, and sends it to the Jackson Appeal;&#xD;
the editor of that sheet multiplies by 50 and prints it,&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFEDERATE ARITHMETIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
and the Southern Source then multiplies by 50 and&#xD;
starts for New Orleans, and by the time the report gets&#xD;
to the St. Charles Hotel, we have captured thirty-five&#xD;
trillion sixty-two billion and five hundred million&#xD;
(35,062,500,000,000) Yankee prisoners, as any one will&#xD;
see who will work out the sum according to the princi-&#xD;
ples of the Confederate Arithmetic.&#xD;
"Every thing in the Confederacy is multiplied by 50.&#xD;
But when we speak of the affairs of the United States,&#xD;
we apply the second great rule of the Confederate&#xD;
Arithmetic, which is as follows :&#xD;
Confederate Rule of Subtraction.&#xD;
" Deductfrom every Federal number twice its actual&#xD;
amount.   Thus: a Federal scouting party captures&#xD;
100 Confederates. From this 100 you must deduct&#xD;
200, which leaves a balance of 100 in our favor; and&#xD;
instead of the Yankees getting 100 Confederates the&#xD;
Confederates get 100 Yankees. It was by this rule&#xD;
that Gen. Bragg defeated Rosecrans.&#xD;
"Thus, Sweet Idiot,".I said, "I have explained to&#xD;
you those great fundamental laws of mathematics&#xD;
which underlie the Confederacy; and I am. the Confed-&#xD;
erate Archimedes, he who was equally skilled in as-&#xD;
tronomy, geometry, mechanics, hydrostatics, and optics,&#xD;
in all of which he excelled, and produced many ex-&#xD;
traordinary inventions; but, in my opinion, notwith-&#xD;
standing his miraculous skill as displayed in the defense&#xD;
of Syracuse, he never conceived an idea so grand as the&#xD;
Confederate Arithmetic."&#xD;

MACPHERSON DEDICATES HIMSELF To WAR AND LARCENY.-&#xD;
HE ENCOUNTERS THE HONEST JEW.&#xD;
LOUISIANA LOWLANDS Low,&#xD;
April 25th, 1863.&#xD;
SIR :-For some time rumors of the most painful&#xD;
nature reached my ears, while, in my dilapidated hos-&#xD;
pitable abode at Madisonville, I was preparing my&#xD;
mind to offer my life in the sacred cause of the Con-&#xD;
federacy. I read in THE ERA that Gen. Banks had&#xD;
advanced froni Brashear City with a large force of Hes-&#xD;
sians, and that the blessed sons of the Confederacy had&#xD;
been whipped, their gunboats destroyed, and their&#xD;
transports captured or sunk, while they were running&#xD;
before the vile Yankee foe or falling into the hands of&#xD;
Ibid. But I did not believe it. I swore it could not&#xD;
be true ; for with that sublime faith in the Confederacy&#xD;
which leads our people to receive Confederate currency&#xD;
and to set facts at defiance, I scorned these statements&#xD;
as Yankee inventions and falsehoods. I knew that I&#xD;
was the only contributor for THE ERA who dared to&#xD;
speak the truth, and blow the Confederate trumpet,&#xD;
and so long as the True Delta and the Picayune had&#xD;
not a word to say on the subject, which they hadn't&#xD;
for many days, I possessed my sublime soul in Con-&#xD;
federate patience, and clothed and fortified my serene&#xD;
mind with stoical Confederate disbelief in every word&#xD;
uttered by a Yankee.&#xD;

86           THE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
But on Wednesday last I was aroused from my dream&#xD;
of security and Confederate bliss, when the Picayune,&#xD;
a paper in which I have full faith, broke the long and&#xD;
pleasing silence that had sealed its -lips, and made&#xD;
known to inc that there was at least some foundation&#xD;
for the diabolical reports in THE EnA which had ap-&#xD;
peared from time to time a week or ten days before.&#xD;
Then it was that, resting my teeth upon the leg of a&#xD;
chair, I gave myself up to momentous meditations.&#xD;
I'efore mv mind arose the incredible vision of Confed-&#xD;
erates flying before Yankees, and I cried aloud : " Ig-&#xD;
I)l)lC. debased villain that I am!- why sit I here while&#xD;
Scouniitrvien starve ald run leaving their bones&#xD;
behind them to bleach  )uon the bloody field of car-&#xD;
Image, and while one of the children of my loins lan-&#xD;
uiiVIhes iii a loathsome dungeon in Baronne street ?&#xD;
\ rise. Macpherson ! abandon the seductive paths of&#xD;
ph ilosopllv and poetry, buckle on a C. S. plate, shoulder&#xD;
a double-barrelled shot-gun, and plunge headlong into&#xD;
the deep-flowing tide of Yankee homicide and larceny !"&#xD;
I then arose in my terrible might, while my dilapi-&#xD;
dated hospitable abode trembled to the top of the&#xD;
stove-pipe beneath the massive heel of my new boots,&#xD;
with which I smote the quaking ground ; and I swore&#xD;
by the mud image of Jeff. Davis, which had just been&#xD;
set up by my Idiotic Boy, that I never would wash my&#xD;
face or taste a drop of water until I had exterminated&#xD;
every Yankee, man, woman, and child, in the States of&#xD;
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and the First Con-&#xD;
gressional District of Texas !&#xD;
"Not drink any water, James !" exclaimed my wife,&#xD;
in a tone of astonishment; "what will you drink ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"IRum!" I answered, with a voice like bellowing&#xD;
thunder ; "rum, my love! and rum alone !"&#xD;
Therefore I dedicated myself to the god of war:&#xD;
"0 Mars !" I exclaimed, " the fatherless son of Juno,&#xD;
whose delight was in contest and strife, and who wast&#xD;
a warrior of severe countenance, with a cuirass and an&#xD;
Argive shield upon thine arm! -thee I invoke, and to&#xD;
thee I dedicate my vast and comprehensive intellect,&#xD;
and the death-compassing stroke of my unapproach-&#xD;
able arm !" I then went forth on my mission of de-&#xD;
struction, breathing revenge and blood from my nos-&#xD;
trils at every step.&#xD;
.Te Honest Jew.&#xD;
Just after crossing the Yankee lines, I encountered&#xD;
an individual who informed me that he was an Honest&#xD;
Jew. "Right glad am I to meet you, my noble&#xD;
friend," I said: "for honest men are scarce in these&#xD;
unwholesome days. I trust you are an Israelite in&#xD;
whom there is no guile."&#xD;
"I ish dat," responded the Honest Jew; "and vat I&#xD;
say, dat pe truee"&#xD;
"Then," I answered, "you are a good Confederate ;&#xD;
for Confederates alone are capable of speaking the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
"You vait vun little pit," returned the guileless Is-&#xD;
raelite, "an' I show. you I make seventeen hunder&#xD;
tollar in fifteen minutes !"&#xD;
"fHow ?" I asked.&#xD;
"I shut up Yankee's eye.&#xD;
The Honest Jew then beckoned me to follow him.&#xD;
Approaching the Yankee sentinel, he said:&#xD;

"I habe tree hinder tollar goods back yonder. I&#xD;
take 'em across that bayou I get two tonsan'. Now&#xD;
you must shut your eye vile I goes py, an' I gives you&#xD;
fiftv tollar '"&#xD;
All right," replied the Yankee sentinel, "give me&#xD;
the 8O and Il shuit my eye while you pass."&#xD;
The honest Jew paid the Yankee the sum specified,&#xD;
and the Jew went back after his goods. But I noticed&#xD;
that the sentinel called the corporal of the guard and&#xD;
had some private conversation with him, after which&#xD;
the corporal disappeared.&#xD;
Soon the Jew came up with his goods, and the&#xD;
Yankee sentinel didn't see him at all when he passed ;&#xD;
but he hadn't got fifty yards before the corporal and&#xD;
four men dodged out from behind a tree and arrested&#xD;
him. His goods were seized and confiscated, and he&#xD;
was told that if he ever tried such a dodge again, he&#xD;
would be sent to Fort Jackson with a ball and chain&#xD;
to his leg.&#xD;
"Var's mine fifty tollar " said the Honest Jew,&#xD;
shaking his fist at the Yankee sentinel.&#xD;
"I have it," replied the base Yankee dog; "you&#xD;
gave it to me to shut my eyes while you passed, and I&#xD;
fulfilled my part of the bargain."*v&#xD;
I then resumed my journey to New Orleans, accom-&#xD;
panied by the Israelite in whom there was no guile,&#xD;
and whose deep-heaving sighs and groans of agony&#xD;
over his loss, touched inc with pity, and filled my mind&#xD;
with tenfold anger against the foul despotism of the&#xD;
United States.&#xD;
* A true incident. ED.&#xD;

THE HONEST JEW.              89&#xD;
"My guileless and honest friend," I said to him,&#xD;
"you are a victim of unmitigated villany and iron op-&#xD;
pression. You would do good by supplying the Con-&#xD;
federacy and getting rich at the same time; but the&#xD;
damnable and debased despotism of the United States&#xD;
steps in your way !"&#xD;
"Oh, I pe very boor-very boor, indeed!" groaned&#xD;
the Israelite in whom there was no guile.&#xD;
"My boor friend !" I exclaimed, clasping him to my&#xD;
bosom, "I will avenge thy manifold wrongs. I have&#xD;
dedicated myself to Mars, the death-scattering hero of&#xD;
bloody wars; and now I also dedicate myself to&#xD;
Hermes, the god of thieves, and the son of Jupiter&#xD;
and Maia ; he whose first act was to steal the cattle of&#xD;
Apollo. Henceforth, I am the champion of larceny,&#xD;
and I swear by the soul of the Confederacy, that I&#xD;
will not rest from toil and labor until I have stolen a&#xD;
horse!"&#xD;
"You gives him to me, eh ?" asked the Jew, his eyes&#xD;
lighting up with eager fire.&#xD;
"Yes," I replied, "I'll give him to thee, my wronged&#xD;
and outraged friend."&#xD;
"But tree horses only make me cood for mine&#xD;
coods."&#xD;
"Then three shalt thou have" I exclaimed. "Yes,&#xD;
I swear it by the honor of a Confederate Warrior, that&#xD;
I will steal three horses for this outraged Jew, and one&#xD;
for myself, before I consent to a cessation of hostilities&#xD;
or return to the pursuits of philosophy in Madison-&#xD;

Successful Scheme of Finance.&#xD;
It was about this time that I put into practical op-&#xD;
eration a great scheme of finance that I had studied&#xD;
out in my secluded and meditative hours, in my dilap-&#xD;
idated hospitable abode at Madisonville, and I found&#xD;
that it worked to perfection. The principle is as&#xD;
follows: Never invite a man to drink, but always&#xD;
drink when you are asked. By the application of this&#xD;
simple rule, you get for your own use all the liquor&#xD;
you pay for, and also get a good deal which doesn't&#xD;
cost you any thing.&#xD;
I crossed the river on the Canal-street ferry-boat,&#xD;
with the firm determination not to pay a cent for food,&#xD;
lodging, or transportation, during my travels. Since&#xD;
then I have passed through many scenes, which it will&#xD;
require a long letter to describe, and I hereby give&#xD;
notice to the public that my Twelfth Epistle will be&#xD;
devoted to a full and authentic account of my travels&#xD;
in the Louisiana Lowlards Low, and to a description&#xD;
of the many strange adventures I have encountered.&#xD;

BANKS'S TEOHE CAMPAIGN.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER Xli.&#xD;
THE GREAT CONFEDERATE TRAVELLER DESCRIBES HIS JOURNEY&#xD;
THROUGH THE LOUISIANA LOWLANDS LOw.&#xD;
NOTE.-Algiers is the name of a small town opposite New Orleans.&#xD;
It contains the depot of the Opelousas railroad. Ferry accommoda-&#xD;
tions are miserable. At the time this letter was written, General&#xD;
Banks's brilliant campaign through the Teche country was in prog-&#xD;
ress, and had already resulted in the destruction of the rebel army of&#xD;
Western Louisiana. Two thousand prisoners had been captured,&#xD;
and a considerable number of them had been confined in the Belle-&#xD;
vile Iron Works in Algiers, which led Mr. Macpherson to suppose&#xD;
that the building was in possession of the Confederates.  The&#xD;
rebel army which was so effectually dispersed or destroyed by the&#xD;
movement of General Banks, was in command of Gen. Richard Tay-&#xD;
lor, a son of "Old Zack," the hero and patriot, whose devotion to his&#xD;
country has rendered his name dear to every true American. As&#xD;
Gen. Banks's campaign through the rTeche country seems not to&#xD;
have been generally understood at the time, the author will briefly&#xD;
give what he supposes to have been the theory of the movement.&#xD;
"Why," it was asked, "should the United States forces march&#xD;
through a country, take possession of it, and forthwith abandon it,&#xD;
leaving the inhabitants who, expecting protection, had shown a love&#xD;
for the Union, to suffer the penalty of rebel vengeance? This would&#xD;
be a pertinent inquiry under ordinary circumstances, but the author&#xD;
believes a brief statement of facts will explain this matter to the sat-&#xD;
isfaction of every impartial reader.&#xD;
The great object which General Banks must have had in view,&#xD;
was the capture of Port Hudson and the opening of the Mississippi&#xD;
river. But Port Hudson was a hundred and fifty miles above New&#xD;
Orleans, and in order to invest it successfully, the General required&#xD;
every soldier in the department. Indeed,with every soldier, his force&#xD;
was seemingly inadequate to the undertaking. The rebel garrison&#xD;
of Port Hudson, at the time of its investment, in May, 1863, number-&#xD;
ed seven thousand effective men, and at no time during the siege did&#xD;
Gen. Banks command more than ten thousand effective men. His&#xD;
lines were necessarily much longer than those. of the enemy, and the&#xD;
advantages were all with the garrison, except in the matter of sup.&#xD;

&#xD;
plies. In order to besiege Port Hudson, then, with any prospect of&#xD;
success, it was necessary that he should take every available man&#xD;
that could be spared. But Taylor, Monton, and Sibley were in&#xD;
Western Louisiana with a large force of rebels, and if he moved his&#xD;
entire army to Port Hudson, he left his rear and New Orleans itself&#xD;
exposed to the enemy. As he had not a sufficient force to watch the&#xD;
enemy in Western Louisiana and to invest Port Hudson at the same&#xD;
time, it was necessary to destroy the rebel army of Western Louisiana&#xD;
before Port Hudson could be invested. And this work was most&#xD;
successfully accomplished. The Army of the Gulf accomplished a&#xD;
march of three hundred miles in twenty days, fighting four battles&#xD;
and winning as many victories. The first battle was at Camp Bis&#xD;
land, christened after a planter by that name, whose plantation, now&#xD;
a picture of ruin and desolation, is situated on the r1eche, between&#xD;
Berwick City and the village of Franklin. The rebel army of West&#xD;
ern Louisiana was completely broken up and destroyed by the cam-&#xD;
paign ; and having accomplished this indispensable preliminary&#xD;
step, Gen. Banks at once moved his whole force against Port Hudson.&#xD;
Such, the author believes, was the theory of the Teche campaign-a&#xD;
campaign which, in rapidity of movement, in general management&#xD;
and important results, has not been surpassed in the history of this&#xD;
war, if we take into account the number of men engaged.&#xD;
Brashear City (why will people call such insignificant places cities ?)&#xD;
is situated on Berwick Bay, near the confluence of the Teche and&#xD;
Atchafalaya rivers, It was the base of supplies in the Teche cam&#xD;
p ign, and T he more recent movement by which the rebel army was&#xD;
(:rawn out of Texas, opening the way for the success of the expedi&#xD;
fen to  e Rio Grande, The place was recaptured by the rebels in&#xD;
June, 18G3, almost without resistance by our forces; and large quan&#xD;
titles of stores, ammunition, and a considerable number of prisoners,&#xD;
fel into the hands of the enemy. After the fall of Port Hudson, how&#xD;
ever, the rebels hastily evacuated the place, and just in time to escape&#xD;
capture. It is about ninety miles from New Orleans to the west-&#xD;
ward, and the Opelousas Railroad has its present termini at Algiers&#xD;
oaid Brashear City. r111e country between the two places is very low,&#xD;
and wide forests are seen on either hand. There are plenty of alliga-&#xD;
tors to be seen sunning themselves, and some are of enormous size;&#xD;
although it requires the Confederate arithmetic to make them five&#xD;
hundred feet long, as has been done by Mr. Macpherson.  The au-&#xD;
thor made the journey described in the following letter (I. e. as far as&#xD;
Brashear City), in the latter part of April, ior the first time; and his&#xD;
experience at the lrashear City Iotel can only be appreciated by&#xD;
those who have visited "the Great Temple of Wisdom."    He has&#xD;
connected the philosophy of Macpherson with the ancient mythology,&#xD;
&#xD;
because the credulity, mendacity, passions, and habits of the secession-&#xD;
ists more properly belong to the religion of a pagan country than to,&#xD;
a land and an age of civilisation. Gov. Moore, the last Chief Magis-&#xD;
trate elected by the people of Louisiana, and his itinerant Legisla-&#xD;
ture still claiming to exercise executive and legislative functions,&#xD;
were frightened by the "Yankee" army, or the expectation of its ap-&#xD;
proach, and "skedaddled" to some indefinite point, in or beyond the&#xD;
extreme western portion of Louisiana. Moore still claims to be gov-&#xD;
ernor of Louisiana. His power is about equal to that of Sancho&#xD;
Panza, who, like Moore, also gloried in the title of "Governor."&#xD;
MADIsONvnviE, LA.,&#xD;
May 2, 1863.&#xD;
SR :-As Ulysses, the much planning warrior of the&#xD;
Greeks, wandered the victim of cruel Fate, searching&#xD;
vainly for his home, whence he sighed to return vic-&#xD;
torious from the siege of Troy, even so was I driven&#xD;
from the paths of philosophy, and from my dilapidated&#xD;
hospitable abode, by the articulate-speaking voice of&#xD;
Fate, which sent me forth the great Confederate Trav-&#xD;

Taking passage on one of those magnificent steamers&#xD;

deck and thus poured out my soul to the people of New&#xD;
Orleans : "Farewell," I cried in tearful tones, "fair&#xD;
Crescent City, 'gazing upon the great old Father of&#xD;
Waters ! thee I leave behind. But when I return, I&#xD;
shall come with banner, brand, and bow, leading the&#xD;
victorious and unconquerable legions of Gen. I. Taylor,&#xD;

thirsting for human life, had plucked a woody moun-&#xD;
tain from its base and placed it on my head !" I then&#xD;
shouted three times, and committed assault and battery&#xD;
on a newsboy who offered me THE ERA.&#xD;
Arriving at Algiers, a magnificent city opposite&#xD;
New Orleans, I discovered that the Belleville Iron&#xD;
Works had fallen into the possession of the Confederacy,&#xD;
and that it contained a strong garrison of Graybacks,&#xD;
numbering several hundred. "Blessed be Jupiter," I&#xD;
exclaimed, "the Father of gods and men, and the&#xD;
overshadowing ruler of cloudy Olympus !-for now I&#xD;
perceive that the invader of the Lowlands Low has&#xD;
been driven back with terrific slaughter !" I then sent&#xD;
a dispatch to the President of the Confederacy in&#xD;
Richmond, announcing that General Banks had been de-&#xD;
feated and con pletely wiped out; that GeneralR.Taylor&#xD;
had captured eighteen hundred thousand Yankee pris-&#xD;
oners, and that the head of his invincible column was&#xD;
then in the Belleville Iron Works of Algiers, protected&#xD;
and watched over by a strong line of Yankee sentinels.&#xD;
I then went to the Yankee Railroad Depot, and de-&#xD;
manded a free pass to Brashear City.&#xD;
"By what authority," inquired the Yankee, " do you&#xD;
make that demand ?"&#xD;
"By the authority of the Southern Confederacy," I&#xD;
replied, " and in virtue of my vow to Mars, the death-&#xD;
scattering hero of bloody wars, that I will neither wash&#xD;
my face nor drink water until I have exterminated&#xD;
every damned Yankee in Louisiana, Mississippi, and&#xD;
the First Congressional District of Texas !"&#xD;
"You must be Macpherson," replied the Yankee.&#xD;
"Well and truly hast thou spoken," I answered him;&#xD;
&#xD;
  1THE CONFEDERATE RELIGION.     95&#xD;
"I AM Macpherson, the great Confederate traveller,&#xD;
whose Massive Intellect will produce a volume of&#xD;
Travels more entertaining, though less truthful, than&#xD;
the tales of the Arabian Nights."&#xD;
"If that won't pass you over this road," answered&#xD;
the Yankee, "I don't know what will." He then gave&#xD;
me a dead-head ticket and introduced me to another&#xD;
chap, who at once made me drink a bottle of cham-&#xD;
pagne, after which I started off on my journey.&#xD;
"Now, indeed," I exclaimed, "is the will of Jupiter&#xD;
made manifest, and heaven sends auspicious omens;&#xD;
for I ride at the expense of the United States, and am&#xD;
drunk to start with, without cost-the indispensable&#xD;
condition of a Confederate Traveller and Warrior."&#xD;
"Why is it," asked a chap in the cars, "that you&#xD;
still adhere to the religion of the Greeks and Romans,&#xD;
believe in omens, and offer orisons to the divinities of&#xD;
Olympus, whose worship has been overthrown by the&#xD;
light of Christianity ?"&#xD;
"Untaught Ignoramus !" I answered ; "benighted&#xD;
heathen of Yankee darkness! if thy dull brain is ca-&#xD;
pable of comprehending the Confederate principles, I&#xD;
will explain them to you. The Confederate religion is&#xD;
a conglomeration of the faith of Moses and the intel-&#xD;
lectual fables of Olympus, which have been handed&#xD;
down to us by th'e greatest poets of the earth. As the&#xD;
Jews believe they are the chosen people, and a cussed&#xD;
sight better than anybody else, so do the Confederates&#xD;
believe that they are the salt of the earth-a position&#xD;
fully sustained by the large saline deposits near New&#xD;
Iberia. So far, then, our faith is founded on Moses&#xD;
and the Israelites generally; but the rest of it Corre-&#xD;

sponds pretty faithfully with the pagan religion, except&#xD;
that ours surpasses the pagan in the magnificent splen-&#xD;
dor of its fables. Let me illustrate this point to your&#xD;
ignorance-besotted mind. Ancient Troy was a village&#xD;
about half the size of Algiers, and the siege of the&#xD;
place was a series of fist-encounters between Ajax,&#xD;
Heenan, Priam, and other prize-fighters. But Homer&#xD;
has converted his pugilists into demigods, and has in-&#xD;
troduced nearly all the gods of heaven, earth, and hell&#xD;
as interested spectators, or active co-operationists. For&#xD;
all this there was a slight foundation in truth ; and the&#xD;
Confederate Religion differs from and surpasses the&#xD;
ancient, in the fact that its biggest stories and achieve-&#xD;
ments have no foundation in fact whatever !"  I then&#xD;
presented him with a copy of Macpherson's Confed-&#xD;
erate Arithmetic, and told him that if his muddy and&#xD;
debased brain could comprehend it, he was smarter&#xD;
than I was.&#xD;
The people along the road turned out by millions to&#xD;
see me, as the train passed on through the Lowlands&#xD;
Low, all giving a hundred and fifty cheers and fifty&#xD;
tigers, in honor of the Plato of the Confederacy and&#xD;
the Fenus of Madisonville, whose Mammoth Brain&#xD;
first brought together in a condensed and intelligible&#xD;
form the famous religion and philosophy of the New&#xD;
Nation, which are destined to sweep every other from&#xD;
the earth, from Greenlandis Icy Mountains to India's&#xD;
Coral Strand.&#xD;
The car in which I was seated was soon filled with&#xD;
bouquets, hurled at me through the window, formed&#xD;
of red, white, and red, indicative of the Confederate&#xD;
flag, and in imitation of those which the Confederates&#xD;

MACPHERsON SHOOTS AN ALLIGATOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
of New Orleans have been accustomed to throw at the&#xD;
players, since the damnable despotism of U. S. will&#xD;
not permit them to throw out-and-out secession flags.&#xD;
At last, the accumulated weight of bouquets and of&#xD;
my Ponderous Intellect proved too much for the labor-&#xD;
ing Engine, and it gave out, when we were kept wait-&#xD;
ing for three hours, surrounded by impenetrable woods&#xD;
and dirty water, moccasin snakes and deep lagoons&#xD;
overhung by weeping cypress-trees, and echoing for-&#xD;
ever with the melodious notes of bull-frogs and alli-&#xD;
gators.&#xD;
Then it was that I walked into the gloomy forest,&#xD;
and recalled to my mind the adventure of Balboa, who&#xD;
discovered the Pacific Ocean, and wading into it up to&#xD;
his waist, stretched forth his sword and took possession&#xD;
of that important stream in the name of his king.&#xD;
Therefore I waded into a mud-hole up to the top of my&#xD;
breeches, and stretching forth my brawny arm, took&#xD;
possession of it in the name of the Southern Confed-&#xD;
eracy!&#xD;
l[acpherson's Interview with an Alligator five hundred&#xD;
feet long.&#xD;
As I was wallowing back, I met an alligator five&#xD;
hundred feet long by Confederate measurement, which&#xD;
is equal to ten feet in Yankee mathematics. I imme-&#xD;
diately drew my Jeff. Davis revolver, a terrible brass-&#xD;
mounted weapon, presented to me by the ladies of&#xD;
Doctor Palmer's congregation, and shot the animal, ex-&#xD;
pecting to see him die at my feet. He paid no attention&#xD;
to it, but rolled over in the dirt and yawned, as though&#xD;
nothing had happened. Then it was that my mind&#xD;

"Majestic Confederate mudsill !-aboriginal inhab-&#xD;
itant of the Louisiana Lowlands Low !-thou art im-&#xD;
pregnable as the defenses of Camp Bisland, and&#xD;
impervious to water and mud alike. Would to heaven&#xD;
that, deployed as skirmishers in R. Taylor's army, you&#xD;
might wad2 in Yankee blood, even as now you wallow&#xD;
in mud, the natural ally of the Southern Confederacy !"&#xD;
Arrival at Tigerville.&#xD;
The engine having been repaired, it gave a Confed-&#xD;
erate snort, and with lightning in its eye and steel in&#xD;
its sinews, drew us to Tigerville, just as the sombre&#xD;
mantle of all-enshrouding night settled over the earth.&#xD;
The conductor shouted " Tigerville," and I looked out,&#xD;
expecting to see a city equal to Madisonville, but&#xD;
could discover nothing but a wide and lonely forest, in&#xD;
which the deep-laid shadows seemed to conceal a thou-&#xD;
sand phantom  forms. But as the train moved on&#xD;
again, I got a sight at Tigerville, which apparently&#xD;
consisted of a grocery store and a brass kettle; and I&#xD;
found that by a miraculous junction of nature and art,&#xD;
while the engine was in the centre of the city, the rear&#xD;
car, in which I was seated, was in the midst of prime-&#xD;
val forests, stretching away for miles o either hand.&#xD;
At last we reached Brashear City, town larger&#xD;
than New Orleans, if you include the woods.: A pe-.&#xD;
culiarity of this city is, that it has no streets.&#xD;

BRAsTEAR CITY HOTEL.&#xD;

&#xD;
The great Temple of Wisdom at Brashear city.&#xD;
Immediately I proceeded to the Brashear City&#xD;
Hotel,.which I soon discovered was a vast temple of&#xD;
wisdom and economy. It so strongly resembles my&#xD;
dilapidated hospitable abode in Madisonville, that I&#xD;
burst into tears as the sweet image of that home arose&#xD;
before me with the Idiotic Boy, now the exponent of&#xD;
Confederate Philosophy, and of my spouse, who sighs&#xD;
for the return of her roving protector, even as Penelope&#xD;
sighed for the return of Ulysses ; but I hope she has&#xD;
fewer suitors than the excellent Greek lady alluded to.&#xD;
Calling for supper, I. was told that none could be&#xD;
had_; as it was past the usual hour, and the chief cook&#xD;
had gone to bed. Then was I filled with admiration&#xD;
at the Arcadian simplicity of life in those remote re-&#xD;
gions, where the repose of a cook begins at nine o'clock&#xD;
in the evening, and is guarded by the changeless law&#xD;
of custom. Gladly, therefore, did I go to my room,&#xD;
supperless.&#xD;
The apartment in which I was placed, and from&#xD;
which a Yankee was expelled to make room for me,&#xD;
filled me with love and admiration beyond the power&#xD;
of language to describe. There was such an absence&#xD;
of all luxuries, or even necessaries of life, that I at once&#xD;
saw that the architect and proprietor of the establish-&#xD;
iment was a philosopher and a political economist.&#xD;
The rude walls were constructed of rough Confederate&#xD;
boards, undefiled by the carpenter's plane, the luxu-&#xD;
rious covering of the paper manufactory, or the un-&#xD;
necessary embellishment of the white-washer's brush.&#xD;

"Thanks to Jupiter !" I exclaimed, "the wall-paper&#xD;
which might otherwise have been wasted upon these&#xD;
walls, can now be used for publishing secession jour-&#xD;
nals." I then got into bed, and pulled down the mus-&#xD;
quito-net. I discovered that the mattress was made&#xD;
of cane-stalks, the products of my native Louisiana,&#xD;
with an immense one in the centre, very convenient to&#xD;
hang upon to keep one's self in bed. The only unne-&#xD;
cessary luxury I observed consisted of two table-cloths&#xD;
on the bed in place of sheets ; and I got up early in&#xD;
the morning, thinking they might be needed for use&#xD;
on the table. I had not been in bed a great while be-&#xD;
fore the nusquitoes, that were buzzing by millions&#xD;
around the net, commenced pouring through im close&#xD;
co1 tllby battalions ; while an immense force was held&#xD;
back as a reserve to fill up the ranks shattered by the&#xD;
death-scattering blows of my manly arm. Now it was&#xD;
that a great physical rencounter commenced, surpassing&#xD;
in bloody destruction the battle of Forts Jackson and&#xD;
St. Philip. I slaughtered them without mercy ; but I&#xD;
found that the wide forests surrounding the city were&#xD;
filled with dauntless legions ; and however many&#xD;
millions I might destroy, it was probable that I should&#xD;
be compelled at last to surrender to overpowering&#xD;
numbers. Therefore, I thought I would try to stop up&#xD;
some of the holes in the musquito-net. I stuck my&#xD;
hat into one of them,' my boots into two others, my&#xD;
breeches into another, my Confederate coat and vest&#xD;
into another, and finally, the washstand and pitcher&#xD;
into the biggest one. But these precautions scarcely&#xD;
checked the overpowering advance of the hostile&#xD;
armies, and 1 went to tying up the holes in knots,&#xD;

until I had tied twenty-five hundred by the Confeder-&#xD;
ate arithmetic, which is fifty in Yankee mathematics;&#xD;
but all to no avail. I at last collected the carcasses of&#xD;
the slain, and piled them up around me; after which I&#xD;
was enabled to enjoy a night of strength-nourishing&#xD;
repose.&#xD;
Arising in the morning, I discovered that there was&#xD;
no soap in the room, which I regarded as a high per-&#xD;
sonal compliment to my cleanliness ; it was as much&#xD;
as an admission on the part of the landlord, that I was&#xD;
clean enough already. Neither was there any looking-&#xD;
glass; and I knew at once that the landlord did not&#xD;
mean to encourage the sentimnenth of worldly pride,&#xD;
engendered in men and women when they survey their&#xD;
persons in a glass.&#xD;
I immediately took passage for Opelousas, whence I&#xD;
walked to Shreveport to find Governor Moore and the&#xD;
Legislature, the custodians of the civil rights of Louisi-&#xD;
ana, and the guardians of the State treasury.&#xD;
Interview with Governor Jloore.&#xD;
I inquired diligently for them, but the inhabitants&#xD;
reported that they had left some time previous, at&#xD;
double-quick, carrying the treasury and archives in a&#xD;
one-horse cart. I followed on and reached the Red&#xD;
River ; and there I discovered Governor Moore weeping&#xD;
on a stump, in the depths of a dismal forest, surround-&#xD;
ed by insects and wild beasts. Seeing me, he fell upon&#xD;
my neck and cried like a child. "Guardian of law&#xD;
and order !" I exclaimed ; "protector of States' rights&#xD;

"Macpherson !" he said, in tearful tones ; "look&#xD;
here on this picture, and then on this. When I took&#xD;
charge of the Legislature, it sat in the fine State-house&#xD;
at Baton Rouge, and I was the proud potentate of the&#xD;
great sugar-planting State, while the treasury was&#xD;
overflowing with funds. But where am I now&#xD;
"In a swamp, on a stump !" I replied.&#xD;
" Where is the treasury ?" he continued.&#xD;
" That's what I'm after," I answered.&#xD;
" Well, thou shalt see it," he replied ; whereupon he&#xD;
led me to the borders of a mud-hole, and drawing aside&#xD;
the thick overhanging foliage, displayed to my vision&#xD;
a one-horse cart attached to a mule, and both stuck in&#xD;
the mud. "To this complexion hath it come at last !"&#xD;
he groaned; "for you see before you the archives and&#xD;
the treasury of the State !"&#xD;
I immediately overhauled the contents, and discov-&#xD;
ered the Act of Secession, of January 6,Q1861; a copy&#xD;
of Macpherson's Confederate Arithmetic, by which he&#xD;
had tried to multiply ) by 50, and so fill the treasury ;&#xD;
and an order conscripting all able-bodied niggers into&#xD;
the Confederate ranks as soldiers. "Those," said the&#xD;
Itinerant Moore, " are the State archives. Look now&#xD;
at the treasury." I looked, and discovered a five-cent&#xD;
shinplaster on the bank of West Baton Rouge, a blue&#xD;
car-ticket, ,nd a receipt for two barrels of whisky.&#xD;
"That," said the weeping Moore, "is what remains of&#xD;
the wealth of Louisiana, after passing through the fiery&#xD;
ordeal of civil war, and the more trying ordeal of my&#xD;

policy. The mule represents the motive power of the&#xD;
Confederacy, and the whole concern is now stuck in&#xD;
the mud."&#xD;
"But the glory of the New Nation still remains," I&#xD;
answered him. "Jeff. Davis still sits enthroned in&#xD;
oriental magnificence in Richmond, and the Idiotic&#xD;
Boy is monarch of Confederate Philosophy. Let us&#xD;
arise and exterminate the Yankee race&#xD;
We arose, and taking me to the recesses of an im-&#xD;
mense hollow tree, I discovered the Legislature in ses-&#xD;
sion. It consisted of. three members, all dead drunk.&#xD;
"Join us," said the governor ; and I joined. We&#xD;
soon became happy in the consciousness that we might&#xD;
soon recover the whole territory of the United States.&#xD;
I was accordingly elected a member of the Legislature,&#xD;
and we forthwith passed an act declaring the power of&#xD;
the Yankees at an end, and seizing the whole conti-&#xD;
nent of America, in the name of the Southern Con-&#xD;
federacy, the said act to take effect immediately.&#xD;
"Thanks to Jupiter !" I exclaimed ; "the  r is now&#xD;
at an end; the North is subdued, and the flag of the&#xD;
New Nation floats in triumph over every inch of ground&#xD;
on the vast continent." We then got blind drunk,&#xD;
from which I was aroused by the recollection that a&#xD;
week before I had made a vqw of larceny, and had&#xD;
promised to steal three horses for the Honest Jew, who&#xD;
had promised to wait in Algiers until I should setd&#xD;
him the specified number of animals. I accordingly&#xD;
started off at double-quick, and returned to the Yankee&#xD;
headquarters at Opelousas.&#xD;

GREAT CONFEDERATE PARSON.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Vow of Larceny fulflled.&#xD;
I was there advised that the late battle-field of Camp&#xD;
Bisland afforded great facilities for stealing horses, and&#xD;
thither I went. Looking around, I discovered not less&#xD;
than sixty animals, and I immediately telegraphed to&#xD;
the Honest Jew, that if he would come up there, I&#xD;
would give him thirty horses instead of three. He&#xD;
went and met me with a glowing face on that field of&#xD;
bloody encounter, in which R. Taylor's forces drove&#xD;
the Yankees thirteen hundred miles in thirteen hours,&#xD;
averaging a hundred miles to the hour. He immedi-&#xD;
ately embraced me.&#xD;
"You pe vun shentlemans," said he; "I bays your&#xD;
pills at the hotel."&#xD;
"All right," I answered him; "there are sixty&#xD;
horses up there; you shall have thirty; take your&#xD;
pick."&#xD;
He started off on the run, but soon returned with&#xD;
fire and indignation in his eyes.&#xD;
"You pe vun tam fillain !" he exclaimed,&#xD;
"What's the matter, sweet one !" I asked, in a tone&#xD;
of tenderness.&#xD;
"You tam fillain ! the horses pe every vun tead !"&#xD;
"Dead !" I exclaimed, "and so young-the oldest&#xD;
not being quite twenty! But weep not, my Honest&#xD;
Jew; they died in the sacred cause of the Southern&#xD;
Confederacy. Ilce et decorum est pro patria mori.&#xD;
You never tried it, poor Jew, and you never will.&#xD;
But, I tell thee, I did not promise that the horses&#xD;
should be alive; and now, o hIermes ! god of thieves,&#xD;
&#xD;
I have fulfilled my vow of blood and larceny !" I&#xD;
then kissed the honest Jew and returned to New Or-&#xD;
leans, having been invited to preach in a secession&#xD;
church on Sunday, April 26th, in consequence of my&#xD;
able exposition of the Confederate Religion to the&#xD;
Yankee Ignoramus, and in view of the fact that the&#xD;
proclamation of that bloody despot, Abraham Lincoln,&#xD;
had been ordered to be read in the churches on that&#xD;
day. The prevailing belief among the Confederates&#xD;
was, that I was the only Confederate parson smart&#xD;
enough to do the thing up properly, and outwit the&#xD;
dull Yankee brain. Therefore did I haste, with wings&#xD;
as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love, to as-&#xD;
sume the robes of divinity. In my next letter, I shall&#xD;
appear as the Great Confederate Parson, reading the&#xD;
Proclamation, and will reproduce the sermon I deliver-&#xD;
ed on that occasion.&#xD;
My task for this week is done. I travelled through&#xD;
the Louisiana Lowlands Low, with a rapidity that&#xD;
would do credit to an engine on the Opelousas road.&#xD;
I am the greatest traveller in the Confederacy, and my&#xD;
only wonder is that my heart does not swell with pride&#xD;
and egotism when I think of my accomplishments.&#xD;
But with all my Massive Intellect and power in the&#xD;
Confederacy, I am not egotistic in any degree beyond&#xD;
what is warranted in the Confederate Code of Egotism.&#xD;
Yours, modestly,&#xD;

ETC., ETO,&#xD;
NoTE.-P4resident Lincoln issued a proclamation, setting apart the&#xD;
80th day of April, 18(L, as a day of national humiliation, fasting, and&#xD;
prayer. (haral James Bowen, Pi ovost Marshal General of Louisiana,&#xD;
issued a circular, in which lie "rinqested" (that was the word used)&#xD;
all the clergymen officiating in the churches of New Orleans, Jeffer-&#xD;
son, ('arrolilon, and Algiers, to read the proclamation of the President&#xD;
to their congregations, oni -unday, the 2th of A pril-the Sunday pre-&#xD;
ceding the day desig nattd by the President. Some of the clergymen&#xD;
paid no attention to this request. Others read it, and the reading&#xD;
was made the occasion for very noisy and disgraceful demonstrations&#xD;
tn the part of th  secessionists in the congregation. The women&#xD;
sk the lead in the sacregious proceedings. The moment the read-&#xD;
ing commenced, they left the churches in a very noisy and offensive&#xD;
manrhllCe1. bhatl ing thai r feet, upsetting stools, and otherwise disturb-&#xD;
ing the peace and good order of the sanctuary. Some of the clergy-&#xD;
men, nlxiols to soothe the nerves of their secession hearers, an-&#xD;
n unced that they would read the Proclamation because they had&#xD;
been ordenid to read it-an assertion as false as it was cowardly,&#xD;
since, as ha s been stated already, they were only i'equested to read it,&#xD;
Ontie of the clergy who neglected to read it at all was Father Joubert,&#xD;
of St. Augustine's chuteri, who, the author has been told, refused to&#xD;
aiinister the sa.'rament to colored men who had enlisted in the&#xD;
a rmvi ;thus making it an offense punishable with eternal damnation&#xD;
fr a negro to fight for the Union ! Father Lemaitre, of the St. Rose&#xD;
tic Lima, read the proclamation, and preached an out-and-out Union&#xD;
sermon to an immem" congregation. He was soon after excemmu-&#xD;
nicated by Arch bishop Odin; but the author is pleased to learn that&#xD;
in paid no attention to his sentence, refused to be damned in all his&#xD;
pirts for the sin of being a Union man, and still continues to exer-&#xD;
cise his ecclesiastical oflice. One clergyman, whose congregation un-&#xD;
&#xD;
DISPATCH FROM JEFF. DAVIS.&#xD;

&#xD;
derstood only the French language, read the proclamation in English ;&#xD;

upon my thirteenth with my Mammoth Brain un-&#xD;
dimmed, and the fires of genius glowing more brightly&#xD;
than when I began.&#xD;
Returning from my immortal travels through the&#xD;
Louisiana Lowlands Low, I had scarcely set foot upon&#xD;
the Levee at New Orleans, when a courier, mounted&#xD;
on a Confederate mule, came riding up with the rapid=&#xD;
ity of lightning. "I am," lie said, "the bearer of im-&#xD;
portant dispatches from your Idiotic Boy, the Great&#xD;
exponent of Confederate Philosophy in Madisonville,.&#xD;
since your departure from your dilapidated hospitable&#xD;
abode."&#xD;
I opened the dispatches with a trembling hand, and&#xD;
was startled at the vast importance of the matter&#xD;
therein contained, Jeff. Davis, whose mud image&#xD;
stands upon my shelf in Madisonville, and which I&#xD;
always approach with uncovered head, had telegraphed&#xD;
to the Idiotic Boy as follows:&#xD;
eJ6f Davis's Dispatch.&#xD;
The Proclamation of Abraham Lincoln appointing&#xD;
a day of national humiliation and prayer, must not be&#xD;
read in the churches of New Orleans ; or, if read, it&#xD;
must be received with hisses, howls, and Confederate&#xD;

hours, I was tapped upon the shoulder by a man of&#xD;
giant frame. His form towered on high more lofty&#xD;
than that of the bloody despot Abraham Lincoln,&#xD;
whose throne at Washington is built of human skulls,&#xD;
and whose daily food is a fricasseed Southerner. His&#xD;
large and glowing face was red as a Confederate army&#xD;
shoe, and his threadbare gray garments showed me&#xD;
plainly that he belonged to the glorious New Nation.&#xD;
He gazed upon me with a look of melting tenderness&#xD;
with those fiery eyes, beaming in their sunken sockets&#xD;
like the orbs of night, or the all-warming sun in his&#xD;
meridian glory, and falling at my knees, he burst into&#xD;
a flood of tears.&#xD;
"I am a Weeping Orphan!" he said: "I am six&#xD;
&#xD;
TIIE WEEPING OI Pll A N.   109&#xD;
&#xD;
feet and five inches high, and forty-nine years of age.&#xD;
Weight, two hundred and eighty pounds."&#xD;
" Unhappy youth ! " I exclaimed : " thine enormous&#xD;
height entitles thee to the sympathy of a Confederate&#xD;
philosopher, even if thou, tender bud and sweet honey-&#xD;
suckle of affliction, hadst not been cast upon the cold&#xD;
charities of the world at a tender age."&#xD;
"How do you make that out ?" asked a Yankee, in&#xD;
a gruff voice, interrupting my train of sublime medita-&#xD;
tion ; "up North we-call a man of forty-nine years&#xD;
well advanced in life!"&#xD;
"And so he is,"I answered, "in those unhappy realms&#xD;
of Yankeedom ; but in the celestial Confederacy a man&#xD;
does not arrive at the years of discretion until he is&#xD;
fifty-one."  I then fell upon the breast of the Weeping&#xD;
Orphan, and told him that I would share with him my&#xD;
last crust, and invited him to my quarters at the St.&#xD;
Louis Hotel, which invitation he accepted with flow-&#xD;
ing tears of gratitude.&#xD;
iacpherson finds himself with a large family on his&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
Scarcely had we taken four drinks, before the Or-&#xD;
phan burst into a flood of such violent tears that I&#xD;
feared the effect upon his tender constitution. "Oh!"&#xD;
he cried, "what will become of those sweet buds of&#xD;
affection, my wailing infants, who groan for bread;&#xD;
and my tender spouse, whose grief surpasses my own&#xD;
"Bring them hither," I exclaimed ; "I will protect&#xD;
them from the cold blasts of the world, and fill their&#xD;
mouths with bread and jerked beef."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Generous stranger !" exclaimed the Orphan; "I&#xD;
accept the proffered hospitalities of your house." ie&#xD;
then brought in his family, which consisted of a wife&#xD;
and thirteen children, and all about the same size.&#xD;
"These are the cause of my anxiety,'' le exclaimed,&#xD;
" and for these I weep almost as much as for my own&#xD;
bereaved lot, cast as I am, at a tender age, upon my&#xD;
own resources."&#xD;
"I will keep this charge !" I answered, " and thou&#xD;
shalt know that none ever in vain appealed to the&#xD;
charity of the Plat of the Confederacy."  I then&#xD;
ordered supper for the crowd, and found that it would&#xD;
cost me 885 per day to feed my unhappy guests.&#xD;
Sunday morning, April  G, 18(3, dawned upon the&#xD;
world with resplendent glory. The all-beholding sun&#xD;
shone from a cloudless sky, and the birds sang sweetly&#xD;
around the lofty chimneys of the St. Louis Hotel,&#xD;
where I might have l)eelI seen arm-in-arm with the&#xD;
Weeping Orphan, followed by his wife and thirteen&#xD;
infants, wending our way towards the Great Confed-&#xD;
erate Temple of holiness in Camp-street. The people,&#xD;
attracted by the understanding that I was to expound&#xD;
the Confederate religion, and read Abraham Lincoln's&#xD;
Proclamation in a Confederate manner, turned out in&#xD;
overpowering numbers. At least three hundred thou-&#xD;
sand registered enemies were present, and as many&#xD;
more went away, unable to gain admittance.&#xD;
Not having a pastoral robe I pulled off my coat,&#xD;
and mounted the pulpit in my shirt sleeves, where I&#xD;
was received with loud applause. The women waved&#xD;
their handkerchiefs and cried, " God bless you !" I&#xD;
was always popular with the women of New Orleans,&#xD;
&#xD;
CONFEDERALTE .SAINTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
1i&#xD;
&#xD;
and the reason of it is that I so profusely and ably&#xD;
represent their thoughts,.feelings, and wishes. I am&#xD;
endowed with the extraordinary gift of nature, which&#xD;
enables me to read the innermost emotions and thoughts&#xD;
of the human mind. I comprehend to its fullest extent&#xD;
that deep, and intense, and passionate, and divine super-&#xD;
human hatred, which the true ladies of New Orleans&#xD;
cherish in their glowing bosoms for the whole Yankee&#xD;
race-a hatred as deep as the twelfth circle of Dante's'&#xD;
Inferno, and as high as the flag-staff of the St. Charles&#xD;
Hotel before it was cut down. hate the Yankees?&#xD;
Yes! I hate thirst, when there is no Confederate ruin&#xD;
within a hundred miles of me ! I had rather be a door-&#xD;
keeper in a Confederate hog-pen than to play a piano&#xD;
in the parlor of a Yankee. Therefore it is that I am&#xD;
popular with the true ladies of New Orleans; and there-&#xD;
fore it is, that the moment I stepped into the pulpit I&#xD;
was loaded down with bouquets and sympathy.&#xD;
The audience began to cry out, "Macpherson ! Mac-&#xD;
pherson !" I was about to respond, when, much to&#xD;
my astonishment and indignation, the Weeping Orphan&#xD;
dodged in ahead of me, and with streaming eyes in-&#xD;
formed the people of his unhappy lot in life. It&#xD;
occurred to me that something might be made out of&#xD;
the affair : I proposed that a collection should be&#xD;
taken up for the weeping object of sympathy before&#xD;
me. Three thousand dollars were collected, which I&#xD;
put in my own pocket, and then proceeded with the&#xD;
exercises.&#xD;
"Confederate saints," I said, "and believers in the&#xD;
only true faith, we shall begin this performance by&#xD;
singing a beautiful hymn, composed by myself, and&#xD;

YANKEES.&#xD;
hymn in L. M., by Rev. JAMEs B. MACPHERSON, of Madisonville, Poet&#xD;
Laureate, Author, Philosopher, Warrior, and Traveller.&#xD;
1.&#xD;
Yankees have horns and hoofs and tails,&#xD;
The soil is blighted where they tread,&#xD;
And be they women, be they males,&#xD;
I wish the Yankee race was dead.&#xD;
2.&#xD;
Confederate vengeance, like a blow&#xD;
From the avenging hand of Fate,&#xD;
Shall lay all the damned Yankees low&#xD;
In our brave Louisiana State.&#xD;

The singing concluded, I proceeded to deliver my great&#xD;

ging over the Classical Dictionaries and hunting up&#xD;

ful and sublime feature of the Confederate religion,&#xD;
that you can strike out any part .that don't please you,&#xD;
and add any thing you'd like to see there. I have&#xD;
accordingly struck out from they text the words, 'the&#xD;
trumpet,' and this gives us a splendid expression of the&#xD;
basis of the whole Confederate establishment, and reads&#xD;
simply : 'Blow Ye!' I cannot imagine how two words&#xD;
could possibly be found which more fittingly express&#xD;
the duty of every Confederate. I have searched the&#xD;
annals of by-gone ages ; I have explored every tongue,&#xD;
living and dead ; I have sought in the hieroglyphics of&#xD;
Egypt, the euphonious language of the Greeks, the&#xD;
sublime speech of the Ronans, and the fiery words 9f&#xD;

worthy of the obedience of every one in the Confed-&#xD;

occasion ; and therefore I cry with  loud voice:&#xD;
Blow Ye !&#xD;
"I have endeavored to live up to thi great funda-&#xD;

give a touching and noisy example of the faith. I am&#xD;
the great Confederate Blower, and the reason of my&#xD;
fame among men is, that I blow in a more faithful&#xD;
manner than the general run of Confederates, although&#xD;
the average of the Confederate race is but very little&#xD;
behind me. To the Confederates \of New Orleans I&#xD;
give the deserved and proud distinction of Blowing in a&#xD;
manner perfectly satisfactory to our King, Jeff. Davis,&#xD;

mon sense mnhis muddy and idiotic brain, to mingle&#xD;
with the Confederates of New Orleans, whether in&#xD;

iii health, in victory or death, in carnage and slaughter,&#xD;
or in peace and innocence, I will Blow and Blow for-&#xD;
evermore. Yea, from the table of my memory I'll&#xD;
wipe away all trivial fond records, all saws and books,&#xD;
all forms, all pressures past, that youth and observation&#xD;

niously over my mouth, and blew so fiercely that it&#xD;
frightened the thirteen infants of the Weeping Orphan,&#xD;
and they cried in concert with me, making a most&#xD;
beautiful illustration of Confederate theology.&#xD;
At this stage of the proceedings, a delegation entered&#xD;
from Algiers, leading a small live alligator by a red&#xD;
string, which lhe presented to me in behalf of the&#xD;
Yankee Railroad men at the Algiers Depot. The head&#xD;

that according to the rules of Confederate Arithmetic,&#xD;
he was seventy-five feet long, which is equal to eigh-&#xD;

me to say, that the Confederate Arithmetic is perfectly&#xD;
simple, and if the public will pay proper attention to&#xD;
its rules, they can learn to cipher as well as I can, and&#xD;
I shall not then be bothered by people coming to have&#xD;
me do their sums for them. Multiply every Yankee&#xD;
figure by fifty, and you get the Confederate total. The&#xD;
delegation then departed, and I resumed my discourse,&#xD;
having sent the animal under an escort of Stuart's&#xD;
cavalry, to my dilapidated hospitable abode.&#xD;
Confederate Saints !" I said, " I have now a most&#xD;
loathsome and unholy duty to perform. I have been&#xD;
ordered by the Provost Marshal General, under the&#xD;
penalty of death, to read in your hearing a loathsome&#xD;
and unholy proclamation by that most foul and un-&#xD;
natural despot, Abraham Lincoln, a tyrant more base&#xD;
than Caligula or the princes of Central Africa. The&#xD;
proclamation fixes next Thursday as a day of national&#xD;
humiliation, fasting, and prayer, and I had rather give&#xD;
a thousand dollars than to read it in my temple of&#xD;
Confederate Holiness, provided I was allowed to take&#xD;
up another collection. But my life is of great value&#xD;
to the Confederacy, and the fundamental faith of the&#xD;
New Nation is, that every man shall look out for his&#xD;
own neck. Rather than have my able brain separated&#xD;
from the gigantic frame on which it now stands, I will&#xD;
read this most hateful proclamation, and I hope the&#xD;
arrangements will prove effective !"&#xD;

I then commenced reading the proclamation in the&#xD;
.Ethiopian tongue, and, simultaneously with the pro-&#xD;
nunciation of the first word, the whole audience gave&#xD;
the Confederate snort, while a nigger fiddler struck up&#xD;
the R. Taylor Gallopade, and forty others danced a&#xD;
grand hoe-down in the gallery. The Weeping Orphan&#xD;
pinched his thirteen children until they screamed at&#xD;
the top of their voice, and the ladies went to upsetting&#xD;
stools and drumming on the pews with their fan-&#xD;
handles. As soon as the reading was completed, the&#xD;
audience knelt and received my benediction.&#xD;
Thus did I outwit the dull Yankee brain ; thus did&#xD;
I obey the order and trample it in the dust at the same&#xD;
time; thus did I save the great temple of Confederate&#xD;
Holiness from defilement and sacrilege.&#xD;
Returning from church, I indulged in liberal pota-&#xD;
tions, and made the proposition to the Weeping Or-&#xD;
phan of taking five hundred drinks in succession, and&#xD;
we went at it. Irecollect swallowing the thirtieth, and&#xD;
then my Massive Brain lost a consciousness of mundane&#xD;
events. But when I awoke, I found that the Weeping&#xD;
Orphan had stolen $3,000 out of my pocket, and ske-&#xD;
daddled, leaving his wife and thirteen children on my&#xD;
hands to support. Thus, in a moment, was I reduced&#xD;
froim luxury to abject peulry and degrading poverty;&#xD;
and my scanty earnings barely sustain the life of the&#xD;
helpless ones that fortune has so unexpectedly thrown&#xD;
under the protecting egis of my Benevolence.&#xD;
But such is the fate of all sublunary greatness. The&#xD;
light that streams down from the morning sun is, ere&#xD;
long, hidden in the shadows of all-enshrouding night.&#xD;
The smile that lights up the face of innocence and&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty is soon dissipated and lost in the haggard lines&#xD;
of grief. The step of youth must some day totter with&#xD;
age; the glory of life is transient as the meteor's flash ;&#xD;
and until I have an opportunity to take up another&#xD;
collection, or to steal a thousand dollars, I must grapple,&#xD;
single-handed and alone, with the ill fortunes of life,&#xD;
and remain gaunt with famine and thirst.&#xD;

a benighted world, and presented myself as a model of&#xD;
the Christian virtues and graces, and a strict temper-&#xD;

like the Tenth Infantry.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Damn the army !" I replied. "It is a peculiarity&#xD;
of Confederate warfare, that a Major General requires&#xD;
no army. Proclamations, sir, proclamations are the&#xD;
things with which to crush the Yankee foe. How did&#xD;
Beauregard raise the blockade of Charleston ? With a&#xD;
Proclamation ! How did Magruder do the same thing&#xD;
at Galveston ? With a Proclamation ! How did Gov-&#xD;
ernor Moore conscript the niggers in the Trans-Missis-&#xD;
sippi Department? With a Proclamation ! Are they&#xD;
greater Generals than I?  No, sir!  You damned&#xD;
Idiot ! talk to me about an army ! I'll show you&#xD;
that I'm Major General and Commander of the Depart-&#xD;
ment. Pen, ink, paper, and gas are the only imple-&#xD;
ments necessary to secure a Confederate victory at&#xD;
every step !" I then wrung the Idiot's nose and swore&#xD;
to be revenged.&#xD;
Subsequently I determined to raise an army, and&#xD;
opened a Recruiting Office in Madisonville, and swore&#xD;
that 1 would fill the ranks at all hazards. I raised a&#xD;
Confederate flag two hundred feet long by Confederate&#xD;
measurement, which is four feet in Yankee mathemat-&#xD;
ics, and sent a nigger through the streets pounding on&#xD;
a tin pan to drum up recruits. The first one that came&#xD;
in was seventy-four years of age, blind in one eye,&#xD;
walking on two crutches, and armed with a buzz-saw.&#xD;
"Welcome !" I exclaimed, "young and ardent sol-&#xD;
dier of your country, to the headquarters of Confeder-&#xD;
ate glory. You are the nucleus of the army of this&#xD;
department, and I will lead you to endless conquest !"&#xD;
He then whirled his buzz-saw and took his place in&#xD;
line-of-battle. I conscripted two niggers to hold him&#xD;
up on his crutches while he should fight.&#xD;

Finding that this patriotic yotth was the only per-&#xD;
son who would voluntarily enlist, or voluntarily obey&#xD;
my orders, I resolved to enforce. my authority at the&#xD;
point of the sword, 'mid scenes of broil and battle. I&#xD;
therefore mounted the Confederate Mule, the same an-&#xD;
imal that carried ine to New Orleans when I attended&#xD;
the great Charity Fair, and drawing my shining blade&#xD;
with a Confederate flourish, placed myself at the head&#xD;
of the column, determined to lead in person, according&#xD;
to Macpherson's Confederate Tactics, a profound work&#xD;
on military science, which I had compiled the night&#xD;
before. I marched off in the following order : 1st.&#xD;
The General Commanding, viz., myself. 2d. Music,&#xD;
viz., the nigger with a tin pan. 3d. The column in&#xD;
order of battle, consisting of the patriotic youth, sup-&#xD;
ported on either flank by an African.&#xD;
I determined to make my first demonstration on the&#xD;
abode of a Choctaw Indian, who had some time been&#xD;
seen about Madisonville dressed in the peculiar and&#xD;
fantastic style of his race. Halting in front, I gave&#xD;
the order to deploy column in the back yard, for the&#xD;
ptirpose of cutting off retreat, while I should attack in&#xD;
front, with the musician supporting me as a reserve.&#xD;
These dispositions having been made on scientific&#xD;
principles, I gave the Confederate snort, the great sig-&#xD;
nal of attack. The Indian, started from his morning&#xD;
slumbers, without waiting to dress, jumped out of a&#xD;
side window and cut for the woods. "Sweet Choc-&#xD;
taw !" I exclaimed,-"for the moment thy speed gives&#xD;
thee success; but this is no fault of my tactics, and&#xD;
thou owest thy safety to the fact that I have not an&#xD;

me deficient in the art of war, try and make thine es-&#xD;
cape through the back yard, over my invincible col-&#xD;
umn !" I then put spurs to my mule, and started in&#xD;
pursuit. After a race of two miles, I overtook him&#xD;
and held him, while, in obedience to my orders, the&#xD;
column came up, and the Choctaw was conscripted,&#xD;
and took his place in line of battle, a willing and obe-&#xD;
dient soldier of the Confederacy. "The Great Spirit,"&#xD;
I said to him, "will not send any Choctaw to the&#xD;
happy Hunting Grounds, unless he fights for the Con-&#xD;
federacy." The column then marched back to Madi&#xD;
sonville.&#xD;
My Chief of Staff reported a case of gross and dam-&#xD;
nable insubordination, which I resolved to punish in&#xD;
Confederate style, with the fullest extremity of military&#xD;
vengeance. A young and able-bodied man, only sixty&#xD;
years of age, living in the suburbs of the city of Madi-&#xD;
sonville, had disregarded the order to enlist, and had&#xD;
concealed himself in the woods, armed with a shot-gun,&#xD;
determined to die rather than take up arms against the&#xD;
United States. I immediately ordered my forces,&#xD;
white and Choctaw, to advance, and halted at the res-&#xD;
idence of the accursed Yankee. Dismounting, I en-&#xD;
tered the house, where I found a woman and five chil-&#xD;
dren. "Where," I demanded in tones of thunder,&#xD;
flourishing my sword, and stamping my foot, "where,&#xD;
woman, is thy Yankee husband ?"&#xD;
"Oh, sir !" said she, falling at my feet, and looking&#xD;
imploringly in my face, "for the love of Heaven, spare&#xD;
him ! He is old and feeble, and we shall starve with-&#xD;
out him. We are poor and hungry, and he is our only&#xD;
hope. Look upon my children, and pity us."&#xD;

"What are children to me, or I to children ?" I&#xD;
asked. "I am a C nfederate General, sworn to win&#xD;
innumerable battle with this shining sword, and to&#xD;
exterminate the whole vile race of detested Yankees.&#xD;
Your husband shall die ! He is a Yankee !"&#xD;
"He is not a Yankee," said the woman; "he was&#xD;
born and raised in Louisiana."&#xD;
"What do I care where he was born ?" I answered.&#xD;
"Every man who does not fall down and worship Jeff.&#xD;
Davis and the Southern Confederacy, and is not will-&#xD;
ing to leave wife.and children behind him to starve to&#xD;
death, for the sake of'Southern independence, the same&#xD;
is a Yankee, and shall suffer death ?" I then ordered&#xD;
the Choctaw Division to advance, with two blood-&#xD;
hounds thrown out in front, as skirmishers and detect-&#xD;
ives, and gave orders to bring the villain, alive if pos-&#xD;
sible, but dead, if necessary. The Division gave the&#xD;
Choctaw warwhoop and advanced at the double-quick,&#xD;
and the bloodhounds soon got on the scent. In a few&#xD;
hours the accursed villain was brought to my head-&#xD;
quarters, bleeding from wounds inflicted by my skir-&#xD;
mishers.&#xD;
"I am sold and feeble," he began to say, "and&#xD;
wholly unable to bear arms."&#xD;
"Silence !" I exclaimed. "Perhaps your benighted&#xD;
and besotted mind does not understand the great fun-&#xD;
damental principles of Confederate Justice, so beauti-&#xD;
fully illustrated in the official career of General Hind.&#xD;
man, who reprieved two men after they had been shot.&#xD;
It is a peculiarity in our system of jurisprudence, that&#xD;
we understand a case without asking any questions,&#xD;
and convict and punish a man without investigating&#xD;

his case. I have Confederate brains in my head, and&#xD;
it is as clear to me as the light which beams from the&#xD;
all-beholding sun, that you are a Yankee Abolitionist.&#xD;
You will, therefore, prepare for instant death."&#xD;
A gallows was erected in front of his house, and he&#xD;
was hung by the Choctaw Division, under my order.&#xD;
As an act of mercy, I permitted his wife and children&#xD;
to witness the execution.&#xD;
Thus, in a single day, did I raise and equip a Con-&#xD;
federate army, discipline them, put them on a war&#xD;
footing, and win two battles. I retired for the night,&#xD;
thankful for the success of my patriotic efforts, and&#xD;
panting for glory upon the field of carnage.&#xD;

MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
May 23, 1863.&#xD;
SiR:-Arousing from a dream, I looked up and saw&#xD;
a Midnight Assassin stealing into my room with fierce&#xD;
looks, and with a dagger in his hand, which he pur-&#xD;
posed to plunge into my vitals. This sight it was that&#xD;
harrowed up my soul, froze my young blood, made my&#xD;
two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, my knot-&#xD;
ted and combined locks to part, and each particular&#xD;
hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcu-&#xD;
pine !  "Is this a dagger which I see before me ?"    I&#xD;
exclaimed: "or art thou but a dagger of the mind; a&#xD;
false creation, proceeding   from   the rum-oppressed&#xD;
brain? Avaunt ! and quit my sight! Let the earth&#xD;
hide thee !"&#xD;
But the earth declined to do it, and tee stealthy&#xD;
Midnight Assassin, with murder in his heart and the&#xD;

instrument of death in his hand, stood over me, ready&#xD;
to perpetrate his crime of blood. "Such," I thought,&#xD;
"is the unhappy lot of greatness; to be exposed to the&#xD;
shafts of malignant envy, to be watched, hunted, fol-&#xD;
lowed, assassinated ! Oh that I were but an ordinary&#xD;
man ! Oh that nature had withholden from me the&#xD;
prolific gifts of Genius, and the masterly qualities of a&#xD;
military commander! Then I might have lived in&#xD;
quiet seclusion and peace; but now I must die the vic-&#xD;
tim of envied greatness !" It then occurred to me&#xD;
that as a great Confederate General, it might be proper&#xD;
to show fight, and die in heroic combat, falling with&#xD;
my face to the foe. "What man dares, I dare!" I&#xD;
exclaimed. "Approach thou like the rugged Russian&#xD;
Bear, the armed Rhinoceros, or the IIyrcan Tiger,&#xD;
and my firm nerves shall never tremble ! " As I said&#xD;
this, the cold perspiration stood upon my forehead. I&#xD;
then drew my Jeff. Davis revolver from under my&#xD;
head, and shot the villain dead on the spot!&#xD;
The moment I had committed this deed of homicide,&#xD;
my conscience reproved me, and trembling with fear,&#xD;
I wrapped my head up tight in the Confederate Blan-&#xD;
ket which always covers my martial couch. "I am,"&#xD;
I said, "a foul and unnatural murderer ; and if justice&#xD;
dwells in Madisonville, I shall be hung by the neck&#xD;
until I am dead !"&#xD;
Aurora at last mounted her golden chariot, and the&#xD;
light of morning shed its celestial lustre over the man-&#xD;
inhabiting earth. But I, overcome by a consciousness&#xD;
of guilty homicide, dared not look up for two hours.&#xD;
Then I was moved by a conviction of duty, and wish-&#xD;
ing to drill my army in Confederate tactics, I resolved&#xD;

to leap boldly from my couch, gaze indifferently upon&#xD;
the mangled remains of my victim, and deny all knowl-&#xD;
edge of the transaction. Therefore, hurling the per-&#xD;
spiration-besmeared blanket from my august person, I&#xD;
leaped from the bed and opened my eyes, to fix them&#xD;
on the dead corse of my red-handed homicide. But I&#xD;
discovered that nobody was hurt. There was, how-&#xD;
ever, a distinct bullet-hole in my Gray Confederate&#xD;
breeches, that were hanging on a chair at the foot of&#xD;
the bed; and these I had mistaken and shot for a Mid-&#xD;
night Assassin.&#xD;
The Madieonville Congo Guards.&#xD;
Therefore, I determined to conscript all niggers&#xD;
between the ages of nine and one hundred, within five&#xD;
miles of Madisonville, and issued orders to that effect.&#xD;
But the vile darkies did not heed my commands, and&#xD;
I therefore deployed the buzz-saw Division as skir-&#xD;
mishers, with orders to fetch in every nigger that&#xD;
could be found. Ten of them were captured and&#xD;
brought to my headquarters; whereupon I proceeded&#xD;
to address them in a very able and patriotic manner,&#xD;
both upon the destiny of articulate-speaking men, and&#xD;
the duty of Confederate soldiers in the field, with the&#xD;
hope of instilling into their besotted intellects, some&#xD;
gleamings of the lofty and humane philosophy of tho&#xD;
Confederacy.&#xD;
"You damned niggers!" I said; "you are about to&#xD;
be enrolled as Confederate soldiers, under the laws of&#xD;
Louisiana, and in accordance with the proclamation of&#xD;
Governor Moore. This is the highest honor that could&#xD;

be bestowed even upon a white man, and for you to&#xD;
receive it is a blessing so vast and incomprehensible&#xD;
that none but a Mamnoth Brain can understand the&#xD;
full and imperishable felicity that has descended into&#xD;
your black souls. But you will please understand that&#xD;
tis is not a compliment to you personally, but to the&#xD;
Confederacy which you represent; and you will also&#xD;
comprehend distinctly that you are not human beings&#xD;
at all, and that the design of the Infinite was'that you&#xD;
should be slaves and wild beasts forever. The Con-&#xD;
federacy is based upon this divine law of nature, which&#xD;
made the Confederacy to boss and abuse niggers and&#xD;
keep them on a perfect equality with Confederate&#xD;
mules. You are the connecting link between man'&#xD;
and the monkey, and differ from the Orang-)utang&#xD;
only in the gift of speech. This was given you by the&#xD;
Almighty, in order that you might better serve your'&#xD;
masters ; for everybody must admit that a dumb nig-r&#xD;
ger will not bring as high a price in the market as&#xD;
those that can utter speech. Vice President Stephens&#xD;
has nobly said that niggers are the corner-stone of they&#xD;
Confederacy, and this I wish to impress upon your&#xD;
debased and idiotic minds. Your heels are long andF&#xD;
your shins tender, and that proves the truth of Judgoe&#xD;
Taney's declaration, that you haven't any rights that&#xD;
white men ought to respect. The Lord cursed Ham,&#xD;
and the ham was smoked. Therefore you are blackI&#xD;
damn you! and must be enslaved by the Confederates&#xD;
for evermore.  I can prove it by the Confederate&#xD;
Bible ; for the theology of the Confederacy, as I&#xD;
showed in my celebrated sermon from   the words,&#xD;
'Blow ye,' permits true believers to strike out any pas-&#xD;
&#xD;
ADDRESS TO THE CONGO GUARDS.      129&#xD;
sage of Scripture they don't like, and to put in any&#xD;
thing they'd like to have there.&#xD;
"Therefore it is that the Confederate Theology is&#xD;
superior to every other. You can prove any thing&#xD;
you want to by it, or you can confound every theory&#xD;
ever started or adopted by mortal man. The Confed-&#xD;
erate Bible is on a par with the Confederate Arithme-&#xD;
tie, and I am the author of both. Therefore, let no&#xD;
nigger dispute my words, for I can prove every thing&#xD;
I say. You are niggers, and niggers are not men, and&#xD;
it is now your glorious privilege to fight for these di-&#xD;
vine principles of the Southern Confederacy-princi-&#xD;
ples founded upon the great and everlasting law of&#xD;
Confederate veracity."&#xD;
The effect of this splendid oration upon those to&#xD;
whom it was addressed, was, indeed, like magic. The&#xD;
bold declarations of truth smote upon their heathenish&#xD;
and bestial intellects, and inspired them with overpow-&#xD;
ering and matchless zeal for Southern Independence.&#xD;
They gave five hundred cheers for the Confederacy,&#xD;
and six hundred for me, and threw their hats a thou-&#xD;
sand feet in the air by Confederate measurement, while&#xD;
the biggest nigger, grinning from ear to ear, struck up&#xD;
the Old John Brown song, the whole Congo Division&#xD;
joining in the chorus: "Glory, glory, hallelujah !"&#xD;
Immediately the spirit of prophecy and of poesy de-&#xD;
scended upon me, and I composed a Confederate war-&#xD;
song, to be sung on all occasions, as follows:&#xD;

NOTE.-On the 30th of April, 1803, an order was published by Major&#xD;
General Banks, requiring all registered enemies of the United States&#xD;
to leave the Department of the Gulf, on or before the fifteenth day&#xD;
of the next month. As no one could sail for any port in the United&#xD;
States or a foreign country without taking the oath of allegiance to the&#xD;
United States,_the registered enemies were compelled to go over to the&#xD;
-Confederacy," for which they had professed such a profound rever-&#xD;
ence and love. So long as they were forbidden to go, they were loud&#xD;
in their complaints that the cruel and despotic government should&#xD;
prevent them from joining their friends; but when they were or-&#xD;
dered to go, all their zeal disappeared, and they were equally loud in&#xD;
their complaints that the cruel and despotic government should com-&#xD;
pel them to go. When the time of their departure actually arrived,&#xD;
they presented a melancholy spectacle ; a more dejected set of wretches&#xD;
was never seen. To add to their grief, as soon as they arrived in&#xD;
Mobile, the able-bodied men were forced to join the rebel army. The&#xD;
order sending them out of the Department was received with great&#xD;
exultation by the Union citizens of New Orleans; for some of these&#xD;
registered enemies had become very insolent, under the lenity that&#xD;
permitted them to remain in the city. Many of them had registered&#xD;
their names as enemies of the United States, in order to make them-&#xD;
selves popular with the secessionists, and without any expectation&#xD;
that they would ever be compelled to leave the I)epartment. And&#xD;
when they found that the tact of being registered enemies in-&#xD;
volved the necessity of going away, and, as was the case with many,&#xD;
of leaving home, fIanily, and kimdred behind them, perhaps forever,&#xD;
the romance all melted into thin air, and they discovered that a sen-&#xD;
timental attachment for the land of Jeff. Davis, which could be cher-&#xD;
ished in security at a distance, was quite a different matter when it&#xD;
exiled them from the coulfirts and pleasures of civilised life.&#xD;

MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
May 30th, 1808.&#xD;
S1R :-A Macedonian cry came to me as in my dilap-&#xD;
idated hospitable abode I meditated schemes of blood-&#xD;
shed and revenge. It came from New Orleans, from a&#xD;
Registered Enemy, and said : "What shall I do? Come&#xD;
over and help me&#xD;
Arriving in New Orleans, I immediately called upon&#xD;
the Macedonian, and with him forthwith went down to&#xD;
Lakeport to witness the departure of the first regular&#xD;
load of Registered Enemies. "        I said, "there&#xD;
will b° a grand secession demonstration, exceeding that&#xD;
on the levee, when the women turned out en masse to&#xD;
kiss the departing Confederate prisoners. I will sm-&#xD;
mon the people to arms, raise a revolt, capture New&#xD;
Orleans, and add it to the Department of Madisonville !"&#xD;
But when I arrived at the point of embarkation my&#xD;
soul and face became swollen with Confederate indig.&#xD;
nation. For instead of a grand secesh demonstration&#xD;
I only found a small crowd of weeping women and&#xD;
wailing children, who said they wished their husbands&#xD;
and fathers had taken the oath of allegiance to the&#xD;
United States, instead of running off to the Confederacy&#xD;
and leaving them to starve alone.&#xD;
"Stop such treasonable talk as that !" I shouted in&#xD;
tones of Confederate : thunder. "Every person who&#xD;
utters a sentiment favorable to the Union, will have his&#xD;
name written down, and he shall be hung when the&#xD;
Confederates come here 1"&#xD;
"What has the United States done so bad ?" asked a&#xD;
woman who was weeping in a base and cowardly man-&#xD;
ner at' the departure of her husband. "Did we not&#xD;

live together in peace and plenty before the South&#xD;
seceded ? What wickedness did the United States&#xD;
commit ?"&#xD;
"It robbed us of eternal rights," I answered.&#xD;
"Is it not the eternal right of a wife to be protected&#xD;
by her husband, and to have her children fed and cared&#xD;
for by their father ?" asked she, in a violent flood of&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Base, cowardly woman !" I exclaimed ; "the great&#xD;
light of Confederate Science has never pierced your&#xD;
weak and debased intellect. Women and children,&#xD;
food and raiment, are nothing beside Southern Inde-&#xD;
pendence. Were it not for the rebellion, would I ever&#xD;
have been a Major General? No ! Would Jeff. Davis&#xD;
have been a President? No! Would My Idiotic Boy&#xD;
have been Chief of Staff, or the Honest Jew a Quarter-&#xD;
master? No ! Such, madame, are the happy fruits of&#xD;
rebellion. What to me are weeping women and starv-&#xD;
ing children ?-what desolate firesides and blasted fields?&#xD;
-what trenches of buried soldiers and plantations gone&#xD;
to waste? Nothing ! These are the price of Confed-&#xD;
erate shoulder-straps and. civic crowns. What though&#xD;
they are stained in innocent blood and bathed in wom-&#xD;
an's tears? They glitter all the same, and glory still&#xD;
summons the Confederate Warrior to the field ! Starve,&#xD;
for ought I care ! The more that starve, the less there&#xD;
will be to feed on the next crop !"&#xD;
"You are an unfeeling brute !" sobbed the woman.&#xD;
"Madame," I replied, drawing myself up to my full&#xD;
height, and smiting my breast with great dignity ;&#xD;
"madame, if my position does not protect me from in-&#xD;
sult, my sex at least should be respected !"&#xD;

I then turned away with an air of justly offended&#xD;
pride, and turned, my eyes upon the black ship, about&#xD;
to depart for the lovely shores of my native land. I&#xD;
expected to see countenances gleaming with joy and&#xD;
patriotic pride. "These true and devoted friends of&#xD;
the Confederacy," I said, "have filled the earth with&#xD;
their moans, to be allowed to come to us, when they&#xD;
knew they couldn't ; and now that they are at last al-&#xD;
lowed to come to our sweet land of cotton and inde-&#xD;
pendence, their faces will glow with unspeakable de-&#xD;
light !" Imagine my burning wrath, when instead of&#xD;
this, I saw a pack of the most dejected devils that my&#xD;
eyes ever rested upon. One was looking at his wife&#xD;
and children with streaming eyes, and asking in a low&#xD;
moan if it was too late to take the Oath of Allegiance.&#xD;
"Too late !" replied a Yankee Demon. Then the&#xD;
Registered Enemy smote his forehead with his hand,&#xD;
and said he had made a damned fool of himself, to&#xD;
which the Yankee Demon nodded assent.&#xD;
"Beloved Confederates !" I said, addressing them&#xD;
from the shore; "as the Children of Israel, represented&#xD;
in Madisonville by the Honest Jew, wandered for forty&#xD;
years in the Wilderness, but at last found the happy&#xD;
land of Canaan, so have you, while twelve times the&#xD;
Moon hath filled her horn; borne with meek patience&#xD;
the unsufferable and loathsome bondage of the United&#xD;
States, sighing for the happiness of the Confederacy.&#xD;
But now the long night of your vassalage has been dis-&#xD;
pelled by the brilliant splendor of the rising Confederate&#xD;
Sun, and you are about to plant your weary feet in&#xD;
Madisonville, a land that flows with milk and honey,&#xD;
where the butchery of the Yankee Demons cannot dis-&#xD;

S ears and Bars will stand between you and all harm."&#xD;
Even this eloquence did not arouse their stupid souls,&#xD;
and I turned away in disgust, reluctantly concluding&#xD;
that the Registered Enemies were a lot of blockheads.&#xD;
I immediately started for Madisonville on my Con-&#xD;
federate Mule, in order to get there before the Regis-&#xD;
tered Enemies reported at my headquarters.&#xD;
Afacpherson meets the honest Jew.&#xD;
As I was going hurriedly home, I saw a man in the&#xD;
woods tucking rolls of paper into the trunk of a hollow&#xD;
tree. A pproaching him stealthily, I was astonished to&#xD;
recognize in him my integrity-loving friend and Con-&#xD;
federate co-laborer, the honest Jew. Wishing to give&#xD;
him a pleasant surprise, I caught him violently by the&#xD;
collar and planted my right foot stoutly against his&#xD;
shin1s, beoic he was aware of mily presence.&#xD;
lie lumped eight feet in the air, and struck the&#xD;
grond(, looking pale as a corpse, exclaiming with fero-&#xD;
clous earnestness:&#xD;
"I no steal 'em! I pe berfectly innocent !-berfectly&#xD;
innocent !"&#xD;
"iMy innocent and outraged friend !" I replied, " of&#xD;
course you are innocent. Who accused you of stealing ?"&#xD;
"Gott i  hiinmel !" shouted the Honest Jew; "I&#xD;
taut you pe van tam tief and robber. Inow know you&#xD;
pe mine tear Sheneral." We then clasped each other&#xD;
in a tender, loving embrace, until our bosoms were&#xD;
bathed in tears of mutual love.&#xD;
"A pleasant surprise, my dear," I said.&#xD;
&#xD;
16)&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, yah, vun sehr tam bleasant surbrise," he an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
"What have you here ?" I asked, approaching the&#xD;
tree.&#xD;
"Noting, noting at all," he answered.&#xD;
"Then there can be no harm if I look at nothing," I&#xD;
answered, and then proceeded to examine the tree,&#xD;
when I discovered several very large rolls of Confed,&#xD;
erate treasury notes. "Sweet disciple of Moses," I&#xD;
said, "whence and for whom this vast treasure ?"&#xD;
"Mine !" he cried, while a look of agony passed over&#xD;
his features.&#xD;
"Sir !" I said, "you are a swindler and thief! I am&#xD;
your superior officer, and I swear that unless you divide&#xD;
with me justly and fairly, I will hang you, and expose&#xD;
to the world your infamous crimes !"&#xD;
The Ionest Jew then swore lie always intended to&#xD;
divide with me, and that he hid the bills only as a&#xD;
means of security. I then asked him how he had man-&#xD;
aged to accumulate such vast wealth.&#xD;
"I sells the glothing and horses," he replied. I then&#xD;
learned that, after conscripting an army, the Honest&#xD;
Jew had drawn clothing and horses from the Govern-&#xD;
ment, and that he had sold the clothing to the soldiers&#xD;
and the horses to the highest bidder, and that the&#xD;
money in the tree was the fruit of this scheme, alike&#xD;
creditable to his head and heart.&#xD;
"Nothing," I remarked, "but an equal distribution&#xD;
of the proceeds, could have reconciled me to this ahni-&#xD;
rable trick. Come once more to my bosom "&#xD;
"I make you very rich in five tays," said the Honest&#xD;
Jew.&#xD;

.,&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
"how," I asked.&#xD;
"You vait for the Registered Enemies," he answered.&#xD;
Arriving at Headquarters, I found that great numbers&#xD;
of Registered Enemies had arrived and were arriving&#xD;
from New Orleans, and thereupon I immediately issued&#xD;
an order on the subject, as follows:&#xD;
HEADQUARTERS,&#xD;
DEPARTMENT OF MADISONVILLE,&#xD;
Madisonville, La., May 28th, 1863.&#xD;
General Order No. 3.&#xD;
Whereas, it has come to the knowledge of the Major-General&#xD;
commanding this Department, that certain and numerous persons,&#xD;
pretending to be Registered Enemies of the United States have&#xD;
nriived within the limits of his command from New Orleans, it&#xD;
is therefore ordered: That all the Registered Male Enemies of the&#xD;
United States coming to these shores, not over one hundred years&#xD;
of age, shall be immediately conscripted and enrolled as a part of&#xD;
the military force of this Department ; unless they shall pay over&#xD;
to the Chief Quartermaster the sum of one thousand dollars, in&#xD;
which ease they shall be exempt from the draft.&#xD;
By order of Mason GENERAL JAMES B. MAOPIIERSON.&#xD;
THE IDIOTI Boy, Chief of Staff.&#xD;
The first Registered Enemy who reported himself at&#xD;
Headquarters was the Macedonian, who came with a&#xD;
smiling face, and, slapping me on the shoulder, said:&#xD;
"Our relations have been so pleasant heretofore, that I&#xD;
shall find in your sweet society full compensation for&#xD;
the sacrifice I make in leaving my native land." But&#xD;
I put on a look of offended dignity, and inquired who it&#xD;
was that presumed to make himself so familiar ! I then&#xD;
handed him a copy of the above order, and he turned&#xD;
pale as a ghost when he read it.  However, he paid one&#xD;
thousand dollars to the honest Jew. In all five hundred&#xD;
&#xD;
men paid their thousand dollars, which made the hand-&#xD;
some sum of five hundred thousand dollars to be equally&#xD;
divided between theIIonest Jew and myself. I then&#xD;
issued the following:&#xD;
HEADQUARTERS,&#xD;
DEPARTMENT OF MADISONVILLE,&#xD;
Madisonville, La., May 29th, 1863.&#xD;
General Order No. 4.&#xD;
So much of General Order No. 3, as relates to the Exemption&#xD;
of Registered Enemies from the operation of the Conscript law&#xD;
on payment of one thousand dollars, is hereby rescinded; and all&#xD;
Registered Enemies, without exception, will immediately report&#xD;
armed and equipped for military service, the same as though the&#xD;
said sum had never been paid.&#xD;
By order of MAJon GENERAL JAMES B. MACPILERSON.&#xD;
THE IDIoTIC Boy, Chief of Staff.&#xD;
"By wha4 code of justice is it," inquired the Mace-&#xD;
donian, "that, after taking our money on promise of&#xD;
exemption, you conpel'"us to enter the service ?"&#xD;
"By the code of Confederate justice," I replied:&#xD;
"the same principle that is in force in New Orleans,&#xD;
which compels negro property-holders to pay taxes for&#xD;
the support of schools, and then forbids them to send&#xD;
their children to school; and the same principle by&#xD;
which John C. Breckinridge, sitting in the Senate of&#xD;
the United States, and drawing his salary from the&#xD;
United States treasury, plotted and toiled-for the down-&#xD;
fall of the Union, and the up-building of the Southern&#xD;
Confederacy,"&#xD;
Settlement with the honest Jew.&#xD;
At midnight, in my guarded tent, I summoned the&#xD;
Honest Jew to my presence, and told him we had&#xD;

made a million dollars, and it was time to divide. I&#xD;
therefore ordered him to settle immediately, and to&#xD;
pay over to me one-half the profits, in accordance&#xD;
with the bargain fairly agreed to by both parties.&#xD;
"Show me your receipts," said the Jew; "I can bay&#xD;
no monish mitout receipts to show I owe it !"&#xD;
"Loathsome and disgusting reptile!"  I exclaimed,&#xD;
"is it thus you trifle with pecuniary rights and eternal&#xD;
justice? Is it thus you seek to subvert the principles&#xD;
of Confederate veracity, and uproot the very founda-&#xD;
tions of society? Can you expect to rob the Confed-&#xD;
eracy and its loyal subjects with impunity, and not&#xD;
divide the profits with your Commanding General ! I&#xD;
will show you that it cannot be done. For half thy&#xD;
wealth, it is Macpherson's ; the other half comes to the&#xD;
general State which I represent, and so I'll take the&#xD;
whole."&#xD;
"Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that ;" re-&#xD;
plied the honest Jew, " you take my house when you&#xD;
do take the prop that doth sustain my house; you take&#xD;
my life when you do take the means whereby I live."&#xD;
ringig hither the cash and abjure thy vile faith,&#xD;
and thou shalt live and have half," I said.&#xD;
" Yah," replied the honest Jew, " I do that mit time.&#xD;
1 goes now and pring you the monish."&#xD;
lie then started off to bring to my tent the treasure;&#xD;
and I lay congratulating myself that I had made half&#xD;
a million dollars, and converted a Jew to the true faith.&#xD;
13ut hour after hour passed, and the Honest Jew did&#xD;
not return. Two o'elock, three o'clock, four o'clock,&#xD;
daylight, and no welcome Mosaic footstep came to&#xD;
cheer me in my waiting loneliness.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Oh Honest Jew!" I cried in my distress, "what&#xD;
evil hath befallen thee? Oh whither hast thou wan-&#xD;
dered? Did thy pious youthful feet go astray in the&#xD;
woods?"   I then hastened to the hollow tree, hoping&#xD;
at least to find the treasure, even if I could not once&#xD;
more clasp the Honest Jew to my bosom in a loving&#xD;
embrace. But imagine my grief, terror, rage, when I&#xD;
discovered that the vile villain had gobbled up all the&#xD;
money and skedaddled to distant and unknown places,&#xD;
leaving me once more to groan and moan in honest&#xD;
poverty, the victim of loathsome and disgusting ras-&#xD;

MACPHERSON DRINKING HEMLOCK.      143&#xD;
abode, in Madisonville, at the solemn hour of mid-&#xD;
night, last Monday, being the six hundred and sixtieth&#xD;
Olympiad and the third year thereof, and the year 3 of&#xD;
the Southern Confederacy.&#xD;
The cause of his death is melancholy beyond de-&#xD;
scription. He did not fall in battle, as was his ardent&#xD;
desire, at the head of his invincible legions, dealing&#xD;
death and destruction among vile Yankee foes ; but he&#xD;
fell a victim. to his own hands. In a word, he com-&#xD;
mitted suicide. Calling his Idiotic Boy to his side, he&#xD;
exclaimed :&#xD;
"Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw,&#xD;
and resolve itself into a dew! or that the Everlasting&#xD;
had not fixed his canon 'gainst self-slaughter! Now&#xD;
indeed I fear the avenging wrath of the offended gods&#xD;
of Olympus. But if I would reach the Elysian Fields,&#xD;
where dwells the soul of the great Achilles, I must die&#xD;
at once, like Socrates, the Philosopher, by drinking&#xD;
poisonous hemlock!"&#xD;
Having announced his determination, his family and&#xD;
his staff in vain gathered around him with tears, striv-&#xD;
ing to win him from his fatal purpose. They pointed&#xD;
out to him the deadly stroke the Confederacy would&#xD;
suffer ; the pallor with which Philosophy and Reli-&#xD;
gion would hear of his death ; the inconsolable tears of&#xD;
his wife and staff; the exultation of the Yankee De-&#xD;
non, and the honest grief of THE ERA. But all in&#xD;
vain. "I love the Confederacy with intense and pas-&#xD;
sionate love," he answered, "but the will of the gods&#xD;
and the Voice of Oracular Fate must be obeyed1"&#xD;
He then ordered the hemlock to be brought to him in&#xD;
a five-gallon demijohn, and calmly entered upon the&#xD;

business of preparation for his journey across the Styx,&#xD;
-or to quote from his own beautiful words, for "the&#xD;
coming of that solemn hour, when neither worldly&#xD;
pomiip, nor martial renown, nor yet the brave love of&#xD;
the Confederacy which pervades every impulse of my&#xD;
soul, and every throb of my heart, can stay my foot-&#xD;
steps in the last pilgrimage to the realms of Pluto."&#xD;
3faepersom's Will.&#xD;
lie then took four drinks of the hemlock, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded to make his will, with all the calmness and dig-&#xD;
nity of Confederate greatness.&#xD;
To my faithful and beloved wife," lie said, " I give&#xD;
and bequeath my dilapidated hospitable abode, and&#xD;
all it contains; to my Idiotic Boy, the mantle of Phi.&#xD;
losophy and the management of Confederate Policy; to&#xD;
my staff I give my sword and uniform, and it is my&#xD;
wish that after my death they shall contend for it in&#xD;
single combat, as Ulysses and Telamonian Ajax con-&#xD;
tended for the armor of divine Achilles; and to the&#xD;
combatants for the splendid prize, I say in the words&#xD;
of man-smiting Heenan, may the best man win!&#xD;
"To the Noble Woman and the ladies. of New&#xD;
Orleans, I leave the task of fanning and keeping alive&#xD;
the fires of treason in the Yankee-oppressed Crescent&#xD;
City."&#xD;
Having made the above disposition of his worldly&#xD;
affairs, lie took four drinks of the hemlock, and re-&#xD;
marked that the working of the Mammoth Brain would&#xD;
cease the moment the working of the fatal hemlock&#xD;
began.&#xD;
&#xD;
"To the Unhappy Cuss," he said, "I leave the ar-&#xD;
rangements for the funeral. I wish to be buried with&#xD;
military honors worthy of my rank and name. I wish&#xD;
to have my funeral modelled on that of Alexander the&#xD;
Great, a warrior whose fame was only surpassed by my&#xD;
own. In the third Section of the sixteenth Book of&#xD;
Rollin's History, you will find an account of the cer-&#xD;
emonies performed at the interment of the Conqueror&#xD;
of the World; and I wish those performances to be&#xD;
carried out to the letter, over my own remains."&#xD;
At this stage of the solemn scene, there was a loud&#xD;
wail heard in the door, and looking aro ilthere was&#xD;
seen the Honest Jew, pale and haggard, and bathed&#xD;
with tears. He fell upon the floor, rolled over, threw&#xD;
himself upon the neck of the expiring" Philosopher,&#xD;
tore his hair, and asked to be forgiven.&#xD;
"To err is human-to forgive divine !" answered the&#xD;
dying General. "Your arrival is most opportune, for&#xD;
the treasury is empty and the preparations for my&#xD;
funeral will involve an immense outlay. Promise to&#xD;
defray these expenses, and I will forgive you all."&#xD;
"I bromise," said the Honest Jew; and then the&#xD;
two great men, happily reconciled,.embraced with&#xD;
touching affection.&#xD;
"It has been the great purpose of my life," said the&#xD;
expiring Warrior, " to re-establish in all its glory the&#xD;
worship of the Olympian gods; for the pagan religion&#xD;
alone, with such additions as I have made, is fitted to&#xD;
the demands of the Confederacy. But I am cut off by&#xD;
Fate in the midst of my labors, and I desire to be&#xD;
buried after the manner of the Greeks and Romans."&#xD;
Midnight at last cast the shadow of deepest gloom&#xD;

over the face of universal nature. The great Macpher-&#xD;
son had now nearly emptied the demijohn, and' all felt&#xD;
conscious that the fatal hemlock must soon do its hor-&#xD;
rible work. Suddenly he gave a wild groan, and, rising&#xD;
in his couch, smote his breast and spake his last words,&#xD;
as follows:&#xD;
Last Words qf Ifaeplerson.&#xD;
"The long day has passed," he exclaimed ; "the&#xD;
long night is come! O Jupiter! thou great father of&#xD;
gods and men, the most high and powerful among the&#xD;
immortals, whom all others obey ! avenge the wrongs&#xD;
of the Confederacy, and smite the Yankees with the&#xD;
bolts of thy thunder! Farewell, brave Staff ! Carry&#xD;
out the policy which I have inaugurated, imitate my&#xD;
valor, and always buy your hats of Stapleton, 95&#xD;
Canal-street."&#xD;
A cold sweat then stood upon his intellectual brow;&#xD;
the eyes became fixed, the lips ceased to move, and&#xD;
JAMES B. MACPHERSON, the great light of Confederate&#xD;
letters, the favorite of the ladies of New Orleans, ceased&#xD;
to breathe the vital air.&#xD;
We have the authority of the Southern Source, a&#xD;
member of his staff, for saying that prodigies of na-&#xD;
ture attended the departure of the valorous chieftain to&#xD;
the realms of Pluto. He informs us that cloud-com-&#xD;
pelling Jove, at the moment of dissolution, hurled a&#xD;
living bolt of thunder from Mount Olympus, which&#xD;
smashed the five-gallon demijohn, that had held the&#xD;
impious poison, into a thousand atoms, and tore the&#xD;

other members of General Macpherson's staff, for the&#xD;
particulars of his death. The great Philosopher and&#xD;
hero who has departed, has often reminded our readers&#xD;
that man is mortal, and that earthly greatness soon&#xD;
vanishes, like the dews in the sunshine of the unclouded&#xD;
heaven. Let each take the lesson home, remembering&#xD;
that even the Mammoth Brain of Macpherson had to&#xD;
succumb to the power with which earth's greatest men&#xD;
have contended in vain. There is no fountain of per-&#xD;
petual youth, even in the Southern Confederacy, nor&#xD;
yet in Madisonville, a place which Macpherson assured&#xD;
us flows with milk and honey !&#xD;

HE WAS NOT DEAD, ONLY DEAD DRUNK.-HIIS METHOD OF&#xD;
PAYING DEBTS.-IIE     MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE&#xD;
RELIABLE GENTLEMAN, ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NoTE.--During the siege of Port Hudson, New Orleans was daily&#xD;
filled with rumors of disasters to the army, of General Banks, which&#xD;
were industriously circulated by the secessionists. Men apparently&#xD;
made it their principal business to lounge around the St. Charles Hotel,&#xD;
and to retail these unfounded reports. Every statement made by the&#xD;
"Reliable Gentleman" in his conversation with Macpherson, the&#xD;
author himself head at different times in that building. The noise&#xD;
made by piling wood on the levee was, on one occasion, mistaken for&#xD;
the roar of artillery by some negroes ; and from this incident arose a&#xD;
report of a disastrous repulse of our army.--Macpherson was re-&#xD;
suscitated in obedience to what appeared to be a very general demand&#xD;
on the part of the readers of IHE ERA.  The Registered Enemies&#xD;
who went from New' Orleans to Mobile, carried most astounding&#xD;
news. On their statements one of the Mobile papers issued an extra&#xD;
announcing that New Orleans had been captured by the Confederates&#xD;
under Magruder, who immediately started for Forts Jackson and St.&#xD;
Philip with a force of fifteen thousand men.  It may be proper, in&#xD;
this connection, to state that during the siege of Port Hudson, a for-&#xD;
midable force of Texans advanced into Western Louisiana, with the&#xD;
intention of taking the fort at Donaldsonville (a village about eighty&#xD;
miles above New Orleans), cutting off the supplies of General Banks,&#xD;
seizing all the vessels that could be found, crossing the river and&#xD;
making a descent upon New Orleans. This force was variously esti-&#xD;
mated at ten thousand to eighteen thousand men. The plans of the&#xD;
rebels were frustrated by two serious defeats-one at Lafourcho&#xD;
Crossing, and the other at Donaldsonville. The defense of the fort&#xD;
at the latter place was one of the most brilliant of the war. The&#xD;
garrison consisted of about a hundred and fifty men, under command&#xD;
of Major Bullen, and many of these were convalescents. The attack-&#xD;
ing force, under General Greene, consisted of an entire brigade. The&#xD;
gunboat Princess Royal, under Commander Wolsey, checked the ad-&#xD;
vance of the enemy. A desperate hand-to-hand fight occurred, the&#xD;

THE MACPHERSON LETTER  .&#xD;
&#xD;
enemy advancing to the parapet. A hundred and twenty rebel pris-&#xD;
oners were actually captured by the garrison, inside the works.&#xD;
About a hundred of the enemy's dead were buried by our soldiers ;&#xD;
and the rebel loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners was about four&#xD;
times as large as the entire force defending the place. Our loss was&#xD;
inconsiderable. The fight at Lafourche Crossing was also a brilliant&#xD;
affair. There were, in fact, two engagements, in both of which the&#xD;
enemy was repulsed with severe lows. Colonel Cahill and Colonel&#xD;
Stickney gained great credit in the successful defense of the place.&#xD;
General Emory was at that time in command of the defenses of New&#xD;
Orleans, and no-officer could have performed his duties more vigilant-&#xD;
ly or faithfully. The capture of Brashear City, and the erection of&#xD;
rebel batteries on the river, threatened to sever all communication with&#xD;
General Banks's forces at Port Hudson, and New Orleans itself was&#xD;
menaced. Tph e secessionists were in constant expectation of the ar-&#xD;
rival of a rebel army, for many days ; and the Union citizens, as well&#xD;
as the officers in conmnand, were not certain their expectation would&#xD;
not be realised. General Shepley, Military Governor of the State, called&#xD;
upon the people to rally for the defense of their homes, and formed a&#xD;
brigade for sixty days' service. General Emory called for negro volun.&#xD;
teers, and two regiments were promptly raised  The author has&#xD;
deemed it propel to make these explanations, in order to show the&#xD;
reader what a fruitful field New Orleans presented, in those days, for&#xD;
"Reliable Gentlemen" and "Intelligent Contrabands."&#xD;
MADISo)vLIE, L.A,&#xD;
June 27th, 1863.&#xD;
SIR :-I died in the consoling faith that I was the&#xD;
Biggest Liar in the Southern Confederacy ; but 'after&#xD;
the arrival of the Registered Enemies in Alabama, I&#xD;
found they were going so far ahead of'me in that line,&#xD;
that I should have to rise from my grave and vindicate&#xD;
my noble reputation by the invention of more sublime&#xD;
falsehoods than ever before graced my able produc-&#xD;
tions. In truth, the mendacious stories those unhappy&#xD;
exiles spread in the streets of Mobile actually made my&#xD;
bones rattle in their coffin ; and I came forth like that&#xD;
mythological giant whose name I have forgotten ; but&#xD;
who, smitten to the earth, always arose with renewed&#xD;
&#xD;
NOT DEAD-ONLY DEAD DRUNK.&#xD;
&#xD;
151&#xD;
&#xD;
strength; and I will now tell such astounding lies as&#xD;
shall cause the Yankees to howl and the Confederacy&#xD;
go mad in the ecstasies of biss !&#xD;
An account of my death and burial has been pub-&#xD;
lished, and a Latin inscription placed on my tomb, so&#xD;
ponderous and incomprehensible that all hope of resus-&#xD;
citation seemed to be at an end. It was given out that&#xD;
I had committed self-slaughter, by drinking poisonous&#xD;
hemlock from a'five-gallon demijohn. But the truth&#xD;
is I was not dead, but only dead drunk, and the hem-&#xD;
lock was only ordinary Louisiana Rum.&#xD;
Alexander the Great drank the health of his friend&#xD;
Proteas in the Cup of Hercules, a Dutch Lager Beer&#xD;
arrangement, that held six bottles. He pledged his&#xD;
friend the second time in this enormous bumper, and&#xD;
immediately fell flat and died. Socrates, the greatest&#xD;
philosopher of the Greeks, as I am of the Confederates,&#xD;
took one swig of hemlock, and expired. In order to&#xD;
show myself superior to both of these, I drank the five&#xD;
gallons of Louisiana Lum, convinced that it is more&#xD;
fatal than the liquid consumed by Alexander, or the&#xD;
hemlock imbibed by Socrates. But I played dead to&#xD;
see what the newspapers would sy about me, and&#xD;
what action would be taken by the Confederate Gov-&#xD;
ernment.&#xD;
IMuch to my astonishment, the Yankee EnA was the&#xD;
only paper in New Orleans that paid any attention&#xD;
whatever to my death. The others had been profuse&#xD;
in their tears over Stonewall Jackson ; they had made&#xD;
themselves and their readers perfectly miserable over&#xD;
every two-penny Confederate hero who got killed or&#xD;
drank himself to death ; but when I, who had always&#xD;

praised them-I, who had been the champion of their&#xD;
creed, and lied on the same side-I, Macpherson, the&#xD;
great and shining light of the Confederacy, the Invin-&#xD;
cible Warrior and the most magnificent Blower the&#xD;
Confederate Sun ever shone upon in all his course-f&#xD;
say, when I, greater and wiser than all, was supposed to&#xD;
be dead and gone to my grave, they had not a tear to&#xD;
shed for me; not a black column-rule with which to&#xD;
express an emotion of grief; not even a line among the&#xD;
editorial notices of auction sales and health-restoring&#xD;
patent pills, to announce the destruction of my noble&#xD;
mind, and the overthrow of the greatest Intellect that&#xD;
the world has ever known. Then it was I found how&#xD;
sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a cussed&#xD;
fool for a friend.&#xD;
23acpherson comes forth.&#xD;
Wednesday evening, June 17th, in the third year. of&#xD;
Confederate Independence, was the anniversary of the&#xD;
Yankee battle of Bunker Hill, where the ragged&#xD;
American militia clinched boldly with the British&#xD;
Regulars. The pale new moon presented the faintest&#xD;
possible crescent outline of beautiful silver, sinking&#xD;
into the boundless expanse of Western Louisiana, when&#xD;
I arose in all the habiliments with which the Honest&#xD;
Jew had clothed me, and proceeded to my D. H. A.&#xD;
(said initials being a classical abbreviation for my&#xD;
Dilapidated Hospitable Abode).&#xD;
As I entered that renowned mansion, more famous&#xD;
than the White House at Washington, or the Pewter&#xD;
Mug of New York, the Idiotic Boy fell fiat on the&#xD;
&#xD;
floor, overcome with strange unearthly fear, and cried&#xD;
aloud: "Tell me why thy canonised bones, hearsed in&#xD;
death, have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre&#xD;
wherein we saw thee quietly inurned, hath oped his&#xD;
ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again !&#xD;
What may this mean, that thou, dread corse, again in&#xD;
complete steel, revisitest thus the glimpses of the moon,&#xD;
making night hideous?"&#xD;
"Dry up!" I replied, at the same time hitting him&#xD;
in the chops, and loudly demanding a drink of gin.&#xD;
.Miacpherson pays his Debts by a General Order.&#xD;
I found a vast number of bills from all quarters, and&#xD;
claimants immediately besieged my dwelling, demand-&#xD;
ing instant payment. In the first place, there was the&#xD;
Confederate tailor, with a bill of $18,000 for my outfit&#xD;
as a Major General, who said his family was starving,&#xD;
and nothing but proml1pt liquidation would save them&#xD;
and him from famine.&#xD;
"Prompt liquidation is my rule," I replied, and&#xD;
immediately took four drinks.&#xD;
Then came the butcher with a similar bill for six&#xD;
months' supply of sole-leather steak ; then the grocer,&#xD;
the shoemaker, and so on to the end of the chapter.&#xD;
"Something must be done for these nudsills of soci-&#xD;
ety," I said. "It is one of the evils of our existence,&#xD;
that laboring men have to eat and wear clothes ; and&#xD;
were I to suggest improvements in the formation-of&#xD;
the Universe, I would arrange it that the mudsills&#xD;
who wait upon the Southern aristocracy, should grow&#xD;
fat on air, and look with contempt on base pecuniary&#xD;

means.    I must at once pay these debts ; and the devil&#xD;
of it is, there isn't a dime in the treasury !"&#xD;
Then it was that light burst upon me from        South&#xD;
Carolina, the great fountain of Southern Independence.&#xD;
Then it was that I remembered that on the 6th day of&#xD;
June, IS1, Governor Pickens paid all the debts of the&#xD;
South by a proclamation, declaring it to be treason for&#xD;
a Southerner to pay up in cash.       Therefore I deter-&#xD;
mined to relieve my creditors, and pay all bills by a&#xD;
General Order ; and accordingly I issued the follow-&#xD;

having been pained at the sufferings of my deserving creditors,&#xD;

it is hereby ordered and declared as follows:&#xD;

(&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
St. Charles Hotel, we put up for the night, when a&#xD;
man came up, and pulling me to one side, asked what&#xD;
the news was from Madisonville. I replied that I had&#xD;
not the honor of his acquaintance, and that he would&#xD;
do better to mind his own business, and not exhibit&#xD;
any of his impertinence to a Major General of Confed-&#xD;
erate Volunteers.&#xD;
Hereupon the fellow drew himself up with great dig-&#xD;
nity, until he looked quite tall, and said:&#xD;
'"R. G. S. C. II."&#xD;
"I am familiar with every language," I replied,&#xD;
"known to articulate-speaking men, since the accident.&#xD;
at the tower of Babel; I understand all science and&#xD;
philosophy: I am, in fact, an Eneyclopomdia of Useful&#xD;
Knowledge, revised and enlarged; but I cannot, with&#xD;
all my learning, master those mystic symbols:"&#xD;
"I am," said the offended fellow, "the Reliable&#xD;
Gentleman of the St. Charles Hotel !"&#xD;
"Come to my arms, sweet one I" I cried, clasping&#xD;
him to my heaving bosom in a loving embrace. "I&#xD;
regret that the Southern Source is not here to make&#xD;
your acquaintance ; for there is such a remarkable re-&#xD;
semblance in your personal appearance, impudent man-&#xD;
ners, and unblushing mendacity, that you might be&#xD;
mistaken for twins, or for one and the same person."&#xD;
The Reliable Gentleman bowed profoundly, and re-&#xD;
plied: "I am proud, General; you do me infinite&#xD;
honor. I am, so to speak, the Ears of the St. Charles ;&#xD;
for I hear every thing."&#xD;
"Judging from the enormous development of your&#xD;
acoustic organs," I replied, looking admiringly at his&#xD;
ears, "I am fully prepared to believe your statement."&#xD;

15 6        THE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
Again the Reliable Gentleman bowed his pleasure.&#xD;
"I am," he continued, "the Repository of all informa-&#xD;
tion; nothing occurs without my knowledge ; I am,&#xD;
sir, a Boiling Caldron, wherein are thrown all scraps&#xD;
of information, to be cooked up into reliable intelli-&#xD;
gence; and as the witches of Macbeth threw poisoned&#xD;
entrails, fillet of snake, tongue of dog, adder's fork, and&#xD;
lizard's leg into their caldron, so does every Big Liar&#xD;
hurl his reliable information to me. I button-hole&#xD;
every man I see; I pump him until he tells all he&#xD;
knows and all he don't know ; and I spread the news&#xD;
around town, adding such suggestions as will please the&#xD;
person to whom I speak."&#xD;
"Dear Caldron !" I replied, kissing him fondly,&#xD;
"you are the man I have long desired to find. Come&#xD;
now, sit down, and tellme all that has happened during&#xD;
the last four or five weeks."&#xD;
You should have seen the dignity and pride which&#xD;
the'a sat enthroned upon the countenance of the Boil-&#xD;
ing Caldron and Repository, as he drew himself up,&#xD;
apparently believing that he was an India Rubber&#xD;
Man, and could stretch himself out as tall as Honest&#xD;
Old Abe, if he but put himself to it. Iowa. I never saw&#xD;
Wisdom until I looked upon that majestic countenance.&#xD;
Retiring to the front of the Rotunda, and placing our&#xD;
feet higher than our heads, the Reliable Gentleman&#xD;
proceeded to give me the following additional par-&#xD;
ticulars:&#xD;
"During the period you mention," he said, impres-&#xD;
sively, "the bloodiest battle ever fought on this Conti&#xD;

land."&#xD;
"Which whipped ?" I inquired.&#xD;
"The advantage was decidedly with our arms," he&#xD;
replied; "but the victory was on the side of the&#xD;
enemy."&#xD;
The Reliable Gentleman was about to proceed with&#xD;
his narrative, when he suddenly espied an Intelligent&#xD;
Contraband on the opposite side of the street. Quicker&#xD;
than Olympian lightning he darted off; seized him by&#xD;
the button-hole, and showered upon him a series of&#xD;
questions in such rapid succession, that the Intelligent&#xD;
Contraband was almost paralysed.&#xD;
" Dey's at it, massa !" said I. C.&#xD;
"At what ?" inquired R. C.&#xD;
"Fightin' up dar !" was the reply; "I'se hearn 'em!"&#xD;
Immediately the Reliable Gentleman rushed fran-&#xD;
tically through the streets, grabbing every man he met,&#xD;
and telling him that a bloody battle was in progress up&#xD;
the river ; that he had just seen a highly respectable&#xD;
gentleman direct from the battle-field, and that the&#xD;
slaughter was dreadful. Immediately the street corners&#xD;
were crowded by an excited populace, eagerly devour-&#xD;
ing the news, and repeating it with wild exaggerations.&#xD;
Soon the Intelligent Contraband approached me, and&#xD;
said: "Par's a mistake, massa. Pat ar fightin' noise&#xD;
was den niggers on the levee, pilin' up wood !"&#xD;
The Reliable Gentleman then returned, and resumed&#xD;
the history of events. "A negro regiment went in a&#xD;
thousand strong," he said, "and seven hundred 'of them&#xD;
fell dead on the first fire. The slaughter was terrible.&#xD;
One was caught and hung, and three escaped lame for&#xD;

life. Thirty-five Federal Generals were killed on the spot.&#xD;
The slaughter was awful. Federal loss in two hours,&#xD;
seventeen thousand five hundred and two. Meantime,&#xD;
General Johnston concentrated a force of ninety-seven&#xD;
thousand in General Banks's rear, ready and willing to&#xD;
tear him in )pieces. General Banks and staff were cap-&#xD;
tured, and Colonel Grierson, with his whole command.&#xD;
The slaughter was frightful. General Breckinridge next&#xD;
made his appearance in General Banks'srear, with an im-&#xD;
imemne force, and just before he arrived at Jackson, sent a&#xD;
nigger to General Balks, to let him know that he was in&#xD;
rear. On the 3d of June, General Banks raised the&#xD;
e, and, with his whole connnand, retreated to Baton&#xD;
Rou2ge, which place was suybseqlently captured by the&#xD;
enemy.   The slaughter was appalling. Kirby Smith&#xD;
then crossed the river at Bayou Sara, moved towards&#xD;
Port Hudson, and got into General Banks's rear, with&#xD;
an immense force, sufficient to crush him, while Sibley,&#xD;
just returned from a flying visit to Texas, hung upon his&#xD;
flanks with a tremendous force. The slaughter was&#xD;
unparalleled. General Taylor, about this time, got in&#xD;
General Banks's rear. A portion of General Banks's&#xD;
forces were then sent to Vicksburg to reinforce General&#xD;
Grant. About this time a detachment of General&#xD;
Grant's army was sent to the aid of General Banks,&#xD;
from Vicksburg. The slaughter was tremendous !"&#xD;
here the Reliable Gentleman put on a look of such&#xD;
awful wisdom and solemnity that I thought I should&#xD;
die. If my Idiotic Boy knew twice as much as that&#xD;
man, I'd make him Grand Blow-Master of the Con-&#xD;
federacy. lie then looked around with his fingers on&#xD;
his lips, indicative of profound secresy, and making sure&#xD;

that no one could overhear him, made the following&#xD;

Western Louisiana, white and black, old and young, has&#xD;
been put to death! Every house, barn, shed, outhouse,&#xD;
tree, stump, shrub, cotton-bale, and combustible sub&#xD;
stance of every name and sex, was burned by the torch&#xD;
of the incendiary! The country is depopulated; the&#xD;
human race in that part is extinct, and the inhabitants&#xD;
are suffering all the toihnents of famine !"&#xD;
Having delivered this crushing and reliable announce-&#xD;
ment, he started for the Bar-Room in great haste, and&#xD;
I left instantly for Madisonville, satisfied that the ser-&#xD;
vices of the Great Confederate Blower were not re-&#xD;
quired in New Orleans.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
MACPIERSON ENCOUNTERS THE CUSSED FOOL Or CARONDELET-&#xD;
SIREET.--BETTING ON VICKSBURG AND PORT HUDSON.-&#xD;
Founiti o JuLY CELLJRA'O'ION AT MADISONVILLE, ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-The Union citizens of New Orleans will not soon forget the&#xD;
unbounded joy inspired by the news of the capture of Vicksburg and&#xD;
Port Hudson. The rebels stoutly refused to believe that either place&#xD;
had fallen, and pronouueed both reports " Yankee lies." They talked&#xD;
loudly, and offered to bet against odds ; but it was fund that when&#xD;
brought to the test, they generally "backed out."&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
July 18th, 1803.&#xD;
SI :-As I was sitting in Jacobs's Picture Gallery,&#xD;
undergoing Photography, I chanced to cast my eyes&#xD;
upon the sidewalk, and there I saw     a CUSSED FOOL,&#xD;
whom I knew at once was a good Confederate. There-&#xD;
fore I rushed out, without waiting to bid my friend&#xD;
good-day, or to pay my bill, and clasping him warmly&#xD;
by the hand, asked him what he was driving at.&#xD;
"Betting," he replied.&#xD;
"What are you betting on ?" I asked him.&#xD;
" On Yicksburg," replied the Cussed Fool.&#xD;
"What's the matter with Yicksburg ?" I asked.&#xD;
" Nothing," he answered ; "and that's what's the&#xD;
matter with me.     Come to my place in Carondelet-&#xD;
street, and I will show you something. that will make&#xD;
your Confederate eyes gleam with joy."&#xD;
Walking to his place I was delighted to find that he&#xD;
was none of your poor white trash, but an out-and-out&#xD;
&#xD;
J&#xD;
&#xD;
VIOKSBURG NOT TAKEN BY GRANT.&#xD;
&#xD;
161&#xD;
&#xD;
Southern aristocrat. We took four drinks of wine, and&#xD;
I told him it was very choice, but that for an honest,&#xD;
steady drink, Louisiana Rum could not be beaten.&#xD;
"Now then," said he, "I am going to prove to you by&#xD;
the Confederate Arithmetic that Yicksburg is not taken,&#xD;
and that the dispatch published by the Yankee editor of&#xD;
THE ERA was a foul and infamous invention--a lie made&#xD;
out of whole cloth, for a bad purpose, which, it is sup-&#xD;
posed, was to affect the price of sugar and molasses, etc."&#xD;
"Proceed," I said, "for I am author of the Arithme-&#xD;
tic of which you speak."&#xD;
"In the first place," said he, "Vicksburg is impreg-&#xD;
nable. It is a Gibraltar, as I can prove to you by all&#xD;
the Southern papers that have published any thing on&#xD;
the subject." Ie then took down a file of Southern&#xD;
papers and pointed out eight thousand places in which&#xD;
Vicksburg was called " Gibraltar," and declared to be&#xD;
"impregnable."  "Now," he continued,"the combined&#xD;
forces of France and Spain were unable to reduce Gib-&#xD;
raltar, and a place that is impregnable cannot be taken,&#xD;
according to my views. But when we come to analyse&#xD;
the question we find that the intrenchments of Vicks-&#xD;
burg are equal to twenty thousand men by the usual&#xD;
estimate, and this multiplied by fifty, according to Con-&#xD;
federate mathematics, would make the works equal to&#xD;
one million of men. One Confederate is equal to five&#xD;
Yankees, and this would bring it up to five millions of&#xD;
men. Then we will take the garrison, which amounts to&#xD;
forty thousand. This sum multiplied by fifty gives us a&#xD;
garrison of two millions, each of whom is equal to five&#xD;
Yankees, and so, in fact, the garrison is ten millions&#xD;
strong. The garrison and the intrenchments together&#xD;

PORT HUDSON NOT CAPTURED.       163&#xD;
&#xD;
thus give us fifteen million brave Southern patriots, all&#xD;
armed and ready to fight with desperate valor for Con-&#xD;
federate independence. That nearly equals the entire&#xD;
population of the free States, and-if they cannot hold&#xD;
out against Grant's army, then I will sell out and go to&#xD;
France."&#xD;
"You satisfy me," I replied, "I am sure that Vicks-&#xD;
burg is not taken !"&#xD;
"I'll bet ten thousand dollars on it !" passionately&#xD;
cried the Cussed Fool.&#xD;
Just then a Yankee came up, and said : "I'll take&#xD;
that bet !"&#xD;
"What !" cried the Cussed Fool, in amazement.&#xD;
"Pll take the bet," he repeated, and at the same time&#xD;
put down ten one thousand dollar greenbacks.&#xD;
A smile of wonder passed over the face of the Cussed&#xD;
Fool, as he surveyed the Yankee from head to foot, as -&#xD;
though he had been a curiosity inl Barnum's Museum.&#xD;
Understanding his meaning, I proceeded to explain:&#xD;
"You Damned Yankee," I said, "you do not under-&#xD;
stand the principles of well-regulated Southern families.&#xD;
When a man says he will bet on the Confederacy or&#xD;
that Vicksburg is not taken, do you suppose he means&#xD;
it? Not a bit of it ! It is an ordinance with the great&#xD;
doctrine e of Blowing ; a doctrine which I preached in&#xD;
the Temple of Confederate Holiness in Camp street,&#xD;
and which is faithfully followed by every secessionist in&#xD;
New Orleans."&#xD;
"That's true," said the Cussed Fool of Carondelet-&#xD;
street. "°11 not bet a dime; put up your money !&#xD;
Bitt I know a man who will bet ten thousand dollars to&#xD;
one thousand that Yicksburg is not taken"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Show him to me," said the Damned Yankee.&#xD;
We then walked down to Hawkins's, and there we&#xD;
found him. His face was red and swollen with blow-&#xD;
ing, and immediately I recognized him as the Great&#xD;
Southern Sinorter. He knew it was a lie-he had seen&#xD;
a paper of a later date, and Vicksburg held out and was&#xD;
impregnable. He was ready to bet ten to one, up to&#xD;
any amount, that the Yankee dispatch was a lie.&#xD;
"Up to what amount, sir ?" inquired the Yankee.&#xD;
"Up to any amount you please I" cried he, at the&#xD;
same time sending out a peculiar blowing sound from&#xD;
his nostrils.&#xD;
"Say ten thousand," replied the Yankee.&#xD;
"Say any thing you please !" cried the Great Southern&#xD;
Snorter.&#xD;
"I say, then," replied the Yankee, "that I'll bet you&#xD;
ten thousand dollars against five thousand that Vicks-&#xD;
burg has been taken by General Grant !"&#xD;
"You must excuse, me," said the great Southern&#xD;
Snorter, "I just remember that I have an imperative&#xD;
engagement. I have no time to talk with you, and,&#xD;
besides, if I should bet, most likely I would get ar-&#xD;
rested."  The great Southern Snorter then walked ofl&#xD;
with a sad look, and all the Yankees laughed.&#xD;
Just then a fiendish newsboy came up, and thrusting&#xD;
papers in our faces, cried out : "Here's your Extra&#xD;
EPA--Fall of Port Hu ddson I"&#xD;
"Its another Yankee lie !" cried the Cussed Fool;&#xD;
"P11 bet ten thousand it is a lie ! I can nrove that&#xD;
Port Hudson is impregnable and the Gibraltar of the&#xD;
Lower Mississippi !" ie then ran the sum over on the&#xD;
ends of his fingers, as a devout Catholic would count the&#xD;

beads, and I was pleased to see that he had the whole&#xD;
Confederate Arithmetic at his tongue's end. "Garrison,&#xD;
10,000 by 50 is 500,000, by 5 is 2,500,000. Fortifica-&#xD;
tions, ditto is ditto; total number of Confederates,&#xD;
5,000,000! The whole Yankee army could not contend&#xD;
with one-tenth part of that number, and I know that&#xD;

How the Rebellion saved Property.&#xD;
We then walked off; arm-in-arm, the Cussed Fool in&#xD;
a most thoughtful abstracted mood,&#xD;
"Fool," I said, "you are one of the best Confed-&#xD;
erates I have seen, and I now wish to ask what you and&#xD;
the rest of the Confederates got up this rebellion for ?"&#xD;
"To save our property," he replied.&#xD;
Just then we observed a red auction flag in front of&#xD;
a most beautiful residence, and halting at the door, we&#xD;
discovered TYLER in all his glory, selling the furniture&#xD;
and every thing else at auction. "This," said the&#xD;
Cussed Fool, "is a sale by order of the Quartermaster;&#xD;
the house and furniture were confiscated and sold by&#xD;
the United States, because the former owner was in the&#xD;
Confederate army. Now see his splendid furniture, his&#xD;
mirrors framed with massive gold, his statuary of&#xD;
Carrara marble, his pianos, his library, all and every&#xD;
thing put up for sale by Yankees, and bid off by Yan-&#xD;
kee purchasers, and the fruits thereof going into the&#xD;
treasury of the United States, a government that every&#xD;
Confederate despises."&#xD;
"Where are his niggers-?" I asked.&#xD;
"Niggers !" shouted the Cussed Fool, while a flash.&#xD;

"And this is the way you saved his property by the&#xD;

"Macpherson," said the Cussed Fool, "if the South-&#xD;

"Go it," I replied, and whistled the new Confederate&#xD;

July 4th-lagruder in New Orleans.&#xD;
On the 4th of July, the people of Madisonville as-&#xD;
sembled in a vast multitude around my residence, and&#xD;
demanded an oration. The Idiotic Boy read the Con-&#xD;
federate Declaration of Independence, which, for want&#xD;
of a table, he rested upon the head of a nigger. I&#xD;
then mounted a soap-barrel, and proceeded to expatiate&#xD;
on the beauties of Southern Independence. "It is&#xD;
eighty-seven years ago to-day," I said, "that George&#xD;
Washington and John B. Floyd laid the foundations of&#xD;
the Southern Confederacy, by proclaiming to the na-&#xD;
tions of the civilised world the eternal and heaven-&#xD;
ordained doctrine of secession. But it took Jeff. Davis&#xD;
and the Miles Legion to complete the noble work; and&#xD;
it was not until the year 1861 that Truth, robed in&#xD;
light gray, and bearing a Palmetto tree in her hand,&#xD;
stepped forth from the shores of South Carolina, and&#xD;

1. The General Commanding felicitates the people o{ his De-&#xD;
partment on the recent brilliant Confederate Victories at Port&#xD;
Hudson and Vicksburg, and also in Pennsylvania and Tennessee.&#xD;
The splendid valor of our troops has demonstrated to the world&#xD;

Before leaving the Cussed Fool, I asked him to de-&#xD;
fine Honesty, and he replied that it consisted of form-&#xD;
ing an opinion and sticking to it through thick and&#xD;
thin, in spite of facts or arguments. "The man," said&#xD;
he, "who lives up to his faith atithe greatest sacrifice&#xD;
of comfort, money, and common sense, is the most&#xD;
honest man.    Tell me who you think he is."&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE PHANTOM CONFEDERATE; OR, THE GHOST OF MADISON-&#xD;
VILLE.&#xD;
(A True Story.)&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
August 1, 1863.&#xD;
SIR :-It was in the full of the Moon, in the month&#xD;
called Julius by the Romans, and anno tertio de Ia&#xD;
Southern Confederacy, at the very witching hour of&#xD;
night, when churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes&#xD;
forth contagion to the world, that I might have been&#xD;
seen seated on a cypress stump, in the midst of a blasted&#xD;
heath, near the classical city of Madisonville, C. S. A.,&#xD;
with a roll of plug tobacco in my hand, (a present&#xD;
from Gov. Lubbock, of Texas), and a Confederate can-&#xD;
teen of Louisiana Rum by my side. Thus sitting did I&#xD;
meditate upon that beautiful scene described by Vir-&#xD;
gil, in which Eneas, with his Trojan followers, as&#xD;
ragged and dirty as a Confederate army, was visited&#xD;
by Venus, his good-looking mother, who came in the&#xD;
form of a huntress, with a commodious bow hanging&#xD;
from her white shoulders. O Dea certe! cried the&#xD;
pious Eneas; which, being translated into the Con-&#xD;
federate tongue, means: O goddess for certain!&#xD;
"Why," thought I, "if goddesses for certain, gods,&#xD;
apparitions, ghosts, hobgoblins, phantoms, and spec-&#xD;
tres visited the great warriors and philosophers of&#xD;
ancient days, why may they not also visit me, who&#xD;
&#xD;
surpass all mortals both in the invincible strength of&#xD;
my arm, and the magnificent gifts of intellect ?"&#xD;
Scarcely had this sublime thought turned itself&#xD;
over in my mind, when I heard a low sound floating&#xD;
upon the air, in tones as gentle as the Lolian Harp,&#xD;
and immediately I recognised it as a spiritual Con-&#xD;
federate snort.&#xD;
"0,..Deus Uonfederatus, cete !" I exclaimed, "be&#xD;
thou a spirit of health or a Yankee damned; bring&#xD;
with thee airs from heaven or blasts from Boston ; be&#xD;
thy intents wicked or charitable, thou comest in such&#xD;
questionable shape that I will speak to thee! I'll call&#xD;
thee-Macpherson, Confederate Royal Blower !"&#xD;
"I am," responded the as yet Unseen, "the Phan-&#xD;
tom Conftderate, or the Ghost of 2XIadisonville, doomed&#xD;
for a certain space to walk the night, and by day con-&#xD;
fined to fast on mule's meat, until the surrender of the&#xD;
garrison shall ensure us Yankee rations ! List, list, Oh&#xD;
list !-if ever thou didst thy dear Confederate love-"&#xD;
.Macpherson-" Oh heaven !"&#xD;
Phantom Confederate-" Then give me thy can-&#xD;
teen ; for now am I consumed by devouring thirst !"&#xD;
.2lac.-"Thirst ?"&#xD;
P. C.-"Ay, thirst most dry, as in the best it is; but&#xD;
this most dry, queer, and unnatural !"&#xD;
Iac.-" Haste me to know it, that I, with wings as&#xD;
swift as meditation or the thoughts of love, may swoop&#xD;
to my revenge!"&#xD;
I then seized the canteen in a glow of generosity,&#xD;
placed the muzzle to my lips, and drank the contents&#xD;
at a single gulp, after which I gave him my canteen&#xD;
as he had requested. " Behold !" I said to him, "the&#xD;

&#xD;
generosity of a true Confederate. Thus did the Louis-&#xD;
iana Secesh Convention of 1861 gobble up the Custom-&#xD;
house, Mint, light-houses, arsenal, and revenue cutters&#xD;
of the United States, while Honest Old Abe stood&#xD;
looking on, greedily begrudging the same ! Approach,&#xD;
dread corse ! that I may gaze upon thee ! Is it not&#xD;
enough that the whole Yankee race should be leagued&#xD;
togethe: against me, that spirits must be summoned&#xD;
from the vasty deep, to disturb the repose of the great&#xD;
Confederate warrior ?"&#xD;
The ghost then approached, and, turning my eyes&#xD;
upon him, I beheld a being of majestic mien, dressed&#xD;
in a gray uniform, with a cadaverous countenance, and&#xD;
very dirty. His garments were tattered and torn in&#xD;
such a manner that whenever he stepped, the legs of&#xD;
his breeches released his limbs to the gaze of the mid-&#xD;
night Moon.&#xD;
"Wherefore," I asked, "presumest thou, thus ragged,&#xD;
to come into the presence of a Major General of Con-&#xD;
federate volunteers ?"&#xD;
"Because," replied the ghost, "I haven't got any&#xD;
other clothes. I am the representative phantom of the&#xD;
Southern Confederacy. I was born in South Carolina,&#xD;
and have relatives in eleven States, besides New York&#xD;
city and Vallandigham's district." He then showed&#xD;
me a neck-tie with eleven stars in it, emblematic of the&#xD;
Bonnie Blue Flag, and wrought by the ladies of New&#xD;
Orleans. As he was showing this to me, he smote his&#xD;
head with pain, raised his eyes upwards and exclaimed.&#xD;
"Oh!"&#xD;
"What's the row, sweety ?" I enquired.&#xD;
"That," replied he, "is occasioned by a contraction&#xD;
&#xD;
FAREWELL TO THE CRESCENT CITY.&#xD;
&#xD;
171&#xD;
&#xD;
of the Federal lines; I feel it squeezing the brains out&#xD;
of their natural channels."&#xD;
"Fear not," I answered, "you have not brains&#xD;
enough to suffer serious damage."&#xD;
Suddenly the Phantom began to dance with the&#xD;
wildest joy, while his whole ghastly face became lighted&#xD;
up with enthusiastic bliss. "Tell me," I said, "the&#xD;
cause of this sudden revulsion of feeling, which seems&#xD;
to have lifted you from the lowest sub-basement of&#xD;
Despair to the highest attic of Delight ?"&#xD;
"A. great victory in Pennsylvania !" he replied.&#xD;
"The field of Gettysburg fills me with unspeakable&#xD;
happiness !"&#xD;
As he spoke, however, I noticed that one of his eyes&#xD;
had been gouged out, and one side of his face complete-&#xD;
ly smashed in, while a stream of blood was coursing to&#xD;
the earth. I inquired the meaning of this, and he re-&#xD;
plied it was the result of casualties at Gettysburg.&#xD;
"No great victory," he said, "is ever won without ap-&#xD;
palling sacrifices of life and limb; but Lee has succeed-&#xD;
ed in getting out of Pennsylvania, with a loss of only&#xD;
forty-five thousand men&#xD;
" Is'that all?" I asked.&#xD;
"Every bit, sure as you live, Macpherson !" cried&#xD;
the Confederate Ghost; and, jumping up, I began to&#xD;
whistle the air of ".Molly, put the kettle on," and then,&#xD;
seizing each other's hands, we danced a compound&#xD;
double-shuffle for thirty minutes, in honor of Gettys-&#xD;
burg. This magnificent exhibition was interrupted by&#xD;
twinges of excruciating pain, which caused the Ghost&#xD;
to writhe and swear like a man with the gout. "What&#xD;
now ?" I enquired.     I&#xD;

" That disease," he answered, "is known in the Con-&#xD;
federacy as 'Roseerans in the Legs.' Whenever a Con-&#xD;
federate General gets that disorder, he starts off at a&#xD;
double-quick, and cannot stop until he falls, out of&#xD;
wind. I've got the disease !" he cried, with a tone of&#xD;
terror. "I caught it in Tennessee and Pennsylvania.&#xD;
Curse those malarious Yankee dens of death and per-&#xD;
dition !" And so exclaiming, the Ghost started ofi,&#xD;
and ran so smartly that even I, fleet of limb as I am,&#xD;
could scarcely keep up. Over the blasted heath,&#xD;
through the silent streets of Madisonville, down the&#xD;
lane, and around the dilapidated hospitable abode,&#xD;
ran the fleet-footed Ghost, with Macpherson at his heels.&#xD;
The Idiotic Boy jumped out of bed, and joined in the&#xD;
chase, without waiting to dress. In vain did we try to&#xD;
tree him-in vain to intercept him ! To run, run, run,&#xD;
now and forever, seemed to be the strong passion that&#xD;
possessed his Soul, and bound his body obedient to the&#xD;
Will. " Tullahoma !" he cried, as lie leaped a wide&#xD;
ditch. "Chattanooga !" he screamed, as he jumped a&#xD;
fence, and fell on the other side, exhausted and appar-&#xD;
ently defunct. Raising him to his feet, I rubbed his&#xD;
head with a shoe brush until the left eye opened, his&#xD;
lips quivered, and' he faintly whispered in my ear the&#xD;
word " Bragg-adocio !"&#xD;
A Strange Phenomenon.&#xD;
Now it was that a most extraordinary phenomenon&#xD;
presented itself to my eyes. The Ghost, starting up,&#xD;
suddenly leaped iii the air like a bullet-pierced Indian,&#xD;
and fell to the earth in two pieces. Upon examination,.&#xD;
&#xD;
EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON.&#xD;
&#xD;
178&#xD;
&#xD;
I discovered that he had been clean split in two length-&#xD;
wise, as even and slick as though an immense razor,&#xD;
dropped with the accuracy of a guillotine and the&#xD;
power of Hercules, had severed him in twain. It ex-&#xD;
tended to the top of the cranium. One piece was, in&#xD;
short, the right half of a human body, and the other the&#xD;
left half. It now became doubtful whether conscious-&#xD;
ness would ever return; but return it did, and each&#xD;
separate part began to talk on its own hook, the left&#xD;
part saying his name was J. Davis, and the right that&#xD;
his name was Magruder Lubbock. The conversation&#xD;
of the two was so incoherent and contradictory, it was&#xD;
evident neither side knew what the other was about,&#xD;
and both bled so copiously that I was in constant fear&#xD;
of instantaneous dissolution. I asked J. Davis to give&#xD;
me the name of this extraordinary disease, and he re-&#xD;
plied that it was called "Open iJfississippi River," in&#xD;
the Confederacy. "When a man gets this disorder,"&#xD;
he continued, "his case is incurable ; there is no possi-&#xD;
bility of ever again uniting his disjointed parts. I&#xD;
caught it at Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and there is&#xD;
no medicine in the world that can do me good !"&#xD;
Visit to Tew Orleans.&#xD;
The Idiotic Boy and myself tore up a Confederate&#xD;
blanket, and with the pieces tied together the two parts&#xD;
the best we could, and all three of us started for New&#xD;
Orleans in a butcher's cart. As if wonders would&#xD;
never cease, when we arrived in front of the St. Charles&#xD;
Hotel, I found that half of the Ghost had disappeared.&#xD;
On enquiring of the remaining half what had become&#xD;

Hotel, the right eye had espied General Weitzel stand-&#xD;
ing on the steps, and had immediately left for Texas,&#xD;
procuring a new crutch at Brashear City.&#xD;
Curiously did I watch the movements of the remain-&#xD;
ing half of the Phantom Confederate. He strayed leis-&#xD;
urely down to the Clay Monument, and informed the&#xD;
crowd that foreign intervention was now a fixed fact,&#xD;
and that a French fleet was about to be sent to New&#xD;
Orleans, in obedience to the petition of our French cit-&#xD;
izens to the Emperor, through their consul here, to be&#xD;
protected against a negro insurrection that broke out&#xD;
in this city on the Fourth of July, and has been raging&#xD;
with terrible fury ever since. Having made all his&#xD;
friends in that neighborhood happy, by this announce-&#xD;
ment, he then walked up to Carondelet-street and visit-&#xD;
ed the Cussed Fool, who read Yallandigham's second&#xD;
letter aloud from the balcony, to an admiring audience.&#xD;
At this stage of the proceedings an Extra ERA an-&#xD;
nounced the total suppression of the great Confederate&#xD;
Revolution in New York city, whereupon the Phan-&#xD;
tom put on a look of dismay, and disappeared through&#xD;
the back door, in a sudden and unaccountable manner.&#xD;
I have not seen him since.&#xD;
Let no' one question the literal truth of my ghost&#xD;
story. I give the world the untarnished honor of a&#xD;
Confederate soldier and a chivalric Southern gentleman,&#xD;
that every word I have written is exact, literal truth.&#xD;

ONE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR ANOTHER'S ACTS. 175&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
MACPHERSON IS ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY.-HE&#xD;
EXPOUNDS THE LAW OF RESPONSIBILITY.-HE VISITS PORT&#xD;
HUDSON AND VICKSBURG.-IE .TESTS THE HOMEOPATHIC&#xD;
PRINCIPLE, AND IS CHASED BY THE DEVIL, ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-The Author takes the liberty of introducing an extract&#xD;
from a very complimentary introduction to the main portion of the&#xD;
following letter from the Indianapolis Journal, as explanatory of its&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
"The responsibility of the 'Abolitionist' for the beating Mac-&#xD;
pherson gave the 'nigger,' is exactly that which the Copperheads&#xD;
fasten upon the people of the North for the Southern rebellion. 'If&#xD;
you had only done what the South wanted,' they say, 'there would&#xD;
have been no war. Why didn't you get down on your knees and lick&#xD;
the dust, and take your kicking kindly, as we did, and wanted you to&#xD;
do? If you had, this unnatural and unconstitutional war would&#xD;
never have happened. You are responsible for it. The blood is all&#xD;
on your skirts, you mean, cowardly whelps.' Macpherson epitomizes&#xD;
the speech of Judge Perkins before the K. G. C.'s last winter 'to a&#xD;
dot.' The judge, himself, could not state its main point and spirit&#xD;
better."&#xD;
MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
August 22d, 1863.&#xD;
Sm:--As I was going along Rampart street, in New&#xD;
Orleans, last Wednesday, I met a nigger on one side of&#xD;
the street and an Abolitionist on the other. "Abo.," I&#xD;
said, "you go over and pull that nigger's wool."&#xD;
"What for ?" asked Abo.&#xD;
." Because I tell you to," I replied.&#xD;
"It wouldn't be right," replied Abo. ; "the boy has&#xD;
done me no harm, and I shan't pull his wool."&#xD;
"If you don't do it," I replied, "I'll knock him down&#xD;
and pound him within an inch of his life."&#xD;

"I shan't do it," said Abo.; "and I would like to&#xD;
know what he has done to you."&#xD;
"Nothing," I replied, "but he's a nigger, and that's&#xD;
enough. If you'll pull his wool I'll let him off. But&#xD;
you won't, and if I whip him to death, you'll be re-&#xD;
sponsible for it, you vile inhuman, Abolition renegade !&#xD;
Where's your humanity for the nigger? Where's your&#xD;
philanthropy? Where's your regard for human rights&#xD;
and liberties? The owner and overseer are the only&#xD;
true friends of the nigger! I implore you to save him&#xD;
from  the awful mauling I'll give him ; but you&#xD;
won't, you infernal, hypocritical, sneaking, puritanical,&#xD;
drawling, damned Massachusetts, Boston, round-head&#xD;
Yankee Abolition fool !" Saying which, with a stream&#xD;
of fire flashing from both eyes, I rushed upon the darkey&#xD;
with the ferocity of a tiger, knocked him flat on his&#xD;
back, kicked his face into a jelly, and whipped him with&#xD;
a raw-hide until he wasn't able to stand on his feet, and&#xD;
a stream of blood ran from every vein in his body.&#xD;
"What's you gone an' done, massa ?" said the un-&#xD;
happy wretch, when I let up on him.&#xD;
"I, you black numbskull !" I answered; "1 didn't&#xD;
do it: it was that sneaking Abolition nigger-thief that&#xD;
did it. I am your best friend and protector !"&#xD;
A policeman came up and arrested me for assault&#xD;
and battery. I was arraigned at the bar as a crimi-&#xD;
nal, and made the following address to the Court:&#xD;
I3faopherson's eloquent Plea in .Defense.&#xD;
"May it please the Court : I do not suppose any thing&#xD;
I can say will alter your predetermined decision, or&#xD;
&#xD;
DEFENSE FOR BEATING THE NIGGER.&#xD;
&#xD;
your fixed resolution to offer me up as a sacrifice to&#xD;
Abolition fanaticism. As Socrates stood up to be tried&#xD;
by a pack of heathen numbskulls, so do I stand up in&#xD;
the presence of Yankee nincompoops, who no more&#xD;
comprehend and understand the rul s and regulations&#xD;
of Confederate Courts of Justice, than Jeff. Davis com-&#xD;
prehends the meaning of his own proclamations. And&#xD;
as Socrates fell a prey to the lubberheadedness of the&#xD;
popular Athenian tribunal, so shall I fail, with all my&#xD;
learning, to prevent this besotted Court from commit-&#xD;
ting Scandalum Magnatum-an offense against Con-&#xD;
federate prelates and dignitaries, which, under the old&#xD;
statutes of England, was no offense when committed&#xD;
against common folks, but a crime when done to big&#xD;
men like me. Nevertheless, if the truth can permeate&#xD;
your bestial intellects, allow me to call your attention&#xD;
to the law of this case. In the first place, I take the&#xD;
ground that the authority of Governor Moore and the&#xD;
Louisiana Legislature (which at last accounts was in&#xD;
session behind the Rocky Mountains), is in force in this&#xD;
city, and that the Black Code of Louisiana is binding&#xD;
upon Yankees who come into the Department of the&#xD;
Gulf. I also plead the usages and customs of the Con-&#xD;
federates in justification of my conduct ; and this&#xD;
brings me to a logical analysis of the case. The wit-&#xD;
nesses against me are two-a nigger and an Abolition-&#xD;
ist. Under the Black Code of Louisiana, a slave's&#xD;
testimony cannot be taken in a Court of Justice, and&#xD;
under the former precedents. and usages of this great&#xD;
Confederate Commonwealth, an Abolitionist should be&#xD;
hung without trial. Therefore, the nigger's evidence&#xD;
is no evidence at all, and the Abolitionist has no busi-&#xD;

ness here; he had better go North and sing psalms, and&#xD;
not venture into my Department, for if he does I'll&#xD;
hang him higher than Haman or John Brown. I there-&#xD;
fore ask the Court to discharge me, send the nigger&#xD;
back to Confederate slavery, and hang the Aboli-&#xD;
tionist."&#xD;
The Court didn't see it, and so I continued my thrill-&#xD;
ing discourse:&#xD;
"In the second place, the Abolition Cuss is responsi-&#xD;
ble for the pounding of the 'darkey ; since, had he&#xD;
pulled his wool as I requested him to do, I should not&#xD;
have touched the black brute. But Horace Greeley is&#xD;
the author of this war, and Wendell Phillips got up the&#xD;
late riots in New York, as I can prove to you by an&#xD;
editorial in one of the New Orleans papers: and what&#xD;
can you expect of an Abolitionist any how ? They&#xD;
alone are responsible for the war and for slavery, and&#xD;
therefore I ought to be discharged."&#xD;
In spite of this irresistible logic, which should have&#xD;
secured my instant release, the Court declined to let&#xD;
me off, and was about to pronounce sentence, when I&#xD;
jumped out of the second-story window, and made off&#xD;
for Madisonville so fast that the whole Department of&#xD;
the Gulf couldn't catch me.&#xD;
facpherson visits Port Hudson and Vic7csburg.&#xD;
I went up to Port Hudson and Vicksburg on the&#xD;
steamer Crescent, with a whole load of Yankee generals,&#xD;
colonels, congressmen, lawyers, and editors, and shed&#xD;
tears of inconsolable grief as I gazed upon the deserted&#xD;
Confederate rat-holes behind the parapets of Port Hud-&#xD;
&#xD;
APPARITION OF THE.DEVIL.        -179&#xD;
soli, where we stopped to look at the works. Not&#xD;
believing that the place had been taken, I inquired for&#xD;
the headquarters of General Gardner, and was direct-&#xD;
ed to an old house that had many holes through the&#xD;
roof, and the balcony clean knocked off by Yankee&#xD;
shells.&#xD;
"Is General Gardner in ?" I enquired of a sentinel.&#xD;
"Yes," was the reply, "he is in jail."&#xD;
I knew then that Port Hudson was taken, and so&#xD;
telegraphed to the Cussed Fool of Carondelet street. I&#xD;
regret to add that my observations at Vicksburg were&#xD;
equally unsatisfactory.&#xD;
Similar Simlibus curantur.&#xD;
Heart-sick and discouraged at the drooping condition&#xD;
of the Confederate cause on the Mississippi, I returned&#xD;
to Madisonville, and devoted myself wholly to drink-&#xD;
ing. Having swallowed one demijohn of Louisiana&#xD;
Rum, I became beastly drunk ; and then it was that the&#xD;
great principle of Hahnemnann--"like cures like"-burst&#xD;
upon my mind. If it be true, I thought, that like&#xD;
cures like, then will another demijohn of the same de-&#xD;
structive liquid restore my mind and body to their ac-&#xD;
customed activity. Accordingly I applied the remedy&#xD;
in doses larger than those which had produced the&#xD;
disease, and it resulted in a perfect cure. I got over&#xD;
being drunk, but in doing so I got the delirium tre-&#xD;
mens, which lasted me for two weeks, and confined me&#xD;
to my room. That is the reason I have not written&#xD;
any letters recently.&#xD;
I never suspected that the Devil was a hod-carrier&#xD;

THE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DEVIL'S DITTY.&#xD;
&#xD;
until I was prostrated by this singular disorder ; but as&#xD;
soon as the thing was fairly on me, I saw him with a hod&#xD;
of bricks on the top of his head, grinning at me hideous-&#xD;
lv, and every now and then picking out a brick and&#xD;
pitching it at my head with unerring aim. I cut around&#xD;
the house because the Devil was after me, but he was&#xD;
too fast, and hit me at every step.   He was dressed in&#xD;
gray uniform, a good deal soiled and faded, and his&#xD;
shoes had burst out so that it showed his cloven foot.&#xD;
This performance continued at intervals for fourteen&#xD;
days, and whenever the Old Boy chased me around the&#xD;
house, he hummed the following :&#xD;
DITTY, SUNG BY OLD SCRATCH AS HE CHASED MACPHER-&#xD;
SON WITH BRICKS.&#xD;
Dear Jeff. 's sick they say,&#xD;
But I mean he shall stay&#xD;
On earth a while longer ;&#xD;
My cause will be stronger&#xD;
With his plotting you see;&#xD;
So a while let him be!&#xD;
Secession I like,&#xD;
It was a ten-strike ;&#xD;
My clerks are all busy-&#xD;
Writing names till they're dizzy !&#xD;
Yet awhile, it is planned,&#xD;
Jeff's card-house shall stand !&#xD;
I like men that lie&#xD;
So much faster than I&#xD;
Ever could, I believe,&#xD;
E'en in dealing with Eve !&#xD;
Yes, the Rebs are a wonder,&#xD;
They lie so like thunder !&#xD;
I love New York rioters&#xD;
And slung-shot proprietors,&#xD;
Who'll burn an Asylum;&#xD;
Not yet will I " spile" 'em!&#xD;
&#xD;
I've suspended my orders&#xD;
To bring 'em into my borders !&#xD;
The Copperhead faction&#xD;
Suits me just to a fraction,&#xD;
They follow Fernando&#xD;
And play to my hand so,&#xD;
And never pulltriggers&#xD;
But in shooting poor niggers!&#xD;
And as for that standing sham,&#xD;
Mr.Vallandigham,&#xD;
And New York Judge McCann,&#xD;
There never was better one;&#xD;
They preach habeas corpus&#xD;
And blow like a porpoise !&#xD;
Yet a while let 'em hobble,&#xD;
But soon will I gobble&#xD;
The whole, as guerillas&#xD;
Seize chickens or fillies,&#xD;
With greater momentum&#xD;
Than grape could have sent 'em!&#xD;
When he finished up the performance of this ditty,&#xD;
he disappeared, and I arose clothed and in my right&#xD;
mind.&#xD;

182         THE MACPHERSON LETTERs.&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
MACPHERSON IS SEIZED WITH THE NEWSPAPER MANIA, AND DE-&#xD;
TERMINES TO BECOME AN EDo0a.-HE DISSOLVES THE ARMY&#xD;
of MADISONVILLE, ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-At the time this letter was published, a great lumber of&#xD;
newspaper schemes were on foot in New Orleans. No less than three&#xD;
new dailies were in contemplation, beside one which had actually&#xD;
been started.&#xD;
MADISONvILLE, LA.,&#xD;
Oct. 9, 1863.&#xD;
Sm:-Returnng from      the Convention of General&#xD;
Magruder and the kicked-out Governors, recently held&#xD;
in Texas, I stopped in New Orleans on my return. But&#xD;
I soon discovered that a malignant and destructive con-&#xD;
tagion had broken out in that city, which, in its devas-&#xD;
tating ravages, spared neither age, sex, color, nor condi-&#xD;
tion. From   the high in position down to the lowest&#xD;
son of a gun, it took all, sparing none in its onward and&#xD;
miraculous progress. As the hot and noxious simoonr&#xD;
sweeps over the burning sand, while a thick sulpburous&#xD;
exhalation rises from the earth, first in hurried gyra-&#xD;
tions, and then ascends the air and covers the whole&#xD;
heavens-while hissing and crackling noises are heard,&#xD;
and animal life perishes as though touched by Greek&#xD;
fire, even so had this pestilent epidemic seized with an&#xD;
unyielding grasp every one who ventured within the&#xD;
circle of its magic influence. The millionaire was taken&#xD;
in the midst of luxury and splendor ; the lawyer in his&#xD;
office; the literati in garrets; fair women fell its vie-&#xD;
&#xD;
tios ; even a Confederate, fresh from ort Jackson, was&#xD;
stricken before he had been three days from prison.&#xD;
My first impulse was to skedaddle, as unceremoni-&#xD;
ously as the Reliable Gentleman of the St. Charles Hotel&#xD;
did, when he heard there was a case of yellow fever in&#xD;
town. But learning that the disease seldom proved&#xD;
fatal, except to the pocket, I determined to take my&#xD;
chances, especially as I had no money, and was, in fact,&#xD;
a travelling object of charity. But I had not been in&#xD;
the city two hours before I was seized with a violent&#xD;
and uncontrollable desire to start a daily newspaper, or&#xD;
to get an interest in one already started. It came upon&#xD;
me like a flash of lightning hurled by the hand of Jupi-&#xD;
ter, when he darts the destructive bolts from the summit&#xD;
of divine Olympus ; and it worked upon my mind in a&#xD;
manner so violent that I soon fell sprawling on the&#xD;
floor, as flat as one of Sylvanus Cobb's novels. The&#xD;
crash of my fall hastily brought a friend to my side.&#xD;
"Great Heaven !" he exclaimed; "Macpherson has got&#xD;
the contagion ! A physician, quick! for the love of&#xD;
Confederate intellect !" A distinguished physician soon&#xD;
appeared, felt of my bounding pulse, and began to&#xD;
question me as to the symptoms of the disorder.&#xD;
"This desire to start a newspaper," he began-" have&#xD;
you ever had it before ?"&#xD;
"Only in slight degree," I answered him. "For&#xD;
some fime I have had it in my head to put the Idiotic&#xD;
Boy in editorial charge of a paper ; for the manner in&#xD;
which the press in New Orleans is conducted, has con-&#xD;
vinced me that he would be a bright and shining light&#xD;
among his cotemporaries. But that was as nothing&#xD;
compared to the desire which I now feel. A wild,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
restless fatality, Sn irresistible purpose, consume me,&#xD;
as if one of Gillmore's batteries had been opened,&#xD;
sweeping Greek Fire through my bones."&#xD;
"There is no doubt as to what ails you," said the&#xD;
good Doctor, shaking his head gravely ; "you have&#xD;
caught the prevailing distemper, known in medical&#xD;
parlance as the Newspaper Mania ! "&#xD;
"Is there no remedy!" I asked.&#xD;
"Only one that I know of," he answered.&#xD;
"And what might that be? ", I inquired.&#xD;
"To pay the bills of some newspaper establishment&#xD;
for a month," he replied, "receiving in return the re-&#xD;
ceipts of the concern, has, so far as my observation&#xD;
goes, proved an effectual remedy for all complaints of&#xD;
this nature."&#xD;
"Is the remedy severe?" I asked.&#xD;
"Alas! yes," he answered; "none but millionaires&#xD;
can indulge in it; and unless you have plenty of&#xD;
metal, your case is hopeless."&#xD;
I therefore hurried back to Madisonville, hoping that&#xD;
a change of climate and the quiet repose of my home,&#xD;
might restore my mental equilibrium ; or that, con-&#xD;
certing measures with the Honest Jew, I might gratify&#xD;
the terrible desire that now burned to the very mar-&#xD;
row of my bones.&#xD;
Imagine my horror, therefore, when on reaching my&#xD;
abode, I found that the very disorder from which I&#xD;
had hoped to escape, was raging with tenfold fury in&#xD;
Madisonville. The Idiotic Boy, first among the vic-&#xD;
tims, had already started a daily, and was astonishing&#xD;
the human race with the wisdom and genius of his&#xD;
leaders. Three secret prospectuses were in circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
THE NEWSPAPER PROJECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
for rival sheets; and even the military had not escaped&#xD;
the distemper. The whole Buzz-Saw Division had&#xD;
turned job-printers, and every stationer and bookseller&#xD;
in town was printing posters. I asked the Honest&#xD;
Jew, how much the average profits of a newspaper,&#xD;
were ; and he answered with glowing eyeballs, that a&#xD;
daily newspaper made a hundred thousand dollars&#xD;
every three days; and that it was his intention to set&#xD;
two running at once, in a large building fronting on&#xD;
two streets-a newspaper at each end. Both, he said,&#xD;
could be printed from the same form, and as the public&#xD;
would never read either, they would not discover the&#xD;
base deception.&#xD;
"The press of Madison ville is already large," I be-&#xD;
gan; "its papers, in fact, are more numerous than its&#xD;
readers; and if we are to establish a new concern, or&#xD;
seize an old one, we must advocate some principle that&#xD;
nobody believed, or ever can believe; so that ours will&#xD;
be the exclusive organ of that Idea, and meet with no&#xD;
competition."&#xD;
"Vat brinciple do . you call dat ? " enquired the Is-&#xD;
raelite.&#xD;
" That," I replied, "is yet to be evolved from the&#xD;
Mammoth Brain of him now before you; it is a ques-&#xD;
tion of intellect that I alone can solve."&#xD;
"I have him ! " said the Jew.&#xD;
"What is it?" I asked.&#xD;
"No brinciple ! "he replied, with a look of triumph.&#xD;
"Brinciple be tampt ! Bublish a baper mit no brin-&#xD;
ciple at all."&#xD;
But the great Idea, I saw, was Consolidation. I&#xD;
would buy or seize all the newspaper establishments&#xD;

in Madisonville ; all their presses, all their types. I&#xD;
would then construct a building of gigantic propor-&#xD;
tions, eighteen stories high and five thousand feet&#xD;
front on four streets, and into this magnificent temple&#xD;
of art should be put all the materials of all the offices&#xD;
in this city ; and my great mind and overshadowing&#xD;
genius should be the ruling and guiding spirit of the&#xD;
splendid whole. All rival factions would then bow to&#xD;
me, and all give me their patronage. The lion should&#xD;
lie down with the laib, the Confederate with the&#xD;
Yankee, the tiger with the jackass, the elephant with&#xD;
the baboon, and the greatest man of the age should&#xD;
lead them. Filled with this Idea, even as my insides&#xD;
were tilled with liquid Rum, I arose and issued the&#xD;
following&#xD;

General Order No. 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
HEADQUARTERS,&#xD;
DEPA RTMENT OF MADISONVILLE,&#xD;
Madisonville, La., Oct. 1st, 1863.&#xD;
&#xD;
The General Commanding announces that the Army of Madison-&#xD;
ville is hereby dissolved. The men have fought bravely without&#xD;
pay, and l should consider it an insult to their pride and patriot-&#xD;
ism to offer them money in this late stage of their protracted de-&#xD;
privations and sulThrings. They will, therefore, be immediately&#xD;
mustered out of the service without further compensation than the&#xD;
consciousness of having done their duty, and of having served&#xD;
under the greatest warrior of ancient or modern times. The&#xD;
money which would have been paid to the troops under different&#xD;
circumstances, will be turned over to the honest Jew, who will&#xD;
disburse the same in accordance with verbal instructions from&#xD;
these headquarters. Soldiers of the Department of Madisonville !&#xD;
your swords shall be beaten into printing presses, and your bay-&#xD;
onets into ink-rollers; no more shall you grapple with bloody&#xD;
foes, but you shall stick type and do job printing. But, under all&#xD;
circumstances, you will be cheered by the grateful reflection that&#xD;
your General will retain his rank and pay, whether sweating&#xD;

blood on-the field of carnage, or swaying the destinies of the hu-&#xD;

By command of MAJOR GENERAL JAMES B. MACPHERSON.&#xD;
THE IDIOTIC Boy, Chief of Staff.&#xD;
Thus, Consolidation and the downfall of all rivalry&#xD;
is the grand Idea that now possesses me. I shall ex-&#xD;
change the gray gory garments of war for the editorial&#xD;
robe, and shall make my paper the organ of every prin-&#xD;
ciple and sentiment known to mankind. I shall take&#xD;
one position in one article and follow it immediately br&#xD;
another, taking a directly opposite view ; and thus will&#xD;
I be able to conciliate all conflicting opinions and in-&#xD;
terests. Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars&#xD;
that make ambition virtue ! Oh, farewell the braying&#xD;
mule and the shrill trumpet, the ear-piercing fife, the&#xD;

TIE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
MACPIIERSON, DISGUSTED WITH THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS, RE-&#xD;
SOLVES 1O   ACQUIRE OFFICE AND CIVIL RENOWN.-THE&#xD;
RESTORATION OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT IN LOUISIANA.-MAC-&#xD;
PHERSON IS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, ETC., ETC.&#xD;
NOTE.-The pro-slavery party of Louisiana, hoping to retain the&#xD;
"divine institution" in New Orleans and other parishes where it was&#xD;
not abolished by the President's Proclamation, formed a scheme to&#xD;
hold an election on the second day of November, 1863, the day fixed by&#xD;
the old( Constitution, for a Governor, Congressmen, State officers, and&#xD;
a Legislature. Of course there could have been no legality or au-&#xD;
thority in such an election, since it had not been called by the Gov-&#xD;
ernor, or countenanced in any manner by the military authorities.&#xD;
rT he State officers who were in Louisiana previous to the outbreak&#xD;
of the rebellion, had deserted their posts and joined the Confed-&#xD;
eracy ; and the only government in Louisiana, since the occupation&#xD;
of New Orleans by the United States forces, has been the military&#xD;
government. A few Copperheads-perhaps twenty, all told-met&#xD;
secretly in Masonic Hall, and nominated candidates for the different&#xD;
offices. Their proceedings and designs were kept profoundly secret,&#xD;
as long as possible. 'They determined that on the Wednesday pre-&#xD;
ceding the election, they would issue a call for a mass-meeting, to&#xD;
be held the next Saturday evening, to ratify their nominations. In&#xD;
other words, the people were to have five days' notice before the&#xD;
election. The matter "leaked out," however, a little sooner than&#xD;
the conspirators intended to have it. But on the Wednesday pre-&#xD;
ceding the day fixed for the election, the Masonic Hall clique issued&#xD;
an 4 Address to the People of Louisiana," calling upon them to con-&#xD;
vene at the usual places of voting, the next Monday, and elect civil&#xD;
officers, and assuring them there was "nothing to prevent" it; that&#xD;
th e military would not interfere, and that this course would meet the&#xD;
approval of the national government. "On the second of November,&#xD;
then," said the address, "go to the polls and cast your votes as usual ;&#xD;
your chosen Congressmen will take their seats on the first Monday of&#xD;
December ; your chosen Legislators will meet on the third Monday&#xD;
of January and organise; your State olficers will on the same day be&#xD;
&#xD;
MACPHERSON IN THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS.             189&#xD;
inaugurated, and thus the wheels of civil government will be once&#xD;
more set in motion in our State, and we trust prosperously and for&#xD;
the benefit of mankind. Fail to make this little effort, and your last&#xD;
opportunity for renewing Civil State Government, in accordance&#xD;
with legal provisions, will fruitlessly pass, with the probable de-&#xD;
struction of Republican Institutions. * * *&#xD;
"Let us arise, then, and go forth and perform the imperative and&#xD;
sacred duty of electing the officers of a Civil Government in Louisi-&#xD;
ana, on Monday, the second day of November, the time appointed by&#xD;
our laws ; and if we fail, it may be the last time we will have the&#xD;
power of acting as freemen."&#xD;
The purpose of this movement, it was well understood, was to re-&#xD;
store the infamous Black Code of Louisiana-a code most barbarous&#xD;
in its provisions-and to re-establish slavery on its former founda-&#xD;
tions. But the scheme, as soon as it was exposed, subjected its&#xD;
authors to such ridicule and contempt, that they "backed out" of it,&#xD;
and published an announcement that the election would not be held,&#xD;
since it was feared that the people would not vote ! But the end it&#xD;
seems was not yet ; for the gentlemen who were nominated by Masonic&#xD;
Hall, had the assurance to claim that they were entitled to exercise&#xD;
the offices for which they were named, on the ground that had the&#xD;
election been held, they would have received a majority of the votes!&#xD;
Nearly all the men nominated by Masonic Hall for State officers&#xD;
were residents of New Orleans. Some of them were notorious for&#xD;
their rebel proclivities; some had signed or voted for the Ordinance&#xD;
of Secession, in the Convention of 1861.&#xD;
MADIsoIL~vLE, LA.,&#xD;
October 30th, 1863.&#xD;
Sm :-As the Devil, after the great secession move-&#xD;
meut described by Milton, was hurled headlong flam-&#xD;
ing from the ethereal sky, with hideous ruin and com-&#xD;
bustion, down to bottomless perdition, there to dwell&#xD;
in  adamantine chains and penal fire, so had I been&#xD;
pitched heels over head from the lofty position I once&#xD;
occupied, and was nowhere. The few days' experience&#xD;
I had in the newspaper business came near worrying&#xD;
the life out of me. Every five minutes during the&#xD;
night, my door-bell would ring furiously, and ,some&#xD;
new candidate for newspaperial fame and wealth would&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6747-00000096"/>&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
present himself, with propositions to buy me out at&#xD;
half price or to steal the concern outright, until finally&#xD;
in disgust I told the Honest J ew to take the whole con-&#xD;
cern and go to the devil with it, or anywhere else, pro-&#xD;
vided he would give me an hour's sleep.&#xD;
11 having disbanded the army of Madisonville, and the&#xD;
Buzz-Saw Division having all turned job printers, I&#xD;
have felt my powers sensibly decline. I turned my at-&#xD;
tention to philosophy, which is a good thing in its way ;&#xD;
but even Socrates was as poor as a Confederate pack-&#xD;
horse, and was abused for it by his wife. In short, phi-&#xD;
losophy don't pay bills. Therefore, having lost military&#xD;
power, I determined to acquire enough civil grandeur&#xD;
to make up for it ; and I planned a grand scheme for&#xD;
inaugurating civil ,government in Louisiana. Secresy&#xD;
was very important, since the plot was one so wise that&#xD;
the lubberly-headed niasses of the people could never&#xD;
comprehend or appreciate it. Therefore, I called a&#xD;
meeting of the faithful in the attic of my dilapidated&#xD;
hospitable abode, to lay before them the splendid con-&#xD;
ception that had sprung from my Mammoth Brain.&#xD;
The better to ensure secresy, a grip and pass-word were&#xD;
adopted. The grip consisted of a grab at the nasal or-&#xD;
gan, and the pass-worcl was : " Treasury."  The fol-&#xD;
lowing distinguished statesmen were present&#xD;
James Buchanan Macpherson, the Confederate Phi-&#xD;
losopher and Southern Blower ; his son, and Chief of&#xD;
Staff; the Idiotic Boy ; his Quartermaster, the honest&#xD;
Jew ; his Commissary, the Unhappy Cuss ; his Chief&#xD;
of Cavalry, the Solitary Horseman ; his Chief of Artil-&#xD;
lery, the Inconsolable Thug ; his Chief of Signal Corps,&#xD;
the Southern Source ; his Judge Advocate, the Weep-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing Orphan; his Aids-de-Camp, the Macedonian, the&#xD;
Reliable Gentleman, and the Cussed Fool of Carondelet-&#xD;
street.&#xD;
It was a touching sight, and one calculated to bring&#xD;
tears to the eyes of an alligator, to look upon this as-&#xD;
sembly of fallen greatness. Every man of them had&#xD;
enjoyed a fat office under me in the days of my martial&#xD;
glory ; but now they looked like a set of darned loafers,&#xD;
with lank jaws and seedy breeches. They reminded&#xD;
me of the congregation of registered enemies that Satan&#xD;
got around him in the infernal regions, after his repulse&#xD;
by the heavenly army. I arose and addressed them&#xD;
as follows:&#xD;
.Jfacpherson's Address.&#xD;
"Fellow-citizens of Louisiana ! We address you as&#xD;
loyal to the Government." [A voice : "Which Govern-&#xD;
ment ?"] Jlfiacpherson: "None of your d-d business,&#xD;
you hounds! Wait till my scheme is put into execu-&#xD;
tion, and then learn what it is by the results. As loyal&#xD;
citizens you have duties to perform to me and your-&#xD;
selves, your State and country. We are in danger, and&#xD;
immediate action is required. The fact is, you are like&#xD;
me in one respect-you all want office; and the want&#xD;
of civil government in our State can, by a proper effort&#xD;
on your part, soon be supplied, under laws and a Con-&#xD;
stitution formed and adopted by yourselves, in a time&#xD;
of profound peace. It is made your duty as well as&#xD;
your right, to meet at the usual places, and cast your&#xD;
votes for me as Governor, and for yourselves to fill the&#xD;
best offices in the State. Heretofore in our history the&#xD;
direction of these elections has been had by legal&#xD;

agents ; but the legal agents now have no authority of&#xD;
any sort, and, therefore, we will take charge of the&#xD;
whole business ourselves. We held a State election in&#xD;
1861, and nothing has since happened that amounts to&#xD;
any thing. We promise you that the military will not&#xD;
interfere, there being none in this part of the country ;&#xD;
and we think we can assure you that your action in&#xD;
this respect will meet the approval of the National Gov-&#xD;
ernment." [A voice : "Which National Government ?"]&#xD;
Jfacpherson : "Dry up, you vagabond ! We urge upon&#xD;
you action in this important crisis. It will convince&#xD;
the world of our wish and determination to manage the&#xD;
offices of the State and the public revenue in the man-&#xD;
ner most satisfactory to ourselves ; it will encourage all&#xD;
desirous of making a splurge in other States, and will&#xD;
have a tendency to cause the soldiers to throw down&#xD;
their arms, and give us our own way, overawed by the&#xD;
civil grandeur that will surround us. Go to the polls&#xD;
then ! Your Governor will assume his constitutional&#xD;
functions, and the Legislature will convene in Madi&#xD;
sonville forthwith ; your Congressmen will take their&#xD;
seats as soon as they can find them." [A voice: "In&#xD;
Washington or in Richmond ?"]&#xD;
3facpherson: "Silence, you low-lived scoundrel!&#xD;
It is our intention to assume our old status, in order&#xD;
that we can clear the State of Yankee office-holders,&#xD;
and whip our niggers under our own vine and fig-tree,&#xD;
with none to molest or to make us afraid. Let us&#xD;
arise, then, and go forth and perform the imperative&#xD;
and sacred duty of electing ourselves to office ; and if&#xD;
we fail, it may be the last time we shall have the&#xD;
power of acting as freemen-that is, thrashing the&#xD;

niggers and spending the public fund according to our&#xD;
own discretion !&#xD;
At the conclusion of this able and patriotic address,&#xD;
a burst of applause greeted me like the roar of battle.&#xD;
The Southern Source then arose, and stated that he&#xD;
had just had an interview with Jeff. Davis, and had&#xD;
been assured of his approval and support. The Em-&#xD;
peror of France had also promised a land and naval&#xD;
force to co-operate with the new governor. [Applause.]&#xD;
The Idiotic Boy was loudly called for, but declined&#xD;
to speak, as he was about to be a candidate for the&#xD;
suffrages of his fellow-citizens for one of the highest&#xD;
offices in their gift. Modesty,.he said, prevented him&#xD;
addressing the audience; but he nevertheless went on&#xD;
and spoke two columns, saying that the facts of seces-&#xD;
sion and rebellion had changed nothing, except to turn&#xD;
the offices over to the present company, which he be-&#xD;
lieved to be a good thing. In conclusion, he expressed&#xD;
the hope that the advertising and job work necessary&#xD;
to be done, would be given to the paper with which it&#xD;
was well known he was connected. [Hisses by the&#xD;
Honest Jew and other publishers.] I interfered, say-&#xD;
ing, that the newspaper business had played out, and&#xD;
had nothing to do with political questions.&#xD;
The Honest Jew said: " Pefore I gives mine subbort&#xD;
of der measure, I vish to know if I be made Dreasurer.&#xD;
You makes me Dreasurer, I zteals the bublic funds&#xD;
and tivides mit you vun half the brofit !" [Applause,&#xD;
and the nomination of the Honest Jew as State Treas-&#xD;
urer by acclamation.]&#xD;

Grand Ratification ]ileeting.&#xD;
It was voted unanimously that time was of great&#xD;
consequence, and that the sooner we were elected the&#xD;
surer we would be of our offices. Wishing, however,&#xD;
to give the lubberly-headed people a fair show, we called&#xD;
a grand Ratification Meeting, to be held at Merritt's&#xD;
Hotel, in Madisonville, the next morning at five o'clock.&#xD;
The sun was not up when the assembly convened,&#xD;
but that made no difference. On motion, James B.&#xD;
Macpherson, of Madisonville, was chosen President; and&#xD;
the Idiotic Boy, of Madisonville, was appointed Secre-&#xD;
tary. A list of Vice-Presidents was then appointed as&#xD;
follows: The Unhappy Cuss, of Madisonville; the&#xD;

of Madisonville; the Weeping Orphan, of Madisonville ;&#xD;

The audience consisted of the Inconsolable Thug, of&#xD;
Madisonville, the bar-keeper of Merritt's Madisonville&#xD;
Hotel (drunk), and three niggers of Madisonville, sleep-&#xD;
ing on the sidewalk.&#xD;
"Fellow-citizens of Louisiana !" I said, "I am thank-&#xD;

ful for the honor conferred upon me, in being called to&#xD;
preside over the deliberations of this great assembly.&#xD;
I am happy to greet my fellow-citizens of Louisiana&#xD;
upon this auspicious occasion. [Three cheers by the&#xD;
Inconsolable Thug, who knocked down the barkeeper,&#xD;
by way of a 'tiger.']  Our principles are well known.&#xD;
We go for restoring the State as it was before the Yan-&#xD;
kee brates came down here and took New Orleans ; and&#xD;
we believe that the offices of a State belong to the&#xD;
great men of the State. If elected to the office of Gov-&#xD;
ernor by the suffrages of the people, I shall perform the&#xD;
duties of the office in a manner perfectly satisfactory&#xD;
to myself." [Applause on the platform.]&#xD;
The Idiotic Boy suggested that the ticket had been&#xD;
enthusiastically endorsed by the people of Louisiana,&#xD;
and that the election ought to come off at six o'clock the&#xD;
same morning. We therefore adjourned to the usual&#xD;
places of holding elections, and in fifteen minutes there-&#xD;
after the polls closed. The result was proclaimed&#xD;
in a loud tone of voice, and it was found that every&#xD;
candidate nominated in the attic had been elected with-&#xD;
out opposition.&#xD;
The only disturbance at the polls was occasioned by&#xD;
the Inconsolable Thug, vho rolled up his coat and&#xD;
pulled off his sleeves, and fought the barkeeper and&#xD;
the niggers for the drinks.&#xD;
At seven o'clock A. Mi. of the same day, I was solemnly&#xD;
inaugurated Governor of the State of Louisiana. The&#xD;
ceremonies were performed at Merritt's Hotel, Madi-&#xD;
sonville. A high stool was arranged in front of the&#xD;
bar, with a decanter and glass within reach; and on&#xD;
this stool I took my seat, looking as wise as though I&#xD;

while on my left was the Lieutenant-Governor elect and&#xD;
the other State dignitaries. The oath was administered&#xD;
by the barkeeper, after which I delivered the following&#xD;
Inaugural Address:&#xD;
"Fellow-citizens of Louisiana! It is customary on&#xD;
occasions of the solemn inauguration of the Chief&#xD;
Magistrate of the State, that his predecessor should be&#xD;
present. But in the present instance I am    authorised&#xD;
to say that it is not convenient for Governor Moore to&#xD;
attend. I beg leave to say that I shall pursue the&#xD;
same policy that he did, and I sincerely pray that my&#xD;
gubernatorial career may be crowned with results no&#xD;
less brilliant than those he realised."&#xD;
Amid the plaudits of the crowd, I was then escorted&#xD;
to the D. H. Abode, now become the Executive Man-&#xD;
sion, amid salvos of artillery from a hundred-pound&#xD;
wooden howitzer.     I rode on a triumphal horse-car&#xD;
decorated with old newspapers and drawn by eight&#xD;
jackasses. The officers of State having been sworn in,&#xD;
I issued the following :&#xD;

MADISONVILLE, LA.,&#xD;
Dec. 31st, 1863.&#xD;
S1R:-Since my elevation to the lofty position of&#xD;
Governor of Louisiana, every Confederate within five&#xD;
thousand miles of Madisonville has applied to me for&#xD;
an office. I was delighted beyond measure to see the&#xD;
amount of patriotism which these faithful sons of chiv-&#xD;
alry possessed. Every one of them, I found, had first&#xD;
raised the Confederate flag in New Orleans, and had&#xD;
been, last to pull it down when the infernal Yankees&#xD;
took possession of that impregnable city. Every one&#xD;
of them had suffered tenfold persecution, and the ago-&#xD;
nies of purgatorial punishment for the holy cause of&#xD;
Southern rights; and there was not one who did not&#xD;
declare that his soul would swell with gratitude, if I&#xD;
would point out to him a method in which he might&#xD;
immediately spend the remnants of his fortune and&#xD;
pour out his heart's blood for the sacred Confed-&#xD;
eracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6747-00000101"/>&#xD;
t&#xD;
t&#xD;
a&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
how the Governor got rid of 'em.&#xD;
"Sweet Confederate patriots !" I said, addressing&#xD;
them from the roof of the house; "you all want office.&#xD;
I sympathise with your honorable ambition and I will&#xD;
give every one of you a position [loud shouts of&#xD;
apljplause on all sides] on certain terms. [Many voices:&#xD;
Give us the terms, Governor!' and, ' We accept.']&#xD;
Don't be in a hurry about accepting, you hounds! un-&#xD;
til you hear the conditions. You are all anxious to&#xD;
serve the Confederacy in the most effectual manner.&#xD;
[Cries of 'yes,' 'that's so,' et cetera.]  You would&#xD;
willingly lay down your lives, your fortunes, and your&#xD;
sacred honor on the glorious altar of Southern Inde-&#xD;
pendence. [Loud cries of 'yes,' and 'bully for the&#xD;
Gov. !']  Well, sweet ones! you shall be accomino-&#xD;
dated. [Cheers and shouts for fifteen minutes.]&#xD;
Every one of you shall have a posish under my admin-&#xD;
istration, if you will enlist in the Confederate army for&#xD;
three years or during the war, unless sooner dis-&#xD;
charged !"&#xD;
A hum of voices was heard on all sides, like that&#xD;
described by Homer, when the Greeks issued from&#xD;
their black ships to pounce upon Priam. It grew&#xD;
fainter and fainter, until it fell upon the ear like strains&#xD;
of distant music, and then it died out altogether. On&#xD;
looking about me, I discovered that the vast assembly&#xD;
of patriots had disappeared. Every mother's son of&#xD;
'em had skedaddled ; not one has since asked for an&#xD;
office or shown his head in Madisonville.&#xD;
&#xD;
The True Southern Patriot.&#xD;
I then made the acquaintance of the True Southern.&#xD;
Patriot; the man who didn't want office. He was a&#xD;
man of meek manners, and said he only caine to assure&#xD;
me of his supreme admiration of my great abilities,&#xD;
and that he was mine respectfully until death should&#xD;
us part. I asked him if lie would like to go to Con-&#xD;
gress, whereupon he seemed stricken with horror.&#xD;
No," he replied, " the time of my political ambition&#xD;
has passed; nothing on earth would induce me to&#xD;
accept an office."&#xD;
On questioning him, I found that he already held&#xD;
four offices under the Confederate Government; and&#xD;
to this fact I attributed his reluctance to take a posish.&#xD;
The Idiotic Boy chastised.&#xD;
I have prepared my letters to Tu Eux for publica-&#xD;
tion in book form, and the manuscript has already&#xD;
gone on to the publisher in New York. It will be the&#xD;
greatest work that ever emanated from the human. in-&#xD;
tellect, and as a history of Confederate Glory will&#xD;
equal in truthfulness the story of Sinbad the Sailor. I&#xD;
gathered all the letters together in a big pile, and&#xD;
taking up a pair of scissors, remarked to the Idiotic&#xD;
Boy that I should cut from them every part not worth&#xD;
printing.&#xD;
"If you do that," replied the Imbecile Youth,&#xD;
"your book will not make two pages."&#xD;
I flogged him like Satan for that speech. But when&#xD;

202          THE MACPHERSON LETTERS.&#xD;
I came to look over the letters, I found he was alto-&#xD;
gether too near the truth, and for this I flogged him&#xD;
again within an inch of his life.&#xD;
The Governor' 8Pilgrimage to Richmond.&#xD;
As the faithful Mohammedans make a pilgrimage&#xD;
to Mecca for the good of the soul, so did I start for&#xD;
Richmond in the search of political power. It will be&#xD;
remembered by the readers of my former able produc-&#xD;
tion, that at the time I was elected Governor of Loui-&#xD;
siana, a whole set of State officers was chosen, and that&#xD;
the Cussed Fool and the Solitary Horseman were&#xD;
elected as representatives in Congress. The election&#xD;
was held in Madisonville before daylight, on the morn-&#xD;
ing of October 28th, 1863, and the barkeeper of Mer-&#xD;
ritt's Hotel administered the oath of office. It may&#xD;
seem strange that the Chief Magistrate of a great State&#xD;
should be hard up; but such, nevertheless, was the&#xD;
case: for the Treasurer, the Honest Jew, stole all the&#xD;
money, and ran away. I therefore called a council of&#xD;
State, and addressed them as follows:&#xD;
"Brother dignitaries of the Commonwealth of Loui-&#xD;
siana ! called, as all of us were, by the unanimous suf-&#xD;
frages and sufferings of our fellow-citizens, to uphold&#xD;
the dignity and power of the State, and to dispose of'&#xD;
the public revenue according to the dictates of our own&#xD;
consciences, it becomes our duty to stand by the ship&#xD;
of State in adversity .as well as in prosperity. Honest&#xD;
poverty has been held as a mark of honor by the wisest&#xD;
sages of antiquity ; and if it be in truth an honor, then&#xD;
are we entitled to the highest respect, for there isn't a&#xD;
&#xD;
red in the treasury, and it becomes our duty to raise the&#xD;
wind. Happily, an honorable way is open for the ac-&#xD;
complishment of this most desirable object. I have&#xD;
therefore to propose that the Cussed Fool and the Sol-&#xD;
itary Horseman shall go to Richmond to get seats in&#xD;
Congress, if possible. But for fear they may not sue:&#xD;
ceed, I will go with them, and we will collect mileage&#xD;
from the Sergeant-at-arms, before their claim is passed&#xD;
upon by the House. This will yield a very handsome&#xD;
sum, and we will divide it equally among the various&#xD;
officers of the State."&#xD;
This proposition was received with loud shouts of ap-&#xD;
proval; and accompanied by the two members of Con-&#xD;
gress and the Idiotic Boy (Lieutenant Governor), we set&#xD;
out for the great Confederate capital. I journeyed over&#xD;
hills and mountains and through valleys, until I ar-&#xD;
rived in a big swamp, which, I was told, was. formerly&#xD;
known as the Chickahominy Bottoms, but is now called&#xD;
Strategy Swamp, because a whole army got swamped&#xD;
while practising strategy in those gloomy regions. I&#xD;
sank to my middle every time I stepped; and the Idi-&#xD;
otic Boy informed me that it only required a siege of&#xD;
the malarious fever to ruin my constitution and com-&#xD;
plete my military education.&#xD;
I then debouched from the woods, and, lo and be-&#xD;
hold ! the city of Jeff. Davis loomed upon my vision.&#xD;
"0 great Confederate Jerusalem !" I exclaimed, "as all&#xD;
the honest Jews shall some day be gathered together in&#xD;
Palestine, so shall all the Confeclerates soon swarm with-&#xD;
in thy gates, when Meade, Grant, and Gilmore im-&#xD;
piously crowd them up in one place. And as the foot-&#xD;
print of Mohammed is preserved in a sacred temple, so&#xD;

shall the mark of my Confederate shoes form a shrine&#xD;
for future generations ?"&#xD;
We then advanced to the city by the right flank, and&#xD;
I immediately visited the Executive Mansion, and had&#xD;
an interview with Jeff. Davis. Jeff. was glad to see&#xD;
me, but said he had been a little more near-sighted than&#xD;
usual since Chickamauga. I told him we came as rep-&#xD;
resentatives of a great principle.&#xD;
"What piriciple is that ?" asked Jeff-&#xD;
"Mileage," I answered.&#xD;
lie said he hoped we would succeed, and that the&#xD;
best plan would be to get the Clerk of tle House&#xD;
drunk, and hire him to place the names of the two&#xD;
Congressmen on the roll before any objection was&#xD;
raised ; and then to apply immediately to the Sergeant-&#xD;
at-arms for mileage.&#xD;
It is a melancholy fact that the human mind is so&#xD;
constituted, in some instances, that it is open to the&#xD;
voice of duty and justice only after it has received the&#xD;
inducement of a liberal fee. And it is providential,&#xD;
perhaps, that the Louisiana Delegation had no money;&#xD;
otherwise we might have been tempted to try to bribe&#xD;
the Clerk. But we found this unnecessary. The Clerk&#xD;
was anxious to be re-elected, and in order to accomplish&#xD;
this he determined not to enroll the names of any but&#xD;
those who would vote for him, and a promise to vote&#xD;
for him was all that was needed to secure a place on&#xD;
the roll of members.&#xD;
The great and molnentons day at last arrived for&#xD;
Congress to assemble.  The Louisiana Delegation&#xD;
looked pale and ihvjgard, but I told them I would stand&#xD;
by them until they got their mileage. We approached&#xD;
&#xD;
MACPHERSON9S TWO DELEGATES IN CONGRESS.        205&#xD;
the Sergeant-at-arms, where, in accordance with in-&#xD;
structions, the Cussed Fool and the Solitary Horseman&#xD;
fell prostrate before that official dignitary, and in tears&#xD;
and lamentations sufficient to move a house, implored&#xD;
him to pay them their mileage. The Sergeant-at-arms&#xD;
replied that he didn't see it, and I haven't seen it yet&#xD;
myself.&#xD;
The Louisiana Delegation then arose to its feet, and&#xD;
we all went into the House of Representatives together,&#xD;
when the following proceedings occurred:&#xD;
Mr. STEVENS. said : I ask to have the credentials of&#xD;
the persons claiming to be representatives from Louisi-&#xD;
ana read.&#xD;
CLEnK just drunk enough to be funny).-The Clerk&#xD;
will gratify the curiosity of the gentleman. [Laughter&#xD;
by the Idiotic Boy, the Louisiana Delegation, and me.]&#xD;
Now came the greatest triumph of my life ; for the&#xD;
Clerk proceeded to read, in a clear and distinct tone of&#xD;
voice, the credentials which I had prepared by four&#xD;
weeks' labor, and a careful study of Webster's Diction-&#xD;
ary and the Black Code of Louisiana:&#xD;
CREDENTIALS.&#xD;
I, James Buchanan Macpherson, Governor of the State of Lou-&#xD;
isiana, duly and legally elected by the voters of said State, in pur-&#xD;
suance of my twenty-second letter to the EuA, and the Constitu-&#xD;
tion and laws, and inaugurated by taking the oath administered&#xD;
by the barkeeper of Merritt's Hotel, do certify that at an election&#xD;
begun and held in Madisonville, before daylight, on the morning of&#xD;
the twenty-eighth day of October, 1863, in accordance with Masonic&#xD;
Hall, for the purpose of electing Representatives from said State&#xD;
and raising the wind, the following named persons were regularly&#xD;
elected to represent said State in said Congress for the term of&#xD;
two years from the fourth day of March, 1863, namely :&#xD;

All of whom were regularly elected in accordance with the&#xD;
Constitution and Laws of said State of Louisiana, as by me con-&#xD;
strued and interpreted.&#xD;
In testimony whereof, I, James Buchanan Macpherson, Author&#xD;
of the Confederate Arithmetic, Traveller through the Louisiana&#xD;
Lowlands Low, Clergyman, Poet, Philosopher, Plato of the Con-&#xD;
federacy, Warrior, great Southern Blower, and Governor, elected&#xD;
as afore'aid, do hereby commission said persons, so elected as&#xD;
aforesaid and duly sworn, to represent said State in the said Con-&#xD;
federate Congress, on condition that they shall pay my hotel bills&#xD;
as long as 1 remain in Richmond, and divide their mileage with&#xD;
me honorably and justly; and I do hereby give these credentials&#xD;
in evidence of their fair and square election ; and I do hereby af-&#xD;
fix my private seal of office, my predecessor and friend, Moore,&#xD;
having carried off the great seal, and having had no opportunity to&#xD;
send it back, in consequence of General Banks chasing him like&#xD;
the devil last spring, from which he has never recovered; and&#xD;
my said private seal I have hereunto affixed this twentieth day of&#xD;
November, in the third year of Jeff. Davis, and the year of our&#xD;
Lord, 1863.&#xD;
JAMES BUCHANAN MACPHERSON,&#xD;
Governor of the State of Louisiana.&#xD;
My private seal, which I affixed to the above docu-&#xD;
ment, is the picture of a jackass grabbing at a crib be-&#xD;
yond his reach.&#xD;
Stevens moved to strike the name of the Cussed Fool&#xD;
and the solitary horseman from the roll of members ;&#xD;
but was induced to withdraw it, and we proceeded to&#xD;
the election of a speaker. The Louisiana Delegation&#xD;
voted for a candidate of their own, and thus succeeded&#xD;
in getting their names in the Congressional proceedings.&#xD;
The future historian, the unborn ierodotus, will be&#xD;
struck with the appearance of those euphonious names,&#xD;
and he will also be struck by the fact that they never&#xD;
appear afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
BROOKS SUSTAINS THE LOUISIANIANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
207&#xD;
&#xD;
After the election of a speaker, the members went&#xD;
up to be sworn ; and now there was a row with the&#xD;
Louisiana Delegation. Stevens objected to the Louisi-&#xD;
ana Delegation, and Brooks came forward, prompt&#xD;
as ever, to vindicate the cause of innocence and justice.&#xD;
He said that he hoped the House would go on in the ordi-&#xD;
nary way, and swear in every man, woman, and child&#xD;
that applied for admission. It was hard work to stand,&#xD;
and he thought the gentlemen from Louisiana should&#xD;
have seats. If, after admitting them and paying their&#xD;
mileage, it should be found desirable to get rid of them,&#xD;
they could be kicked out or put out in any manner the&#xD;
House should determine. lie knew nothing of the&#xD;
rights of the members from Louisiana, and he didn't&#xD;
care a damn, so long as they were good Confederates&#xD;
and would vote on his side. The country was rich and&#xD;
could afford to pay. These gentlemen had come a long&#xD;
distance for seats, and it would not be in accordance&#xD;
with the rules of chivalry or hospitality to keep them&#xD;
standing, except on one of the standing committees.&#xD;
Memminger could easily print off a few more treasury&#xD;
notes. [Applause by the Louisiana Delegation.]&#xD;
STEvENs.-These credentials are no credentials at all.&#xD;
Who has ever heard of this pretended Gov. Macpherson?&#xD;
[Voice-" Read THE ERA."] By what right does he&#xD;
claim that title ? There has been no election in. Louisi-&#xD;
ana, and how was it possible for anybody to get elected?&#xD;
Brooks moved that Macpherson's Twenty-second Let-&#xD;
ter, containing an account of the State election be read&#xD;
for the information of the ignoramus who had just taken&#xD;
his seat. He would there find an official account of the&#xD;
election and its results. But it made no difference&#xD;

&#xD;
whether there had been an election or not. He put it&#xD;
upon the ground of courtesy. These gentlemen had&#xD;
taken a great deal of trouble, and he believed if they&#xD;
were refused admittance others would be deterred from&#xD;
asking for seats in the House.&#xD;
Stevens moved to refer the members from Louisiana&#xD;
to the committee on credentials.&#xD;
Allen moved to lay the Delegation on the table.&#xD;
Lost. Stevens's motion was then carried; the banner of&#xD;
freedom and truth trailed in the dust ; the free-born&#xD;
citizens of Louisiana were virtually expelled from the&#xD;
house. From this moment, in my opinion, dates the&#xD;
visible decline of public virtue in the Confederacy.&#xD;
What encouragement is there, henceforth, for patriots&#xD;
ambitious to go to Congress ? None! What way is&#xD;
there left open by which a pennyless Governor like me&#xD;
can pay his hotel bills, if his friends get nothing to&#xD;
divide with him? None!&#xD;
The knees of the Cussed Fool knocked together, and&#xD;
it was in vain that I strove to administer consolation&#xD;
and hope to his wounded and bleeding soul. I asked&#xD;
him to show that the spirit of a man had some place in&#xD;
him yet, and to resign himself to his fate.&#xD;
" Resign !" said he, brightening up; " that is a good&#xD;
idea. I will resign myself," and immediately he wrote&#xD;
his resignation as member of Congress, which I accepted&#xD;
on the spot, and notified the Speaker of the fact in&#xD;
writing. But that leather-headed ignoramus said the&#xD;
Cussed Fool was no member at all, and he didn't see&#xD;
how he could resign a seat which he never possessed.&#xD;
Therefore, he would not trouble the House with the&#xD;
matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
The question then arose how we were to get away&#xD;
from the city without paying our bills. We finally hit&#xD;
upon the expedient of having every thing charged to.&#xD;
the Solitary Horseman, who still remains in Richmond&#xD;
waiting at the door of the House patiently, day by day,&#xD;
for the Committee on Credentials to let him in. He&#xD;
hopes by his patient conduct and meek looks, to arouse&#xD;
the pity of the House; and praying that he may suc-&#xD;
ceed, I remain,&#xD;
Yours, officially,&#xD;
