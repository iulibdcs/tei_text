            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN this work the author has not attempted so great folly as a real disguise, either
               of himself or his friends and pupils. But he has grouped together some of the
               striking every-day facts of an interesting period of his life, to show that real life
               is all full of romance. In most respects, though there are fables in it, and he is a
               poor critic who can not see them, this story of Castlereagh is a true narrative.
               Castlereagh represents a true person, although, in the coloring and intensity of his
               portraiture, he is simply IDEAL. He could not represent a true model, modestly, but
               in ideal.</p>
            <p>The many pupils of Lindenvale Institute, and the surviving though far-scattered
               tutors and helpers, will perceive where truth and fiction lie snugly enfolded
               together—where the fact has been highly fabled—where the fable is largely true, and
               where the foundation laid is firm or sandy. Although quick to make these discoveries,
               they will agree with Castlereagh that the picture here drawn, in its general
               outlines, has a very striking resemblance to Lindenvale Institute as it was.</p>

               <p>ELBERT CASTLEREAGH had been settled as pastor eight years in Richmond, a rural
                  township of New England. Of these, nearly six had been years of married life with
                  Sarah Matilda Hayward, whom he had found and married on the banks of the sweetly
                  flowing Raritan in New Jersey. They had two sons, John and Hobbs, and at the time
                  of which this record speaks, John was nearly three years of age, Hobbs less than
                  one year old.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh had thus wrought, for many years, in this retired township, "going out
                  and in" among the good people. He began to deem them weary years. And one evening,
                  just as the twilight deepening gathered<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6389-00000008"/>
                  ered the day into night, he sat down in the old and easy arm-chair of his study,
                  with any other than a cheerful, contended mind. Tired, harassed, drooping, the
                  young pastor complained that his field was not only hard of present cultivation,
                  but that it held out no brighter prospect in its future; a field remunerative-less
                  of peace, of improvement, of fame, where neither great or good results would ever
                  be developed. He sighed for a place more congenial and useful. His warmest
                  passions were enlisted in the cause of education. Oh! could he but connect those
                  two controlling elements of human life in one—religion and education—and from
                  early youth lead the mind into the pure and elevating seats of moral and mental
                  influence and refinement, it were a life, the worth to live. He long considered
                  the question. Long and earnestly sought for an answer to the inquiry, "Do not
                  prudential reasons and providential circumstances indicate a duty paramount to all
                  others?" and answered half affirmatively were all the inquiries that came up in
                  his fevered brow e'er judgment and long sober thought had weighed them well.</p>
               <p>By little and little Castlereagh had become dull in his pastorate. Little did he
                  care to make more and still richer flights in his burning and eloquent discourses.
                  He deemed the ears dull, and the hearts hard, of those to whom they were
                  addressed. Weary grew the walks over his much-loved parish. Sameness and tameness
                  stamped themselves on every scene, and object, and pursuit, grinning horribly upon
                  him. His food came tasteless to his lips, the bright eye dimmed, the dark locks
                  hung uncombed, and wife and children, in their fond love and embraces, could not
                  long keep him from his moods. And he resolved, (then faltered, again considered
                  it, and then fell back on present things,) that he would accept the bright light
                  that seemed to offer itself, and in the new and delightful parish of Linden-vale,
                  commence, in some unostentatious way, the work which long had been to him a bright
                  vision of hope for the land and the world.</p>
               <p>"We must," he said, "have a Christian education and a pure piety secured early to
                  the people, or farewell to all our confidences and wishes for the world."</p>
               <p>Elbert was right herein, but the delusion was in thinking he himself, with his own
                  single arm, could do the work of two; that a true and faithful pastor could also
                  take on him the labors of an educational establishment for the young, and assume
                  the constant care and training of an hundred opening minds; that one physical
                  constitution, and one mind, could labor easily and long endure the cares,
                  vexations, and excitements of the school-room and the pulpit at the same time. The
                  bright hope of his early life had been to teach great truths to others, and to
                  make man manly, beauty lovely, and religion graceful and all-controlling. He
                  looked with love and with pity on the young, and sighed for their complete
                  emancipation from ignorance, temptation, and passion. He had seen no brighter<pb
                     n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6389-00000009"/> vision than this along the path he had
                  been treading for eight years of his parochial life. What hope so great and well
                  founded as that of permanent piety, if connected with an educated, refined, and
                  studious mind? And he considered the toil, the self-denial, the great effort to
                  secure it, just as inviting as the laurel-crown to him who strove for precedence
                  in the athletic games and races. He weighed the good of a human soul against the
                  weary effort, and it was heavy with preponderating good.</p>
               <p>To disengage his thoughts from this study and its consequent result, kindly,
                  intelligently, and calmly reasoned his beloved Sarah. Her dissuasives were as
                  affectionately answered, and the husband, the scholar, the father, and Christian,
                  besought her to name no more the toil and hazard, but to co-operate with him, and
                  consummate a plan so hopeful of the most glorious and blessed results.</p>
               <p>The evening dimmed still more, the stars came out, the evening chirps and songs
                  began, and still Castle-reagh mooded. And by and by as he continued ruminating,
                  thrown back in his chair, a gentle rap on his door seemed to reach him, and a
                  stranger, bland, courteous, and refined, entered. Elbert would have arisen, but
                  ere he could do so, the soft pressure of the stranger's hand on his brow repressed
                  him, and at the same moment the incomer noiselessly glided to a seat.</p>
               <p>"I have come," said he, "to soothe you."</p>
               <p>"Ah!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I well know what it is that rests so heavily on your spirit."</p>
               <p>"Then tell me—oh! tell me—is it so, can it be that I do err?"</p>
               <p>"To err is human, Castlereagh. But not all of human kind do err beyond
                  forgiveness."</p>
               <p>"No; and yet my spirit can but faintly buoy itself above the flood of doubt and
                  conviction it is launched on; and to me, sometimes, there is a fearful admonition
                  in my doubts."</p>
               <p>"These are," the stranger said, and his long pale finger pointed upward—"these are
                  thy trials. Faith is searching in thee for her foundation. If there be in thy soul
                  a firm rock for her feet, thou shalt soon be at rest."</p>
               <p>Elbert trembled, though at what he scarcely knew. The words rung their own
                  powerful music in his heart, and they seemed to him fitted to compose the very
                  spirit they yet terrified.</p>
               <p>He arose and looked upon the stranger. Benignity and wisdom were impressed upon
                  his countenance, and he became more assured.</p>
               <p>"Shall I go forward," he inquired, "or shall I cast off the thought of good I
                  would do for the reality of that which, though I might, I do not?"</p>
               <p>"Would you see the stars, the moon, the sun itself in clouds? Would you, if it lay
                  in your power, pour the desolating monsoon over the desert, or water it as with
                  the river of God?"</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6389-00000010"/>
               <p>"True, <emph>true.</emph> I would fertilize and bless; I would do all that lies in
                  my <emph>power</emph>—"</p>
               <p>"Power! Is there not power pledged to thee? 'My grace is sufficient for
                  thee.'"</p>
               <p>"But consider, the promise may not be to those who with open eyes do err."</p>
               <p>"It is heaven's great guaranty to such as can, in all good doing, believe. If,
                  then, there is in thee more unbelief than faith, beware lest thy present doing
                  leave thee on the quicksands of works. There is no good in works alone."</p>
               <p>"I have labored here with my flock these eight comfortless years—no, I will not
                  say all comfortless and friendless, but with little in them of deep sympathetic
                  gladness, hope, and joy. I pine for a field where, beginning at the foundation, I
                  may build a goodly edifice of faith and love to the glory of God, and show to man
                  how pure and perfect may be on earth the Church of Jesus Christ the Lord,
                  purchased by His own most precious blood."</p>
               <p>"Castlereagh, that noble impulse has been <emph>given</emph> thee. It urges you
                  on; it denies you peace in the condition you now occupy. It is the will of Heaven.
                  Why do you linger?"</p>
               <p>"My wife, my best friends hold up admonitory fingers."</p>
               <p>"And your own conscience—?"</p>
               <p>"Bids me obey my impulses."</p>
               <p>"Conscience, that never yet erred, you resist, and to the minor object subject the
                  major. Can you not believe? Can you not put forth that power which is pledged and
                  given thee, and overcome? They only who gain the prize receive the crown. Thy
                  wife, thy children, thy friends, will all yet rejoice in thy conquest, and admire
                  the force, and wisdom, and benevolence of thy heart."</p>
               <p>Elbert reached forth his hand, the stranger grasped it. "Then you do from this
                  moment embrace the faithful impulse?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I will! I do!</emph>" was the firm reply.</p>
               <p>"Hear me, then," said the stranger: "I am your friend and guide, sent to you by
                  the all-controlling Guardian of your existence. You have now overcome the doubts
                  and the fearful hesitance that keep the human soul in bondage. Now, there is
                  nothing difficult to you. Every effort of your mind will be successful. All toil
                  that other men do know in consequence of lingering doubts and half-way purposes in
                  their pursuits, will to you but be as joyous pastime. You have but to will, and
                  disease abates, foes become friends, distance is annihilated, tears are dried up,
                  old age removes afar off, and every earnest desire or thought of the soul is
                  gratified. Do you seek to lead into the paths of wisdom, holiness, and peace, a
                  thousand youthful minds, and gird on them the armor of a glorious strife with
                  ignorance and sin? This desire, in all its essential features, will be gratified.
                  Indeed, it is foreknown that you will gather around you a noble enthusiastic<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6389-00000011"/> siastic band of youth, and teach them how
                  to live and die, who will, under your instruction and guidance, go out every where
                  to dress and keep in beauty and fragrance, as the garden of the Lord, the whole
                  land in which you dwell. The very dawn of a new era, namely, the era of CONFIDENCE
                  and VICTORY, has its culmination in you. Child of Destiny, to doubt now were a sin
                  of awful magnitude! Go forth, therefore; begin, struggle, conquer! You have put to
                  flight your only foes—your doubts. Henceforth <emph>confidence</emph> is the
                  weapon you will employ, and you will beat from your way every thing that may arise
                  to impede you."</p>
               <p>Here the stranger paused. Quickly a bright and cheerful sunbeam filled the room
                  with its light, and Elbert smiled. Then a dark gloom settled down upon the
                  apartment, a flash of vivid lightning followed it, and then the crashing thunder
                  rolled. The winds and the rains fell, and the earth was desolate and wild on every
                  side as far as the eye could reach. And by and by came forth the RAINBOW in all
                  its glorious colorings, and there was peace.</p>
               <p>"Behold!" said the stranger, "there is now peace. Such a result will crown your
                  labors. The darkness will be followed by light—the storm and tempest by a sweet, a
                  heavenly calm. You can not, do not longer doubt! You yield your heart and soul to
                  the pure work of goodness, and live henceforth to carry out the infinite and
                  glorious mission of your Creator!"</p>
               <p>Elbert pressed his hand heavily upon his heart, and bowed his very soul before the
                  stranger in the deepest reverence and truthfulness. He uttered no word, and seemed
                  to himself spell-bound and entranced by the presence and words of the being before
                  him.</p>
               <p>The two sat and gazed long one upon the other. The evening hours went on. Elbert
                  fancied the stranger smiled, and then crimsoned, and then his face grew dark and
                  solemn. Anon there came over it the bland, warm friendliness that had won him. He
                  raised his finger and pointed upward, and his eyes looked upward, and Castlereagh
                  looked upward. Thus gazing, and full of interest, that every moment grew more
                  intense and held him breathless, the stranger meantime seemed to fade away from
                  his sight, his hand relaxed its grasp, the place he occupied was tenantless.
                  Elbert started. A lamp burned clearly on the table, the door of his study was
                  opened, his wife was kneeling at his side and bathing his forehead and temples
                  with camphor. Their common friend and sympathizer, the bereaved and widowed Alice,
                  was rubbing his hands with flannel, the tender-hearted Mina, the servant, was
                  breezing him with the fan, and little Johnnie was wondering on his tiptoes over
                  the back of a chair.</p>
               <p>"Elbert!" cried Sarah, "Elbert! Elbert! what does distress you? How wildly you
                  have dreamed, and groaned, and mournfully sighed. Here, take and drink this cold
                  water that Mina has just brought you from the well, and it will check this profuse
                  perspiration."</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6389-00000012"/>
               <p>"Wife! dear, dear Sarah! was it all, and only a dream? Have I seen no one? has no
                  other footstep crossed my threshhold than your own and these?"</p>
               <p>"None, none! it 's a dream, my Elbert. Come, shake it off, and gaze upon us with
                  your own kind and loving eyes. We can not bear those wild and doubting looks."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will. The stranger then is gone. There <emph>was no one here.</emph> There
                  could have been no one! It was—was it—a dream?"</p>
               <p>"Truly, only, and but a dream," said Mina.</p>
               <p>"Has no one come or gone, Mina?"</p>
               <p>"None, kind sir, but ourselves, believe me."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, thank you, Mina. What, and Alice, too? Ah! you must have been the
                  stranger."</p>
               <p>"I have but this moment come here, Castlereagh. You do well to gather up your
                  recollection fully, and consider that you have, as your wife tells me, slept here
                  a disturbed sleep, as she believes, of more than an hour. Oh! you dreamer, will
                  you not have done with dreams, and put on your true manhood, and work?"</p>
               <p>"I will, I will, Alice, Sarah. Hereafter, I will do that which conscience alone
                  dictates. I will go to work. I will do with my might what my hand findeth to do. I
                  will 'obey the voice divine.' I will toil not merely for myself, but my work shall
                  have conjoined with it a godlike faith. Faith and work shall be my motto. I will
                  no longer dream, and dreaming, dream<q>

               <p>And the dream was over!</p>
               <p>No. A few month's intervened, and Castlereagh became a resident of LINDENVALE. The

               <p>THE daylight of a sweet morning in October came. Lindenvale was sparkling with
                  frosty diamonds in the sun. The breezes from the cold north had hushed away at
                  midnight, and Castlereagh slept a calm, a holy, loving sleep, and Johnnie was
                  beside him resting his nerveless neck on his outstretched arm, and Hobbie lay in
                  his cubbie, the large sweat-drops oozing from under his curling locks. Sarah
                  Matilda had risen with the breaking day, and stolen softly off. Her steps were
                  hastened by the chill of the fair morn, and she flew by a sequestered, winding,
                  and picturesque path, to reach the summit of Bluff Rock, o'er hanging by a
                  thousand feet the sweet village of Lindenvale, e're the sun's rays should pencil
                  it. Climbing from point to point, clinging to the shelving rock where the path was
                  faintly cut, and it had been easy to mistake and fall, penetrating further into
                  the dark shade of the cedars, and anon gaining an open space, from whence she saw
                  the first curling smoke of the dwellings in the valley, she at last reached the
                  headland's summit, and hurried her to the open, storm-beaten brow, where soon she
                  stood a bright figure in the morning's sun, that directly burst up from the
                  eastern horizon.</p>
               <p>Though enthusiastically fond of the summit, for it revealed a glorious world on
                  either side—a far off, surging, canvas-besprinkled sea—a beauteous city in
                  repose—a quiet hamlet low in the vale—and streamlet, mountain, and forest—and
                  distant church spires of other hamlets here and there—yet seldom had she at so
                  early an hour of the day gone there, and almost never before alone. Never,
                  however, could she have chosen a happier morn, nor could there have been a fitter
                  hour to breathe its pure atmosphere, and to behold all that it was capable of
                  revealing. And she sought to trace with her eye each moving object around her own
                  cottage. She listened to the voices that began to rise up from the awakening town.
                  She traced the movement of Mina around, gathering here and there a dry twig to
                  kindle the morning fire. She gazed for the form of Johnnie, or perchance Hobbie,
                  or the fluttering signal of her husband from the opened casement. She listened for
                  the first notes of the awakening morning-bell in the dome of Castlereagh
                  Institute, and eagerly sought for the first appearance of the merry awakeners, the
                  cheerful, happy lads of the school. But the hour<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000014"/> was too early. All slumbered yet, save Mina. Sarah,
                  reclining on the smooth rock, and gazing on the distant landscape, prayed that the
                  world so fair to look on, might be a true and holy Paradise, a fitted temple for
                  the pure worship of God, a cultivated earth for the smiles of heaven. She breathed
                  a sigh over human vanity and sin. She mourned over the recollection that ignorance
                  and depravity, were the great truths, if told, of heathen lands. She considered
                  and rejoiced in the assurance that the Gospel of Jesus is able "through faith" to
                  make men wise unto salvation, and wondered when the sounds thereof might go out
                  into all the earth. These were fitting thoughts for the morning of so bright a
                  day, a place so elevated over the moving tides of human life, so retired and
                  lonely, so near to God.</p>
               <p>She arose hastily. A stone, loosened from its hold on the brink of the cliff, fell
                  crashing down the dark and dizzy height, and bounding from projecting points, by
                  and by rolled fiercely down the broken, shelving fragments at the foot of the
                  bluff, and awakening startling echoes, bounded once fiercely more, and buried
                  itself forever in the waters of the stream that flowed near the base of the
                  mountain.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" shouted a young voice in the entangled boughs near her, overhanging
                  the precipice—and an eagle flew screaming away toward heaven.</p>
               <p>Sarah, for a moment irresolute, was excited by the scene, and directly called out,
                  as she stepped forward, and noticed a slender human figure issuing from his
                  concealment, "What has happened, my lad? Say, did you loosen that rock? Did you
                  frighten the wild eagle?"</p>
               <p>The boy started at the unexpected sound of a human voice, and the figure of a
                  beautiful woman alone on the mountain at so early an hour of the morning. Then the
                  flush of his cheek fled, and a pale, abashed look seized him, as he recognized in
                  the lady before him, Mrs. Castlereagh. The boy was Fitz Maurice Williams—a wild,
                  rambling lad, of natural genius, but of careless habit, unlike most boys, loving
                  oft to saunter away alone on the crags of the mountain, sometimes building little
                  huts for himself, not unfrequently passing a summer's night in a cave or hut, if
                  perchance he could escape from toil or the watchings of his guardian's cows.
                  Eccentric, wild and roving, he was withal a fair boy, with auburn locks, matted
                  and uncombed, rolling up his ears, shielding his forehead and thickning in his
                  neck, his eyes being keen, but not fierce, indicating kind and genial feelings,
                  but nothing effeminate and weak. His form was slender, approaching even to a
                  delicate and fragile outline; but his step was elastic, and his walk straight,
                  firm, and far-spanning.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Castlereagh in a moment discovered who the lad was. He had often passed her
                  house. She had frequently observed him sitting on the grass low down by the fence,
                  gazing on the lads at play in the Institute grounds. Not unfrequently he carried
                  in his hand a<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6389-00000015"/> book, and sometimes she had
                  spoken to him and inquired if he did not love to read, and if he would like to see
                  the picture-books in their library. At this time he held his torn cap in his hand,
                  and stood before her the very picture of an uncultivated son of the wilderness—a
                  boy left to roam.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Castlereagh called to him to come to her. The boy slowly complied. "How now,
                  my lad, Fitz Maurice—it is you, then! I should suppose no other village boy would
                  be up as early as this, much less on this cliff before sunrise. What brings you
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Come last night, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"You came last night! No, you do not mean to say that you have passed this cold
                  night on the mountain?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Wherefore did you this?"</p>
               <p>"I love to."</p>
               <p>"But are you not afraid?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing hurts me."</p>
               <p>"When the wind blows, and when the thunders roar, and when there are
                  lightning?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! them I loves—that's half I cums for," cried the boy, with delight.</p>
               <p>"And the dark?"</p>
               <p>"The dark is beautiful up here."</p>
               <p>"And the solitary, lonely hours?"</p>
               <p>"Ma'am?"</p>
               <p>"Are you not sometimes afraid of being all alone?"</p>
               <p>"Rather be."</p>
               <p>"Why so?—don't you love to see the school-boys playing on the green?"</p>
               <p>"No, not much—because—"</p>
               <p>"Because—?</p>
               <p>"They don't think of a poor boy, nor how ignorant he is."</p>
               <p>"Then you climb up here to get away from such scenes because they distress you.
                  Perhaps you bring a book with you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; I have two books now in my rock."</p>
               <p>"Where is that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is out yonder."</p>
               <p>"Won't you tell me about it?"</p>
               <p>"You don't care for 't."</p>
               <p>"Yes; I would like to know all about it, and see it."</p>
               <p>"You'll tell the boys?"</p>
               <p>"No, if you don't wish me to."</p>
               <p>"Well, it ain't nothing but a great hanging rock in the woods, resting on the
                  tip-top of the mountain out yonder, split into two or three great pieces, and
                  having a wonderful great cave inside. There I go."</p>
               <p>"Why! you queer boy—what a place you ramble to. May I go and see it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, if you want to."</p>
               <p>"Is there time, now?" thought Sarah. "Will Elbert rise and miss me, and the
                  breakfast come on ere I can return?" So she eagerly inquired of Fitz Maurice the
                  distance.</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6389-00000016"/>
               <p>"It's a mighty little ways," said he.</p>
               <p>"And is there a path to it?"</p>
               <p>"I know a path to it; but nobody else knows."</p>
               <p>"If I could go there before my breakfast-bell sounds I would."</p>
               <p>"We'll run," said the boy.</p>
               <p>So they started. The boy hurried on, and Sarah, as she best could, followed. Often
                  the boy turned suddenly in his path, and, gliding round a rock or hillock, kept on
                  in a true course toward the huge fragment they were seeking. Presently they
                  encountered a marsh, and the alders, and young cedars, and shruboaks, grew thick
                  and entangled around it.</p>
               <p>"Here," said the boy, leading his companion close to a large chestnut on the
                  margin of it, near to the abrupt side of a minor hillock; "here is the path—crowd
                  close to the tree, put your foot now on that flat stone just under the bush—spring
                  here to the bank, and cling alone for two or three steps. There, it is all over,
                  now we have good walking." So it proved. Directly they emerged from the low
                  ground, and in a little path winding up to a higher point than and yet reached,
                  soon both stood at the mouth of the cave. Sarah was astonished. It was truly a
                  wild, a wonderful, a magnificent ruin. A huge boulder, resting on the surface, by
                  the elements without or the forces within itself torn asunder, and the different
                  parcels fallen apart, at the base reposed shoulder to shoulder, or stood in crazy
                  independence on their own pedestals. And within there seemed a cave for the wild
                  beasts, a shelter, or it might be a resting-place for the poor exile or fugitive.
                  It was the most singular and wild spot she had ever seen, and her little
                  pale-faced boy of the matted locks called it his "rock-home;" and there he
                  sometimes passed the night, and there he kept "two books."</p>
               <p>"And now," said she, as she sat down in his cave; "show me your two books."</p>
               <p>The boy scrambled up the rough sides of the cave, and, reaching as far as his
                  slender arm would go, drew them from behind a projection in the rock—from his
                  bookcase—"Here, ma'am, they are all safe."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," she answered; "and here we have a book, it is called—why, it is my
                  own Johnnie's Abbot's story!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Johnnie lent it to me. I told him I'd keep it good."</p>
               <p>"So you have; he shall lend you all you want."</p>
               <p>"May he though—true?"</p>
               <p>"He may, indeed. You shall have as many books to read as you desire. And here is
                  an Arithmetic!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am; that's mine."</p>
               <p>"What do you with it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, study out sums."</p>
               <p>"What up here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, on the rocks." So he pointed here and there to the rough pencilings around
                  them in the cave. Mrs. Castlereagh had never seen the like before. She<pb
                     n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6389-00000017"/> would not suffer herself to betray all
                  the interest she felt in the strange lad, and the strange scene enacting round
                  her. But she resolved that she would forth-with communicate the whole affair to
                  her husband, and take immediate steps to give the lad the advantages of an
                  education.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the sun was creeping higher. It was six o'clock and a
                  half—"Hark!" said Fitz Maurice; "there, that's your first bell, and I must hurry
                  away to my cows." The sound of the distant morning bell of the Institute now
                  penetrated the mouth of the cave, and they both hastened to leave. The boy laid
                  his arithmetic on its shelf, but the other book he took away with him. Having
                  conducted Mrs. Castlereagh to a point where all was very familiar to her, he
                  bounded away by one of his own foot-paths, and, in less than ten minutes, as it
                  seemed to her, as she looked from one of her window-openings, on the way down the
                  summit, she saw him springing from rock to rock, in the creek at the base of the
                  mountain, and hurrying over the fields, and up the hill sides, and so on, here and
                  there toward his own home.</p>
               <p>Hardly had Mrs. Castlereagh reached the last turn of the rude path as it led out
                  from the mountain, than, with a cry of delight, her husband, and Johnnie, and
                  Hobbie started from some bushes and caught her in their arms. Mina had told them
                  where she had rambled, and they had come to seek and surprise her. So she pressed
                  the rosy-cheeked boys to her lips, and was glad to be supported by the arm of her
                  husband; while all chatted and laughed, and so gat them to a fine breakfast that
                  Mina was spreading as they entered their house.</p>
               <p>Soon the second bell of the Institute sounded, and in came the tutor and the boys,
                  from their rooms, to breakfast and to prayers. And the lady instructress and her
                  young ladies came from their rooms and the parlor. For Castlereagh Institute was
                  already established!</p>

               <p>TWO full years had passed since the night of the dream. Nearly one year and a half
                  Castlereagh had been the idolized pastor of Lindenvale. There also, closely
                  adjoining his beautiful parsonage, he had erected a Gothic and picturesque
                  structure for an institution of learning, and furnished it with all necessary and
                  desirable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">matériel</foreign> for a school of high order;
                  and, at the present time, it had been four weeks in progress. In one department of
                  the school were lads, in another, girls, and to each was assigned a careful and
                  thorough teacher. Castlereagh daily visited the school, and personally interested
                  himself in every thing that might be conducive to the fulfillment of his great
                  design without undertaking any one burdensome and constant duty there. Yet his
                  slightest wish and work were law. Each room was beautifully modeled for the light
                  and sound; and for the convenience venience of recitations; and to observe all
                  faces; and to pass from one part to another. And in the wings of the building were
                  alcoves for the library, and desks and tables for periodicals and newspapers. And
                  the costly apparatus glittered in its case; and statuettes, heads, charts, and
                  maps, adorned the frescoed walls. The slightest touch of the rich tasseled cord,
                  near the tutor's desk, caused the bell in the tower to give forth its sounds; and
                  the nicely-balanced steel-bar, in a recess, gently struck, gave through the
                  different apartments the richest vibrations to arrest the ear and govern the
                  movements of the school. When Castlereagh entered the front door of the school
                  with a friend, or strangers, he stopped an instant at the threshhold, and, making
                  a slight inclination of the head, the tutor touched with his finger the tremulous
                  bar, and immediately every pupil was on his feet. He touched it again, and quickly
                  each one resumed his place and former position of study.</p>
               <p>It was Castlereagh's aim not to overburden himself with boarding pupils.
                  Accordingly many applicants were denied. A few young lads and misses were taken
                  under his immediate care in the family, others came to the school as day-scholars,
                  and many of them walked miles, while a goodly number found accommodations in the
                  respectable families of Lindenvale. Still, as far as in his power, he was willing
                  to accommodate the parent who was extremely solicitous of placing a beloved child
                  in his family.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6389-00000019"/>
               <p>"Thus I should feel were I sending away one of my own dear lads," thought he. "The
                  care of the child's manners, and the formation of respectful habits, and
                  especially the cultivation of correct intimacies and friendships can not be of
                  less importance than his studies. If they are in the family, then, in one sense,
                  they are always in the school."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh had spread on the large circular table of his study, a globe and an
                  Atlas. He seemed intently studying the latter, when little Johnnie, then just six
                  years of age, came quietly to his door, and rapped for admission.</p>
               <p>"Come," said a voice within, and directly Johnnie, with tears on his cheeks, threw
                  himself into his father's arms.</p>
               <p>"What troubles my boy this day? Why these sobs and tears, my Johnnie?"</p>
               <p>"Why, father, the boys have got my ball, and won't give it to me, nor give me a
                  knock—and—I—" Johnnie was overcome, and cried.</p>
               <p>"I presume the boys don't mean to trouble you, my son. They have their recess now
                  for a few minutes, and perhaps have lost their ball. Can not you allow them yours
                  for a little time?"</p>
               <p>"I wish they'd ask me for it, and not catch it away—that great boy from the shop
                  kicked it right away as I was reaching for it, and then caught it, and knocked it,
                  and would n't let me get hold of it at all."</p>
               <p>"The boys only want some wild play for a few moments ments, Johnnie. Never mind;
                  I'll see that it comes round to you again. In the mean time let us sit down and
                  study geography a little. I read here in my paper that a vessel touched at Cape
                  Blanco—"</p>
               <p>"Here, Johnnie, Johnnie!" cried Hobbs bursting rather wildly into the room; "see,
                  here is de ball. Hobbie cotched it up and run, oh! ever so tight, and day could
                  n't get it. Ain't you glad?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Thank you, Hobbie; give it to me."</p>
               <p>"Fadder," said Hobbie, "give me some paper, pen, and ink."</p>
               <p>"Paper and <emph>pencil,</emph> Hobbie?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>want</emph> ink."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but ink is black, and it soils my boy's fingers and clothes. Pencil?"</p>
               <p>"Please."</p>
               <p>"Now, Johnnie, while Hobbie scrawls—about this Cape Blanco; I don't see it."</p>
               <p>"Why, father, there are two or three of them."</p>
               <p>"Ay!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; there is one on the Eastern coast, and another on the Western coast of south
                  America."</p>
               <p>"Ah! well, the one I want is, I think, on the Western. That would place it in
                  what, or near what ocean?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! of course the Pacific."</p>
               <p>"True. Now can you point it out to me?"</p>
               <p>"Guess so. Here! see that! It lies in these large letters."</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6389-00000020"/>
               <p>"When did you find that, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! don't know—some time, s'pose."</p>
               <p>"Do you study hard, Johnnie?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir. Study all the evening, sometimes; all the forenoon, sometimes. When I
                  get hold with mother, of geography or music, work away till get through, or the
                  time is gone. Mother and I have gone over the whole Atlas."</p>
               <p>"Why, Johnnie! and can you remember the places?"</p>
               <p>"Some I can, some I can't—"</p>
               <p>"He knows," said Hobbie, "where I lives. Ha, ha, ha!" and Castlereagh laughed
                  heartily with his boys.</p>
               <p>"And do <emph>you</emph> know where you live?" said the father.</p>
               <p>"S'pose so."</p>
               <p>"Well, tell us?"</p>
               <p>"Live here! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!" and they all laughed again, and Hobbie went
                  on with his scrawls.</p>
               <p>"Father," said Johnnie; "Hobbie don't know any thing about geography, and he don't
                  know his letters."</p>
               <p>"I do know A, and B, and H, and W. See there! I've marked them good."</p>
               <p>"So you have, Hobbie; quite good. Well, Johnnie, he'll learn some time."</p>
               <p>"Yes; s'pose so. But there's some larger boys than Hobbie, father, and in the
                  school, who can hardly read!"</p>
               <p>"Their education has been neglected, my son; and they will, many of them, suffer
                  from it through life."</p>
               <p>"Well, father, I hope you'll try to make them all <emph>good</emph> boys, not
                  rough fellows, steal my ball, and use bad words."</p>
               <p>"I hope, my son, they will none of them be wicked and rude. Just come now,
                  Johnnie, let us see where Lieutenant Wilkes sailed. Did you ever trace his course
                  on the maps?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! I know all about it, and it is very interesting. Mother and I studied it
                  all out one day, and she read me a full account of it in the books, also."</p>
               <p>"What did he discover, away down in the South Seas?"</p>
               <p>"Why, father, he discovered the Antarctic coast. There it is."</p>
               <p>"Yes: I see it. And now, just tell me where Sir John Franklin lost himself down
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"Down here! Ha, ha! Why Sir John Franklin perished, as it is supposed, searching
                  for a north passage—away up there, father, not down in these latitudes."</p>
               <p>"That's all right, Johnnie. And where did he sail from?"</p>
               <p>"Over there, in England."</p>
               <p>"You were reading, the other day, about Napoleon. Where did he live?"</p>
               <p>"He lived in France. There's France; and there's Paris, the capital."</p>
               <p>"And does Hobbie know any thing about these things?"</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6389-00000021"/>
               <p>"I knows about Napolin Bonepart".</p>
               <p>"How much do you know, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I knows he was a great general, and he <emph>beat,</emph> he did."</p>
               <p>"Where did you learn that, my bright boy?"</p>
               <p>"It's all in the Maggazene.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"
                     xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                   I see'd it there, and Johnnie told me; and you can read it for yourself;
                   I'm busy now," and Hobbie continued his scrawls.</p>

               <p>"Hobbie 'll know something one of these days, Johnnie. As for you, your first
                  letters were learned at the top of newspapers, and on your pewter plate"</p>
               <p>"So mother says."</p>
               <p>"And, Johnnie, how does the music flourish? Do you learn any thing?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a little. Tell mother I'm going to learn all of Hayden's pieces. I've got
                  over twenty-four pages of the Instruction Book, and play 'Hob Nob,' 'Java March,'
                  and 'Bonaparte Crossing the Rhine.'"</p>
               <p>Why, Johnnie, you are doing well!"</p>
               <p>"Think so?"</p>
               <p>"Very well. Now sit down, and play a little on my melodeon here."</p>
               <p>"I like the melodeon."</p>
               <p>"What can you play?"</p>
               <p>Oh! not much—play 'Corinth,' 'I love to steal awhile away.'"</p>
               <p>"Well, try it. Very good; very good, indeed. Now let us have 'Hebron.'"</p>
               <p>"No. I can't. Don't play in that key."</p>
               <p>"What do you like best?"</p>
               <p>"Can play best in the key of C, and D, and F, and in A minor."</p>
               <p>"Well, here is a simple piece, and a very great favorite of many."</p>
               <p>"Don't know it."</p>
               <p>"What! 'Ortonville?'"</p>
               <p>"Never played it."</p>
               <p>"I'll show you. But you know, Johnnie, I play only two parts. I don't yet know how
                  to play the only two parts. I don't yet know how to play the harmony. Perhaps I
                  shall by and by." So Castlereagh played and hummed, and Johnnie looked on and
                  heard. "Now, Johnnie, try it."</p>
               <p>Johnnie sat down and picked out not after note, and soon produced the whole
                  piece.</p>
               <p>"Now, father, you shall sit down and try to play the harmony."</p>
               <p>"I'll try; but you have beaten me, my son. I shan't succeed."</p>
               <p>The boy looked on and soon begun to be very merry, and directly broke into quite a
                  laugh, when his father declared himself completely unsuccessful in his effort.</p>
               <p>"Father," said he, "it is the easiest thing in the world."</p>
               <p>"Johnnie, it may be easy to your little fingers, but it is hard to mine."</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6389-00000022"/>
               <p>Hobbie now seized his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chapeau,</foreign> as he called it,
                  and rushed out of the room, singing— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Lay down the shubbel and de hoe,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"And so Hobbie is musical too, Johnnie?" said Castlereagh, with a bright smile in
                  the eye of a father proud of his bairns.</p>
               <p>"Yes, little Hobbie knows pieces, father, I tell you."</p>
               <p>"And how does he learn them so?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother and all of us sing and play, and he gets hold of them."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that's the way, I know," said his father. "Now, Johnnie, music is a natural
                  gift, old amateurs and philosophers to the contrary notwithstanding. I am
                  persuaded it is born with some children, and that they can easily cultivate to
                  great perfection the whole science of music, while with astonishing effort only
                  can others acquire a mere rough expression and a very limited knowledge of it. I
                  take the highest pleasure in believing that you and Hobbie have an inborn
                  perception of music, and I hope one of these days you will both of you be able to
                  gratify you parents and all your friends with your development of this most
                  precious boon of heaven."</p>
               <p>Johnnie seized his ball and cap, and darted away after his brother.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh paced the room. His father's heart was beating proudly over his boys.
                  But his spirit was not at rest when he thought of the rude associations that they
                  might possibly form in the school. He trembled at the suggestion which flitted
                  across his mind, that he could not always know the character of the pupils of his
                  charge, and that seeds of sin and depravity sown in them might spring up a fearful
                  harvest of evil unto others. On his brow a shade of sad thought rested.</p>
               <p>But Sarah Matilda came and said, "You have had a nice hour, husband, with the
                  boys, and it has been quite a relief to me. I have had a call from our city
                  friends, the Summer's, and they are very anxious that their young niece, Miss
                  Josephine Leland, should take lessons of me in music. What think you, my dear,
                  about it?"</p>
               <p>Will it be agreeable to you, Matilda? The number of your pupils increases daily,
                  and I fear they may prove too great a tax upon both time and strength"</p>
               <p>"I should rather like Josephine among my pupils. She is a sweet young lady, and
                  quite a promising musician."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I would give her a trial."</p>
               <p>It was arranged that Josephine should ride out twice a week in the omnibus, and
                  take lessons from eleven to twelve o'clock. She was a delicate, graceful young
                  lady of seventeen, with exhuberant dark tresses, and sparkling black eyes, greatly
                  admired, and justly, for her beauty and lovely character.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6389-00000023"/>
               <p>"And now," said Mrs. Castlereagh, "how comes on the dedication—poem, is it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, fie, Matilda! A poem for the dedication of the Institute, Hall, and
                  School?"</p>
               <p>"Well, is it not queer that the workmen should fail to finish the hall in season
                  for the dedication, previous to the opening of the school?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, odd. But never mind. We have the advantage of a school under a very
                  encouraging beginning, to give us all a little enthusiasm."</p>
               <p>"No fear the want of that, Elbert, in yourself."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; I need a little shavings and kindlings to blaze up."</p>
               <p>"You 'll push your way, husband, if all is dark and all is dame, and
                     <emph>my</emph> lamp and fire have gone utterly out."</p>
               <p>"Ho, ho, Sarah! No such thing, now. Why, dear me, child, I have not a quarter part
                  of your energy."</p>
               <p>"Toot, toot, husband."</p>
               <p>"Nor a seventeenth of your faith."</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear me, what a mistaken idea."</p>
               <p>"Nor a thimbleful of your charity."</p>
               <p>"Husband, husband, be quiet, and now answer me a plain, practical question, truly.
                  How comes on the Sunday's sermons?"</p>
               <p>"Dull, dull! I have one that I call new—must preach one old sermon again. Don't
                  look blue, now; it is a good sermon, though old. And I must write out more at
                  length the dedication—poem? for Monday's eve."</p>
               <p>"Prythee don't kill yourself at the outset, Elbert. Don't, pray don't undertake
                  too much—and yet I must tell you of my morning's early rambles, and what
                  determinations it led me to form." So she told him all the story, as we have
                  written it before. Castlereagh listened to it with the deepest interest, and it
                  was his settled purpose, as they closed their, interview, to obtain the boy Fitz
                  Maurice's release from his present situation, and to receive him permanently into
                  his own family and school. Castlereagh and Sarah Matilda now sat down cosily
                  together, and amused themselves with picturing their future, when retired from
                  busy life, they should dwell in own house. And they passed an hour drawing off
                  plans for their future home, a cottage plan, a square-built house, a sharp roofed
                  dwelling with wings, chimneys with fire-places, etc., etc. Who has not been in his
                  life-time a "castle" builder?</p>

               <p>LINDENVALE was stirred by some new element of life. All was bustle and commotion;
                  eager looks and hasty steps and rapid utterances bore their witness to some
                  unusual excitement in the minds of the citizen villagers. Lindenvale, that reposes
                  in the shade of mountain-bluff and forest, that opens through a long sweet vista
                  on the sea—Lindenvale, with its triple spires, its picturesque dwellings, half
                  hidden in their dark, bowering shade-trees and verdant vines—Linden-vale, with its
                  little waterfalls, chiming sopranos to the out-rattling bassos of heavy machinery
                  in its numerous and scattered factories—was in a tumult of excitement and hurry
                  and cheer. Here were little groups on foot accelerating their walk; ladies
                  springing, with elastic step, along the street, or, peradventure, with
                  nicely-toileted person hurrying along in open carriages. Friend nodded to friend,
                  and every one sought a common point of interest and attraction. The evening air
                  was soft and clear for the season; the white clouds now and then enveloped the
                  round moon and sought her smile; the stars glittered on—those little
                  gold-decorators of the blue sky—and seemed, each one of them, to look down sweetly
                  on the self-same scene, and to be thinking only of the happy souls in Lindenvale.
                  The cheerful, exhilarating sound of the new Castlereagh Institute bell rung out
                  over every roof of the sweet village, summoning the old and the young from their
                  firesides to witness and enjoy the interesting services of the dedication of the
                  Institute and the HALL to the purposes of art and science.</p>
               <p>And the long, well-lighted hall began to fill—by and by to crowd—at length it
                  became a jam. Choice places near the platform were twice and thrice sought, and
                  disappointed seekers gat them back into the next best places, and wished they had
                  come earlier. Who has not seen this before? But good-nature prevailed; and when a
                  seat broke down, or the press became intolerable, the mass, by one common impulse,
                  swayed a little to the right or left, and relief came—temporary, but allaying fear
                  and quelling murmurs.</p>
               <p>At the furthest end of the hall there was a decorated platform, with raised seats
                  on each side, for the pupils of the seminary. Over the speakers' table there was
                  an arch of green, tastefully wreathed and interspersed with flowers. On the walls
                  of the room were fastened colored placards, printed in large type, announcing the
                  great objects of a Christian education such as, "THE FEAR OF GOD INCULCATED"—"THE
                  LAWS REVERENCED"—"PATRIOTISM CHERISHED</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6389-00000025"/>
               <p>Chat game, and buzz began. Young gentlemen chatted with their lady companions, and
                  blessed the mild stars that gave them this opportunity of following up an
                  already-begun acquaintance and friendship. Ladies—some with doffed hats, others
                  slightly vailed, all in nicely-fitted glove and bracelet, and beaming with
                  smiles—attracted the admiring gaze and attention of their friends and customary
                  suitors. A few distinguished gentlemen, trustees, clergymen, friends, or aged
                  ones, the young ushers of the Institute led to the platform. A few seats were
                  reserved yet for expected ones of note or favor, while on either side the raised
                  seats were kept for the members of the school.</p>
               <p>In the still and retired study, which was a room in the wing of the Parsonage on
                  the second floor, alone bending in prayer, low, humble, grateful, his windows
                  darkened, his doors bolted, was the young pastor of Lindendale, the learned, and
                  earnest, and devoted scholar, the founder of the INSTITUTE. Four weeks had passed
                  since the school was opened, but the dedication, for necessary reasons, has been
                  delayed until now. In the mean time, full seventy pupils, girls and boys, day
                  scholars and boarding pupils, had joined the Institute.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh felt the importance of the present occasion. He designed, if it were
                  possible, to impress on every mind the great power of educated talent and holy
                  piety. He would that parents and guardians of children especially, might catch
                  something of his own view in respect of parental and home influence on the minds
                  of children in the formation of their characters; and as he sought in prayer the
                  aid of that great Spirit in whose hands, simply as an instrument of good results,
                  he desired to act, the last notes of the tolling bell were sounding. He arose from
                  prayer. A rapping at his door caused him immediately to open it, where he
                  encountered his tutor, Clifford, into whose hands he had placed the immediate
                  oversight and instruction of his pupils.</p>
               <p>"We begin to wait you, sir," he said.</p>
               <p>"I am ready, Clifford—say, Cliff, are there seats for all?"</p>
               <p>"Hardly, sir. Some standing up on the window-frames, and one of our seats has
                  already broken down."</p>
               <p>"Oh! pitiable circumstance. Let's away—are the pupils arranged, Cliff?"</p>
               <p>"They await us below."</p>
               <p>"Well, now, let's go;"—and away they went.</p>
               <p>The young ushers had, with great difficulty, preserved a narrow pass for the last
                  comers, to the platform. Castlereagh, with a flush of gratified pride on his brow,
                  preceded Sarah along this passway; and as the bell ceased its vibrations, Sarah
                  sat at the piano, and giving the signal march, soon appeared in the hall, led by
                  their accomplished and beautiful teacher, Miss Frances Halloway, a long array of
                  sweet-faced young misses, who filled immediately all the reserved seats on<pb
                     n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6389-00000026"/> the right of the platform. And as
                  Clifford led in the lads, they proceeded in order and with cheerful smiles, to
                  occupy the seats on the left. The Rev. Mr. Kirk Alling, and the Rev. Mr.
                  Gregorius, were on the platform. Several distinguished gentlemen and highly
                  talented and beautiful ladies were seated near it. Every space was occupied; and
                  the hall, being perfectly lighted, every countenance seemed absolutely shining
                  with delight. As the music of the piano died away, Castlereagh rose and requested
                  the audience, as introductory to the occasion on which they were assembled
                  together, to unite in prayer to Heaven for a blessing. The Rev. Mr. Kirk Alling
                  offered up the petition—an earnest prayer for the blessing of God upon all who
                  were present, and for His smile on the begun enterprise of Christian education of
                  a high character among them.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh, on the ending of the prayer, arose, with his manuscript in his hand,
                  which he soon laid upon the stand before him, and bowing calmly to his auditory,
                  spoke to them, with hardly once glancing at his papers, in the following
                  words:</p>
               <p>"WE ARE A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. We have the Bible—have the Church—we have the
                  Sabbath—we have the SCHOOL. We believe in the existence of one God, the Maker of
                  heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>"Were we this evening, with the pleasant light of the moon around us, to be
                  gathered together as we, in our individualities, are here, in some one of the
                  villages of the eastern clime, along the borders of Japan, of China, of Siam—were
                  we there, native-born and taught, we might wear the same features that we now do,
                  and be of the same physical stature and strength, but how true of us, that in most
                  other respects we should be entirely different from what we now are. We should not
                  only speak a different language, but the language, but the language itself would
                  be to us an insolvable problem. We should be able, probably, to communicate few of
                  its leading principles to the comprehension of a stranger, or to trace it to any
                  reliable source—other, certainly, than to the uncreated BRAHME, whose assistants,
                  Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, have filled the earth with knowledge and power. We might
                  talk of education, but it would be a conversation of enigmas and
                  contradictions.</p>
               <p>"Had we commenced our existence in heathen lands, under the institutions of error
                  and superstition, we had worshiped idols instead of Jehovah, and yoked ourselves
                  to force along, over the prostrate forms of devotees to the senseless imagery of
                  Polytheism, the ensanguined car of moral darkness, which crushes soul as well as
                  body—denying to the one all spiritual freedom, and to the other progressive
                  improvement and happiness.</p>
               <p>"The great car of the East—of India's intellectual bondage, civil degradation and
                  religious error—though moved on creaking axles by thousands of blind enthusiasts,
                  and though it be the representative of all freedom<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000027"/> dom, is infinitely less intelligent, understood and
                  appreciated than the car of the West, drawn by her single Horse of Iron! This
                  thunders forth the progress of man. It answers the desire awakened to get forward.
                  It answers the desire awakened to get forward. It breaks man from his eternal
                  gravitation to the earth, and shoots him off in one of the great centrifugal lines
                  of nature <emph>over</emph> the horizon. But the other, viz., Juggernaut's car
                  keeps man, soul and body, all the day of life in the self-same place. It compels
                  him to sweat and toil, and then gives him no pay, neither promises him any future
                  amelioration. It awakens no intelligent desires, feeds no curiosity, satisfies no
                  aspiration, but ever stultifies its votaries, and teaches them to degrade
                  themselves to the worship; of a senseless and horrid imagery. This is block
                  worship; or it may take another form, that of nature, and then it is star worship,
                  the worship of the heavenly bodies; or of the rivers, of the trees, beasts, birds,
                  fishes and insects—all of them combined, objects of less importance in the scale
                  of being or creation, that the creature who is taught to worship them.</p>
               <p>"But, happily, we are here, not there. Let us rejoice. It is well with us. We were
                  cradled on the sea, and have been going up and down in the earth.
                     <emph>Motion</emph> has been our law. We have found 'land!'—a goodly land.</p>
               <p>"When India was under the faith of Brahma, and Juggernaut was the personating
                  Deity of creation—some thousands of years ago—this land of ours was an
                  undiscovered waste, the wild man being its tenant. And he had a Deity, but HIS
                  Deity was the Great Spirit—the absolute—the unknown, still, a living Spirit. Yet
                  to the wild man of the woods there was given no mouth of holy prophet, and he,
                  too, worshiped and served he knew not what. He has gone. The red man's footsteps
                  were in the wilderness.</p>
               <p>"When Columbus hove in sight of this continent, the wild, grim FOREST stood here,
                  and the races of red men were here. But now Columbus has departed; the forest has
                  fallen; the red man, with his war-whoop, his bow and arrow, his scalping-knife,
                  has perished. But there are here a Christian people, and they are strong.</p>
               <p>"Where NOW is India—she of olden time, Juggernaut's disciple? Is she strong, and
                  wise, and good, and free? She was thought strong in the days of Alexander and
                  Cæsar, and when Mohammed held Mecca. But she was strong only in a comparative
                  sense, not in true and expansive science, religion, and philosophy. India is now
                  burned over with the gunpowder of Europe. The waters of the Ganges and Cambodia
                  are ruffled by the steamships of her conquerors.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, <emph>indeed,</emph> there is something more mighty than elephants or
                  Juggernaut. It is the CHRISTIAN PEOPLE; it is the Christian's steamship and car,
                  the Christian ship, the Christian ax, the Christian temple, the Christian
                  SCHOOL-HOUSE!</p>
               <p>It is ours to speak of progress. And<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6389-00000028"/> this
                  we owe to our <emph>religious education,</emph> using the terms in their widest
                  sense. We educate our sons and daughters according to a Bible standard, taking
                  that for our rule of faith and practice.</p>
               <p>"We have then much reason to rejoice in the land of our birth, and in the
                  circumstances that now surround us. And as we survey the society in which we live,
                  and note its objects, our attention becomes more and more absorbed in those who
                  are favored with YOUTH, in the very midst of all the privileges that make our land
                  and our institutions. We see them in the enjoyment of schools, and learning the
                  fundamental principles of liberty, religion, and government. We see them gathered
                  to gether in schools, colleges and seminaries, acquiring true knowledge. Our youth
                  are growing up, (or must do so,) an educated class, as well as an industrial one;
                  and we say, the institutions of the land will be committed to the care of wise and
                  good men.</p>
               <p>"Thus we rejoice. How much there is in this to gladden every true lover of his
                  country—every well-wisher to man!</p>
               <p>"Our institutions demand intelligence in the people. They were laid deep and
                  firm—in the cement of piety, knowledge, and industry. They require the same sort
                  of care to preserve them that enjoyed in their origin. Hindooism of India, Lamaism
                  of Tartary, Boodism of China, require for their preservation the identical
                  knowledge on which they were originally planned. Give their people truth, light, a
                  true science, a true faith, and they pass immediately into Christianity—they can
                  not longer remain in the darkness of idolatry. In like manner. Christianity and
                  Christian institutions need the aliment of <emph>Christian</emph> science.
                  Christian ethics alone can do a Christian people service. The philosophy, the
                  science, the laws of heathen nations can do a Christian people no good. To embrace
                  them were the same as to embrace an idol image in the place of the cross—to
                  worship Juggernaut in the place of Jehovah in a Gospel temple.</p>
               <p>"Here is the difference: Christian institutions are in want only of Christian
                  nourishment, drawn in the first instance from the Gospel, and so continued,
                  expanding and fraternizing with all true science, art, taste, and industry, and
                  the great principles of civil freedom, religious freedom, and toleration. Heathen
                  institutions, as such, want but paganistic, superstitions teachings and
                  privileges. They require no Gospel, no true science, no true science no true
                  freedom, no religious expansion. The art of heathenism is to make abortive every
                  desire of the soul or mind for improvement and liberty.</p>
               <p>"The <emph>school</emph> is one of our most important and long-cherished
                  instrumentalities for educating and improving the minds of our children and youth.
                  The school is necessary, because parents are too much occupied to instruct their
                  own children properly, and the children are generally, too thoughtless to devote
                  themselves to<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6389-00000029"/> a course of study without
                  its regular system of rules and duties. Yet there are found those who have
                  improved their time and the means of self-culture afforded them, out of the
                  school, to an extent that surprises while it also gratifies us."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh then mentioned the case of a young lad in the place who had borrowed
                  of him, during the summer, more than fifty volumes of books, many of them of a
                  respectable size, and worthy of deep study, all of which he had read as he watched
                  and fed, here and there along the highway, a herd of cows.</p>
               <p>(The boys and girls clapped their hands, and said it was J—— S——). "Yes," said
                  Castlereagh; "that is the boy. You have all heard." he continued, "of our
                  countryman Elihu Burrit, the learned blacksmith? He is a man of whom the whole
                  nation has, doubtless, heard, and is one of whom the people of America may well be
                  proud. Though untaught in the schools, he has already acquired, at his forge, and
                  by improving morning and evening hours when not required to labor, no fewer than
                  fifty-five spoken and dead languages; and so extensive has his knowledge become of
                  language, that the remark is near to truth which was made of him by Governor
                  Everett, of Massachusetts, 'That he would have been perfectly at home at the Tower
                  of Babel, in the confusion of tongues!' In this respect, certainly, Burrit has
                  attained to the extraordinary eminence of Cardinal Mezzofanti, the great linguist
                  of Europe whom all admit to have been familiar with <emph>thirty-two</emph>
                  different languages, and by some it has been asserted that he spoke some forty or
                  fifty, and even a much larger number. He died at Rome, March15, 1849, aged
                  seventy-four years.'<ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002"

                        inspire her hopes of the young, and lead to efforts, self-sacrificing and
                        generous, in behalf of education that shall open an avenue of progress to
                        the studious, talented, and noble youth of our land, who might otherwise
                        despair of attaining the height of their own ambition, much less to that
                        elevation, conspicuous and honorable, which he has gained by the force of
                        his own exertions.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Frost's father is yet alive, a gentleman of property, at a very advanced
                        age. His mother is also living. They have several children; one married
                        daughter and her husband perished in the burning of the steamboat Erie, on
                        the lake of that name, a few years since. At least one son is a graduate of
                        Dartmouth.</p>

                  in the business of making and vending shoes in a neat and tasteful shoe-store on
                  his own account. He early, evinced a love of mathematical science, and has
                  displayed talents of no ordinary character in its pursuit. He says, in a letter
                  which I have received from him, 'I early imbibed a love of study. I recollect my
                  first acquisitions were in arithmetic, and that the results gave me the highest
                  pleasure. When I excelled other boys in the school, my progress was attributed by
                  them to some peculiar mathematical talent. But it was not so. I boast of no
                  genius. I attribute my success uniformly to more study than others gave their
                  lessons or work, and, perhaps, to a greater <emph>love</emph> of study.' Mr. frost
                  has found time, not only to become master of all existing forms of algebraic
                  numbers, but is also familiarly and thoroughly acquainted with geometry,
                  trigonometry, and astronomy. He is at home in the Modern Calculus, and in the
                  Principia of Newton, where few of our learned professors venture, or fell at ease.
                  Indeed, in mathematical science he has made so great attainments, that it is
                  doubtful whether there can be found ten mathematicians, in the United States, who
                  are capable, in case of his own embarrassment, of lending him any relief. Remember
                  that we are speaking of a self-taught scholar, and he no genius. Let me tell you
                  how it was done. He says, 'When I went to my trade, at fourteen years, of age, I
                  formed a resolution, which I have kept till now, extraordinary preventives only
                  excepted, that I would faithfully devote <emph>one hour each day</emph> to study,
                  in some useful branch of knowledge.' Here is the secret of his success. He is now
                  forty-five years of age, and is a married man, the father of three children. Yet
                  this <emph>one hour</emph> rule accompanies him to this day. 'The first book which
                  fell into my hands,' he says, 'was Hutton's Mathematics, an English work of great
                  celebrity, a complete mathematical course, which I then commenced, viz., at
                  fourteen. I finished it at nineteen, without an instructor. I then took up those
                  studies to which I could apply my knowledge of mathematics, as mechanics and
                  mathematical astronomy. I think I can say that I posses, and have succesfully
                  studied <emph>all</emph> the most approved English and American works on those
                  subjects.' After this, he commenced natural philosophy and physical astronomy.
                  Then chemistry, geology, and mineralogy, collecting and arranging a cabinet.
                  'Next, natural history,' he says, 'engaged my attention, which I followed up with
                  close observations, gleaning my information from a great many source; the works
                  that treat of them at large are rare and expensive. But I have a considerable
                  knowledge of geology, ornithology, entomology and conchology.' Not only this; he
                  has added to his stores of knowledge the whole science of botany, one of the most
                  extensive now pursued, and has made himself completely now pursued, and has made
                  himself completely master of it. He has made actual extensive surveys, in his own
                  State, of the trees, shrubs, herbs,<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6389-00000031"/>
                  ferns, mosses, lichens, and fungi. Mr. Frost thinks that he may possess the
                     <emph>third</emph> best collection of ferns in the United States.<ref

                        of the rarest plants that are to be found in the United States. The articles

                  of the gifted poets, and is, to a considerable extent, familiar with history;
                  while his miscellaneous reading has been very extensive. He says of his books "I

                  literary; composing the standard works published in this country, containing five
                  or six hundred volumes. I have purchased these books, from time to time, with
                  money saved for the purpose by some small self-denials.'</p>
               <p>"Here, then, we have an account, I assure you it is wholly reliable, of one—plain
                  man of forty-five—who has made the compass, so to speak, of the hill of science;
                  studying his HOUR a day, when the day's labor was done, for more than thirty
                  consecutive years. He began this one hour system when he was fourteen years old.
                  Behold the result. Here is a man with the cares, business, and responsibilities of
                  life on hands, yet a devoted, faithful, successful student. A man who is a
                  profound scholar, and yet a plain-spoken, humble, pious, laboring man, residing
                  still in his native village, far inland; supporting himself by his trade and daily
                  labor, while he is worthy of a position as a teacher in one of the best
                  institutions of learning in the land. Can you imagine the whole benefit that might

                     accept the hearty thanks of Castlereagh for the offer to himself (when weak
                     in body, and troubled both in mind and estate), of a situation similarly
                     lucrative and desirable.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"Should any of you, my hearers," said Castlereagh, "ever take a journey to the
                  White Mountains of New Hampshire, or to Quebec, by way of the Connecticut Valley
                  Railroad, through the village of Brattleboro', Vermont, of hydropathic notoriety,
                  you will do well to visit the shoe store and shop of my friend of whom I have now
                  spoken—the industrious, careful mechanic—the self-made, and yet almost unequaled
                  mathematician and scholar, this true specimen of a NATIVE AMERICIAN!" (Prolonged
                  cheerings.) "And I Pray the good citizens of Brattleboro' may not tire of the
                  frequent inquiry of stranger—'can you tell me, sir, where I may find the man in
                  spectacles, CHARLES C. FROST?'"</p>
               <p>Castlereagh then proceeded still further to illustrate and unfold his theme.</p>
               <p>"Education consists in furnishing the mind with thoughts, and with proper
                  discipline for thought, and in exchanging that which is rough, uncomely, and
                  offensive in manners, for that which is easy, agreeable, and polite. It is the
                  part and the glory of education tion to elevate, ennoble, purify, and strengthen
                  the mind. Other things being equal, the MAN is immeasurably improved by a thorough
                  education. His influence is increased perhaps a thousandfold! Look at him in
                  society: He is at the head of the nation, at the head of the army, navy, the
                  state, the judiciary; he is the leading mind in the Senate, or House of
                  Representatives; he is first at the bar, first in the pulpit, first in medical
                  science and practice, first in the numerous arts; a controlling spirit in
                  manufactures and trades; a tall man among the yeomanry; he is a prince among
                  merchants—a bold and influential navigator. Such men are wanted as engineers on
                  our numerous rail-roads—wanted as surveyors of lands, as printers, as writers, as
                  recorders—wanted in counting-rooms—wanted every where, and in all times. A young
                  man who understands the art of book-keeping, and is also a good penman, commands a
                  salary, sometimes equal to three thousand dollars a year—very often as good as one
                  thousand dollars a year. Look into one of the gorgeous edifices of our cities, or
                  floating steam-vessels and ships on the seas and rivers—see there the skill,
                  taste, and wisdom of the builders. They are ARTIZANS of whom we are proud!
                  Dull-headed, drunken, blundering mechanics can do nothing of this sort. Look into
                  the printing-office! What a world! what an empire of life, and knowledge, and
                  power you care surveying! No driveling sot or fool controls the press; no

                  generous, and active impulses.</p><note place="foot" xml:id="note_007">

               <p>Castlereagh then turned him to the particular theme of the dedication, and
                  reviewing the causes that led to the enterprise of the Institute, dwelling on the
                  future good that might connect with its progress and prolongation, he pronounced
                  the edifice set apart to the great interests of society, to be secured through the
                  instrumentality of education and religion.</p>
               <p>When he had concluded his long address, the Reverend Mr. Kirk Alling and Reverend
                  Mr. Gregorius made a few most energetic and appropriate remarks, responsive in
                  their sentiment to what had gone before. And then was sung a beautiful hymn by the
                  scholars, prayer was offered, and the great crowd began slowly to dissolve away.
                  And as they defiled down the narrow row stairway, and gained the open porch, the
                  bell in the tower rang over them its happy "adieu! adieu!"—its cheerful
                  "good-night! good-night!" The dedication was over.</p>

               <p>"Oct.—. I am now thirty years old. Before reaching my age, Alexander had almost
                  conquered the world; Bonaparte had crossed the Alps and subdued Itlay; Mr. Pitt
                  was great in the English Parliament; and Randolph was famed in the American
                  Congress. I have done little either to secure a name to myself or to benefit
                  mankind. Where is the soul that I have ever blessed? Where is the human enterprise
                  that hails me as its great heart and life? Have I, whom the Creator made, lived
                  thirty years, and lived unto myself? Oh! humbling consideration. From this day, I
                  dedicate myself to the world—I will live for its good. I will be a philanthropist;
                  I will strive to pluck from burnings everlasting some immortal souls, and from
                  ignorance bring forth a thousand. The way seems opened. A smiling Providence seems
                  to lead me. I will go forward and complete what has been so auspiciously
                  begun."</p>
               <p>An unopened letter lay on the table before him. It had arrived with the evening
                  papers. Breaking the seal, he read with difficulty the following words:</p>

               <p>Castlereagh read the letter, now laughing aloud, now groaning and sighing. At
                  last, crushing the letter in his hand, he cast it on the floor, and ground it
                  under his feet. "The illiterate, purse-proud, and<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000035"/> selfish fellow!" exclaimed he. And then he walked
                  his room in his excitement. "Will he keep his son at work on his farm till he is
                  fourteen, till he is old enough for college, and old enough to know everything he
                  need know for the common affairs of life, and then send him in his ignorance and
                  mortification to me to teach him A, B, C, and perhaps remove him at the close of
                  this very first term? No, no. Let him be sent to the District School. I don't want
                  him, ignoramus, big booby of a fellow." Accordingly he took his pen to write a
                  refusal. Presently it occurred to him that the boy might be brighter than the
                  father, knowing more of books than was represented, and one, who though ignorant,
                  might, by long and faithful application and exertion, become a useful and
                  intelligent scholar and citizen. Aware that the labor must be great at best, that
                  should reclaim from gross ignorance a lad of his years and habits, he shrunk from
                  the effort and responsibility, but at length determined that he would make the
                  effort, and wrote Sunderland Artaxerxes, as follows:</p>

                              description of your son Amos. I think it a very great misfortune that
                              you should have kept him so long time at work, when he ought to have
                              been in school. He will, in all probability, be a sufferer through
                              life in consequence of your neglect of his education cation. However,
                              I am disposed to give him a trial. If you will place him entirely
                              under my care for three years, I will, if he be possessed of at least
                              common talents, then send him back to you a different boy in many

                  <p>"It was not duplicity that controlled me in breaking up my residence in
                     Richmond. No, believe, me, it was a far different sentiment, and an object as
                     high and pure as that is contemptible and ignoble. I could have died there in
                     the performance of duty. But I sought something more than mere life in my
                     removal. It was an extended field of usefulness. I decline to say anything
                     further, <emph>less</emph> to you, might savor of that which I now ignore.
                     'Ungrateful?' Flatly, I am not. Ingratitude forms no part of my being. I do
                        not<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6389-00000036"/> recollect a friend to whom I
                     have ever turned the cold look, or cherished for him other than the sincerest
                     regard. Men may construe actions as they will, but my motives will bear
                     inspection in the highest courts of wisdom and truth, whence some men may be
                     driven in shame. It is my great aim to do good, to educate and influence, and
                     bless the rude and ignorant as well as the more refined of mankind. I wish to
                     begin this course with the young, and with my own children, who will soon
                     require a great deal of attention. I have also the care of Gertrude's
                     education, who is my half-sister, and to whom I am bound by duty and affection
                     to provide the best facilities of instruction in my power. My own mother, holy,
                     beloved, amiable, affectionate, I saw laid down in her grave. Over that grave
                     we shed tears of early sorrow, and brothers and sisters, entwined in a common
                     embrace, lifted up their prayers to heaven for support. They planted the
                     sweet-scented blush rose at her grave, and the myrtle leaves are still green
                     over her ashes.</p>
                  <p>"In three years our revered and kind father gave us a new mother—sister
                     Gertrude's mother. We loved her and she idolized us. She became the mother of
                     four children—two were sisters, two brothers. The younger brother soon died.
                     Consumption had well-nigh carried to her grave their mother, and we were daily
                     expecting the black-sealed envelop, when, at midnight, as Sarah Matilda and
                     myself were sleeping in our warmest room for dread of the cold December night,
                     a horsemen galloped to our door, and with a loud voice awoke us. On my throwing
                     up the window, he informed us that he had been sent to forward heavy tidings;
                     the letter which he bore would give the particulars; but the import was briefly
                     the sudden and alarming sickness of my father! Can I describe to you the
                     overwhelming nature of this shock! Never was there a kinder heart than his. How
                     dearly beloved was he! How he sate up until midnight in the chilly night of a
                     late day in October, to keep burning the fires that should impart their cheer
                     to myself and Sarah, when on our bridal-tour we were drawn lazily over the
                     mountains, and first, together, visited his distant home. How cheerfully,
                     happily, he bade us welcome! Ever was it thus. And now, alas! wounded? Yes; a
                     small bruise neglected, had inflamed horribly! He lay nearer death's door than
                     the feeble sufferer, his wife. Carried swiftly onward the next day and night,
                     the frost biting us sorely, Sarah Matilda and myself reached the family
                     mansion. Alas! too late. The beloved father, whose farewell blessing we sought,
                     lay in his last repose. We followed him to his grave. Sixteen days after and
                     the wife and mother slept also the same slumber, and was buried beside him—and
                        <emph>home</emph> was spoiled. The little ones were given to the married
                     brothers and sisters. I was appointed guardian to Gertrude, and early in the
                     following spring, I bore her in my arms, in the evening, as she slept from
                     fatigue, from the steamboat landing to<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6389-00000037"/>
                     our own home. She was in her ninth year—an affectionate child and sister.</p>
                  <p>"Six years have nearly expired since that evening. It has been the effort of
                     our life to instruct her, and develop those principles and powers of mind which
                     ever may reasonably be expected to appear in answer to continued and faithful
                     instruction.</p>
                  <p>"It were worth a life's exertion to accomplish this for one human being, not
                     only for one so nearly related and dear to us, but even to one related only by
                     the common links of our humanity. A life! Yes, all of life, to train
                        <emph>one</emph> thus to know more of the great powers of the human soul—to
                     know more of nature—to know more of God, of Christ, of salvation, of eternal
                     things. And if so greatly valuable this labor in the case of one immortal
                     mind—of one of human blood and kind, consider the immense importance of that
                     service when it results in turning MANY precious ones into paths of light and
                     salvation they had otherwise never seen or trodden! Oh! what can equal the
                     value of labors thus performed. The worldly, selfish, busy sons of time think
                     not of these ennobling and benevolent exertions but with sighs, and shrugs, and
                     cold, repellent hearts. Yet the LABORER is worthy of his hire; and as God is
                     the Judge, who doeth all things well, the LABORER shall not finally go
                     unrewarded—the object of strong condolence and meaningless commiseration. He
                     shall stand BEFORE kings.</p>
                  <p>"Pray excuse me if I have, at this late hour, failed to make my ideas
                     intelligible, or have omitted some points material to the interest of the
                     subject. I am filled with the purpose of doing all in my power to aid the young
                     in securing to themselves the best education possible. To this I lend my
                     principal exertions. The young men of our country are remarkable for their
                     energy, devotedness to an idea, whole-heartedness in what they engage,
                     perseverance in pursuit—and they show all these traits of character in applying
                     time, talents, fortune, labor—years of labor, to gain artistic knowledge and
                     skill, the rules of trade, the power of letters, and professional science. They
                     are a busy, noble republic of youths. The whole frame of society supports
                     itself in them. I am engaged in a goodly work to help to educate them; and come
                     what may, let me not forget that it is for God and my country that I labor. I
                     rejoice every day in the society of your children. Hayden's peculiarities, and
                     Stella's frankness give me an agreeable study. My duties are arduous, though
                     pleasing. May but my strength last a few years, I will do a good work here. For
                     this I pray.</p>

               <head type="sub">HERE ARISES THE STORY OF CLIFFORD AND OLIVIA</head>
               <p>CASTLEREAGH had at length broken away from his former parish and labors, and had
                  now become the resident pastor of the interesting parish of LINDENVALE.</p>
               <p>It was stipulated at the time of his settlement, that he should have the liberty
                  to establish, and have the care of a school for the intellectual and more
                  improvement of the young learners of the village, and of such as might resort to
                  him from abroad.</p>
               <p>With funds procured him by his friends—friends, true, unflinching and generous to
                  the last—the Seminary buildings were erected, and made a goodly appearance. The
                  Institution was situated on one of the main streets of the village, a little in
                  the back-ground of the lot, and on a rising hillock covered with oaks and walnuts
                  and chestnuts. Into the midst of these the edifice was let down <abbr>(i.
                     e.,</abbr> built up), and there, in one of the sweetest shades—in one of the
                  most retired and winning groves in all the valley of Lindendale, the young minds
                  of the Institute were forming for the busy work and play-ground of life.<ref

               </note>
               <p>We will introduce the school family to you.</p>
               <p>There are two departments to the school; one is for the young gentlemen and lads,
                  the other for young ladies and misses. Clifford presides over the former, and Miss
                  Frances Halloway over the latter. Castlereagh has a position as instructor in the
                  higher mental and moral sciences, having deemed it best for the Institute to hold
                  some positive relation to it of this sort.</p>
               <p>He has on him, also, all the general management of the school and family,
                  outwardly superintending and financiering. He plays the part of diplomatic
                  minister, and seals and breaks the foreign correspondence. He prepares the public
                  expresses and bulletins, and knows where the different wires are sprung that
                  announce opinions. He has in charge the <emph>commissary</emph> department, with
                  its ever-recurring relation to steaks, roasts, fries and bakes. In the government,
                  he can not otherwise hold an umpirage.</p>
               <p>Clifford Hayward, having completed his University studies, was now spending the
                  last half-year of his professional course with Castlereagh, the husband of his
                  sister, Sarah Matilda. A long, severe course of study had impaired his health, and
                  Castlereagh induced him to take the position of principal teacher in his school
                  for two years. With his assistance, the Institute was opened very much to every
                  body's satisfaction, especially that of Castlereagh. Clifford added to good sense,
                  wit, conversational power, poetry, music, sentiment while sympathy was not a
                  redundant item of<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6389-00000039"/> himself, but an
                  affluent aggregate of his nature. He could weep—but only when the lachrymal tide
                  was forgotten, and his soul was broken. He could suffer (as Castlereagh had seen
                  him) the highest degrees of personal anguish, prostrated on his couch, pale,
                  convulsed, and near dying, without a tear. But when the sweet, curly-haired,
                  amiable and precocious sister, LOUISA, died, and there was no more life in her, he
                  cast himself with such a bitter groan on the bed, and wept with such convulsive
                  paroxysms, that others wept for him, and forgot the dead! His was a strong
                  sympathy, but not a controlling point in his character. It was rather his nature's
                  antidote, useful, extraordinary, but never as a commodity.</p>
               <p>The School-boys loved him. And he had his favorties, who could always win him any
                  where, and lead him from his musings. On the play-ground they ran to meet him, and
                  chose him on this or that side of the game, to give a rival party what they called
                  a Waterloo defeat! Alas! poor NAPOLEON, that every great discomfiture, signal and
                  manifest, should take its nomenclature from thine! But the passionate sympathy of
                  a world pours out its oblation over thy misfortune in the name of Waterloo. The
                  glory of the conqueror is forgotten in sorrow for the conquered. The human mind
                  seems unable to prevent this; for to say that one was the greater general than the
                  other on that fated field, is but to accummulate fresh emotions of sympathy for
                  him whose sword that day was sent home to its scabbard bloodless; who "slept his
                  last sleep on a lone isle of the ocean."</p>
               <p>At Richmond, Clifford formed the acquaintance of a beautiful young friend, who was
                  a few weeks a visitor at his sister's. She resided in one of the Northern cities,
                  and was passionately fond of Nature as developed in the rural villages of New
                  England. She was fond of botanizing, and would ramble over the most distant hills
                  for a rare plant, or venture into the dark ravines in quest of any thing that
                  would enrich her herbarium, even a simple fern itself. She was but seventeen years
                  of age, yet her form was fully developed and graceful. Her dark ringlets hung in
                  great clusters down her neck and arms. Her conversation was lively, enthusiastic,
                  intelligent. Her manners highly cultivated, and her heart pure and trustful.</p>
               <p>Clifford often accompanied her abroad, and seemed never happier than when he could
                  be her escort in her rambles, or regale her with his music. Their acquaintance
                  seemed fast ripening into a personal regard, when Olivia received a sudden summons
                  to return home, and accompany an invalid sister to the South. Clifford was quite
                  unreconciled to so distant and uncertain a parting; but disdaining to complain
                  aloud, he merely became less sociable and apparently indifferent! Olivia, busying
                  herself over her preparations for leaving, concealed in the main the true feelings
                  that may have fluttered in her heart, and it was beyond the eyes of Castlereagh,
                  probably of Clifford, to discover any sorrow in<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000040"/> her separation that did not connect with her
                  suffering sister. Clifford was a little piqued at this, thinking it strange that
                  so agreeable an acquaintance could be terminated, perhaps forever, with so little
                  apparent regret! He thought of a great many ways of telling her so before she
                  left. But no opportunity seemed to occur favorable to it, even though they took
                  their walk together as usual on her last day at Richmond, and were a whole hour
                  together humming music in the evening. Only this was said between them, "When you
                  reach Alabama," said Clifford, "perhaps some time or other you may receive a
                  letter from me."</p>
               <p>"That," said she, "is hardly supposable."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because the mails seldom reach the back-hill settlements!"</p>
               <p>Clifford was about thinking of some proper answer to this, when company appeared,
                  and their <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-á-tête</foreign> was broken.</p>
               <p>The next day Olivia's place was vacant, and she soon after accompanied her sister
                  and friends on their Southern tour.</p>
               <p>When the school is over for the day, Clifford frequently wanders away into the
                  forest alone. His hands are thrust deep into his coat-pockets. He, apparently,
                  cares but little where he goes, or how long time he may be absent. Castlereagh
                  often thinks, at such times, that Olivia may be in his mind, her image painted on
                  his heart, wandering with him in the groves.</p>
               <p>But let us go on with our introduction to the school under Clifford's care; there
                  are about forty lads, some of them looking exceedingly bright. They are from the
                  village, many of them—a part from neighboring towns and from distant cities. Some
                  of them are boarding-pupils, others are day-scholars. They are learners all the
                  way from Webster's Spelling Book and Mental Exercises in Arithmetic, to Euclid,
                  and Virgil, and Homer. Good, bright, keen, hard, wide-awake boys. They will learn
                  good and evil fast. Look out for them, Clifford—Castlereagh, pray for them!—</p>
               <p>Here is one of them. He sits cross-limbed and diagonally on his seat. His left
                  hand rests heavily on his opened Algebra. His right plays with his penknife. His
                  hair is thrown into wild grass-clusters and entangled nets. His collar is off, and
                  his neck-tie loose and open. A fixed, and yet easy. though unreadable expression
                  sits on his whole phiz. He is not at work, nor is he at play. Speak to him, and he
                  hears you; leave him, and he is never alone; molest him and he will give you a
                  blow or a keen reproof; crowd him, and he will close his book; give him a gentle
                  smile, and he will re-open it. This is Hayden, careless, easy, fixed,
                  peculiar.</p>
               <p>And there, leaning back in his seat, in fat, fair, and easy independence, is
                  Horace. His dark hair curls<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6389-00000041"/> around his
                  ears, and rolls around his brow, and hangs gracefully here and there, never
                  looking combed, and seldom <emph>un</emph>combed; and his eyes sparkle under his
                  shady lashes, black—and yet smiling, laughing eyes, small twinklers in banks of
                  fat, and dimpled cheeks, and bewitching smiles. But Horace is too fat and easy for
                  a scholar. He is tired; look, he nods in his seat. "<emph>Horace!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Sir!" cries the waking youth.</p>
               <p>'Don't go to sleep!"</p>
               <p>"No! <emph>sir!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And here is a surly-looking, uncultivated fellow, a great green boy from a distant
                  town. Look out for him boys. He carries anger in his eyes. He is yelept Hyder Ali,
                  and will make, by and by, a soldier in the Turk's grand army.</p>
               <p>In the corner of the room, close by the window, in a cosy, well-to-do sort of a
                  seat, with his books all well-packed and arranged; his person well-attired; his
                  bright countenance showing a boy of uncommon native energy and enthusiasm; his eye
                  bent on his book, and careless of the hum of the school-room is the lad we have
                  already heard somewhat of. It is Amos, the son of illiterate Artaxerxes. The boy
                  reads slowly, but correctly. He lays a good foundation for every one of his
                  studies. Castlereagh sits beside him a few moments.</p>
               <p>"Amos!"</p>
               <p>"Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Getting on?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so, a little."</p>
               <p>"Love the book?"</p>
               <p>"Somewhat, sir!"</p>
               <p>"You read and write?"</p>
               <p>"Beginning—rather back of the fellows."</p>
               <p>"You will overtake them, if industrious."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, some of them."</p>
               <p>"What is your highest motive for studying, Amos?"</p>
               <p>"Motive? To please my father."</p>
               <p>"You love your father, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Love him! Indeed, sir, I love nobody else as well."</p>
               <p>"He is then, I presume, a kind and a good father?"</p>
               <p>"Did you, sir, ever know one who was not?"</p>
               <p>"Most men are kind to their children."</p>
               <p>"My father, sir, never bade me do what is improper. He wishes me to study and make
                  myself an intelligent man. I study to please him."</p>
               <p>"Amos, go on as you have begun. Your father will reward you with his continued
                  love, and your heavenly Father will bless you, if you also do all things to his
                  glory. He has said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother.' Good-by."</p>
               <p>There is a lad that has his desk near the teacher's platform, and he too is a
                  bright, thin, pale-faced, and flaxen-haired boy. His eye can flash, his white
                  cheek redden. His features, when composed, indicate no very decisive strength of
                  character. He is mild in appearance; but all his actions show him attentive to
                  what is passing. His movements are quick, his lessons<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000042"/> are perfect, his behavior sober, his intercourse
                  with others kind, and respectfully retiring. He never quarrels, but is not tame,
                  nor is he a coward. He pursues the even tenor of his way, and is acknowledged a
                  fine scholar, and a fine companionable fellow by all. It is Fitz Maurice
                  Williams.</p>
               <p>There is a row of boys, good, bad, indifferent, occupying the central desks. They
                  whisper by stealth, they study under law, they are the rough unhewn oak and the
                  unchiseled marble. They will hardly bear smoothing, but may become substantial
                  pillars and blocks in the edifice of mind. Hark! and you will hear now and then
                  from one of them a heavy breathing, a lifting of the chest, as though the task
                  were infinitely impossible. Look! and you will observe one gazing off on the green
                  fields, intently watching the flying of the birds and the frolic of the lambs.
                  Withdraw a moment, and lo! the pack all yawn, or smile, or gesticulate in mirth or
                  anger, and appear a disordered band, ready for a rush, a mêlee. Appear again, and
                  behold! quiet reigns, order is resumed, every seat is filled, every eye is bent on
                  the page; industrious! earnest! faithful boys. Some of you will come within an
                  inch of States Prison by and by. In many a rumpus you will bear your part. Look
                  out for the police staff when after swindlers, and remember to vote strong against
                  capital punishment. There are large boys, there are small boys, there are bold and
                  shy, truthful and false; there are favorites and friendless less; there are
                  quarrelsome and pacific; there are strong and weak; there are hectors and
                  sufferers; there are revengeful and forgiving.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Peter?"</p>
               <p>"Roswell Childs struck me."</p>
               <p>"I did not strike him—he kicked me."</p>
               <p>"I did not kick him, sir."</p>
               <p>"He did."</p>
               <p>"Come here, Roswell and Peter—what is the matter, and what is <emph>truth</emph>
                  in all this?"</p>
               <p>"The truth is, sir, that Peter Hills is always kicking, and careless whether he
                  hits me or the desk."</p>
               <p>"Does he kick out of a sort of spite, or when he is absorbed in his studies
                  without thought?"</p>
               <p>"Whichever way, he sometimes hurts a fellow, that's certain."</p>
               <p>"Well, do you seriously think, Roswell, that Peter intentionally gave you a
                  kick?"</p>
               <p>"How could it be otherwise, sir, when there is room enough for him on his own
                  side?"</p>
               <p>"Well, have you had any quarrel together lately?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, he quarreled with me to-day."</p>
               <p>"What did he do to you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"He—he—stole my knife."</p>
               <p>"And you?"</p>
               <p>"I caught him and—and—got it back, sir: that's all."</p>
               <p>"Well, Peter, how is it? Do you try to kick Roswell?"</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6389-00000043"/>
               <p>"I do not. I am not aware that I ever kicked him."</p>
               <p>"You l—," Roswell was just uttering, when Clifford stopped him.</p>
               <p>"You did not intend to kick him?"</p>
               <p>"I had no occasion to, sir."</p>
               <p>"Have you not quarreled with him?"</p>
               <p>"He has been angry at me, sir, because I forgot last night at the close of school
                  to return his knife, which he had lent me."</p>
               <p>"Then he lent you his knife?"</p>
               <p>"He did."</p>
               <p>"He begged it," says Roswell.</p>
               <p>"It is true, I asked him for it."</p>
               <p>"Then you have not kicked him purposely; you have not quarreled with him; you have
                  not stolen his knife. What did he strike you for?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know, sir."</p>
               <p>"Why did you strike him, Roswell?"</p>
               <p>"For kicking me."</p>
               <p>"Henderson! Did you see this matter?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir."</p>
               <p>"Did you, Hogarth?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Did Peter kick Roswell?"</p>
               <p>"Don't know, sir."</p>
               <p>"What do you know about it?"</p>
               <p>"I saw Peter curl and cry."</p>
               <p>"What made him curl and cry?"</p>
               <p>"I could n't say, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, your testimony is not worth much."</p>
               <p>"Jones! Did Roswell strike Peter?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yes, sir,</emph> he did."</p>
               <p>"What for?"</p>
               <p>"For stealing his knife. I believe."</p>
               <p>"When did he strike him?"</p>
               <p>"This morning, sir."</p>
               <p>"Oh! ho! We don't progress at all with such testimony—all off the track, Jones.
                  Did you see him him NOW?"</p>
               <p>"Now? <emph>No, sir, I didn't.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I come back, then, to you, Roswell. You allow you did strike him. Give me your
                  hand. <emph>Once! twice! three</emph> times! Will you strike him again? Speak!
                  Tell me if you are going to maim a little fellow like Peter Hills, when he is
                  quietly pursuing his studies?" As the dark eye of Clifford searched the boy's
                  conscience, his brute will gave way, and with a downcast face, and eyes swimming
                  with tears, he faltered, "No, Sir, I will not."</p>
               <p>"Then, with this, I forgive you. Redeem yourself in my opinion quickly, or you
                  must forfeit my respect and your privileges in this school."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh heard of this, and sighed over it, lamenting the development of such
                  evil in the character of any of his pupils. He drew Roswell and Peter into his
                  study, and made them sensible of the importance of kindness one toward another,
                  and succeeded in softening to a considerable extent the rough character of<pb
                     n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6389-00000044"/> the elder boy. Already he discovered that
                  he had undertaken a great work, to educate the mind, and to regulate the hearts of
                  his pupils, securing correct and kindly habits in their familiar intercourse with
                  one another. But the school progressed. It was popular. Every body praised it.
                  Every body sent pupils. The newspapers praised it. "We know not a more agreeable
                  and fascinating teacher of youth than the Rev. Elbert Castlereagh, nor an
                  institution for the development of mind and character is early life equal to the
                  recently established Lindenvale Institute." Every day or two came letters or
                  inquiry or personal applications. Mr. Castlereagh would set himself in his study
                  to sermonize early in the day. Directly he is called down. Mr. A. is in the parlor
                  with his son, whom he wishes to place in the school. Mr. B. calls directly after
                  to inquire the price of tuition Colonel C. D. calls in fifteen minutes to
                  introduce his friend Mr. E. from the West Indies, who has a son he desires taken
                  into the family to board. The morning wears away, the sermon drags. It is noon.
                  Dinner is announced, and after it, engagements abroad prevent any sermonizing. See
                  the pastor. He is by the sick bed. He is at the mournful funeral. He is passing
                  hours in a distant District School as an examiner of its condition. He is at tea
                  three miles from home. He is anon at home, and all the family cluster round him.
                  He must make one in the little gathering of the evening home circle. The programme
                  represents "magic music," "tableaux," "story-telling," "quadrilles by amateurs,"
                  and "a grand chorus of sacred music to close." And the sermons drag. At ten, when
                  the family circle breaks up, he is weary, and by eleven sleeps."</p>
               <p>But there is another department of the school. Cast back these folding-doors and
                  you step directly into it. Here are thirty or forty young ladies and misses,
                  presided over by Miss Halloway. They have each a separate desk, and occupy a large
                  and singularly neat and tasteful room. The young ladies smile on Castlereagh as he
                  passes them. They form a most delightful group. Is there a more interesting sight
                  than a roomful of happy-faced, intelligent, earnest, studious young ladies, who
                  are all devotedly attending to those studies and acquisitions which will elevate
                  the character and embellish life with every attractive grace? Castlereagh was
                  always charmed with the sight, and took the deepest interest in the improvement of
                  each one of his fair young pupils. He found especial pleasure, also, in
                  introducing visitors to this department of his school. Rarely did one visit it
                  without partaking of his enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"Stay! Mr. and Mrs. Kirk Alling, a few moments, and we shall close the school with
                  singing."</p>
               <p>They expressed a pleasure to wait.</p>
               <p>"In the mean time," said Mrs. Kirk Alling, in a low tone, "pray tell me who that
                  tall, dark-haired girl in the corner may be?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! that staid, sober-looking miss, poring over<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000045"/> her French book? It is Miss Melinda Hillhouse, a
                  distant relative, as I suppose, of the celebrated James Hillhouse, of a
                  neighboring city. She is our poetess."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I fancy there is something refined and elevated about her. She has an
                  intellectual face, a fine forehead, a commanding, though a rather set
                  expression."</p>
               <p>"A noble girl, madam; just seventeen, and without a passion equal to her love of
                  the muses."</p>
               <p>"What has she done with her pen?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! we shall see—we shall see. She is a mere girl yet. Let her alone for
                  awhile—we shall see."</p>
               <p>"Here, on the left, are two bright-looking girls, sir. I think they are exquisites
                  in their way."</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! Yes. They fancy life a great affair to them. They are fond of their showy
                  dresses and top-knots; and, strange as it may seem to you, one of them is our best
                  mathematician."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I must know her name."</p>
               <p>"Grace Percival."</p>
               <p>"Not the daughter of the plain Mr. Percival, in the North Section?"</p>
               <p>"The same. Her parents are plain, unobtrusive people, but they have remarkable
                  character. Mr. Percival is himself fond of mathematics, and every evening studies
                  with his children. He is a very fine surveyor, and a citizen highly respected.
                  Mrs. Percival, when a girl, it is said, was fond of gay things, and so it comes
                  natural to the daughter. By and by you will see a strong notable character
                  there."</p>
               <p>"And the other?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't know as much about her. She is a great reader, and can sing most
                  sweetly."</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirk Alling admired the pencil-sketchings of two young misses near him, and in
                  commending their work, inquired their names of Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"Isabel and Stella: they are both inmates of my family; and so is Miss Hillhouse;
                  and there are some three or four besides them."</p>
               <p>The bell in the cupola was struck a few times, the absentees came hurrying in from
                  their private studying-rooms, books were all laid aside, the folding-doors were
                  opened, and the two departments appeared, arranged, each in its proper order, and
                  all the bright faces turned toward the central platform, where were the teachers
                  and visitors.</p>
               <p>Clifford took his seat at the piano.</p>
               <p>"My scholars," said Castlereagh, "the duties of the school-room are now, for
                  another day of life, ended. I hope that you have all so passed this day, that you
                  can part in peace and love, and can now unite heartily in singing the beautiful

               <p>The hymn was sung with much enthusiasm by the school, Sarah Matilda gliding in
                  just in season to lead off the air. The school was then closed; and, after the
                  usual running here and there to find a lost glove, shawl, bonnet, cap, or book,
                  the boys hurried away; and presently, with all heartiness in many an embrace, and
                  love in many an upturned lip and cheek, the young misses, one after another, and
                  anon in little jaunting and shouting clans, went their several ways, homeward.</p>
               <p>"My! what an interesting life you are leading here, Brother Castlereagh!" said his
                  reverence, Kirk Alling. "It is wonderfully so. How full of promise to you, and to
                  them, and to the world—why, I should like this myself!"</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear Brother Kirk, when I make change, I should like it that you were my
                  successor. It is in truth a great, a thrilling, an immeasurably interesting
                  position. Here are eighty young minds forming for influence in the world. Their
                  position will affect thousands—I may safely say millions. You may consider a
                  school of this sort, the begun center of a circle of influences of mind on mind,
                  its larger circumference reaching into the very heavens."</p>
               <p>"I see it—I see it, sir. Here are your ministers preaching to hundreds and
                  thousands of souls, some of them, in their turn, preaching to others. Here are
                  your lawyers and statesmen. Here are your gifted artisans, merchants, and
                  professional men of all sorts. Here your authors and fair ripe scholars, male and
                  female—fathers and mothers, whose cultivated minds and hearts shall make a
                  gladsome home for their children, and so go far to sustain every good and
                  religious institution."</p>
               <p>"You have it, brother. That's the view. It's a world-wide one; and as generous as
                  it is large."</p>
               <p>"And is not the care, the anxiety excessive?"</p>
               <p>"Oh!—why—for that matter, one must expect something of the kind. Yes, I have much
                  to do. There are some difficulties to overcome—some anxious hours to get through.
                  But with nerve, dear sir, nerve all up, and the work promising so well, I hope to
                  get on."</p>
               <p>Clifford sat drumming at the piano; now a light melody then a low broken
                  succession of chords—anon flourishing through some wild air of Mozart.</p>
               <p>"What call you that, Mr. Hayward?" inquired Miss Holloway, approaching him, and
                  languidly leaning on the instrument. Clifford said nothing; but as he rollicked
                  away over the music, slowly moved his face toward her, with one of his penetrating
                  glances, from which, almost starting, she exclaimed: "Now, fie, Mr. Hayward; your
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">moderato quasi andantino,</foreign> your <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">allegro vivo energico</foreign> are thrown away on the company.
                  See! There are the two married ladies sauntering off<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000047"/> by themselves. And do hear their good, venerable
                  reverences' praise up school-keeping! Oh! it is delicious! Hear them. They think
                  there is nothing so 'thrilling,' so 'compensatory,' so 'full of promise,' so
                  'happy' on earth. Oh, dear me!—Well, is it not rich and curious though?"</p>
               <p>"Very," said he, in reply; and shutting up the piano; continued, "and now for a
                  ramble, eh?"</p>
               <p>"If you please, sir;" and away they hastened for a long, delightful range of the
                  groves and mountains.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh soon after sat down in his study to write sermons.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CHURCH, THE PEOPLE, THE PRAYER, THE SERMON, THE HOUR.</head>
               <p>As Castlereagh entered the aisle of his church on the Sabbath day, the sexton
                  ceased to toll the bell, and the organist began to fill the house with the rich
                  tones of the instrument under his care; other sounds were hushed, the leaves of
                  books were unturned, slipdoors opened and closed with care; forms of persons in
                  the dark aisles silently as shadows passed from one point to another, and sank to
                  their seats. Few came with bold, up-staring-gazing features to see and be seen.
                  The appearance of the Lindenvale church was that of a calm, pious assemblage, who
                  came together to worship the Lord of Hosts, to pray fervently to Him, in all
                  sincerity confessing their sins. They came to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ from
                  one of his humble and earnest embassadors. They expected if he spoke to them of
                  sin, they should be made to see its execrable nature, and the impossibility of
                  human escape and relief. If, of the law, they should tremble under its eternal
                  purity and sanctions; if, of the atonement, that the whole plan of redemption
                  would be sketched before<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6389-00000048"/> them; if, of the
                  practical duties of life, that these would be arranged in no imaginary form high
                  out of sight; but in the discernible verities of our sin-stricken earth and
                  suffering society-world, as it is. Woe to him, who, with a tender conscience, has
                  neither said his prayers, nor read his Bible on that day. The preacher would soon
                  find him out, and send an arrow of conviction to his heart. He would pray for
                  blessings on all those who, on that day, had sought first the forgiveness of their
                  sins, and a due preparation for the sanctuary, by fervent supplication before God,
                  in the retirement of the closet! Ah! here were some cut off. He would pray for
                  light and for enjoyment among all those who had made the Word of God their morning
                  study. And here again, some who had slumbered late, and some who had toileted
                  late, had little sense of personal advantage. And when he prayed for poor,
                  unworthy sinners; here again, some were found to whom the prayer conveyed but
                  little heart-felt enjoyment, because of pride. And when he prayed that heavy
                  chastisements and harassing affictions, and poverty, and all suffering, might not
                  delude men, as, though these were an atonement for their sins, and a ground of
                  their pardon—alas! some had not a deepness of theology, nor a reading of Scripture
                  adequate to go along with him. And so, when he prayed that God would glorify
                  Himself in all things, whether by the sinner's salvation or condemnation, <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">mihi miserabile!</foreign> can he mean to pray thus?</p>
               <p>Castlereagh's prayers were short. He frequently seemed not to know whether they
                  were short or extended. They were usually the former, and ended
                  abruptly—impressively. But they were meant to be <emph>prayers</emph>—prayers for
                  dead sinners—but living men, for whom Christ died. Prayer must be humble, devout,
                  unto God; a thanksgiving, a confession of sins, supplicatory, submissive. It must
                  be kind toward men, and self-abasing before God.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh read the Word of God, with an eye fixed down upon its pages, as
                  studying into, and understanding, and enjoying its transparent sentences. It
                  seemed as though he heard rolling through it, the River of the Fountain of Life.
                  As he gazed on it, deeper floods of the Light of the World waved before him, and
                  dispelled his darkness. As his soul became an hungered, over it the Bread of Life
                  was conveyed to him and he was strengthened. His earnest readings led many of his
                  congregation to open their Bibles and follow him closely, striving themselves to
                  be near the great sources. And he sought to keep them with him, ever as it were,
                  waving the upward hand, a signal of the track over which he was led, and an
                  invitation and entreaty to them to go with, or to follow after him. He felt the
                  richnes of the simple Bible-words, and himself was able to work out many a full,
                  soul-satisfying commentary on them. Impressive reading of the sacred Scriptures,
                  hath in it much to awaken and instruct. Castlereagh's Scripture-readings and brief
                     comments<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6389-00000049"/> were thought among his best
                  things on the Sabbath. Thus was the BIBLE honored through him.</p>
               <p>He took for himself and for others a deep interest in the praises of the
                  sanctuary; and his soul seemed often in transports of rapture, just on the high
                  wings of an angel homeward-bound, as he listened to the songs of redemption poured
                  forth from the voices of redeemed sinners around him. Blessed employment of the
                  gifted muse, to cast the sacred text into lyric verse, and preserving its pure
                  theology, to give us the Bible in the shining robes of poetry. And then, blessed
                  be the great master artists, who have in their own spirits found, and have given
                  out unto us, the waving scales of melody, the mysterious chords of harmony, the
                  evervarying, ascending and descending vibrations whereon our pure Scripture poetry
                  may be stretched, and where it may repose, and where it may speak to us, and
                  quadruple its beauty, its longevity and its power. Music! poetry! truth! prayer!
                  What significant <foreign xml:lang="LAT">memorabilia</foreign> of the sanctuary!
                  what a grand basis of religion! The gates of untruth can never prevail against a
                  cause so deeply set in the nature of the human soul.</p>
               <p>With plain and simple, yet with well-chosen words, that should convey the truth to
                  the hearts of his people, Castlereagh prepared his sermons. They were neither long
                  nor prosy sermons. If they were graceful, they were not merely ornamental. If they
                  contained some fancies, yet were they far from things rhapsodical and vain.
                  Wanting in rhetoric they seldom dom were, but they were not specimens of mere
                  oratorical study. They were often, usually, original in the finest sense of the
                  term, but they were, also, often enriched with quotations from other writers. They
                  were affectionate and earnest; they were also logical and sound. Castlereagh
                  believed that the sermon had a just and holy mission, as well as the prayer, as
                  well as music and poetry and the Word. It was a painful idea to him that it might
                  be of any materials and a thing by itself, unsound, illogical, absurd,
                  self-contradictory and repulsive, or at least unimpressive, when all else in the
                  sanctuary was full of grace and truth! "Beaten oil for the sanctuary," was his
                  motto; and the oil was beaten often by help of the midnight lamp; yea, late into
                  the morning even of the blessed day itself. Thus often work they themselves
                  unfairly, the servants of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh's Sabbath left him usually worn down in strength. But it was sweet to
                  call together his family after early tea, and, ere the sun declined, attend to the
                  exercises of devotion with them. With a family of twelve or fifteen
                  boarding-pupils, his own household and the teachers, all numbering twenty or
                  twenty-five persons, they formed a very pleasant and delightful circle, where he
                  customarily presided, reading first two or three verses in the Scripture, and each
                  one of the circle in his turn following till all had read. Then came the inquiry
                  for the text, of one; the subject of the discourse, from another; some of the
                  divisions, from<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6389-00000050"/> a third; important
                  truths, from another. After this came a full recital of the commandments, and
                  verses of hymns by those who were to learn them. Then, accompanied by the
                  melodeon, some appropriate hymn was sung, and prayer brought the exercises to a
                  close.</p>
               <p>Thus a full hour was often passed. Delightful hour to memory now! Oh! hour!
                     <emph>hour!</emph> HOUR of evening prayer in the family school at Lindenvale.
                  The memory of thee is now before my eye. I see the stranger with them. He is
                  wiping the warm joy-tear away. I hear the happy voices of children, youth and age,
                  praising and adoring God. I see them kneeling before Him. It is a group of loving
                  and affectionate hearts. They have reposed from secular study, and have this day
                  acquired religious knowledge.</p>
               <p>After devotions, while Castlereagh was occupied with some preparations for his
                  third public exercise, and often into the evening itself, Mrs. Castlereagh
                  gathered the young pupils all around her, and faithfully studied out the
                  Sabbath-school lesson for the next Sunday.</p>
               <p>The children were all sent early to their night-slumbers on the Sabbath evening.
                  Some of them attended the third service; others, especially the younger portion,
                  chose to remain away, and were early sent with sleepy eyes to their pillows.</p>
               <p>"I am tired—I am wearied out. I am faint and gone, gone, <emph>gone</emph> with
                  these three efforts and labors," said Castlereagh, as he came home from the
                  evening meeting.</p>
               <p>"I knew you would be. I told you so, my dear," said his wife. "It is too much for
                  you, and you will ruin your fine health if you do not adopt a different
                  course."</p>
               <p>"How can I? Pray, what course?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! let it be now. Here is a bowl of good cool milk and warm mush, which you
                  like, and some tea if you want."</p>
               <p>"No—no."</p>
               <p>"Well, the milk, then."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, that is good. But what course?"</p>
               <p>"Can you not let the church members carry on the third meeting?"</p>
               <p>"They say they can not."</p>
               <p>"Try them. Never were there better men to exhort and to pray. Why not?"</p>
               <p>Castlereagh partook of his milk; and soon feeling refreshed, exclaimed, "Why,
                  Matilda, I am strong now. I feel, if it were necessary, that I could even go and
                  speak again."</p>
               <p>"Oh! now that is too, too bad, husband. Thus perish all my hopes of even a little
                  reform in you. I do firmly believe, and think it is my final belief, that, as your
                  sister Emily once told you, 'you will kill yourself working for other
                  people.'"</p>
               <p>"Ha! Did little Emmie say that? Well—it may be so. Why should I not? Should I lie
                  in an idle, useless posture!"</p>
               <p>"Elbert Castlereagh, it can by no good meaning of<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000051"/> language imply that you are in an idle and useless
                  position, if, instead of being at your third meeting on Sabbath evening, it is
                  said of you that you are at home with your family, or calmly reading in your study
                  after the labors of the day, or even sound asleep for the night on your bed."</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear wife, I don't know about all that."</p>
               <p>"I know—and every body here says so. Every one seems to say you are doing too
                  much."</p>
               <p>"Oh! how can we do too much in a cause where the Saviour actually perished. If we
                  die, we have him for our Leader."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but the Saviour does not wish you to throw away, but to use to the best
                  advantage, your life, as he did His life. He was repeatedly environed with
                  difficulties, and his disciples were fearful on His account, but He says to them,
                  'My time is not yet.' In seasons of persecution, He bade them flee to other
                  places. He sent them forth to exercise large prudence in publishing his Gospel. In
                  a word, I do not think a modern preacher is called to throw himself into a
                  coughing consumption, or to fasten on him the bronchitis, making necessary a
                  voyage to Europe for a cure, or to preach himself into a chronic diarrhea or
                  cholera, and in any manner to perish a martyr to an unnecessary class of
                  exertions, in order to say with the more emphasis, 'I have the Saviour for my
                  example and Leader!' No, I do not, Elbert."</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare, I am more than half of your mind about it. But I do feel
                  interested, and I want to do all that lies in my power for the good of souls."</p>
               <p>"Yes, very true. But in the end, you <emph>may do more</emph> by doing less
                  now."</p>
               <p>Word was here brought to Sarah Matilda that Clifford wished to see her. She
                  returned in a few minutes, and said that he was a good deal unwell. Castlereagh
                  and Sarah sat up with him till two o'clock, when he obtained relief and slept.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was confined closely in his place to the school for the next two
                  weeks, and when Clifford was at last able to relieve him, they crossed each
                  other's paths, looking both of them as thin and cadaverous as though they had been
                  without food or rest for at least three days and nights.</p>
               <p>And so Castlereagh labored—went down, went up, ahead and astern, wearing and
                  tearing out a life in deeds well done, but, from their very nature, heavily
                  borne.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WE SHALL DO MUCH GOOD AND GET RICH.</head>
               <p>THE first term of the school came to the close in a violent snow-storm. Much had
                  been done by teachers and pupils to prepare for the examination. The hall of the
                  Institute had been decorated with evergreen; the platform carpeted; seats arranged
                  for the accommodation of visitors, and the lamps disposed for the best effect for
                  the exercises of the evening. There were to be an address by Castlereagh, music by
                  the teachers and pupils, orations by the boys, and selections from the
                  compositions of both sexes of pupils.</p>
               <p>The morning was dull with clouds, and the day heavy with storm. In the evening,
                  few came, or could, with convenience; although the pupils scolded, although the
                  bell rang cheerily, and the lamps were all burning brightly, not twenty-five
                  persons dared, or cared to breast the storm.</p>
               <p>"Well, this is really a downright winter-setter," said Castlereagh, as he listened
                  to the hoarse winds, and noticed the snow piling on the windows.</p>
               <p>"Why couldn't it snow to-morrow, I wonder?" said Clifford.</p>
               <p>"Patience, patience, Mr. Hayward," said Miss Halloway; "it does not snow merely
                  for our benefit."</p>
               <p>"No, it is for the benefit of that shouting sleigh-full gang, just gone along,
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and for old winter's honor. Is it not time that the hoary honors of the year
                  should be put on?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! fie, Miss Halloway; do you call a snow-storm the honor of winter?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I do. What is winter to us without it? We boast to our Southern
                  friends of our snow-clad hills, and frozen streams. Surely, half the idea of a
                  northern winter is a snow-bank and a sleigh-ride. Give me the distant view of
                  snow-clad mountains; let me hear the ringing of the sleigh-bells. These I desire
                  in the season of them, and in their highest perfection!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! ho! you are a lover of winter truly."</p>
               <p>Miss Halloway gave him a cheerful smile, and answered, "A great admirer and
                  venerator of the old-fashioned, hard, driving and drifting snow-storm am I."</p>
               <p>"Well, give me the sunny clime of the South—I don't like these freezing
                  atmospheres and these perpetual storms."</p>
               <p>"The sunny South hath, doubtless, attractions—"</p>
               <p>"Nay!—nay! I am speaking of the skies."</p>
               <p>"And I, of human cheeks and eyes. Hark!"</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6389-00000053"/>
               <p>"The hour has arrived for the exercises to commence," said Castlereagh.
                  Immediately all the pupils arose, and Clifford, seating himself at the piano,
                  played, while they all sung a joyful welcome to the school.</p>
               <p>The pupils, numbering seventy-five', were all present, and about twenty-five
                  visitors. These formed, after all, something of an audience, and most of the
                  exercises were gone over. Yet Hayden refused to speak before so meager a
                  collection, and looked daggers all the evening. Some others pouted, and many
                  dismalized over the storm. But, on the whole, the evening passed happily away,
                  and, when all was over, the bell rang as merrily as for a fire, and as wildly. The
                  boys leaped into the snow-banks. The girls hurried into their sleighs, and other
                  vehicles, and by and by all was still. The first term of Castlereagh Institute was
                  closed.</p>
               <p>Sarah Matilda had prepared a beautiful entertainment of fruit and sweetmeats for
                  the boarding-misses, who now all came in and partook of it in the highest glee.
                  Even Hayden recovered his good-humor, acknowledged his fault, and desired it might
                  be forgiven; and all the boys and girls begging for him, he was received again
                  into favor.</p>
               <p>And now the holiday vacation was at hand. Teachers and pupils exchanged many a
                  "merry Christmas" and "happy New Year" beforehand, and separated for the fortnight
                  with a comical mingling of tears and smiles, of sad regrets and joyous
                  anticipations. The sun shone forth, in dazzling splendor, over the unbroken
                  surface of the earth's fair covering, promising a welcome respite to the now
                  dispersing inmates of Lindenvale Parsonage, and a happy return to its pleasant
                  shades and occupations.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was, on the whole, pleased with the review of the term, and with the
                  object he had undertaken to accomplish. Yet he, in truth, confessed that it was a
                  difficult matter to carry out in all its details. It had in itself the promise of
                  usefulness, but the poetry and romance of the enterprise grew less striking than
                  at the first: it was eminently a practical, everyday department of labor.
                  "However," said he; "we shall do good, and get rich. There is do doubt of it. We
                  shall teach these boys and girls the whole science of numbers, the history of the
                  world, the great system of language, the power of thought, natural science, the
                  fine arts, and practical business. With these we shall combine purely moral and
                  mental philosophy, and arrive, by regular <emph>sequences,</emph> at the first
                  great knowledge of the soul( the Holy Spirit aiding and blessing us)—the existence
                  of a benevolent God and Creator, and his son Jesus Christ our Lord, whom, to know
                  aright, is eternal life. We must aim at this knowledge even from the first. I
                  will, I must, I desire to. If I fail of every other thing, let me not, oh! God,
                  fail of this.</p>
               <p>"As for riches, I am pretty sure of them also. It is<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000054"/> always the case, that a man becomes more or less
                  wealthy, who goes earnestlyinto any good business, and manages it with care. When
                  we are rich, if weary of teaching, we will build us a large, fine house, in a
                  sweet grove, near a beautiful stream, or lake, where there are delightful grounds,
                  fine rambles, delicious views, accommodating and intelligent neighbors; in a
                  healthy climate, where it will be invigorating to ride abroad, or to labor on our
                  grounds. We will strive to do good; we will give to the poor, to the benevolent
                  societies, and pass our life calmly and piously to its sun-down."</p>
               <p>Did ever miserly churl even, think such good thoughts as these, before the time of
                  Castlereagh?</p>

               <head type="sub">THE BELL HAS A ROPE, AND THAT GETS TIED.—JOURNAL.—LETTERS.</head>
               <p>THE newspapers, far and near, were filled with a magniloquent advertisement of the
                  second term of the Lindenvale Institute. Its location was given in respect to its
                  vicinity to cities, rail-roads, and places of classical interest and importance.
                  The advantages of the Institute for classical, practical, and ornamental
                  acquisitions were duly set forth, and references of the highest character given.
                  The names of teaches in all the branches were duly set in capital letters, and the
                  public assured that Mr. and Mrs. Castlereagh, presiding over the whole
                  institution, and especially interested in the general character it sustained, as
                  favoring the interests of learning and the best progress of the pupils in their
                  charge, <emph>no fears</emph> need be entertained that they would fail of good
                  scholarship and rapid improvement.</p>
               <p>Indeed all this was said with sincerity. Castlereagh determined to give every
                  pupil under his care the very best education in his power, and to reform every
                  evil habit and every vicious way of life he might detect in any of them.</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6389-00000055"/>
               <p>Fully impressed with these views, he himself labored industriously to bring those
                  results to pass. He devoted more and more time and expense to the school. Hours,
                  days, weeks, and months, were passed by him in diligent, and often exhausting
                  exertions, to carry out his plans, and to make his school worthy of the public
                  patronage, and favorable for the development of the youthful intellect. Above all,
                  he strove to awaken the moral sense, and to lead his beloved pupils to the pursuit
                  of that heavenly knowledge, which is of chief value. In these efforts passed the
                  spring, the summer, the autumn again, and winter scenes a second time, and so on.
                  Two full years closed over him, and we shall learn something of them from the
                  following extracts from a journal kept during the time:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 6.—Our second examination has come off with great élà, having
                  the advantage of fine weather and traveling. Our rooms were crowded, especially at
                  the evening's entertainment. The speakers and musicians did themselves great
                  credit; our patrons seemed much gratified, and all bids fair for a pleasant summer
                  term.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>June 18.—Most of our family and the larger day scholars have been
                  out on a long botanical excursion. Though fatigued, they have evidently passed a
                  happy afternoon. What a desirable recreation!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>July 2—The boys are begging leave to fire off small cannons as well
                  as crackers around the libertypole on the 4th.—I must consider this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Sept. 29.—How could I help it? Miss Halloway, whom we all admired,
                  whose sweet voice, whose kindly smile, whose easy, graceful manners were our
                  frequent theme of praise—whose presence was ever welcome, preferred to leave us on
                  a roving visit to her distant friends. We besought her to stay with us, the pupils
                  clung around her, and made her ever-green garlands and choice presents; but, alas!
                  the hour came for the parting, waving of handkerchiefs, and suffused eyes. We have
                  not yet heard from her.</p>
               <p>We have now in her place, Miss Ellen Irving Merrick, whom we greatly esteem. She
                  has a strong, energetic character, though she is excessively modest and taciturn.
                  She is not Miss Halloway, but she <emph>is</emph> herself. We have lost the one
                  and gained the other. We shall see. She has made a good impression, so far.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Jan. 15.—I am worn down with care and labor. Clifford, my poor
                  brother, is half sick much of the time. He will not say so, but we can see it—feel
                  it, The doctor has compelled him to his chair in the school. Monsieur Tourné, the
                  French teacher, has left me suddenly, for France, in the hope of a new revolution.
                  I tried to calm him, and persuade him to wait a mouth. "Non, non," said he, and
                  away he sped. And so Josephine Leland is married to Lieutenant Henry Sickles, of
                  the army. I fear he is too gay, and a spendthrift. Sarah Matilda is more hopeful.
                  She is proud of her pupil.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 5.—How on earth can we get through with the examination? Here
                  we are in a pretty fix: the boys are quarrelsome, the teachers sick, the programme
                  not made out, myself driven night and day—nervous, irritable, and confused; Sarah
                  Matilda half vexed, and the cooks in a hurry, and boarders grumbling—whew!</p>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>You see, Hayden, Mr. Hayden is sick, Monsieur Tourné has left us, and Sturges,
                     the drawing-master master, is absent—can you give those lessons to the class
                     till he returns?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't think it possible, hardly, sir. Do you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>No difficulty, I fancy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't know enough, that's all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! I'll risk you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>I had rather not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>I know—but to oblige, you see, and help out of this pinch?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>True, there's a pinch.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>But it will soon get by.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, to be sure. Clifford will be well in a few days, and Sturges back directly,
                     and Miss Merrick will resume to-morrow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well. Perhaps it won't hurt me to help as well as I can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>All right, all right, Hayden; and—and—ah! by the way, keep a little lookout for
                     misdemeanors; eh? Hayden; eh?</p>

                  <p>By the way, look our for Joel Crawford and Charlie Howe; they are rather
                     bent—</p>

                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>I will keep a true bill, sir, and—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't magnify little things, Hayden. Just keep things straight, that's
                     all—that's all. See that the bell is in order, and rung in time; eh,
                     Hayden?</p>

                  <speaker>Hayden (all right).</speaker>

                  <p>The easiest thing in the world, sir, were it not for my studies that press

                  <p>Somewhat so, sir.</p>

                  <speaker>Hayden,</speaker>
                  <p>Algebra is <emph>very</emph> long, sir. The class is rebellious.</p>

                  <p>I can let up a little, if necessary. But you know we must get on as far as

                  <p>If you will condescend to shorten up a page, all will be right, and so it is

                  <p>You were saying "Fitz"—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>True; merely that—er—Fitz—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>That he said the rope was in a knot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>You are sure that he told you so? eh, Hayden?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, sir—or that is, he told one of the boys.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, ha! yourself or <emph>one</emph> of the boys. Can't recollect, I take it,

                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Not exactly. But I believe he told me, and then Joel, and then Charlie Howe,
                     and so on.</p>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well, my boy. The rope has been in a knot, it seems, and somebody's
                     guilty. Can you cipher it out? You don't know any thing about it yourself?
                     Come, now, fairly, Hayden?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>The rope is always snarling—</p>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Fitz says it was <emph>tied.</emph>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>So I understand.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you suppose it tied itself, Hayden?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>It's a curious rope, any how, and you see it goes through five or six pullies
                     in this way—so—and thus—and so on; and when it gets under full headway, away
                     goes the rope into the loft, and coils round the pulley, thus; and then when
                     you jump up and catch the end of the rope by the ceiling, and pull down, it's
                     almost sure to take a whirl over the pulley, and slip off in a tremendous hard,
                     stiff, terrible knot, and I<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6389-00000058"/>
                     shouldn't wonder a bit if it did so this very time—only—</p>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a very curious rope—very—very—and pullies, too—they are
                     curious—very—very.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Does the rope ever untie itself in the same way?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Doubtful, I think, about that.</p>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>You think it doubtful, do you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Almost certain, sir, it never does.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, so am I. Your explanations of the mishap is a very ingenious one—ought I
                     to say natural? But the rope got in a knot to-day before the bell was rung at
                     all. We had no "wake-up," no "prayer-bell." Somehow or other it contrived
                     itself into this shape during the night.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>Of that, of course, the boys being asleep, would know very little.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Hayden.</speaker>
                  <p>I heard no noise, sir, in my quarters.</p>

                     tell me any thing more about it—how it came so, eh? Have you any idea that Joel

                  <hi rend="i"/>April 8.—Miss Merrick is again at her post. Sturges suddenly
                  appeared to day, and things begin to brighten. 'Tis certain Clifford can not
                  return, and we must do without him, albeit the new teachers poorly supply his
                  place. No clew to the rogue who tied the bell-rope. Evidently it was Hayden. The
                  ball which was missing has been found in the rabbit burrow, under the straw.
                  Probably the rabbits took it there! The inkstand that was taken away and filled
                  with sand, has been restored with ink. I was under the painful necessity of
                  calling three of my lads into the recitation-room to-day, and severely
                  reprimanding them for their coarse, even profane<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000059"/> language. How it embitters my peace to have occur
                  these dark days in my life. How dreadful is it in the young to acquire this awful
                  habit of profanity! We have very little of it, I fancy; there should be none of
                  it. But it is possible more wicked, terrible words of sin are spoken than I ever
                  can know. Alas! the little boys, my own Johnnie and Hobbie, will not they hear
                  them, catch them, repeat them? Tremendous idea! It must be, it shall be rooted out
                  of the school. There are slang phrases I do not like, which some of the boys use
                  as commonly as they speak, such as "by George;" go it, boots;" "2: 40;" "you old
                  fool;" "you can't come it;" "you lie;" "go to grass;" "you <emph>did;</emph>" "I
                  didn't;" "<emph>thun</emph>deration;" "the fury;" "let her slide." All these
                  phrases and terms, I utterly repudiate, and check the offender whenever I hear
                  him, but alas! is not Satan, the great Deceiver and "Murderer from the beginning'
                  at work in their young hearts? They catch at these words almost by instinct, and
                  bristle up in little boyish wrath against each other, using them as men use even
                  heaviest curses and blasphemies. I can but think my rules respecting profanity,
                  and very oft-repeated exhortations to avoid it, are to a great extent observed by
                  the pupils, and that very few of them—indeed that none of my boarding pupils
                  accustom themselves to the dreadful habit. Yet I do not like these other
                  expressions. They are coarse. They are ungentlemanly. they are <emph>boys'</emph>
                  profanity; may I be able to do it all away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 20—Well. we breathe again. Let me be grateful that the
                  examination has passed so well. We are now rejoicing in our own little family
                  circle. Let's see. We are now but seven. Our large dining-tables are pushed back,
                  and we gather around a small square table and reach to every part of it for what
                  we want. Johnnie begs to be the papa, and serve the meat, Hobbie hopes he will
                  some time do the same, and even now, can help to potatoes and fill the glasses
                  with water. He not unfrequently dashed the water in too abundantly, and floods the
                  neighborhood; but that was an "ackident," and "hopes it will be better next time."
                  Gertrude yawns and says it is lonesome, and wishes Fitz Maurice had not also gone.
                  "If Fitz were here," says she, "we would climb Bluff rock. or walk to the
                  sea-shore." "We will go, Gertrude." say both the children. "I will go any where to
                  see the cars," says Hobbie. "Oh!" say I, "you are my little engineer, ha?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>sir;</emph> 2: 40." (Here it is in my own family! 2: 40!)</p>
               <p>"Oh! Hobbie, fie! fie!" says his mother.</p>
               <p>Mina and Ellen, the girls, are busy-fingered, brightening up the silver, and the
                  rooms. Fitz Maurice has gone for a short visit to a relative's in Harrodsburg.</p>
               <p>As for myself, I am free to confess that I am very dull, very languid, very
                  restless, very lazy. We have but two weeks vacation. Three or four days already
                  gone. I have simply "hung around" without accomplishing<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000060"/> plishing any sermonizing, any calls, any study. It
                  is dull, horrible to live so. Where is sister Blanche, the busy, light-hearted,
                  blues-dissolving Blanche? Oh, yes, she too has left us, and is, I doubt not,
                  threading Broadway, or catching the inspiration of song, as it is warbled forth
                  and poured out in the great goblets of music by Jenny Lind. I retire at eight, at
                  nine, at half past nine: rise at seven—half—eight—oh, awfulness! My neighbors rise
                  at four, five, and six. This is a queer way of life. this vacation-life. I must
                  turn over a new leaf in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April 22.—I have received twelve hundred and forty dollars for my
                  last term. Have paid Saccharine, the grocer, two hundred; Homer, the bookseller,
                  one hundred; Hyde, the hatter and shoemaker, thirty; Help in the house, fifty;
                  Cole, the anthracite, forty; Bones, the meat-man, seventy-five; <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Omnes, varietates, etc., etc.,</foreign> one hundred; Surety's
                  paper at the bank, one hundred and fifty; and <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Scholasticorum arum,</foreign> four hundred. Heigho! Let's see. Ah! I have it,
                  eleven hundred, forty-five dollars. Great speculation this, truly. What, only a
                  hundred dollars left! Scholastic drift! Why, this won't do. This don't pay. After
                  paying off all bills, notes, and expenses, left me but ninety-five dollars. I must
                  put up these tution bills. We can't possibly live so. There is a pleasant side, a
                  dark side, and, perhaps, a neuter side to teaching. Dark side is the running in
                  debt, bad scholars, slow progress, discipline, disappointments, and vexations.
                  Neuter side is the halfdreamy state that you are in when hoping against hope, in
                  the case of a dull grade of pupils, and when telling their parents that they are a
                  very fair set of scholars, promising to do something smart in the world. The
                  pleasant side is the indescribable surface of smoothness. Here every thing glides
                  on so devoid of friction, that you seem too happy ever to stop. You look on your
                  whole school with the administration of a millionaire on his ships and
                  marble-blocks—an accountant on his found, trial-balance—an editor on his favorite
                  dish. The pleasant side is also the after-thought. You look on what you have done.
                  Oh! blessed result. Oh! the reality. Behold the giant intellects you have trained.
                  There goes a genius. Yonder is a statesman. Here in his ermine is a chancellor.
                  And addressing a multitude on the brow of Bunker's Hill, near the granite obelisk,
                  is a WEBSTER, great American orator. "Young man," said Webster, to a student at
                  Yale, when he once visited the college, and was introduced to the students, "if I
                  could do as much for you, as your father, when my tutor at Dartmouth, did for me.
                  I should be inconceivably happy." Here in the solemn shades of the sanctuary is
                  the legate of the skies, proclaiming gracious words, and doing work for future
                  ages. Here are the happy, intelligent circles in the private walks and usual ways
                  of life. Blessed result—the pleasant—the <emph>good</emph> side this. And here it
                  is, that all vexations, and even poverty itself<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000061"/> self, are forgotten. We have done, and are doing
                     <emph>duties,</emph> great, important, responsible DUTIES. The memory of them
                  nerves us for greater things, and gives us a whole life's running stream of
                  after-thought. Grid us then anew for the strife, the neuter, the dark, the
                  pleasant side. In them are glorious reminiscences, scholastic under-drift, and
                  upward and onward, a mark upon the world, whole pages of names great and good,
                  wise and benevolent. Yes, we will see our pupils by and by, our little ragged and
                  wild boys—our blushing and pretty-eyed girls—our young mathematicians, linguists,
                  orators—our sweet musicians, writers, and poets, we shall yet see them among the
                  foremost ranks of great and good men and notable women, and so the name of HARRIET
                  BEECHER STOWE shall come up never more to die. When the Albany Convention was in
                  session and voted to raise a church erection fund of fifty thousand dollars, and a
                  BOWEN was named as a donor to it of ten thousand, it happened that a little
                  cluster of persons sat in the gallery of the church overlooking the platform, and
                  among them was a lady in black, rather passed the meridian of life. Mr. Bowen
                  addressed the convention a few words. Thirty years (more or less) had come over
                  him, but still the lady there knew him, she remembered him as the little boy of
                  her school, away in the eastern part of Connecticut, then but ten years of age.
                  She had been an instrument in the training of a heart that by and by should be
                  found to beat in kindly sympathy with religion and with the poor of Christ's
                  Church on earth. Blessed be the memory of J—,<ref rend="super" target="#note_009"

                  statesman, merchants, artists, yeomanry, "the solid men of Boston," New Yorkers,

                  get their respect. Train them up and on, on, on into those regions whence they

                  </opener>
                  <p>"I am sorry to hear of you such bad news. Why could you not stop the horse
                     before he became so furious? Why did you not rein him to the wall, and then
                     leap from the carriage? It seems to me that you were, though bold and firm, not
                     very wise in the course which you adopted. You say that, finding him very
                     restive, and hard on the bit, you struck him with the lash to subdue him; and
                     finding him more unmanageable, you held him in the middle of the road, with a
                     steady, firm rein, and let him go. In the first place, allow me to say, that
                     although the whip is sometimes useful in such cases, yet it requires a very
                     strong arm, and skill in the use of the rein, to manage an excited horse. I am
                     glad that you did not throw down the reins, scream, and then faint; but as you
                     were thrown out so violently and received such a sprain, I am sorry that you
                     did not, as the jockeys say, 'saw him up'—the best, and indeed the only method
                     I know, by which to bring up a hard and uneasy horse. Just hold him tight in
                     the rein, and violently jerk first one rein, and then the other, by which
                     maneuver the bits are pulled from his clenched teeth against his lips, and he
                     is rendered powerless by the pain. Pray you try it the next occasion that
                     offers. We are happy, after making all allowance for the high coloring you
                     bestow on your injury and convalescence, to conclude it highly probable you
                     might have been, and might now be worse. We shall see you in a day or two if
                     possible. Commend me to the children. I hope they are having a vacation of
                     overflowing happiness. As for ourselves, we begin to tire of it, especially as
                     a two days' rain has kept me a prisoner in my study. You shall see my sermon,
                     though written under these (call them if you please) favoring circumstances. I
                     think it can not fail to meet your approval. If so, I will trust it may do
                     good, yet alas! how many sermons have I preached with joy and hope, and
                     confidence, that have fallen on the barren soil of human depravity, and brought
                     forth no fruit to perfection. Wasted sermons these, in which I trusted there
                     was power sufficient to enkindle, by divine grace,<pb n="124"
                        xml:id="VAC6389-00000063"/> a holy love to God in the bosoms of multitudes.
                     So have I given to children; they have repeated them to me, and heard my
                     explanation, and then have gone out and forgotten them—apparently wasted
                     efforts, apparently stereotyped human dullness. And yet, that dear old
                     disciple, the simple-hearted, and meek, and godly uncle Eldad, living in the
                     red cottage by the road-side, a mile south of me, where two tall elms throw
                     their arms above the roof, and in summer, give a mellow shading to the
                     picture-life of love and quiet there enjoyed, has wept, and anon smiled over my
                     sermons, and gone the weary mile, oft in his lameness, by the help of a staff
                     and the love of Christ, to hear them and to worship. With Bible in his hand, he
                     has passed the whole morning of a day, at home in his cottage-hall, weeping
                     over its truth, and welcoming me with warmest Christian solicitation. Why
                     should I despair? Is it that so many hear and yet are not attentive—are not
                     saved? But in like manner treated they these sons of men, the Light that came
                     into the world. They knew Him not, they received Him not; and yet John's Gospel
                     was not in vain; and unto God are not they labor in love, a sweet savor of
                     Christ, in them not only that are saved, but also in them that perish? And
                     some, yea, many are saved, and they will sing the Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
                     Hallelujah! of the ransomed hosts on high. Uncle Eldad died in peace, full of
                     the faith he was a child of God. It is then sweet, and it is a rich
                     remuneration on earth, even, to<pb n="131" xml:id="VAC6389-00000064"/> write
                     and preach sermons, although by multitudes they are heard with listless ears
                     and unaffected hearts. Neither ought I to forget that precious work of Divine
                     grace in our school, the particulars of which are familiar to you; by which at
                     one time, as I judge, forty of the pupils were more or less affected, and a
                     goodly number were led to sit at the feet of the Saviour, and consecrate
                     themselves to His service. Those last days of the term, when teachers and
                     pupils were seen to weep and rejoice together, and prayer was heard, and praise
                     abounded, never should they be forgotten; they were surpassingly interesting;
                     and in them the grace of God was magnified. But, alas! spiritual apathy takes
                     now the place of life and joy in the Holy Ghost. So we drift. Now on the high
                     waves and tides of success, anon sinking into the undertow, and borne down and
                     afar off, helpless and despairing.</p>
                  <p>"Clifford judging it prudent to remain in New York for a time on account of his
                     health, I have had three different teachers following each other in his place;
                     one remained a week, another a few days longer, the third one helped us
                     through. Having written to Clifford, two days since, inquiring if he was
                     disposed to return and assist us next term, I have to-day received the
                     following, by telegraph: 'Dear sir—<hi rend="i"/>I am disposed to return, but
                     circumstances forbid it.' This is harassing. I must now give up the hope of his
                     services through the summer. Where I shall find a proper person to succeed him
                     I know not. But there is, I think, some prospect of my<pb n="126"
                        xml:id="VAC6389-00000065"/> being successful in applying to the Reverend
                     Gustavus Racey, a young, devoted, talented minister, at present less able to
                     preach than to engage in the business of teaching. I have applied to four or
                     five different persons, highly recommended to me (anticipating Cliffords
                     reply), but have not received a favorable answer, save from Gustavus Racey. It
                     is true, I received a note from a person residing at a distance, who, from the
                     fact of his belonging to the <hi rend="i"/>Scholasticus-a-um, I had reason to
                     think well qualified to be a teacher. But this letter to me was any thing but
                     recommendatory of his scholarship. The writing was bad, the spelling bad, the
                     ideas loosely joined together. My disappointment and mortification were
                     extreme; but I gave him up, and sought elsewhere. If Racey comes, all will be
                     well: if not, why—there it is—I must, though you and Sarah Matilda insist
                     against it, go into the works myself. And thus it is that we make the
                     scholastic drift. You will rejoice with me that the excellent, pious, and
                     beloved Miss Merrick, too good for earth, and not long for it, I sometimes
                     ruminate, will return to pass the summer with us, and again have the care of
                     your own sweet Stella. May she be able to infuse into her young and vivacious
                     heart much of that holy, blessed spirit of piety with which she seems to have
                     been furnished in an eminent degree. The younger sister, Rosetta, will be with
                     us also—a lovely and talented girl. We shall have with us again your own young
                     town-friend, the kind, studious, and exemplary Clarissa Rockwell,<pb n="125"
                        xml:id="VAC6389-00000066"/> and some others. But some anon. Tell Hayden that
                     I must have a set of his white Bantams, and will give him a pair of Johnnie's
                     white and black rabbits.</p>

                  <p>"'Home' were no word-charm but for thee; but wherever thou hast impressed
                     thyself, either on my heart or 'home,' there thou art, and there I can abide in
                     peace. I hope you received my letter by the last post (modern—mail). In the
                     postscript I mentioned a ramble that I took the day previous, which, by good
                     English measurement, was equal to ten miles. Fitz Maurice accompanied me. We
                     visited, in our excursion, the wild ravine in Richmond, where, as you will
                     remember, we once had a most happy pic-nic. I have almost forgotten who
                     accompanied us. Let me see if I can recall and name them:</p>
                  <p>"There was your father, the good and valiant Colonel Hayward, who would have
                     been a warrior, if, in his colonelship, the war had existed; your mother, as
                     gay as her daughters, and still in the prime of her life, careful of all; there
                     were the four sisters—Blanch, Agnes, Effie, and Louisa, who is now asleep in
                        Greenwood<pb n="128" xml:id="VAC6389-00000067"/> wood; your brothers,
                     Clifford and Montague, were present; Gertrude and Johnnie, also (Hobbs, the
                     baby, and Mina were left at home) Olivia—, and her friend, Miss Carter, and our
                     two young clericals, Reverend Tracy Sherwood, Pricipal of Richmond High School,
                     and Reverend Zelotes Mason, the elegant classical divine and sweet musician.
                     Besides these and ourselves, I do not recall any. What a load for pony Nelly,
                     of the feeble, the young, the jars and baskets! By what various paths, in
                     separate clusters, gayly chatting, we at last concentrated in the wild and
                     picturesque glen, and there, far up the creek among the rocks and wild shades,
                     pitches our rude tent, and spread our ample repast.</p>
                  <p>"Do you remember the danger Sherwood run of falling into a deep place in the
                     creek, in consequence of slipping on the smooth surface of a rock? Three times
                     he leaped desperately across the chasm, and each time struck a little below the
                     point where he could avail himself of the true 'line of direction,' and,
                     sliding backward, again sprung for the opposite side. The fourth time (and the
                     whole series transpired in a quarter of a minute), by great dexterity and
                     exertion, he touched a safe spot, and sank panting to the ground. Who of the
                     party was it that lost his porte-monnaie? Who dulled my best ax? Who wet his
                     feet at the crossing? Who lost a beautiful collar? Who was not excessively
                     weary on reaching home?</p>
                  <p>"There are yet some traces remaining of the bower<pb n="129"
                        xml:id="VAC6389-00000068"/> we hastily constructed, by the side of the creek
                     beneath the tall trees; but the rude tables have been long ago washed away by
                     the floods, and one can hardly visit the spot but with melancholy sensations.
                     Did I mention to you in my letter any thing about the gold mine once opened in
                     the immediate vicinity of our picnic encampment? Well, it is of little
                     consequence if I did not. But Fitz and I found it by dint of preservance and
                     hard climbing. It is on the hill side, rather to the east of the
                     pleasure-ground. A sharp ascent has to be made to it; and bushes and rubbish
                     put aside and surmounted; and a very sharp look-out kept up, or the 'mine' will
                     remain undiscovered. When you reach it, there is a large, rough formation of
                     earth, and well overgrown with trees and brush, that appears like one of
                     nature's formed hillocks, but it is, in reality, the earth thrown out in
                     sinking the shaft. The impression that gold could be found there led to the
                     excavation, soon after the Revolution; miners from Germany worked the shaft in
                     and downward, over eighty feet. They discovered galena and silver in
                     considerable quantities, and also copper; but, failing to strike a golden vein,
                     or to find a modern 'placer,' they abandoned the enterprise. Since then it has
                     been partially resumed, once or twice, but it is now, and has been for more
                     than thirty years, entirely abandoned; it is, in a great measure, filled up,
                     and with difficulty discovered. Notwithstanding the failure of the party who
                        sought<pb n="130" xml:id="VAC6389-00000069"/> for the precious metals there,
                     I am perfectly satisfied, from my examination of this whole region in company
                     with your uncle, General H—, that silver, lead, copper, sulphur, and even gold,
                     abound in considerable quantities all along the hills; the copper region
                     extending indefinitely far to the north. In our walk we likewise visited the
                     old parsonage and grounds where our first happy years of domestic life were
                     enjoyed, and drank from the old well, out of the old oaken bucket, the family
                     being absent from the house. Following the wild and meandering little brook,
                     through the woods, we came to the 'seven giants', those tall chestnuts all
                     growing together from one common parent root, and forming a hollow tube, by
                     their united growth, of sufficient diameter to contain a dozen persons. There
                     they remain, unmolested, and I fancied, seldom visited, for the old paths we
                     trod to them were almost obliterated.</p>
                  <p>"We also called on several of the families in the neighborhood, and were most
                     hospitably entertained. On our return we visited the old oak-tree, on the hill
                     top that overlooks the harbor, the city and Lindenvale. How often have we rode
                     beneath its far-spreading branches. It is truly a majestic tree. I once
                     measured it carefully, in company with Montague. At the surface of the ground
                     we found it over (I think) twenty-eight feet in circumference, and, six feet
                     from the ground, about nineteen feet. Some of the branches were six and seven
                     feet in circumference, and the<pb n="127" xml:id="VAC6389-00000070"/> diameter
                     of the shade they cast was over one hundred feet. It is an old land-mark to
                     pilots, as it is seen along the coast for many miles. The owner of it once
                     approached it, with his men, to cut it down for wood. But on learning that it
                     was a well-known land-mark to sailors, generously allowed it to stand.
                     Vigorous, hale, and hearty, there may it stand, 'the brave old oak,' a hundred
                     years to come.</p>
                  <p>"On the return home, we made our way down the rocks and through the wild grove
                     of trees to see the whole of the beautiful waterfall that, from the road-side,
                     dashed down into the valley, and waters 'THE FARM.' The recent rains had filled
                     the creek to its highest capacity, and down rushed the water in varied forms of
                     beauty, sublimity, and power. From the little lawn above, over which it fell in
                     an even, dark outline, it is, perhaps, two hundred feet to the level below. And
                     over rocks, in perfect foam, and in cascades of beauty, and through boiling
                     raceways and pits it comes sweeping down to you, and passes on, soon gliding,
                     meandering, silvering away into the broader stream that transports it to the
                     harbor.</p>
                  <p>"Weary, yet pleased with our ramble, we reached home, and found Gertrude
                     anxiously awaiting us, having prepared an early supper. The vases in the back
                     parlor are now filled with blue, pink and white anemones, running pine, and
                     trailing arbutos, which we brought with us as mementoes and trophies. We also
                     procured, in our excursion, some fine specimens of<pb n="132-133"
                        xml:id="VAC6389-00000071"/> iron pyrites, galena, lime, slate, mica,
                     feldspar, serpentine marble, asbestos and traprock. Fitz Maurice is
                     enthusiastic this evening in his description of the day's adventures; and
                     Gertrude seems to have many regrets that she did not accompany us. He assures
                     her that he remembers perfectly the direction to every place we visited, and
                     says he will drive her over the route whenever she wishes it. He is anxious to
                     enter college in the fall. I tell him to wait another year. It is astonishing
                     how the boy has made headway in his studies the past season.</p>
                  <p>"Alice is doing well. She sustained no fatal injury by her fall from the
                     carriage, and yet it is every body's wonder. She was thrown among large rocks,
                     and struck the only green and soft place that happened to be there, or she
                     would have been, I doubt not, killed instantly. I shall join you at your
                     father's in Twenty-fifth street, to-morrow evening. Love to the boys.</p>

               <p>THE Summer Term of the Institute commenced with Gustavus Racey as the first
                  teacher. Every body was pleased with Gustavus. His countenance expressed goodness,
                  his words were kind, his piety marked and exemplary. He was tall, gentlemanly,
                  easy, polite. A set of rich, sparkling black eyes illumined his face; and a
                  massive shock of well-toileted hair of the same color ornamented his caput. An
                  unbroken circle of pure white teeth smiled between his lips. His cheeks were
                  unadorned with bushy beard, not did his lip boast either mustache or
                  "imperial."</p>
               <p>No soiled collar or tattered cravat ever claimed any familiarity with his throat
                  and neck. His carriage was easy, his tread firm and dignified. In company, he was
                  rather retiring and modest, but perfectly self-possessed, it being seldom, if
                  ever, that he was caught "napping," either by pupils, or dashing belles and
                  blades.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere the school felt his presence; and although, at the first,
                  there was some murmuring because<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6389-00000072"/> cause
                  of Clifford's absence, eventually he secured the attachment of all.</p>

                           <p>"DEAR SIR: If it may be allowed me, who am to yourself a stranger, to
                              address you these few lines—and they contribute at all toward the
                              great desire of my heart to enter your Seminary as one of your
                              pupils—I shall deem myself one of the most fortunate of girls. My
                              parents are willing that I should leave home for a time in order to
                              attend to my studies still further; and I can leave a younger sister
                              with them in my place; but my father does not possess the means at
                              present to assist me, nor is he very hopeful for the future. I have
                              been teaching a school the past, winter, and have reserved a little
                              money, which I intend to appropriate toward the payment of the
                              school-bills, as far as it will go; but unless I can, through your
                              assistance, procure board in some private family at a reduced price, I
                              fear that I can not pay your tuition and the board-bills. I am
                              perfectly willing to do sewing, or other work, in part payment of my
                              board; and you may be able to offer me some position in your school
                              (after a time), by which my tuition will be reduced. If you can render
                              me any assistance, without too much trouble, I need scarcely assure
                              you, that I shall most kindly accept it, and cheerfully avail me of
                              the chance thus presented to enter your school. I am now seventeen
                              years of age, and desire to prepare myself to be a teacher. Please to
                              answer this, if it will not be too much trouble or inconvenience, that
                              I may hear from you on Saturday next.</p>

               <p>No sooner had Castlereagh read the letter than he put aside his sermon for the
                  next Sabbath, and, as he had often done before on similar applications, sallied
                  out to undertake the office requested of him so earnestly and appropriately. After
                  several applications, he succeeded in finding a most desirable situation and wrote
                  her to that effect, in the letter assuring her that the tuition should be reduced
                  one half.</p>
               <p>She entered the school at the commencement of the term, a tall, pale, interesting
                  girl, and by her consistent deportment, constant application, energy of character,
                  and goodness of heart, gained the regard if her teachers and schoolmates. She was
                  not long in revealing her merit as a fine writer. Miss Hillhouse having left the
                  school, we could not at first detect the anonymous writer of some beautiful poetry
                  in the "Classical Miscellany," written and published by the young ladies and
                  gentlemen of the school. By and by it was traced to Eleanor's pen, which was
                  afterward frequently employed<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6389-00000073"/> ployed
                  more publicly for the interests of the school, and usually with very great
                  satisfaction. Castlereagh was not alone in weeping over her touching verses
                  descriptive of the death of a young and beloved female friend. There was also much
                  humor and facetiousness often displayed in her writings, but she was on the whole
                  extremely sedate and serious. She entered the Institute on the following term, a
                  regular boarding pupil, and assistant in the school for one or two hours each
                  day.</p>

               <p>Among the bright and beautiful boys of the family, was Harry Otis Alexander—"Harry
                  Otis" we called him. His father resided in the city of New York—a gentleman of
                  education, business, wealth. He placed Harry Otis in the school to continue two or
                  three years, and attend to mathematics, French, painting, and music, as well as to
                  English branches generally. He was a lad twelve years of age, with an exceedingly
                  slender frame, but possessing an active, energetic character. His face was round
                  and delicate, with a decided feminine expression, in repose indicating a love of
                  fun, and character to originate it, although there was an inoffensive, frankness
                  of expression, and at times a softened shading of melancholy about his fine
                  features. He was a favorite, as well in the school as in the family. Not
                  unfrequently this circumstance came between him and some slight offense, and so
                  proved of great service. He was usually industrious, and very successful in his
                  studies. In music he had no formidable rival among the boys for the space of
                  nearly three years, Hayden not choosing to be first, the only one of all the
                  schoolboys who, perhaps, might in every branch have been his equal, and superior
                  to most others. In mathematics his standing was respectable. He was a fine penman,
                  a handsome reader, a very fine declaimer, and his progress in French was rapid and
                  easy. At football few surpassed him, in climbing the mountains he found great
                  pleasure, in skating and snow-plays he was ever a leader or joyous participator.
                  Ever prompt in his duties, and ready to do kindnesses, he was, <emph>of
                     course,</emph>
                  <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6389-00000074"/> a favorite, and popular. Yet he was
                  high-spirited. Pride often swelled his young heart. A high and rigid sense of
                  honor kept his from low associations, and yet made it appear possible to lead him
                  into danger under the appropriate temptations. Hayden and Harry Otis were unlike
                  each other in many respects—the former a great wit, and careless in his studies;
                  the latter a mimic to the perfect acting of any character, and a good student.
                  They each had their respective followers and admirers, and though seldom sworn
                  intimates, always more or less confederates. Both of them being of high families,
                  and destined to an influential position in society, they naturally and easily
                  treated one an other with considerable respect, even when they and their
                  respective clans were at variance.</p>
               <p>Harry Otis never seemed in a low, desponding vein; Hayden often retiring by
                  himself, and seated on the grass beneath the trees, or on the terraces in front of
                  the Institute, resting his elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, his
                  face, to the eyes, being concealed by them, and his cap drawn down over his
                  exceedingly fine forehead; and there, in half pouting, half meditating and easy
                  mood, chewing over some fancy, or grief, or thought, the world knowing not what.
                  Yet if in one of his brown studies, a fellow-student happening along, knocked off
                  his cap, a tiger could not sooner spring on his prey than did Hayden on the
                  unlucky offender, who generally paid the full cost of his temerity. In due time,
                  accordingly, his "moods" came to be respected, and they usually ended by his
                  stretching himself out at full length on the grass, rolling over two or three
                  times, kicking his heels into the air, and springing to his feet; after which he
                  seemed as merry as any body, and as eager for play, and as prompt at duty.
                  Descended, on his father's side, from one of the most wealthy and illustrious
                  families of one of the triad cities in the northerly part of the State of New
                  York, and from which the city derived its name, his father a highly-accomplished
                  clergyman of Albany, having died at the early age of twenty-seven, the boy had
                  many objects of thought to engross his mind at such seasons, and he evidently
                  sighed for the time to arrive when he could be his own man, untrammeled by the
                  rigid customs of the school. He was adored by his sister Stella, and most fondly
                  cherished by his mother, the widowed Alice. By her side he often sat up until
                  midnight, engaged in reading aloud some favorite author, prosaic or poetic; or
                  Stella, Hayden, and mother, played and sung alternately, the accompaniment being
                  the melodeon, piano, or guitar. All played, all sang, all chatted—the widow and
                  her two beautiful children; a widow at the early age of twenty-six; the children
                  fatherless—the one but two or three years old at his father's decease, the other
                  yet unborn! They all lived at the old maternal home of the mother, at Richmond,
                  cared for and cherished by her aged and respected parents.</p>
               <p>Harry Otis early lost his mother. Thus the boys<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000075"/> could in some measure sympathize; and as they were
                  both descended from families highly educated and respected, Castlereagh indulged
                  many a bright hope respecting them.</p>
               <p>Rosetta Merrick—sweet, gentle, even-minded, bright-eyed, black-eyed Rosetta! The
                  very memory of thee is precious to us. She came with her eldest sister, and
                  remained through the term, bearing away one of the highest prizes of the
                  Institute. To her all seemed instinctively to attach themselves, especially
                  Gertrude. How often they roved away, gathering the wild plants of the fields and
                  forests, or to build their airy castles on the brow of Bluff Rock. Clarissa
                  Rockwell was also one in the happy family, and her presence acted as a charm on
                  the whole circle of the more youthful, repressing too great humor and levity, and
                  awakening desires for improvement. With these was Miss Sophia Marmion, a
                  beautiful, happy spirit of eighteen. Then with Stella there were Isabel and
                  Roxenna, pretty girls and mischievous, who were not always agreeable to each
                  other, but sometimes little secrets were for one's ear and not another's, and the
                  injured party walked aside in no very pleasant mood. By and by it came her turn,
                  and the cold shoulder was tipped to another. Anon, they were all happy together,
                  and faithful. They all contrived many a pleasure-ramble with the lads, accompanied
                  by one or another of their teachers, and fine chats were had as they wandered here
                  and there, and many a throb of the young heart answered to deeds of special
                  kindness shown, or to glances that were meant to be as special, too.</p>
               <p>Fitz Maurice, Amos, Harry Otis, Hayden were pleasant companions for the girls and
                  young misses, and good for battle-door and shuttle-cock, races, hoops, or
                  "Hippodrome." And then, there was bright-eyed Stanton—who came into the family at
                  this time—a good scholar, and a clever, ingenious lad, with an open, brilliant
                  face, speaking the languages of all the kind emotions and good actions—a boy who
                  could apppreciate the society of intelligent boys and girls, and add another to
                  their happy circle. There was Holland, with his brawny shoulders, jet hair and
                  eyes, and dark flashing face—from the distant Islands. His hands were busy in his
                  pockets, and a neglected juvenility had made the kind bow awkward and dull. A
                  descendant of the gallant general who commanded at the great battle of Navarino,
                  Holland, though not long in the school, nor a ready scholar, made many a friend,
                  and, when he left, though hidden in the Far-off West, his big heart swelling will
                  make him, we trust, a noble man—it led him to send frequent letters to
                  Castlereagh, breathing the kindest remembrances, and expressing the strong desire
                  within him to return again to the shades of Lindenvale. Yet during his short
                  sojourn there, Castlereagh, more than once, rushed between him and an antagonist,
                  when their clinched fists and scowling features told him it was time to interrupt
                  the brawl and put the delinquents on their parole of honor, or under<pb
                     n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6389-00000076"/> the discipline of immediate law and
                  order. And there was waggish little Hyde Cornelius Warrens, who will never be
                  forgotten—who laughed out of love for it, and cried if his laugh was not
                  appreciated; who could play the piano as fast as he could run, and could run a
                  race with an English hare; who could sing like a young nightingale, and talk with
                  a water-wheel. How often did the little fellow cling to the hand of Castlereagh in
                  the dark, as they returned from the post office, from an evening lecture, or
                  prayer-meeting, and shrink from the barking dogs. There was in him every thing
                  affectionate and loving, but, alas! under temptation, he fell into a love of
                  tobacco. All the efforts of Castlereagh were powerless to repress that vicious
                  appetite in him, the boy, the little loving Hyde! But he loved him still; and
                  while he studied at the Institute, no one was oftener indulged in his innocent
                  wishes than he—no one oftener delivered out of the paw of larger lions in the
                  school.</p>
               <p>These were the boys and girls in the family and school of Castlereagh at this
                  time; many had left it, others were coming in or applying for admission; and there
                  were besides, the day-scholars, a large number. Often, almost daily, there would
                  arise some temporary embarrassment to the regular motion of all the wheels of the
                  instrument; but Castlereagh, by the exercise of decision, kindness, forbearance,
                  and due penetration, although many times severely tried, could again cause thing
                  to revolve and progress as usual. One day, observing that Harry Otis and Hyde
                  Cornelius were disposed to torment one another, or were indisposed to be
                  forbearing, he reproved them. By and by, as he happened to look from his
                  room-window, he saw the former in hot chase of the latter; and presently a
                  scuffle, a clinch, a roll over, blows; a boy's fight indeed! By this time he had
                  them both on their feet, held apart firmly at his arms' length; shame and rage in
                  their ruffled features, showing the badness of their deed, and proving how far
                  their unrenewed hearts could lead them astray in paths of sin,</p>

                  <speaker>Hyde.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, sir, I did n't him, but he did me yesterday in the same way.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Can this be true, Harry?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H. O.</speaker>
                  <p>He called my father names—"Old General<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6389-00000077"
                     /> Alexander's son." "Ain't your father a great man?" and so forth. I'll not be
                     insulted by Hyde Warrens any how.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Hyde had his ears pulled, and cried. Harry Otis was unsubdued. Castlereagh took
                  him to his room; there he was unhumbled; he even threatened to leave the school if
                  he was corrected. Castlereagh talked and reasoned with him; he remained the same.
                  He was left in his room alone for the afternoon. By and by the window was
                  elevated, and he sat down by it to hold conversation with the boys outside, and to
                  while away the time. Castlereagh, seeing this, sent the boys all away and directed
                  him to close his window, and also the blind; and to have no conversation with any
                  person excepting with himself, until tea. Three years Harry Otis resided with him,
                  and this was the only occasion Castlereagh had to use the rod in order to quell
                  his pride. Before dark, the heart of the lad broke into a thousand pieces, and
                  peace came again, though it was midnight are the excited nerves of Castlereagh
                  allowed him his usual rest. Two years afterward, when they parted they wept
                  together being locked in each others' arms, scarcely able, on account of great
                  emotions, to utter the sad farewell.</p>
               <p>Again, on the fourth of July, Hyde and another boy had wandered off so fat that
                  they did not reach home until after dark. No one knew where they were. But a
                  report circulated near nightfall that caused Castlereagh great excitement and
                  apprehension, to allay which he was about to ride off to make personal inquiries,
                  when the missing boys came in. The report was, that a lad had fallen that day, in
                  consequence of making a mis-step, from the brow of a steep and perpendicular
                  bluff, three miles off, a distance of one hundred and fifty feet, and been saved
                  from death only as by a miracle, being sadly bruised and broken. In this manner
                  was the mind of Castlereagh often disturbed; and his care and anxiety increased as
                  the number of his pupils continually augmented, each developing a different shade
                  of character, and each requiring his unceasing oversight.</p>
               <p>These were trying times for sermons, and parochial visits. Often the bright
                  Orient, sparkling and gorgeous with the uprising sun-beams met poor Castlereagh's
                  almost blood-shot eyes as he cast himself on his couch on the morning of the
                  blessed Holy Sabbath, appointed unto man for <emph>rest,</emph> to gain a brief
                  repose ere the joyous bells of the Sanctuary should summon their worshipers
                  together, and call the pastor to his public ministrations! Oh! heedless
                  Castlereagh, thus wickedly trifling with the boon of health. Thus recklessly
                  pursuing a way so eminently absurd! Who of all thy prominent, and pious, and
                  intelligent people, would have thanked thee to lay out thus for them a Sabbath's
                  intellectual feast? Who of them that would not have reproved thee for the
                  expensive condiments of the banquet if the cost thereof could by any means have
                  been known to them? And what cared they,<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6389-00000078"
                  /> the young and cheerful and giddy ones who on their heads and arms wore all the
                  religion they possessed, or seemed to want, for the long night-watching's over the
                  inspired page where prophet and holy man wrote of <foreign xml:lang="HEB">

                  these things—overdoing thyself, and faultily overdoing. But—ah! there is the "BUT"
                  of all our life's sad reprehensions, and it hath a recuperative energy in us, over
                  us; thou mayest have done good thus, beyond all ordinary, straightforward,
                  well-directed, long and easy-lived methods of thy ministry that were open before
                  thee. Sermons well-digested, well-conned, well and evenly penned, in fair round
                  hand, yea, well-studied, half-committed, all wrought and perfect, done, all
                     <emph>done</emph> and laid aside by Friday evening, might not have served thee
                  as well as they have, doubtless, served others. It <emph>may be,</emph> thou hast
                  saved a soul, by watchings of the long night, therefore, till the morning hour of

                  <p>Such exhibitions, Otis, are not very elevating, certainly, unless they are very
                     properly "got up;" and they are apt to dissipate your minds to the loss of

                  <p>True, sir, I—I stand corrected. I am as anxious as either of them. But candidly
                        <emph>we</emph> boys in the house want a little money for the fourth of

                     rendered of doubtful propriety unless there is a clergyman and his wife present
                     to give them a good type of character! You remember, Otis, the "Great Juggler,"
                     so called, who was in town last autumn?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>H. Otis.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, sir. Very well. Ha, ha!</p>

                  <p>He sent me a family ticket, with his card and best regards, and expressed the
                     hope that I would favor him with my presence. Oh! Harry, I could but say with
                     myself, here is this man, professedly a deceiver, proud of his public character
                     as a juggler, and as much in earnest to carry his point and obtain the
                     undivided attention of the community as he could be were he fired with pious
                     zeal for their salvation. He asks me, my wife, and children, he gives us
                     tickets, he urges us to attend, and all this for no possible good to me, or
                     them, or others. While I am endeavoring to lead men to church and religion, he
                     is urging us to forget and deny Christ. He is zealous in a work that is
                     directly the opposite of mine, and yet unblushingly sends me his card, and
                     urges me to patronize him. He even calculates on my being present to assure the
                     people that the exhibition is morally harmless, and even beneficial. These were
                     some of my thoughts then. But I do not, of course, by these words, intend a
                     rebuke to you, lads, because I suppose your play is really but an innocent
                     diversion.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>H. Otis.</speaker>
                  <p>Such is its only design, sir; and yet I fear that we may sometimes go too far
                     in our diversions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>It is quite supposable. May you be directed ever, my dear boy, in the true and
                     safe path to eternal life. I understand very well the object you have in view.
                     What evening do you desire?</p>

                  <speaker>H. Otis.</speaker>
                  <p>Thank you, sir. The boys will feel—that is, <emph>we,</emph> boys, will be
                     extremely obliged to you. <hi rend="i"/>(Exit.)</p>
               </sp>
               <p>These little exhibitions and while-aways were allowed the boys usually about twice
                  each term. They were intended for the amusement of the scholars and of the family.
                  Frequently they came off with bursts of happy feeling, though sometimes the actors
                  failed to satisfy themselves, if not their auditory. When Thursday evening
                  arrived, and the hour had been announced, there was an immediate rush for the
                  hall, tickets being loudly called for, and pennies fast accumulating. All the
                  lamps in the hall were lighted. A curtain stretched across it in front of the
                  platform, before which seats were advantageously arranged, sufficient to
                  accommodate all who might attend. With noiseless steps the actors behind the scene
                  prepared their exhibition; and<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6389-00000080"/> a young
                  page, in a white jacket, distributed through the audience the evening's programme.
                  The youthful assemblage of boys and girls, dressed in their neatest garments, all
                  rose and saluted Castlereagh as he, with the ladies and gentlemen of the house,
                  arrayed in rich, and some of them in fantastic, and others in Oriental robes,
                  entered the hall, and took their seats. All seemed delighted; expectation was
                  fairly on tip-toe; the feet of the younger boys, especially the heels of their
                  shoes, testified to their impatience, when, lo! the Seminary bell strikes one. A
                  lively, silvery tinkling bell behind the curtain answers it, and the curtain
                  slowly rises. Hardly a breathing disturbs the silence that now prevails. On an
                  elevated pedestal, leaning on an illuminated canvas, encircled with evergreens,
                  appears the form of Washington; a page, in white, with flowing locks, kneels
                  before the statue, with both hands extended toward it, and at the same instant, a
                  low and solemn dirge is heard from without, and chantings, sayings— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Great, great, great and immortal Washington,</l>
                        <l>Too soon hast thou ascended to glory."</l>
                        <l>O'er the story the gory nations joy;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And hope is strong,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Slowly, to the movement of the chant in the last line, a curtain dropped over the
                  tableau; and, as the audience recovered from its spell-bound state, a young orator
                  stepped forward near to the edge of the platform, and delivered a magniloquent
                  oration in praise of the arts and sciences, the progress of ideas, the
                  munificence, generosity, and discriminating patronage of the age by which the
                  superior talent of "the young and rising generation" was developed, which
                  conferred on it immortal honor, and especially adorned the brows of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">savans</foreign> of Lindenvale Institute, with garlands of
                  perpetual green. No sooner were these words pronounced than three or four young
                  lads rushed from behind a screen, each with wreaths on his arm, and, before their
                  object was well understood, they had crowned Castlereagh and all the teachers, and
                  as quickly vanished. At this pleasing and unexpected episode a general shout of
                  mirth broke forth from all present, and a great clapping of hands, amid which the
                  curtain fell. Miss Merrick and Racey, who sat near each other, seemed particularly
                  to enjoy this event; Castlereagh laughed outright, and Monsieur La Place called it
                  "le grand garland surpise des petits garcons."</p>
               <p>Sarah Matilda could hardly preserve her wreath from the enthusiastic grapplings of
                  both Johnnie and Hobbie. After a time, the little signal-bell again quieted the
                  disturbed state of the audience, and, the curtain rising, there appeared Harry
                  Otis sitting at the hall-piano, and the others of the actors all near by,
                  coversing earnestly together in a low tone of voice, or in whispers. They were
                  finding the puzzle for Magic-music<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6389-00000081"/>
                  music, one of their number, to whom it was unknown, being without. This was often
                  parlor play of the family at Castlereagh's, and always awakened considerable
                  interest. It consists in finding something for one of the number to do, who knows
                  nothing of it and is out of the room, but which is known to all the rest. When the
                  outsider is introduced, he is guided to it by the pianist, who plays low, lower,
                  lowest, or loud, louder, loudest, as the finder is near to, or distant from,
                  almost discovers it, or is very blind, quite makes out the mystery, or is in a
                  complete fog. Nothing is said by any one, but universal interest is depicted on
                  every face, and gentle clappings, and nods, and blinks, and "pshaws!" and
                  "indeeds!" and "oh, dears!" in supressed voices or whispers; shrugs and groans,
                  and "almosts" are seen and heard over the whole room, as the party watches the
                  progress of the game.</p>
               <p>Our young actors having agreed among themselves as to the puzzle, scattered
                  themselves about the stage, some of them sitting down and others standing. Hayden
                  was the finder. It was always difficult to puzzle him, and the audience, as much
                  in the dark as himself as to the object to be discovered, wondered what in the
                  world it could be. They closely followed his movements, here and there, noticed
                  every change in the music, were excited or depressed, encouraged and confident
                  now, anon baffled and hopeless. Harry Otis played it out very intelligibly and
                  encouragingly, but Hayden was a long time baffled, and every body began to give
                  him up.</p>
               <p>The young boys and girls "would give up any how." The older and more persevering
                  "hoped he would find it <emph>first.</emph>" At length Hayden seized a table and
                  carried it to the center of the stage. The piano grew loud, swift, loud, louder.
                  as he spread upon it a cloth. Hands began to clap all round, eyes to sparkle,
                  excitement to increase. "Dishes, plates for supper," cried Hayden, as if to his
                  servants. They were brought. Loud and swift went the music. "Bread!" (music
                  faint). "What, no bread?" murmured he. "Sweetmeats!" (music dull.) "Nor
                  sweetmeats?" "Oh! stewed oysters" (music almost unheard). "What neither bread,
                  butter, cakes, sweetmeats, oysters—fat poultry?" (music inaudible). "Nothing to
                     <emph>eat</emph> at this magnificent table?" mumbled he. The music seemed to
                  answer "even so," for it rolled away quite briskly. "A table, plates, no food,"
                  soliloquized Hayden. "The company will please follow my example, and sit down,"
                  said he. But the music faded. "No company, then!" And he was quite thrown off.
                  "Might as well have no light." At the word "light" the music rallied, "Ah! well, a
                     <emph>dark</emph> meal, here goes," and as he was about to extinguish a lamp,
                  the only one on the table, the music dropped away again. A sudden thought relieved
                  him. He sat down the light, the music rejoiced again. "Well," said he, "you shall
                  have light then." The music broke forth into a gay<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000082"/>
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">feu de joie.</foreign> Seizing all the lamps that were
                  burning near him, and placing them together on the table, as the music gave its
                  loud, louder, <emph>loudest</emph> tones of victory, and actors and spectators
                  rose, and cheered, and clapped, Hayden came forward, and exclaimed, "Ladies and
                  gentlemen, will you please to approach, and partake of a LIGHT supper!" And so the
                  curtain again was allowed to drop. Then followed the tableau of the Wounded
                  Hussar, sustained finely by Amos. To this succeeded the scene of the District
                  School. The Editor's Soliloquy followed, it ran thus: "I have composed a great
                  many articles and leaders," says the editor. "but none equal to this. How will it
                  read and look? Yet, it is true, when I wrote this article, I didn't believe it
                  true. I wrote it to fill up, and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">versus</foreign> Moggs of
                  the other paper. But the more I look at it, the more I read it, the more ground it
                  seems to cover—the more truth-like it appears—the better it reads and tells. Fact
                  is, Moggs can't answer it. The piece is altogether too smart for him, and more
                  truth in it than <emph>he</emph> usually dabbles in. I like the articles. People
                  will read <emph>that.</emph> There is sconce in it. It is theoretically true, and
                  practically unanswerable. I am about sorry that I did not put my name to it square
                  in and out. It can't alter the thing, though. There it is in black and white, and
                  true or false, it must add to our fame. False, did I say. It was only false in the
                  first idea, viz.: that we need <emph>no</emph> tariff. If I established that
                  point, then where was the original evil? It is nowhere where—it is
                  gone—annihilated. Have I <emph>not</emph> annihilated the argument in favor of
                  tariff? Do we need any taxation to make us happy or more contented? 'Yes,' says
                  Moggs, of the other paper, 'where is the revenue of the government coming from if
                  not from a tariff of duties? We may,' says he, 'tax ourselves on tea, silks,
                  coffee, and all imported articles a few cents a pound, or yard, or measure, and
                  shall not feel it.' But I have shown that direct taxation, when we want the money,
                  is the thing for us. Moggs, the Know Nothing, must now give in. True, my leader
                  was in original idea defective, but the conclusive reasoning settles the thing.
                  I'm satisfied Moggs is down, beaten, routed, driven off the field, completely put
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hors du combat,</foreign> a used-up man. The article is
                  compact, invulnerable, weighty, convincing—it has convinced myself. I'm a convert
                  to myself—a regular <emph>me in my.</emph> I have heard of a man who was opposed
                  to rail roads, but being appointed to write the article for discussion in favor of
                  them though sorely unwilling, he complied, and converted himself. I belong to his
                  school, and predict for myself hereafter a splendid career of popular favor.
                  Moggs, the Know Nothing, is a doomed man. Farewell to Moggs and all his
                  greatness."</p>
               <p>"A very good hit, sir," said Gustavus to Castlereagh, as the curtain fell.</p>
               <p>"Capital!" he replied; "shown up principle."</p>
               <p>"Petits garcons," said Monsieur La Place. "No fools—very."</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6389-00000083"/>
               <p>"Ha! ha! good, for Mr. La Place," said the ladies.</p>
               <p>The sound of martial music behind the curtain, and afar of, was now heard; the
                  signal bell rings once again; and, presently, as the music came nearer, lo! a
                  company of Continentals, marching, with shouldered muskets and knapsacks, to the
                  stirring sounds of fife and drum—Hyde the fifer, Stanton the drummer. The earnest,
                  solemn tread, the firm way they had, their marching and counter marching, in
                  platoons, in single file, in solid column, in echelon, by right wheeling into
                  line, by left backward wheel, forming hollow square, and breaking up into column,
                  dressing by companies, or battalions, shouldering arms, ordering arms, presenting
                  arms, carrying arms, sloping arms, trailing arms, resting arms, loading arms,
                  ramming down cartridge, priming, making ready to fire, aiming, firing,
                  recovering—all these were admirable performances. The old Continentals themselves
                  couldn't have done better; and to the ripe old music of Yankee Doodle, the curtain
                  fell, as the band, amid the cheers of the audience, marched to their barracks.</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentleman," said a young lieutenant of the army "we are greatly
                  sensible of the honor and pleasure given us by your presence this evening, and beg
                  leave to return you all our sincere regards. Ladies and gentlemen, the exercises
                  of the evening are closed."</p>

               <p>"Scholars are drift-wood."</p>

               <p>"Why, Peleg, where now did you get this curious notion, and where does it
                  apply?"</p>
               <p>"It applies, sir, to authors."</p>
               <p>"Ah! ha! <emph>They</emph> are drift-wood, our pupils, and students in academies
                  and colleges; our great and learned men in all professions, especially our fine
                  writers and authors, eh?—floating most numerously when the tides are high, but
                  left forlorn and desolate on the shores of life when the stream on which they
                  carelessly floated—the stream of public favor—subsides into its customary channel.
                  And 'snow' is what?"</p>
               <p>"Drift-snow' is that which forms into banks of snow where—"</p>

               <p>So young, hopeful Peleg, the wittiest wag of the school, and a fair scholar, went

               <head type="sub">MISS MERRICK—GUSTAVUS—THE NEXT TUTOR.</head>
               <p>THUS the summer term of 185—passed along. Many were the days when Miss Merrick
                  suffered from severe indisposition, and was scarcely able to perform her duties in
                  the school. Yet she was ever uncomplaining, sweet, affable, tender, affectionate.
                  Rosetta grew intensely anxious for her, and sought, by little attentions that lay
                  in her power, to relieve her labors. But these seasons of distress would again
                  wear away, and she would be found again attending to her duties. Gustavus begged
                  that she would give him the whole charge of her department for two weeks, while
                  she returned home to recruit. This she declined, and said, "I shall soon be
                  better."</p>
               <p>"Dear sir," said Gustavus to Castlereagh; "can there not be some thing done to
                  relieve Miss Merrick? she is very unwell."</p>
               <p>"I have urged her to take a vacation, and my wife has offered to do all her work
                  in her absence, but she thinks our fears are groundless;" he replied.</p>
               <p>"I hope they may prove so," said Gustavus; "but<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000085"/> I greatly fear that she is losing strength. Do you
                  observe that she moves often with pain, and that she is very pale?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have observed it all. Last evening, at the prayer meeting, she was faint.
                  But you know she will do all that lies in her power."</p>
               <p>"True, she is unsparing in her exertions, unselfish in her wishes, and lovely in
                  every thing. She has, beyond measure, the love and confidence of her pupils, and
                  it would be a great misfortune to lose her assistance."</p>
               <p>On that day Sarah Matilda had a long and interesting talk with her; but she
                  resolutely affirmed that she was not ill, her only difficulty being a slight
                  rheumatic spasm. She continued to attend to every duty whenever in her power.
                  There were days when she could not.</p>
               <p>"Never," said Castlereagh; "was there a more faithful, pious, and devoted young
                  lady. I have never seen one glaring nor hardly a discernible fault in her. How
                  sweetly and calmly she sits down in the slip at church, and attends to the worship
                  of God. How reverential of goodness; how confiding in the truth; how hopeful in
                  Christ, and yet how self-distrustful is she. And those young pupils that she has
                  the care of in the Sunday-school, they seem almost to worship her."</p>
               <p>With the college commencement, in July, came to a close the summer term of the
                  Institute. As usual, on Saturday previous to the examination, which began on
                  Monday and terminated Tuesday, the school-rooms of the seminary were hung with
                  evergreens and flowers. Oh! what a delightful picture does a happy roomful of
                  bright, intelligent lads and girls present on such an occasion. One wishes he were
                  young again—one of them—a happy pupil among these joyous faces. They come together
                  all dressed in their best robes, and wearing smiles on their checks. They show, in
                  their countenances, and in their manners and general deportment, their
                  improvement. Happy are their parents who see in them now the reward of their care
                  and expense. Happy are their teachers who can say of them "they have finished
                  their arithmetic, had done well in algebra and Euclid, in grammar, history, and
                  geography, etc., etc., and have merited our approbation for correct behavior."</p>
               <p>A large collection of persons assembled in the afternoon of Tuesday, to hear the
                  compositions and declamations, and, on leaving, expressed themselves most highly
                  gratified. Castlereagh was in a high state of excitement, and overjoyed that all
                  went off well; at the same time it was evident that he was himself in need of
                  relaxation. There was a nervousness about his actions, a paleness of the brow, and
                  a sinking of the cheek unnatural to him. He determined to take a journey to the
                  North, as soon as well released from the term.</p>

                  and then of making a pedestrian excursion to the romantic regions of Berkshire,

                  all in my power to my stock of ores and minerals generally."</p>

               <p>"Not over three weeks in all."</p>
               <p>"Very well; after that you will spend a little time here to brush up anew, and
                  render assistance to the family, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, to be sure, most gladly."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, then, as you are now bound for the city."</p>

               <p>Harry Otis was in the midst of a group of girls and boys belonging to the family,
                  all separating for a long vacation, and all bidding adieu with tears and
                  smiles.</p>
               <p>"Amos!"</p>
               <p>"Here, sir."</p>

               <p>"Thank you, sir."</p>
               <p>"Don't forget to give my letter to your father."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, sir."</p>
               <p>"Good-by, Moniseur La Place, and much joy and happiness to you."</p>
               <p>"Ah! mon cher Monsieur Castlereagh; tanks, tanks, a tousand times. Oui, oui, avez
                  soin de Vous. Adieu!"</p>
               <p>"Racey, my good sir; this is hard to part with you. I am sorry neither yourself
                  nor Miss Merrick will return. By the way, see her safely and carefully on the

               <p>"Oh, yes; to be sure, sir, I will see to all, and will write you by and by."</p>
               <p>"Here, my dear Rosette, have n't you spared one kiss for me? Thank you. Adieu,
                  Miss Merrick; heaven bless and preserve you."</p>
               <p>"We shall meet again, my dear sir."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, yes," he answered, with a faltering voice. "We shall meet where
                     <emph>all will know as they are known, and see as they are seen, and every
                     thing be made right forever.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Amen," said she; and leaning on the arm of Sarah Matilda, she walked to the
                  omnibus in waiting. Castlereagh never saw her again; but he often gazes, with
                  affectionate remembrances of her, upon the admirable daguerreotype that she left
                  with his wife. "Good-by, Hyde, Stratton, Isabel, Roxenna! good-by, farewell,
                  adieu, <emph>all;</emph>" and ALL reciprocate, "good-by, farewell, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">adieu.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Adieu, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au revoir!</foreign>" shouted monsieur, waving his
                  chapeau from the open coach.</p>

               <p>Baggage, passengers—all aboard; some on the outside, and some within—a huge load;
                  away they drive, and white handkerchiefs are long seen waving, and hats and caps,
                  also, by each party, till distance separates them. Hayden, Stella, Clarissa, and
                  others, are soon called for by friends in private vehicles, and reach their homes
                  by a drive over the hills.</p>
               <p>It was Friday morning, after the commencement, when Castlereagh called at the room
                  of a student in college, who, the day previous, had graduated with high honor in
                  his class, and was about to go forth into the world to seek its fortunes. He was
                  about the middling size, rather stoutly built, with sandy hair, large lips and
                  eyes, with heavy eyebrows and lashes; his countenance denoted decision and
                  kindness; he was without whiskers, without curls in his well-combed locks, without
                  fashion, and without impropriety in his fashion. He wore a clean dickey, which
                  always gives a neat expression to a gentleman, even if otherwise more or less
                  shabby—and a white cravat. His coat was a fine pea-green, and pants, London brown.
                  He sat on a box in which he had been packing his books and movables, and driven
                  the last nail.</p>
               <p>"I told you yesterday, Mr. Marshall," said Castlereagh, "that I should call to-day
                  to learn your decision."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. I have expected you."</p>
               <p>"Do you feel at liberty to accept of my proposals?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I have thought favorably of them, and have concluded to teach your school
                  for the next year."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you have? I am very happy, sir, to have met you. I trust we shall form an
                  interesting acquaintance in the course of the year."</p>
               <p>"I trust so myself, sir. I have now got through college; my education has cost me
                  time and money. I am disposed to take hold of your school for this, among other
                  reasons, viz., that I may see if my education is practically worth any thing to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"A very good ambition, it strikes me, although on the main question, I think there
                  can be but little doubt, even without the trial you propose."</p>
               <p>"Don't know about <emph>that,</emph>" said he, quickly, rising, blushing, shaking
                  his head and sides with an earnest, happy sort of laugh. (This was one of his
                  great expressions on occasions of disputes, arguments, jokes, etc., etc., as
                  Castlereagh afterward observed.)</p>
               <p>"Well, I am quite happy in your decision. As I told you yesterday, President W.
                  and Professor T. spoke to me of you in the kindest manner; and when your vacation
                  expires, I will hope to see you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"And do you journey this vacation?"</p>
               <p>"I am going immediately to my home from college, and in a few days to Niagara and
                  Canada. A man wants to see Niagara once. I have a love of great cascades and
                  whirlpools of water, of water itself, of the ocean. I am a strong swimmer, and
                  love to bathe,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6389-00000088"/> swim, dive, breast the
                  waves of the sea, as I have done on the beach of my native town, washed by the
                  waves of Long Island Sound. And I have even helped my brother erect strong
                  breakwaters against the encroachments of the Sound, under a contract with the
                  government. You shall hear me tell of it some day."</p>
               <p>"I shall listen to it with great interest, I presume, for I already a deeply
                  attentive hearer."</p>
               <p>"Pray, excuse me, sir," said he, blushing very deeply. "Consider that I am but
                  just graduated, perfectly green, and unacquainted with the world; a simple-minded
                  dem—de—"He would have said "<emph>democrat,</emph>" but noticing a slight shade on
                  the face of his listener, he hesitated, and gulping it down—for Castlereagh was a
                  whig, he saw—he happily waved off the word by saying, "A simple-minded son of
                     <emph>demonstrandi-do-dum.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And I," said Castlereagh, recovering himself, and smiling gayly; "I also go for
                  the '<emph>scholasticus-a-um.'</emph>"</p>
               <p>"We shall not disagree, sir, I see—<emph>saying nothing of politics.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, no—ha, ha, ha! I see the point—quite facetious you are. And so I may expect
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"I will be on the ground at the time."</p>
               <p>"Then, good-morning to you. I have business that will occupy me for an hour.
                  Good-morning."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE JOURNEY.</head>
               <p>IT was a great relief to the mind of Castlereagh to secure his principal teacher
                  for the ensuing year at so early a day, and now that he had the promise of a
                  well-qualified and pious young gentleman to succeed him, he could the more easily
                  reconcile himself to the withdrawal of Gustavus, who, burning with commendable
                  desire to enter the gospel ministry, could not be induced longer to delay his
                  professional studies. The parting with his two favorite teachers of the past year,
                  Miss Merrick and Mr. Racey, saddened him, especially as the suffering one often
                  seemed to flit before him, looking upward with a sweet and holy resignation, and
                  so confirming his apprehensions that the parting between them was forever. How to
                  fill her vacant position in the Institute, and reconcile to the change all parties
                  interested, gave him some concern. He determined, however, to give himself no
                  unnecessary anxiety on the subject, but to take it with him in his journey to the
                  north, as a matter to be settled on the first opportunity.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6389-00000089"/>
               <p>He would have taken Johnnie with him, but the lad had been quite unwell and was
                  feeble. Sarah Matilda on his account and Hobbie's, concluded to remain at home,
                  and more especially as the summer family avalanche from the great metropolis had
                  given out the customary tokens of its approach to fill the recently vacated
                  premises.</p>
               <p>"A good time may you have of it, Elbert," said his wife. "And may you come back
                  with a great deal of resolution, and good health to undertake the duties of the
                  fall."</p>
               <p>"Rather a lonesome journey, I fear," said he, in a desponding tone; "I feel as one
                  journeying to Paradise without Eve."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! nonsense, Castlereagh. Rather say you are journeying outside Paradise
                  and have left Eve at home to take good care of it for your return."</p>
               <p>"Capital, ha! ha!" cried little Johnnie from the lounge.</p>
               <p>"Not a bad idea," said Castlereagh "if it was only in Milton."</p>
               <p>"It is, every whit of it, as much as your journey in <emph>rail</emph> road cars
                  to Vermont is!"</p>
               <p>"And what's in Milton is n't all in the Bible," said Gertrude.</p>
               <p>"Ain't?" inquired Johnnie, with his eyes open very wide.</p>
               <p>"Why, no, Johnnie; not absolutely. Milton's poem is founded in Bible truth. But
                  the author's imagination tion has filled it up with what sister Gertrude says is
                  not all in the Bible."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. But it tells about Adam and Eve and Paradise?"</p>
               <p>"So far it is true, and much further. But never mind now, my lad. We will read it
                  again by and by, and point out what may be termed the more imaginative portions of
                  it. Johnnie?"</p>
               <p>"What, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Will you get over this sinking, feeble state, and so come up to Vermont with
                  sister Gertrude by and by to see me?"</p>
               <p>"I'll try to, father, I want to. The doctor says I may, for I am a good deal
                  better."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, you are, or I could not think of leaving you. Well, you shall go to see
                  your uncle and aunt and your cousins at the north just as soon as your mother and
                  the doctor deem it prudent."</p>
               <p>"Very good, father; I shall get better every day."</p>
               <p>On the following Monday, Castlereagh left home.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," said Mrs. Hayward, at home, in New York, "if Castlereagh has not
                  written again a long letter to the paper. A great amount of relaxation he is
                  taking, sure enough! I knew it would be so. I told Sarah Matilda to caution him
                  and forbid it, and here we see with what effect."</p>
               <p>"Still it is readable affair, mother," said her smiling daughter, Agnes, as she
                  threw the paper on the table.</p>
               <p>"I don't care a fig for the readableness of it. Every<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000090"/> body knows a man can write well enough if he is
                  disposed to, and is in the right circumstances—the question is, simply, whether
                  Castlereagh <emph>ought</emph> to write just at present."</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Blanche, "it isn't every one who could write out of such barren
                  materials a letter—"</p>
               <p>"So much the worse, Blanche; it is harder work for his mind, and that's what I am
                  complaining of. Let him rest—"</p>
               <p>"But he won't rest."</p>
               <p>"Let him" (she was about to say "<emph>die, then,</emph>" but checking herself,
                  she said) "move on then, but not stop a whole day, or sit up a whole night to
                  write letters. Here, Effie, take this paper to your father's office, and show what
                  Castlereagh is about. Next week there will be another, and then others still,
                  besides his regular communications to the monthly magazines, religious papers, and
                  I know not all what. Give me my pen, Agnes; I will write to him myself."</p>
               <p>So Mother Hayward scribbled. Ah! how extensive is the scholastic calamus. Men
                  write, women write, boys and girls write, teachers and scholars write, authors
                  write, traveler's write, editors write, printers write, print and sell, all men
                  buy, read, re-write, and all go drifting, drifting, drifting on the same great
                  tides of time. The world is full of books and writers.</p>
               <p>It the mean time, the letter-writing of our good mother went on. But it failed to
                  get off in season for the mail, and was put by for the next. In the evening paper
                  there appeared another letter. Fearing there would be a third and a fourth before
                  she could dispatch her rebuke, she sat up till midnight to add a long postscript,
                  and saw it the next morning put into the hands of the post agent on the cars in
                  the seven o'clock train.</p>
               <p>Sat up till midnight, did she?—Yes. For what? To chide Castlereagh for doing the
                  same thing. But Castlereagh was really enjoying a very fine interval of
                  recreation. There is a pleasant farming town to the north of Springfield, lying
                  south and east of the Holyoke ridge of hills, call it, for a name's sake,
                  Courtland, where, for one hundred, or, perhaps, two hundred years, the good people
                  have resided, cultivating their acres, and never quite "building a city."
                  Sometimes they have agreed together, and worshiped under one roof. At other times
                  they have quarreled, and held <emph>ceremonies</emph> under two roofs. They have
                  sometimes had a common center, with a well-regulated circumference, and at other
                  times an uncommon center, without any circumference, for when at peace and in
                  fellowship, all Courtland, from its further outline, worshiped and traded at the
                  center. At other times, all Courtland, from center to circumference, worshiped and
                  traded where they could or would.</p>
               <p>Here, also, Castlereagh had an uncle in time past, and although he was a farmer, a
                  manufacturer, a merchant and postmaster, he was, beside these, and all with them,
                  a good Christian man and a scholar! Venerated Dartmouth was his Alma Mater. He had
                     gone<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6389-00000091"/> now to his great home. No
                  peaches, in his riper years, had Castlereagh e'er seen and eaten, like for flavor,
                  size and excellence, to those that hung in such multitudinous forms of temptation
                  from the boughs of his trees, or lay dissolving in their own sweetness on the
                  green grass beneath them. Those days of boyhood and of peaches passed away, and
                  with them passed at length the beloved and venerated AZOR, the son of Azor—"Azor,"
                  the— <q>

               <p>It were a long tale to relate, how he wandered, how he suffered, how he overcame,
                  and, happily, in a distant place, sojourned; and how, in a sweet and
                  densely-shaded cottage, erected in the center of one of the finest farms washed by
                  the Susquehanna, at last he died. The boy-cousin, with whom Castlereagh in early
                  life ate peaches, gathered grapes, raked hay, and stoned the old red school-house,
                  was R. In his young manhood, blessed with affluence, he became the venerated
                  father's prop, and purchased for him and the kind mother who bore him, their
                  pleasant place, where it was sweet to live—a calm and beautiful spot, where one
                  may not, in his old age, refuse to die. "I have never seen the righteous
                  forsaken," cried out the Psalmist. Riches that a man hath gained, when thus
                  employed, are in themselves forgotten in the generous quality of the action done
                  by them. They redeem themselves from the evil natural to them, and incite in one a
                  wholesome appetite therefor. Employed aright, they confer great honor on him who
                  has them, and redeem his name from corrupting selfishness. Appleton! Williston!

               <p>Fifty years after he graduated, AZOR visited Dartmouth. It was but two or three
                  years ago—and now he sleeps. And there, too, sleeps the beautiful ELLEN! The
                  Susquehanna, flowing near their graves, gives to them an eternal green. Born in
                  this same old town of Courtland, little Ellen grew a bright-eyed, graceful, pretty
                  girl, near the waterfalls and vines, where in busy life her parents toiled, "she
                  dancing on the sunny side" of the hill-sheltered cottage; and then, when they
                  removed, she went with them to bloom around their new home, where, for a few
                  years, she would sing, and smile, and cheer them, and love, and learn. Bright mark
                  for death's own archery—"The idol first." She is wounded—dies! But her sweetest
                  song is the swan—song of her exit. Her spirit longs<pb n="174-175"

                  of the Susquehanna.</p>
               <p>Much time had passed away since, in boyhood's sports, Castlereagh had visited
                  Courtland. He now returns there to find that nearly all have fled whom he once
                  knew so intimately. Still there is one family well-remembered and beloved. Hardly
                  has he reached the gate of the large old mansion than he is met by a cheerful
                  group, with wide open-mouthed greetings of welcome, and the weary day is
                  forgotten.</p>
               <p>There is no blight where there are kind, lovely, and intelligent friends. Such
                  were the uncles and cousins Burkley, whom Castlereagh now visited. Henrietta the
                  elder, and Abbie the younger, were only daughters of idolizing parents, sisters of
                  brothers who would willingly die for them. Henrietta was tall, graceful,
                  brilliant; Abbie, delicate, retiring, winning. You knew not why, but they stole
                  into your heart. Bright, shining, kindly eyes, graceful in all their movements,
                  unreserved in their conversation, sensible, witty, unaffected, chatty, cousins
                  indeed; you admired them, and felt an acquaintance of years in a few brief
                  moments, and wondered where you and they had been all this long while of years.
                  And the sun went toward earth's horizon-lines as they all chatted together, the
                  mother and father, and brothers and sisters, and Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"And have you heard of my brother, in the Islands?" inquired the mother.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh sought to look, and to answer calmly; but the question came abruptly,
                  and his manner was constrained and embarrassed.</p>
               <p>"Why! what can be the matter?" quickly said the anxious inquirer, with a look that
                  drove forthwith all concealment from him, and left him at her mercy.</p>
               <p>"Is my brother sick?" inquired Mrs. Burkley, in a calmer tone.</p>
               <p>"Aunt Harriet," replied Castlereagh, "I must tell you, I see, all that I myself
                  know of him. Just before I left home news came to town that he had been very
                  sick—but that he was now no more sick, the Lord Jesus having removed him to where
                  there is neither sickness, sorrow, nor death."</p>
               <p>For a moment she moved not, she wept not, she spoke no word, but sat as though
                  transfixed with the fatal, cold dart herself. At length, while all were mourning
                  around her, she exclaimed, "Dead! Is he dead! William! My brother! my brother! oh,
                  my brother!"</p>
               <p>But he answered her not. The youngest of the father's house, and he afar off. The
                  talented <hi rend="i"/>Scholasticus, the pious, the tall, vigorous, and noble one,
                  was sleeping his last sleep.</p>
               <p>"I will read you these extracts from the West India papers that I have with me,"
                  said Castlereagh, "then you can peruse these letters brought in by the
                  vessel."</p>
               <p>[From the Barbadian Globe, July 14, 185—]</p>
               <p>"The grave has this day closed over the remains of<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000093"/> a man who has for many years exhibited to this
                  community an instructive example of a practical Christian, a sincere follower of
                  the Saviour.</p>
               <p>"The subject of this obituary, W. R. H——, Esq., expired yesterday morning at his
                  residence, 'Sea View,' Hastings, to the great and inexpressible affliction of his
                  beloved and affectionate wife, after a short illness.</p>
               <p>"Our lamented friend died, we are informed, as he had lived, in faith and hope, in
                  peace and charity. The blow has come upon his family and friends suddenly. In the
                  vigor of his age, and in the midst of his usefulness, he has been struck down. A
                  week ago, there was every prospect of a long and useful life; but the Almighty
                  fiat went out that he should 'prepare to meet his God,' and we humbly hope and
                  trust that this good Christian man <emph>was</emph> so prepared, and that he has
                  gone to that rest which the people of God pant after, and are encouraged to expect
                  when their painful mortal race shall be over.</p>
               <p>"Mr. H——, a native of Vermont, U. S., has been many years carrying on a
                  respectable mercantile concern in this city, under the firm of H—— and T——; and
                  during his long residence in this his adopted country, he has gained universal
                  esteem. He was a highly intellectual man, and eminently fitted to adorn society.
                  Few strangers who have settled among us, have been so generally respected. His
                  integrity as a merchant, his exemplary discharge of his domestic and social
                  duties, his piety, his charity, all combined to raise him in public esteem, and
                  will cause his death to be deeply regretted.</p>
               <p>"By the death of Mr. H——, the situation of Consul for the United States becomes
                  vacant.</p>
               <p>"A striking proof of the estimation in which the deceased was held, has been
                  evinced this morning, in the marked attention paid at the celebration of the
                  funeral solemnities at St. Matthias's chapel.</p>
               <p>"As soon as the intelligence reached Government House, the flag there was
                  exhibited half-mast high; the example was immediately followed at Queen's House,
                  the Commercial Hall, and other flag-staffs in the Island. His Excellency Governor
                  Hamilton, accompanied by his Private Secretary; his Excellency the Lieutenant
                  General, his personal staff; the Adjutant General and the staff; the Hon. Mr.
                  Taylor, the Hon. and Reverend Mr. Gittens; the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney
                  and Solicitor-General, and almost every other public functionary, and one of the
                  largest and most respectable bodies of persons of all classes, were in attendance.
                  A guard of honor, under the command of Colonel Brown of the 34th, and two
                  regiments of the garrison were turned out, and lined the road through which the
                  procession passed. The number of guns to which the deceased would, while living,
                  have been entitled on any special occasion, were fired; and nothing, in fact, was
                  wanting to demonstrate the deep feeling of sorrow which pervaded all classes, and
                  the respect<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6389-00000094"/> which was due to the
                  country of which he was the worthy representative.</p>
               <p>"The Lord Bishop received the procession at the door of the chapel, and read in
                  the corpse; the Revs. C. C. Gill, A. Reece, and W. W. Jackson performed the other
                  parts of the solemn service."</p>
               <p>These were rites paid to a good man—a man who had gained for himself a CHRISTIAN
                  character and its respect among a community of strangers. He was a man who,
                  despite the hurry and care of business, rented a small room not far from his
                  store, retired and appropriate, for the sole purpose of meditation and prayer.
                  "Help, Lord! for the goodly man ceaseth from among men." Sincere mourners! weep
                  on, speak on; recall the last fall's visit that he made you; remember well his
                  love, his kind and cheerful words, and his last parting salutations. His tall and
                  manly frame has been cast down, and ye see him no more.</p>
               <p>A temporary gloom followed from the communication of the intelligence of which
                  Castlereagh was made the unwilling bearer. By and by, the spirits of all revived
                  again, and they spoke calmly and even cheerfully of the departed. Thy viewed him
                  now as one gathered into the great Fold of the Redeemer, and resting forever from
                  all his toils, and fears, and conflicts.</p>
               <p>"Henrietta," said Castlereagh, on the following day, as they were walking together
                  along the wayside, "we once, in a careless way, spoke to one another about your
                  coming to live with us, and taking care of the young ladies' department in our
                  school."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes, I remember it, and have often thought the situation would be profitable
                  to me and pleasant."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to urge it against your mother's and sister's wishes, or your own
                  plans, but really, as the place is now vacant, it would give me great pleasure
                  indeed, and so it would Sarah Matilda, if you would come and fill it."</p>
               <p>"Your teacher has then left you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, greatly to our regret. Her health seems to be too delicate for the
                  work."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I am sorry to hear that of her—a very estimable young lady."</p>
               <p>"Truly so—one of the most exemplary young persons I have ever known. But, she will
                  not, I fear, tarry with us on earth long."</p>
               <p>"Oh! how sad is the end of human life, when we see one who is so worthy, cut off
                  in her usefulness and promise. How can we become reconciled to it?"</p>
               <p>"Only, Henrietta, as we look trustfully upon the great map of providence, and see
                  how one event combines with another to complete the wonderful designs of the
                  Creator."</p>
               <p>"True; 'it is not all of life to live, nor all of death to die.' We are here for
                  the commencement of an immortal existence, preparing for our future state. If we
                     <emph>are</emph> prepared, it can not be that we shall die too early.<pb
                     n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6389-00000095"/> Still, we shall, I think, always mourn
                  over the early dead, whom we loved, and who were useful and upright."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but not mourn as they who are without hope."</p>
               <p>"Very true; we shall not. Our sorrow will be a true, subjective one, a mourning of
                  the spirit unseen by the stranger, by him unfelt."</p>
               <p>"Such mourning leads one into the paths of godly sorrow, and into the obedience of
                  Christ."</p>
               <p>"Yes, these are His corrections felt in us that quicken our obedience and subdue
                  our souls; so they seem to lead us where the will of God would have us walk."</p>
               <p>"And if they have this effect, we can never be far from happiness—never in a state
                  of suffering which shall preclude our hope of final salvation—never wholly useless
                  on earth. The true Christian is sometimes off his guard, and affliction is sent on
                  him as a kindly warning of his danger. It is also one of the great results of the
                  first transgression of the race."</p>
               <p>"It is remarkable that the same circumstance which convicts of sin, and proves us
                  guilty, should also be the kindly voice of warning and a needful help of escape.
                  So has the Creator filled the great chasms of nature with help, and admonition,
                  and mercy. Woe be to him accordingly who striveth against his Maker."</p>
               <p>"I admire your views on this subject. Let us study the Word of God for
                  instruction, and how rich, and full, and permanent are the lessons which are
                  conveyed to us. What truth there is in God, in nature, in Providence! There is no
                  error—no falsehood. If we were to study the character of God, examining all His
                  ways and acts, and His words spoken by <emph>Him</emph> for a thousand years, and
                  then were to review what we had done, with all the light acquired by this
                  investigation for another thousand years, and so on for millions of ages, we
                  should never be able to detect one shade of error in Him, the least sin, or
                  imperfection. Is not this a glorious conception of His being?"</p>
               <p>"Truly magnificent; and as real as it is sublime."</p>
               <p>"We can not exhaust His goodness, nor increase it. God is full, perfect, glorious
                  in Himself."</p>
               <p>"Yes, He is so; and I love to think that all our sorrows here are as the infinite
                  goodness of God would have them."</p>
               <p>So they pursued and finished their walk, and were met at the door of the family
                  mansion by Abbie with a sweet smile and a pale brow. Castlereagh observed, he
                  thought, <emph>that she was lame.</emph> Poor girl, art thou lame and afflicted!
                  It were young for thee, so beautiful and lovely to be a sufferer. Perhaps it is
                  not so to be.</p>

               <p>WANDERING from place to place, Castlereagh, on the Highlands of C——, found, at the
                  going down of the the sun, one day, the grave of little JOSEPHINE. It was beneath
                  the spreading branches of a tree in the public cemetery. One of the sweetest young
                  hearts of New York city there reposed, having died in her grandmother's arms, and,
                  ere she breathed her last, chosen her resting-place. "Let it be beneath the tree
                  where <emph>the sweet little birds</emph> will come every day, and fold their
                  wings, and sing to me as I sleep." And so they buried her there, and there the
                  little birds sing above her as she sleeps.</p>
               <p>After a few days, we find him far away among the Northern Highlands.</p>

                           <p>"Your kind notes come daily to hand, and I perceive that as distant
                              from us as you may be, we shall yet seem to be along with you. I did
                              say, indeed, when you left, that you must leave us and your cares at
                              home, but not in the sense of being forgotten, as I see there is no
                              danger that we shall be. The children are daily readers of your
                              epistles; and Johnnie, though too ill and feeble yet to run about, can
                              walk the room, and take them from the desk. I am sorry to say that he
                              does not seem to recover strength. Good Doctor ——, who has been so
                              attentive to him, advises me to send him to you, with sister Gertrude,
                              and I shall do so, if he is thought strong enough for the journey.</p>
                           <p>"You will receive a summons that will perhaps surprise you, and cause
                              a temporary inconvenience in your plan of the journey. I refer to the
                              approaching nuptials. Who should drive to our door the other evening,
                              but Clifford and Olivia, in dashing style—the horse being the wildest,
                              craziest thing that was ever fastened to a gig. They were <foreign
                                 xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> to Boston, and stopped here over
                              one train. They were in high spirits. Clifford sitting down at the
                              piano, played and sung only one piece—the good old song by Russell— <q>

                              him crazy, and Olivia closing her ears, entreated him to stop. They
                              praised up the children, pulled their ears, praised up the supper, but
                              ate little, and drove off. I shall hope for a line to-morrow.</p>
                           <p>"P. S.—I am much pleased with your last plan for that grand house with

               <p>Castlereagh read his letters over twice, said his mother was angry at him for

               <p>The next day he packed up all his effects, and returned homeward. He arrived in

               <head type="sub">MARSHALL—THE SEMINARY PATH.</head>
               <p>A LONG summer vacation, and an agreeable ramble in the country had their
                  perceptible influence on Castlereagh, who, returning a few days before the new
                  term commenced, made every preparation in his power to begin it with <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">éclât.</foreign> Fitz Maurice, though much disappointed at the
                  advice of Castlereagh who proposed such a plan, concluded to study another year
                  before entering college. He wandered around the premises a few days with a pale,
                  discouraged look and an absent air, saying but little, and that generally in a
                  discontented tone of voice. Castlereagh commiserated him, but had thought it best,
                  on the whole, that he should go to college thoroughly prepared to enter on his
                  studies. He knew that his course in college would be a successful one if well
                  prepared to commence it, and to compete with his class-mates. Accordingly he
                  allowed him time to think over his advice, and took but little apparent notice of
                  his chagrin. It wore off by degrees, but he was not fully satisfied till deeply
                  engaged in the studies of the term.</p>
               <p>It was necessary that Castlereagh should spend time, exertion, and money over his
                  school, in order to keep pace with the increasing luxuriousness and demands of the
                  age. There were many other rival institutions about, and it would seem from the
                  advertisements and editorial notices of schools, high schools, select schools,
                  classical institutes, seminaries for boys, seminaries for girls, grammar schools,
                  collegiate institutes, private family boarding-schools, self-supporting academies;
                  the Barrytown, Hightown, Lowtown, Hulltown, Smalltown, Alltown, Scaretown,
                  Dulltown high schools and graded seminaries; the Lombard school, Rev. Mr. Crane's
                  school, Esquire Rush's private grammar school, the Messrs. Charles and Peter
                  Grammerey's school, the Brothers Dawson school, Rev. H. Longacre's, D. D., school,
                  the Misses Optimus's seminary, and Mrs. Smart's institute for old and young boys
                  and girls—that all the world was schooling itself; a part, the great part, getting
                  rich; a part, not a small part either, undertaking to learn.</p>
               <p>It was necessary to procure new things every year. There must be the same
                  attention to the old-fashioned studies of arithmetic, geography, grammar, spelling
                  and writing; but these were only a part; in fact, they were not to be spoken about
                  in company. If any body inquired "what branches are pursued at your seminary,
                  sir?" the answer must be, "Geometry, conic sections, meteorology, esthetics,
                  painting, music, German, Italian, Spanish, and modern history, communicated<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6389-00000099"/> municated in twelve learned lectures,
                  by Rev. Theophilus Melanethon, D. D., LL. D." An institution, numbering one
                  hundred pupils, could not move without ten or fifteen highly accomplished
                  graduates of college as teachers; and the school must be furnished with costly
                  philosophical apparatus (seldom taken out of the cases!), extensive astronomical
                  apparatus (often little understood, but making a fine glitter in the glass
                  alcoves!), globes, maps, charts, cabinets zoological, mineralogical, geological
                  chonchological (not frequently exhibited, studied, explained, comprehended, but
                  highly useful to talk about in the newspapers, and to point at to parents and
                  guardians' visitors). An extensive gymnasia also belongs to a modern school, large
                  play-grounds, horses, carriages, servants, boats, guns, flags, drums, swords,
                  tents, dancing-masters, and so forth and so on—price per annum, from three hundred
                  to a thousand dollars per pupil. Somebody gets rich, somebody gets poor, somebody
                  ought to know a good deal—Know-Nothings should be very scarce!</p>
               <p>At Lindenvale, it was impossible, with Castlereagh's means, to do every thing on a
                  scale so extensive and magnificent as this, and he was, of course, often obliged
                  to part with some of his pupils who desired to keep up with the times. But he
                  spent the whole of the income of the school, for the first two years, in adding to
                  his apparatus and means of instruction, and the comfort of the pupils. And besides
                  this, he found, at the commencement of the present term, that he was just one
                  thousand dollars in arrears for these things and for family expenses. But no one,
                  not even Sarah Matilda, observed that any serious weight was resting on his mind,
                  as his spirit was sanguine and buoyant to a remarkable degree, and he was
                  confident that the winter's terms would relieve him—so they did.</p>
               <p>Every thing was pleasant, inviting, familiar—the sports healthful, the walks
                  invigorating, the scenery attractive, connected with and around Lindenvale
                  Institute. Castlereagh intended from the first, to make the school subserve the
                  interests of sound learning and morals. So much hard study, so much order, so much
                  amusement; and he sought to acquire the ascendant in the minds of his pupils by
                  kindness, attention, and the reward of his confidence for correct deportment. A
                  cheerful familiarity, never allowed to degenerate into rudeness, was always
                  allowed in the family circle. He watched over his pupils with deep and constant
                  solicitude, and rejoiced to see that, for the most part, their progress in
                  education and in true politeness of manners, corresponded with his wishes. Still
                  Castlereagh often sighed for means to enlarge his seminary more in accordance with
                  many institutions, competitors with him for the public favor! <emph>So prone is
                     man to feel the power of example.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The time at length arrived for the return of the pupils and the commencement of
                  the fall term. The morning bell of the seminary poured forth its loud and<pb
                     n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6389-00000100"/> merry notes, and ere nine o'clock, the
                  grounds were full of the boys and girls who came together here from various
                  places, some, strangers entirely, others, old and very familiar faces. The boys
                  who were acquainted ran and shook each other by the hand, and inquired how they
                  had passed the vacation; the girls embraced and kissed each other, and exclaimed,
                  "Oh! how glad I am that <emph>you</emph> have returned!"</p>
               <p>All the morning Castlereagh was busy receiving calls from new scholars and their
                  parents. His parlor was thronged with them. Introduction followed introduction,
                  for besides himself, there was Sarah Matilda, Miss Henrietta Burkley, Mr.
                  Worthington, Ide Marshall, and some others, teachers or assistants, all met to
                  converse together for the first time, and to form some common plan of proceedings.
                  As to the new pupils who called, as fast as possible every case was heard, and
                  discussed, and decided. Then the party so relieved, gave way, and another came. On
                  these occasions it was customary for every pupil to bring his books with
                  him—consisting of seven or eight old volumes, already hard studied and still
                  harder used, and most of them of a somewhat antiquated edition. These were hastily
                  looked over and often rejected—"New books for new schools;" so others were
                  recommended or enforced. By parents, generally, the pupil was said to be "very
                  backward," and, "at first, would not do very well." Occasionally, one was said to
                  be "wild," and would require "watching." (<hi rend="i"/>Smiles, "oh! dear's,"
                  nods, "not<hi rend="i"/>very's," "not much's," round the room.) Now and then one
                  had finished all the chemistry branches, and would confine himself to languages;
                  others to music and drawing. Inquiries from many common people, were about the
                  price of tuition, and a little reduction was never mentioned to such but with
                  evident satisfaction. Once in a while a boy came to the school with instructions
                  from his father to study nothing but arithmetic, as the father never studied any
                  thing else, and has got along well in life. These were among the annoying and
                  whimsical things of the life that Castlereagh was pursuing. Yet he drew comfort
                  from the thought, that in the end positive good would be made to appear. "What am
                  I that I should be unwilling to meet trials of this nature, when I fully believe
                  that one, only one of these children, who may be really benefited by my exertions,
                  will, on earth and in eternity, be to me a measureless ocean of joy?" Thus
                  Castlereagh philosophized and nerved himself to the work of doing good in his
                  particular calling. He had made the discovery that it was indeed a vocation of
                  earnest life.</p>
               <p>After two days the Institute was arranged—a large school was classified as far as
                  possible, and the lessons and regularities of the Seminary began to be enforced.
                  Marshall displayed much coolness and judgment in his position as the principal
                  teacher, although this was his first attempt at instructing a school. And no one
                  ever took charge of the young ladies' department to whom the pupils became more
                  fondly attached than to Miss<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6389-00000101"/> Burkley.
                  Eleanor. N—became an assistant in the school from the commencement of this term,
                  and a boarder in the family. Clarissa did not return. Hyde and Stanton were away,
                  also. But there were others in their places. About twelve boys and young misses
                  were now received into the family, and Castlereagh found himself obliged to look
                  daily after the comfort of a large household, and responsible for the instruction
                  of about seventy-five pupils. There were incessant calls on him for family
                  supplies, for books and stationery. An increase of pupils, attending to music,
                  frequently made it necessary to purchase or rent another piano. New pupils, beyond
                  a certain number, called for more furniture for their rooms, and new study-chairs
                  and desks. New minds, with their own dispositions, tempers, wills, came to be
                  developed, instructed, and governed aright.</p>
               <p>Among a large number of pupils in such circumstances of daily association, there
                  will often arise more or less ill-temper, and party lines will be formed, and
                  clans modeled, and friendships and enmities run high. Castlereagh not unfrequently
                  threw himself between his boy-combatants and sent one to his own room, another to
                  his study, for disorderly behavior, and as frequently advised those who were too
                  confiding and ardent in friendship to choose "the happy mean." But the feuds thus
                  interrupted were not always quelled entirely by one interposition, nor were ardent
                  friendships much less frequently contracted. Troubles would in a day or two break
                  out afresh, and the heart of the Principal was often much grieved on account of
                  these great sins. He prayed and labored to root out of the hearts of his pupils
                  the pride which reigned in them, productive of these sinful ways, and although
                  often generally successful in his government, he found occasionally one possessed
                  of a willfulness and pride that cost him great troubles and sorrow. As pacificator
                  of troubles, and umpire in cases where government was concerned, Castlereagh found
                  something to do notwithstanding the customary freedom of his school from
                  rebellious runaways and fractious ones. And this duty was the source of unfailing
                  humiliation and tears. Nothing that ever came before his mind so thoroughly
                  aroused in him feelings of anguish as that of juvenile impiety. When he witnessed
                  the workings of pride, ambition, envy, jealousy, anger, malice, hypocrisy, revenge
                  in the youthful heart, it smote him as with a rod of iron, and wounded him as an
                  arrow sent to quiver in his life-blood. He could uniformly trace it to parental
                  oversight, neglect, or indulgence. He could see that the child had not been taken
                  in his early boyhood or very infancy, and faithfully, lovingly, and firmly
                  educated and influenced. Nor had he been conversed with perhaps even once, as an
                  accountable being! No! for he was deemed too young. Is the child too young at six
                  years of age to know the difference between right and wrong, and to see himself as
                  guilty in the sight of God? Is he also too young at the going down<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000102"/> of the last sun of his eighth year, and he now
                  standing near the circle of a new period of time, his ninth year? Too young when
                  eight years old to be addressed earnestly on the subject of his sins, and his duty
                  to God? Too young when ten years old! when eleven! twelve!! Alas! when then is he
                  old enough; for long before they are even eight years of age do many children
                  strive in their own little souls to resist temptation and find peace with God. So
                  Johnnie told his mother one Sunday evening when she held with him a long, close,
                  faithful, serious talk, and tried to teach him his great sinfulness, and positive
                  need of God's help in order to a saving repentance of sin and a good hope of
                  salvation. Castlereagh had not been six months at the head of this seminary before
                  the perceived that the common sin of the parents of his pupils was the neglect of
                  personal faithfulness in respect to their spiritual instruction. The children had
                  not been, as a general thing, talked with and prayed with as if they were old
                  enough to appreciate any such matter—when alas! they were already in the toils of
                  Satan. Fellow-teacher of the young, knowest THOU not that these things are so?
                  Verily I am persuaded already of thy answer—"YEA, YEA."</p>
               <p>In the course of the first week, Marshall discovered clearly who were his good and
                  trusty pupils, and who were bad or uncertain. He acccordingly went to Castlereagh
                  with the names all drawn off in two lines, and proposed to re-seat the school on
                  this basis. Castlereagh reagh sat down with him to read the paper, and was
                  surprised at the conformity of their views respecting the character of the
                  pupils.</p>
               <p>"I agree with you for the most part," said he; "but I am amazed at your
                  penetration in discovering so accurately the different habits and characteristics
                  of the lads."</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is simple," he replied. "Give a good, stringent lesson to a class, and you
                  will soon see who know the whole of it, who know a part of it, and have a general
                  idea of the whole, and who know little or nothing of it. Take all this latter
                  class, and put them into work of another sort. Give them little to do, and watch
                  them. By and by you will detect one asleep, another snapping his knife, a third
                  pulling hair, a few making a little study. At the proper time call up the class
                  for a recitation. The poorest ones know no more of this than they did of the
                  previous lesson. A few show some mind and application. Put these into as high a
                  class as you can consistently, and try them. The loafers begin with <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">de novo,</foreign> and keep them pretty near you. I knew in
                  three days where they all stood; perhaps they will eventually some of them change
                  places, but there they now are."</p>
               <p>"It is true," replied Castlereagh. "We will make the arrangements you have
                  proposed. If you have any trouble, speak to me."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir. I think not of meeting with any opposition, and the movement will
                  arrest some of their minds to reflection."</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6389-00000103"/>
               <p>"It may. Please to see that Hogarth and Underhill, those two new boys who came
                  yesterday into the family, are furnished with arithmetics and reading books; and
                  be sure to have them attend faithfully to the seven o'clock study hour this
                  evening."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I will not overlook them."</p>
               <p>"I am willing all the boys should retire, if they choose, at eight o'clock. After
                  nine I do not allow them to sit up, you know, unless there is some special
                  occasion for it."</p>
               <p>"True. They have shown but little opposition to the rule. And they rise generally
                  with the first bell for prayers. This morning, Harry Otis, Hayden and underhill,
                  with myself, rose before the bell, and climbed the rock of the bluff to see the
                  sun rise."</p>
               <p>"Ah! a rich and extensive prospect you had."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; and it is by no means the first time, sir. I used repeatedly to walk
                  here when in college, and climb to the same summit. I admire the sea view from
                  this bluff. I have an extraordinary fondness for water scenes—and should rather
                  die on the water than on the land."</p>
               <p>"Have you notices, some time in your life, when you may have been there, perhaps,
                  with a fine telescope in your hand, a distant range of hills laying far in the
                  north, beyond the whole range that bounds the valley immediately lying in this
                  basin?"</p>
               <p>"I do not recollect to have seen the mountains you refer to, although, I suppose,
                  they have been seen by others."</p>
               <p>"I can not say that they have. But I was recently on mount Holyoke, eighty miles
                  north of this, and could see far away in the south two elevations. One of them,
                  the guide at the Mountain House there assured me, was the identical hill that
                  rises immediately over our Seminary, visited by you this morning, and the other
                  lies here, in the north-east, about three miles off."</p>
               <p>"It may be so, sir. I have indeed heard that Professor—is of that opinion, and
                  some others; but I have never been on Mount Holyoke. What do you think?"</p>
               <p>"It is, perhaps, somewhat difficult to arrive at a conclusive opinion. The outline
                  of the two peaks, as seen from Holyoke, is such as to remind one of these bluffs.
                  But they seem to you, although you look on their rear, as they appear to an
                  observer in front. I was struck with this circumstance instantly, and consider it
                  an objection to the common opinion. Moreover, they are not remarkably high hills,
                  and there are ridges and bold peaks further north in the same line of view, that
                  may lay some claim to what is asserted of these. Yet I do not totally differ in
                  opinion from others about them. The objection to other peaks, that they are too
                  nigh Holyoke, it is difficult to refute."</p>
               <p>Friday afternoon, just as the school was about to close, Castlereagh invited the
                  boys to assemble next<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6389-00000104"/> day at nine
                  o'clock, and to accompany him to the foot of Bluff Rock, provided with shovels,
                  axes, and hoes, in order to continue their labors on a new path they were making
                  under his direction to the summit. This gave them great pleasure. The morning was
                  very fair, the autumnal air bracing, and the occupation one that boys love. So
                  when the hour arrives, Castlereagh numbered over twenty lads, who had come
                  prepared for the sport.</p>
               <p>"Well, boys, this looks well for our cause. Glad to see you. Now, will it not be
                  best to choose our engineers, guides, pruners, and miners; and thus divide up the
                  work, so that we may all labor to the best advantage?"</p>
               <p>To this proposal all assented, and unanimously said that Castlereagh should be
                  General Conductor of the enterprise, and Marshall should be Captain of the
                  operatives. Harry Otis was chosen as the guide, Hayden chief sapper and miner,
                  Fitz Maurice pruner, Edgar, Amos Sunderland and Lawrence Dwights, engineers. These
                  arrangements being highly satisfactory, soon the word was given, and away they
                  went, a merry, merry company, to complete the path to the mountain top, which
                  Castlereagh had alone commenced, and which the boys had occasionally assisted him
                  about. Arrived near the base of the huge perpendicular rock, they struck off under
                  the direction of their guide, through the forest of young trees and bushes,
                  winding around the perpendicular face of the rock to the western ern slope of it,
                  where, amid jagged and fragmentary portions lying on a steep declivity, overgrown
                  in part with cedars, shrub oak, and stunted pines, the engineers were to lay out
                  the line of direction. At present they walked in a broad, well rutted, cart path.
                  Presently the conductor says "Halt! The guide tells me that here we diverge from
                  the path we are in, and strike immediately on to the hill. Pruner!"</p>
               <p>"Here am I, sir!" answers Fitz Maurice.</p>
               <p>"You must cut down the branches of this cedar that hang to the earth."</p>
               <p>In a moment's time this was done, and the party saw a newly path leading them in a
                  gentle curve around the base of a little hillock. They now arrived directly at the
                  foot of the mountain, and rapidly began to ascend along its side by a curving
                  narrow path, that had been easily made with a hoe in the crumbling, red sandstone.
                  The guide led the way to a small tableland, with levers, hoes, shovels, and picks,
                  to remove a large rock in the path. Having brought it up out of its bed, they
                  rolled it to the brow, and sent it whirling into the valley with a great
                  crash.</p>
               <p>Then they all shouted, "Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"</p>
               <p>Underneath the perpendicular columns of the rock, and near all the steepest
                  portions of it, there is an immense amount of fallen fragments that have been
                  accumulating for ages, and have partially decomposed under the combined action of
                  the sun and rain, as they<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6389-00000105"/> have lain
                  exposed there; and roots, and leaves, and earth, and moss, have enfolded and
                  covered them. These must be passed over, and then you come to the base line of the
                  solid mountain rock itself, and you begin to climb its age-worn sides. Castlereagh
                  has partially laid out his path over this rubbish rock, and half-way up the hill;
                  but he now submitted the whole to a review of the engineers. After carefully
                  surveying the route, they decided to follow in the main, the direction which
                  Castlereagh had already indicated by clippings from the bark of the trees that
                  grew up here and there through the whole of this <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >debris,</foreign> diverging a little to the right in one place to avoid an
                  immovable rock, and to the left in another to make the grade less.</p>
               <p>And now all hands were put to work. It was impossible to remove the whole of the
                  loose fragments; this would require the labor of many men and a great many days,
                  for the rocks lay piled loosely one above the other from three feet to six feet
                  deep. Accordingly they endeavored to level down the rough and uneven stones, fill
                  up the open places, and wherever it was practicable, to make steps. Over wide
                  chasms they placed long stone slabs side by side, and up steep places diverged a
                  little to one side and then to the other, making narrower steps than where the way
                  was more level. Lengthwise of this path, on both sides of it, they placed long
                  heavy stones, which would answer the double purpose of protection and a guide.
                  They worked very hard at this, choosing the largest loose pieces they could
                  manage, and then with levers and with bare hands lifting and rolling until they
                  perspired very freely and the excitement was very high.</p>
               <p>When this most laborious part of the whole undertaking was over, the conductor
                  called all hands to sit down and partake of some refreshments. The guide and
                  engineers, together with the miner. having gone further up the mountain to lay out
                  more work, were summoned down by the trumpeter, who blew the signal with his horn.
                  You never saw happier faces, hardly ever redder ones, than all our young laborers
                  wore at this moment. And they all chatted like so many birds in the air, and
                  hopped about like squirrels on the trees.</p>
               <p>The young commissary, with his assistants, having produced basket after basket of
                  provisions, the contents were spread under the shade of the trees on the rocks,
                  and glasses were filled from the water trickling down the ledges. A cold turkey
                  was served on the occasion, two loaves of bread, and sandwiches, pies, cakes,
                  beautiful, pippins, and pound sweets. Two large demijohns, filled to the cork with
                  "milk from the brindled cow," were despoiled of their precious contents amid
                  universal uproar, wit, sentiment, and song, the general conductor filling goblet
                  after goblet as the thirsty young enthusiasts presented them.</p>
               <p>the repast being nearly over, Marshall was called on for either a song or a story.
                  Now, as for singing, he did not know one note from another, and a choice not being
                  left him, he consented to tell a story, which was<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000106"/> about himself; and as it was literally true, and
                  particularly adapted to his auditory, some of whom were intending to pursue a
                  college course of study, we will narrate it.</p>
               <p>"When I was sixteen years of age," said he, "I had prepared myself to enter
                  college. My father and mother were dead, and I resided with an elder brother. His
                  house was situated near the shore of Long Island Sound, and not far off there was
                  an extensive beach, where the sea in high gales and tempests washed away the banks
                  and caused considerable damage. The government was obliged to defend it from time
                  to time by a heavy break-water, <abbr>i. e.,</abbr> a large thick stone wall laid
                  in mortar, and at considerable expense. My brother had taken one contract of
                  several thousand dollars, two or three years previous, and he now took another of
                  sixteen thousand dollars. This was on his hands during the summer that I was
                  sixteen and preparing to enter college in the fall. As he was willing to assist
                  me, he offered me a share in the business, if I was disposed to take hold of the
                  work with him, I consented to do so. We had fifteen or twenty men in our employ
                  constantly, and it happened that my brother was taken ill—very ill indeed. He lay
                  six weeks confined to his bed, and young as I was, the entire oversight of the
                  work fell to me. Profiting by his advice, and encouraged by his confidence, for he
                  could most of the time speak to me and understand the state of the work, I went
                  forward, and did the heaviest part of the job before he recovered. When the
                  break-water was completed, the men all paid off, and the bills were settled, my
                  brother paid me for my profits of the work <emph>a thousand dollars, and with that
                     I paid my way through college.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Hurrah, hurrah! Good, good!" was ejaculated on all sides.</p>
               <p>"We thought you were very expert in choosing and laying stones," said one.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said another, "and we ought to profit by such a distinguished stone layer,
                  en employée of the United States Government."</p>
               <p>Marshall had become a lion.</p>
               <p>"My lads," said Castlereagh, "this story of Mr. Marshall's, shows you that if you
                  earnestly put your heads, hearts, and hands to work, you will often succeed even
                  far beyond your expectations and plans; and it proves to us that God himself will
                  bless those who put their trust in Him and go forward. We may suppose, moreover,
                  that He designed in this manner to prepare the way for a long life of usefulness
                  on the part of our new friend. Never be discouraged therefore. If any of you need
                  help, you will be very sure of it if you go forward and contend with difficulties
                  in the spirit of Christian confidence and virtue."</p>
               <p>The word was now given for further progress in the work. They first named this
                  place where they had dines, "Half-way Lunch," and then, with their hands and
                  tools, soon erected some rough steps by which<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000107"/> they scaled the first, and only perpendicular cliff
                  in their route. Then, preceded by their engineers, they dug their way along the
                  brow of this cliff, making very little ascent for some distance. Presently they
                  came to the surface of a rock, on the side of which it was necessary to wind
                  around where there was very little foot hold. The sappers, drilles, miners were
                  now called into requisition, and after a while, they succeeded in loosening here
                  and there a portion of the rock, and in finding decomposed portions, where it was
                  easy to work out a place for the feet. This spot they called the "Grand Mulets,"
                  an Alpine term, and cautioned each other against a mis-step, by which they might
                  easily be thrown down fifty or sixty feet upon the rude fragments below. Then they
                  made a zig-zag, up-hill course, stopping for breath under the shade of an oak. Now
                  the whole troop worked lustily to undermine and roll from its bed in their way a
                  huge rock, and soon they came to a very narrow path close under a large
                  overhanging ledge, and then to a cramped pass-way between trees and rocks, which
                  they called "Thermopylæ." Then they wound around this cliff, and scaled that,
                  making as many devious courses as possible to add to the picturesqueness of the
                  path, and to relieve the steepness of the ascent. At last the severity of the hill
                  began to be overcome, the sudden and steep cliffs and projections were all
                  surmounted, and but little now remained, save to indicate the course by removing
                  decayed branches, leaves, and loose boulderes. This was soon done; and having
                  reached a huge pine-tree overhanging the rocks, around which they had wrought so
                  diligently in their upward which they had wrought so diligently in their upward
                  ascent, the pruner was loudly called for, to find a tall young sapling, cut and
                  trim it, while others prepared a heavy cluster of evergreen branches. Lashing
                  these to the end of the stick, they ascended the tree, and pushed it far above the
                  branches, and so securely fastened it to the trunk of the tree with nails and
                  cords, as to defy the winds to looses it, even those terrible tempests that often
                  swept over Bluff Rock. It could be seen far off in the valley, especially from the
                  Institute, and indicated the exact point on the brow of the hill, where the new
                  path reached the summit.</p>
               <p>Having gained the brow, and worked their path to where it intersected with the
                  main route to the "Cave," they nailed to the trees a board which they had brought
                  with them, on which Castlereagh had rudely painted the words, "Seminary Path," and
                  drawn a large hand, which a finger pointing in the direction to it. Then they
                  marked the trees, and endeavored to make the path plain where it joined the other.
                  It needed not the word of command from the conductor to lay aside the tools. Every
                  one was tired, and fully satisfied with the labor performed. Some cast themselves
                  on the dry leaves, and rolled about; others sat down, wiped away the perspiration,
                  and fanned themselves with their caps; and others still leaned against the trees
                  and panted.</p>
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6389-00000108"/>
               <p>After a few moment's rest, they all prepared to run forward to the peak or bare
                  summit of Bluff Rock, where the view of the valley, city and ocean is magnificent
                  and uninterrupted, when they were arrested by the approach of voices—merry,
                  laughing, shouting voices of ladies. Presently a very large party of young ladies,
                  the pupils of Miss D's school in G—— street, who had come out form the city
                  accompanied by their teachers, for a Saturday's romp, emerged from the cover of
                  the thickly-growing cedars that overspread the path to the "Cave," and were gayly
                  chatting and hopping along, when suddenly beholding our party of young scholars
                  and workers all clustered around Castlereagh, and in a state of high excitement,
                  such as we have described, the foremost of the advancing party halted and recoiled
                  on the next, and so they all finally came together into a thick cluster, looking
                  less alarmed than surprised. Castlereagh and his party were equally astonished at
                  such an interview. For a moment only the two parties stood thus surveying each
                  other; then Castlereagh perceived that the strangers were the pupils of the school
                  mentioned above, and that a teacher accompanied them with whom he was somewhat
                  acquainted. Without any further delay he approached the party, and accosting the
                  lady, the whole company forthwith became quite ar ease, as they notices their
                  mutual acquaintance. Castlereagh motioned to his lads to fall back, and conducted
                  the young ladies and their teacher a little way into the new path they had made.
                  They looked over the cliff from the signal pine, and traced here and there the
                  winding course of the path far down toward the valley.</p>
               <p>"When we return, Miss H——, may we not descend this way?" inquired one of the young
                  lady-pupils.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps so, Miss Janette; unless it should lead us too far from our carriages,
                  and cause us more fatigue."</p>
               <p>"It will be very little further for you," said Castlereagh; "and I will wait for
                  you to conduct you down, if you like."</p>
               <p>"Oh! thank you, sir, we shall need no assistance, and would prefer the excitement
                  of finding our way alone."</p>
               <p>"At least, allow me to send one of my young pupils as a guide to the 'Cave'!"</p>
               <p>"You are very kind indeed, sir, but pray excuse me if I decline it. We know the
                  way to it, having frequently been there, and there are no dangers now on these
                  heights, even from the 'king's commandment.</p>
               <p>"If there was danger, we should certainly insist on your acceptance of a guard
                  from our brave young band. As it is, we shall content ourselves with the offer,
                  and your polite declinative."</p>
               <p>During the whole of the conversation Marshall stood leaning against a tree with
                  his hat somewhat<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6389-00000109"/> drawn over his face,
                  neither saying a word nor moving from his position.</p>
               <p>the party of ladies at length passed on, tripping away as gayly as at the first;
                  and now, bounding and shouting, our lads rushed along the path by which the others
                  came to the summit rock.</p>
               <p>"Did you know any of those ladies, Marshall?" inquired Castlereagh, as they walked
                  along together.</p>
               <p>"Know them! yes, indeed. I know half of them."</p>
               <p>"Why did n't you speak to them, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I had n't any thing to say, and I was curious to see if they would recognize
                  me, especially my old acquaintance, Janette Patterson, from the same town as
                  myself and an old schoolmate."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. She did not recognize me. And there was another pretty young lady among
                  them, who threw my room-mate a beautiful bouquet at commencement—oh—hum—well. they
                  didn't seem to know me."</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, you don't know. You can't always at such times whether you are
                  discerned or not. If you will believe me, I heard that same young lady; Miss
                  Janette Patterson, whisper your name to her teachers, Miss H——, when we stood
                  together by the pine-tree."</p>
               <p>Marshall started. "Now," said he; "is that true? Is it possible? I declare it is
                  too bad, I would have made her my best bow had I known this. so I fooled myself,
                  after all!" But there was no remedy; so Marshall walked on.</p>
               <p>At last the party returned and began their descent. And now the lads, with the
                  agility and sure-footedness of goats, ran and pursued one another, bounding from
                  point to point in the path, and leaving Castlereagh and Marshall, heavily burdened
                  with tools, far in the rear. In a few moments a great shouting from below reached
                  their ears, and they hurried along to know what it could mean. Presently, up the
                  wild path-way, comes Johnnie, running along, and creeping after him, Hobbie!</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh! my little mountain-goats!" cried the happy father.</p>
               <p>"Ah! ha! father," shouted the lads; "and mamma is here, and all the folks," cried
                  Hobbie. Sure enough, at "Half-way Lunch," there were all the ladies of the family,
                  Sarah Matilda, Henrietta, Eleanor, Gertrude, Stella, Isable, and Roxanna come out
                  to meet the party. Some of them proceeded up the path quite to the signal pine,
                  but, returning, they rejoined the main company at the bridge leading into the
                  village, and all were soon once more at home.</p>
               <p>In this manner did Castlereagh often gratify his pupils, and by an open common
                  familiarity, he acquired a very great influence over them. In this manner he paid
                  attention to their health, and seldom saw any occasion to call a physician to
                  administer to them a nauseating medicines. Thus the confinement and constrained<pb
                     n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6389-00000110"/> strained position of the school-room
                  were broken up; and bodily vigor in the place of weakness; grace, instead of
                  awkwardness, were acquired. After a day's exercise and recreation, like this, how
                  sweet and firm was the sleep which sealed the eyes of all when evening's rest-hour
                  came, and Slumber's arms enfolded them.</p>

               <p>IT was nine o'clock Sabbath morning, and two clergyman sat by the way-side, in the
                  shade of a grove, familiarly conversing with each other. They were out walking,
                  each to the other's parish, to fulfill an exchange arrangement, and had met
                  together at this point. One of them was more robust and heavier than the other,
                  although not in all respects wearing a healthier expression of countenance. He was
                  one of the cheerful—consistently cheerful ministers of the vicinity, a good,
                  devoted, holy man, who had labored hard for his Saviour, and successfully so—whose
                  reward was on high. Between him and Castlereagh, who now sat beside him, there had
                  been a close and pleasing acquaintance from the hour when as young men, Freshmen
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">designati,</foreign> they sat together for the first
                  time in the gallery of the chapel, and were directed by Professor K—— to decline

                  erected a large, imposing edifice on the summit of an oak and chestnut-crowned

                  a thickly crowned cedar-ridge in the rear, where the muses had an arbor, and Cupid
                  hung his quiver. A chosen spot, and fitly shapen by its owner, for the proper
                  education and accommodation of twenty-five or thirty young misses, who were all

                  endeared. Among his young pupil protégés, how much venerated and esteemed; in his
                  parish, idolized; in the association, listened to with great respect. At the age
                  of nineteen he left the blacksmith's forge and became one of the <foreign

                  pleasant to speak to one another of the past and of the present, especially of
                  that good Providence by which their way in life has been directed, and His smile

                  <p>He is gone, sir. His sickness was short, but sufficient. I mourn his absence,
                     although well assured he has gone to the better land. I saw him often during
                     his illness, and he died in the hope of a blessed immortality.</p>

               <p>That day evening found both the pastors at their own homes, having enjoyed another
                  opportunity so grateful to the heart of the ministers of Christ, of preaching the
                  Gospel of the Lord Jesus to attentive, if not awakened congregations of
                  hearers.</p>
               <p>The Association met on Wednesday at the usual morning hour. It was assembled in
                  the study of Rev. ——, and there were present twelve clergymen; Castlereagh was
                  present—W—— <emph>was not present.</emph> When Castlereagh entered the room,
                  accompanied by Rev. Mr. ——, several were already in, chatting in the most easy,
                  earnest, and familiar manner, the hour not having quite arrived at which the
                  business of the Association commenced. Immediately friendly greetings went round
                  the circle, and the new-comers were soon installed in their places in the group,
                  and lent their voices to the common hum. Presently others are announced the
                  greetings are renewed, nods, and smiles, and shaking of hands, introductions of
                  strangers; the hour has come also. Much business awaits the association, and the
                  Annual Moderator calls to order.</p>

               <p>"Brethren! shall the Association be opened with prayer?"</p>
               <p>Immediately every knee is bent in devotion. The prayer is an impressive one. It is
                  a confession of unworthiness, but expresses the joy of every pious heart that God
                  has "counted him faithful, putting him into the ministry" of the Lord Jesus. It is
                  full of reverence. It breaks forth into thanksgiving; it implores the divine
                  blessing on all the labors of Christ's embassadors, the descent of the Holy Spirit
                  on all the churches, the revival of the pure work of grace and salvation to be
                  sent forth unto all the ends of the earth. Then follows the Greek lesson, a
                  critical reading, and study, and a very animated and free conversation over it, of
                  a portion of the Acts of the Apostles from the Greek Testament, each member
                  reading two verses in his turn. The time consumed in this exegetical study is
                  about an hour and a half; and so deeply interested are all the members, that the
                  time expires long before they are perceptibly wearied. It is a happy feature in
                  their programme, and awakens often much enthusiasm, warm discussion, interminable
                  varieties of exegesis, great research of Gesenius, Calmet, Robinson, Kitto, Henry,
                  Doddridge, Barnes, Stuart, Hackett; opinions bold, opinions cautious, opinions
                  strenuous, opinions timid, opinions novel, opinions obsolete, opinions shading
                  into one another, opinions strikingly dissimilar, are advanced on almost every
                  verse that is read. And how many subjects for sermons are in this study of the
                  Acts presented sented to every mind! What a rich portion of the New Testament is
                  this same Acts! Do all men so regard it? Certainly they would, were they carefully
                  and candidly to peruse it.</p>
               <p>Now the books are closed, and half an hour is passed in strict religious devotion,
                  in prayer, exhortation, praise. Truly my soul wait thou on God. It is good to be
                  there, to hear the pastors speak, and pray, and sing as do other men, deploring
                  their own unworthiness, but ascribing praise to God for the blessings of his grace
                  and salvation. They seek direction, they ask for wisdom; they can not be denied a
                  father's blessing.</p>
               <p>And then the business matter of the Association proceeds again. There is a call
                  for the Dissertation. This is a carefully prepared document on a subject given out
                  at a previous gathering. Its reading is followed by discussion, not on the merits
                  of the article presented, but on the question itself. The subjects chosen are
                  sometimes exegetical on a Scriptural reading, or theological on some point of
                  doctrine, dogma, or principle; or they are on practical duty, religious biography,
                  etc., etc. Now we have the Scriptural significance of baptism in the Church; anon,
                  the argument in favor of Christ's divinity; at another time, an inquiry into the
                  power of Edwards as a preacher. And again: "How may the lay element in the Church
                  be the most profitably employed?" Every member is questioned: "What have you to
                  say on this subject?" This is also a pleasing and an instructive season. Hardly is
                  it ended ere<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6389-00000114"/> the dinner-hour arrives,
                  for the members all dine to-gether at the house where meets the Association.</p>
               <p>A minister's admiration of a good dinner has been sometimes his reproach. Why he
                  should not now and then enjoy a sumptuous feast as well as do other men, we can
                  not see. That he loves it, is but saying that in this he resembles mankind in
                  general. To forbid it him, especially when met in a circle of his own brethren,
                  for the purpose of recreation and repose from study, is a petty tyranny. A man who
                  rises from a groaning table, where he has partaken of every delicacy that could be
                  procured, and even drowned the feast afterward with wine, can with very little
                  taste or justice, say: "Give a clergyman porridge; it is good enough for him."
                  That's depravity's judgment. Judgments may hereafter, in a comparison of one man
                  with another, be reversed. Who knows?</p>
               <p>While the members wait the summons in the parlors, they read the papers, the
                     <title>Tribune,</title> the <title>Times,</title> etc., etc. They gather in
                  small circles of three or four; they examine the engravings on the wall; it is
                  rather an idle five minutes or ten—a yawning, stretching time. Presently the doors
                  are thrown open, and the repast is duly announced.</p>
               <p>The dinner is highly convivial. Business is laid aside. The carvers, the
                  gravy-waiters, the condiment helpers, the lookers-on, all play their part. The
                  carvers are cleaving rich cuts transversely from an enormous beef-roast. Fat
                  turkey boiled, fatter roasted, are carved—scientifically carved, every secret
                  joint severed, and the white and dark meat awaits your choice. The dissevered
                  portions lie piled and savory around the dish. Many are the compliments to the
                  carvers, many to the host by the dissectors, for the true metal of the blades.</p>
               <p>"Any thing but a dull carver; thanks, Brother —— for this keen blade. Now
                  gentlemen, what will you have?"</p>
               <p>And then the well-cloven cold ham is delicately shaven down. And lest some
                  epicurean expectancy may not be gratified without it, mine host has also provided
                  a chicken pie in a large yellow dish, boiled chickens, oyster pies, of course, and
                  a halibut steak. Every dish has its own gravy, beef, boiled and roasted turkey,
                  chickens, halibut. Oyster soup is lavished on the well-fattened turkeys and
                  chickens. There are potatoes mashed and browned in butter, common uncommon, and
                     <emph>sweet.</emph> There are turnips in choice varieties, beets, onions,
                  pickles, and cranberry sauce. These are a part of the convivial feast!</p>
               <p>"What will you have, sir?"</p>
               <p>Ah! ha! a difficult question to <emph>settle</emph> if you have all, a difficult
                  selection if a part, utterly impossible to take a little. But all are
                  satisfactorily supplied at last, and every member is very busy and very facetious
                  and happy. It taken a long time to tell over the events of a month, to give and
                  take what comes to hand, to give the news, to gives reviews, to give the dues
                     to<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6389-00000115"/> Brown and Hughes, and so away
                  with all the blues. But is the dinner now over? By no means. This course is
                  removed, every dish is taken away, the crumbs brushed off, the table made ready
                  for further enjoyment. There is one very happy feature in the removal. It is this.
                  The little daughters of the host often, with nimble fingers and on light-stepping
                  feet, busy themselves with the "help" and "mercury" offficials in this department,
                  and in replacing dishes for the second course. The little grand-daughter of Mr.
                  N——, a highly respected and wealthy gentleman of the city, father of clergyman
                  G——, is not ashamed to perform this service, and while her smiling parents
                  approve, their guests lavish on her their sincere compliments. And the delicate
                  little ones of the departed grandsire, the devoted and distinguished Mr. T——,
                  refined and beautiful children as they are the idols of their youthful parents, go
                  smiling and hopping around the well-loaded tables in the same active, not
                  inappropriate, duty. But to the dinner—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias,</foreign>
                  the dessert. Mine host and hostess, one at each end of the table, dip out most
                  highly-flavored custard-pine, or custardquince, while others lend a knife and cut
                  eagerly into the several varieties of pies that are unstintedly ranged along on
                  either side, for the tables are richly set out again, tempting you with pies,
                  pudding, custards, delicious jellies, fragrant sweetmeats; apples, raisins,
                  grapes, nuts, follow, and where is the end? An hour goes by—shall I say sometimes
                  nearly two?—ere the great dispatch is off, the generous host and hostess
                  satisfied, the richly fed guests satisfied, the wants of nature equipoised, and
                  members have all thrice told their well-remembered tales. They wind their way back
                  to the session-rooms. And while a member reads the sermon, his critics and
                  reviewers, some of them walk the room with a light tread, others occasionally
                  nodding, get distant and uncertain views of things, of text, subject, division,
                  argument and close. And some lounge on their neighbor's chair-backs, and others
                  gaping through watery eyes, gaze on the reader puffing through his heavy task. The
                  hour wearily rolls off. The members wake up. They have all heard the sermon! Some
                  have taken notes! They like and they dislike. They commend this, and they censure
                  that. The talk goes briskly round. They are all themselves again. The dinner is a
                  past reminiscence! Then we come to a very busy, entertaining, and instructive
                  scene, an hour where the sands drop fast. It is the account by every member of his
                  month's reading. Some confess that they, by reason of absence, the hurry and the
                  worry of life, have done little during the past thirty days that they care to
                  mention, and slide as easily as possible into the outer circle where they can
                  listen. Others have read the <title>Tribune,</title> the <title>Times,</title> the
                     <title>Express,</title> the <title>Independent,</title> the
                     <title>Post,</title> the Evangelist, the <title>Sun,</title> the
                     <title>New-Englander,</title> the <title>Bibliotheca,</title> the Foreign

               <p>"No, no," says the Moderator; "we are all supposed to have read the papers."</p>
               <p>"No very easy task, sir, though," retorts the victim.</p>
               <p>"Any standard works, or miscellaneous writings, sir?" inquires the Moderator.</p>
               <p>"Ah! beg your pardon, sir. I have been wading through Neander."</p>
               <p>"Was it muddy, sir, or deep water?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! indeed sir, I find Neander is neither muddy nor deep, for 'deep' supposes
                  bottom; unfathomable."</p>
               <p>"Then you have touched neither bottom nor shore in Neander?"</p>
               <p>"I made the shore of many of his ideas, I am happy to say, sir; but have been
                  often floundered. Further, I think Neander highly suggestive and profitable. 'He
                  who reads him for solid instruction will find himself abundantly rewarded.'<ref

                   Like my young neighbor J——, I am almost determined to learn the German, to
                   read him in his own tongue."</p>

               <p>"Well, sir, that <emph>would</emph> be folly. Any thing further, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. I have read Arnold's Sermons. I have reperused Morell. I am
                  passionately fond of these writers, and think them among the best we have.</p>
               <p>"Rev. Mr. —— has read Roget's Thesaurus of English words, and highly commends it,
                  also the UNCLE TOM literature, and the 'SIDE' Miscellanies. Another has perused
                  rused with great interest John Foster's life and correspondence. A large month's
                  reading is detailed, going over the recent valuable publications of all sorts of
                  writers—an account not confined to recent authors, but having extensive reference
                  also to standard works long highly venerated and esteemed.</p>
               <p>"Brethren," says the Moderator, "we will now hear about the sermons preached the
                  past month."</p>
               <p>The members produce their sermons, and when called on, give the text and subject
                  of each discourse, and when it was preached. Some have written four, others five,
                  six, seven, or eight sermons since they last met together. This is an interesting
                  part of the business. Fifty to eighty sermons have been prepared, and are now
                  presented. They show that the writers have been occupied with an intense desire to
                  preach "the kingdom of God" among men—to proclaim the great truths of Gospel
                  repentance, faith, and salvation—to arouse the slumbering consciences of
                  sinners—to convince them of their entire depravity, and need of the Holy Spirit—to
                  begin, to carry on, and to perfect in them the righteousness of God their
                  Saviour.</p>
               <p>After this, "Questions for Advice, and Plans for Doing Good?" is the formal
                  inquiry of the programme. Some have trouble, have had, or expect to, and being
                  heard, are counseled. Many are the plans for doing good: one has a Tuesday evening
                  Bible class for young men; another is lecturing upon the Bible; still another
                  labors in the Sabbath-school at noon; and another<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000117"/> other has started a five o'clock meeting in a
                  grove, two or three miles distant from the church, among a class of men who
                  neglect the Sabbath. One proposes that greater efforts be made in behalf of
                  temperance; another pleads in behalf of the monthly concert of prayer. All are
                  united in their desire that more of a spirit of prayer for the blessing of God
                  should abound in the Church.</p>
               <p>After the place and time of the next meeting have been agreed on, and all the
                  appointments made, the Association is adjourned with prayer.</p>
               <p>On the morrow these pastors are found in their respective parishes, laboring in
                  their studies with renewed pleasure and zeal, or among their people, going from
                  house to house, visiting the sick, conversing with the impenitent and worldly, and
                  on every side of them exciting an influence of the kind New England has felt for
                  two hundred years! Is it surprising, therefore, that a body of such men—3,050
                  strong—should have a moral power in their REMONSTRANCE against a public wrong,
                  exceeding that of commen men, and yet it should be <emph>only a
                     remonstrance?</emph>

               <p>DIARY. <hi rend="i"/>Oct.——Hurrying down to take the cars for Albany, whom should
                  I encounter but my good friend, Deacon D——, an intelligent man, delegate from the
                  church in N—— to the Convention. We sat together nearly the whole trip through. On
                  the same train was the Reverend H. W. B——, who, being in a hurry to get through,
                  rode forward on the cow-catcher! "Saints, sinners, and the Beecher family!" Met
                  Clifford and his mother there. Clifford is now the highly respected pastor of the
                  rich parish of L——, and in his new sphere of labor, finds but little leisure for
                  rambling abroad. Found him in the last seat of the last car in the train, which
                  was of great length, looking out on the magnificent scenery of the Highlands.
                  "This," said he, "provided you have any desire to see the country, is the only
                  good seat in the cars." Thought I, "Odd men show their oddities in very odd sort
                  of ways." We arrived safely. I was disappointed that W——, who was slightly unwell
                  at the meeting of the<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6389-00000118"/> Association, and
                  so detained from it, was not present at the Convention, which passed off very
                  happily. It was voted to raise $50,000 in the churches, by a simultaneous
                  collection, on the first Sabbath of January, as a fund to go toward the erection
                  of church edifices at the West. A noble object—in the eye of faith, resplendently
                  glorious to the land and the world. Many a stirring speech was made on this
                  occasion—many brothers shook hands then for the first and the last time. It was a
                  great drift of fine scholars, many of them eminent divines, and many notable lay
                  brethren in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Oct. 15.—Went to-day into the school and heard the Latin classes
                  throughout, recitation being in Virgil, Cicero, Viri Romæ, and Reader. My boys
                  seem to be improving, on the whole, but their rendering was, in some cases,
                  awkward. In the afternoon, declamation by Amos—good; ditto by Harry Otis and Fitz
                  Maurice; compositions by girls, very creditable. A fine school paper, edited by
                  Miranda, Gertrude, and Eleanor, was read by the latter, and included a very rich
                  sonnet, contributed by herself. The school was not altogether quiet. One of the
                  boys was called to the platform and made to stand there for his disposition to
                  inquietude. There were present a few ladies and gentlemen as visitors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Oct. 20.—To-day, in the city, heard alarming intelligence of W——.
                  Suddenly he has begun to droop. The physician says he does not "rally" at all. The
                  people are bewildered and shocked by the news. Have made arrangements to go and
                  see him to-morrow. Knock! "Come in."</p>

               <p>Deacon N—— came to tell me that he had heard of Mr. W——'s illness, and to offer me
                  his horse if I wished to go and see him. So telling him my plans, he left. Mr. S——
                  called with an order on the treasurer for an hundred dollars of the salary, for
                  which I felt truly grateful. My two notes on the bank come due in three days, and
                  I have now the prospect of meeting them without much further trouble. He had
                  hardly left, when ALICE called, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for
                  Richmond, and protesting she had not a moment to stay, pressed her children,
                  Hayden and Stella, to her heart and darted away to her carriage. Forgetting,
                  however one errand with Sarah Matilda, back she came, and having made known her
                  object in the mean time laid off her hat, and bidding Hayden see that the horse
                  was secured, declared she would not leave till after tea.</p>
               <p>At this the girls and boys all gathered around her, and as usual, when she tarries
                  with us, there were lively times for an hour. She rallied Marshall on looking
                  sober, and Marshall, to prove that he was not sober broke into an immoderate fit
                  of laughter. This produced a very great excitement in Miss Henrietta's mind, who
                  declared the scene was perfectly dramatic.<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000119"/> At the tea-board, the highest good-humor prevailed,
                  and little Hobbie laughed once so crazily that he caught the hiccoughs. Once he
                  upset his glass of water, and once his knife fell on to the floor. Mortified at
                  his ill-luck, he then burst into tears, exclaiming, "It is too, too bad, fader"
                  (he trips on "father" even yet), "there is nothing but ackidents." Hobbie is
                  forgiven amid a burst of merriment, in which the little fellow recovers his
                  equanimity, and laughs too. And now Alice says "she will go, and nothing shall
                  stop her," not even Mina's excellent third-proffered cup. We all rise, all flutter
                  round her, all say good-by a dozen times—when lo! here comes Hayden from the
                  post-office with a long-expected letter. "But what does this mean?" says she
                  wildly, as she breaks the envelop and reads. "Why here is a fifty dollar note
                  only, and I ought to have three hundred and fifty dollars!—'check?' There is no
                  check—I have not received any of late—again, then <emph>I am robbed!</emph>
                  Castlereagh, what <emph>shall I do?</emph> I have lost one hundred dollars before,
                  and now where are my checks sent in letters previous to this." The long and short
                  of the matter was, that she felt it her duty to turn her carriage and ride back to
                  the city, accompanied by Hayden, in order thoroughly, in person, to investigate
                  the difficulty. "Here then I go," said she, muffling herself up as she took her
                  carriage; "having nothing to do, as Mrs. R—— tells me, 'but to ride round and take
                  my comfort!'" This, which was said with the most facetious expression in the midst
                  of great outward discomfort, and in great perturbation of mind, produced an
                  universal clapping, and away she rode, burying her face in her shawl, and
                  weeping—yes, convulsively and sadly weeping—yet remembering the consolatory
                  Scripture, "A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in is
                  holy habitation."</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>Oct. 23.—My own birthday—and the release-day of the beloved W——,
                  from earth! Who would have predicted such an event four weeks ago, when every
                  thing around him was fair and promising? What human eye could have looked along
                  into his future, and espied the flight of his arrow? I have passed three days and
                  nights with his family, and endeavored to render them assistance. W——, has been in
                  a wild and painful state for three days, not knowing any one, and with but one
                  brief and lucid interval, so has died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Oct. 25.—To-day the grave has received the remains of this dear
                  brother. There were present at his funeral a large and weeping company of his
                  bereaved people. They appeared like seep who have been bereaved of their shepherd,
                  and feel their lonely and exposed condition. Yesterday, I left my own pulpit with
                  another, and preached to them. His afflicted wife, sending off her family to
                  church, sat and watched the Sabbath hours away over the still form of her departed
                  husband, communing with her own heart, and gathering strength from God for her
                  last parting<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6389-00000120"/> Never have I passed such
                  another Sabbath-day in the congregations of God's people. Adapting my discourses
                  to the state of things among them, their hearts and my own became deeply affected,
                  and there was a very general weeping through the whole house. To-day the funeral
                  services have been a prayer at the house, by the Rev.—, his own former pastor, and
                  public services in the old church, just ready to be torn down, as the people have
                  erected, by the side of it, a new, and very tasteful modern church edifice. W——
                  indulged himself in the pleasing anticipation of worshiping with is people in it;
                  but no—he has fallen asleep. From the walls of the old edifice, where the fathers
                  of ancient memory have led the devotions of God's people, he has been taken to his
                  grave. Many of the neighboring clergymen were present; clergymen are the
                  pall-bearers; clergymen lower the coffin into its narrow bed; clergymen speak, and
                  weep at his grave. And by and by the tide of human life that has flowed together
                  around his sepulcher begins again to ebb. The great swell is broken, and rolls
                  away. Here and there a few go among the graves, or one lingers as the sexton toils
                  on to end his task; but most had gone, and W—— is alone, cold, forsaken, to be
                  forgotten by living men until the <foreign xml:lang="GRC">αναςτατια</foreign>
                  <hi rend="i"/>(rising-up) of the last day. Can any friend that knew him doubt that

                   How many families of ministers in this vicinity have been called to
                  similar afflictions. I now recall to mind the following, and there may be others;
                  Rev. Mr. B—— has lost an affectionate son and daughter; Rev. Mr. C——, his beloved
                  son; Rev. Mr. T——, wife; Rev. Mr. B——, son; Rev. Mr. W——, son; Rev. Mr. P——,
                  child; Rev. Mr. B——, wife; Rev. Mr. D—— was himself taken away when far from home;
                  Rev. Mr. A——. wife. I have but to run the record a little further back, and it
                  brings in the whole! Such then is human life. It is short at best, and always
                  liable to an immediate interruption. On every grave-stone there is written, as it
                  were, the startling language, "Be ye also ready, for in such an hour, as ye think
                  not, the Son of Man cometh."</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 10.—the fever which carried off brother W—— has prevailed
                  extensively in his family. The pupils have taken it; the school has been
                  temporarily disbanded. One or two of the pupils have died. I, indeed, felt ill
                  myself for a few days, but have now recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Nov. 15.—To-day, Marshall said to me, "Mr. C., you have, I think, a
                  very great tenacity of life."</p>
               <p>"Why so?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"Because," said he, "you do a great amount of business of one kind and another,
                  without giving out, and yet have by no means a robust, healthy expression. When
                  you left my room last summer, after engaging me to come here, I said, 'There goes
                  a dead man in the course of six weeks.'"</p>

               <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed I, with a sudden start.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he continued; "you had a sickly, cadaverous expression that I could but
                  notice; and it remained long on my mind."</p>
               <p>"And how do I appear to you to-day?" inquired I.</p>
               <p>"Oh, for that matter," said he, "'neither better not worse,' as a certain boy once
                  said of his grandfather, 'but a little on the gain,'"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 1.—To-day three of the boys were kept after school in
                  consequence of coming in late from the ice. Henrietta also was obliged to
                  reprimand two of the young ladies for continued thoughtlessness and giddiness of
                  manner. On the whole, the school is doing well. This term closes at Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 2.—Two gentlemen called to-day to engage places for their sons

                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 3.—Marriage took place this morning in the church between two
                  of my young friends, Mr. —— and Miss ——. The church was crowded with
                  observers.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 4.—Hayden is determined to skate, and unless he can have
                  liberty to do as he likes about it, prepares a very poor lesson. Some of the other
                  boys appear equally bad. Marshall is troubled by it. I must see to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 5.—General rule in school to-day, that the bell of the
                  Institute shall be rung for the accommodation of the skaters at noon, fifteen
                  minutes before school.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 8.—Great scampering of the boys to be in school to-day in
                  season, George Haliday having unfortunately been suspended a day or two for
                  breaking over the rule. Every thing goes right again. I gently pulled Harry Otis's
                  ear to-day, and notified Amos that he was careless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 10.—Some of the boys are rather too fond of the young ladies.
                  They would, apparently, take the very highest pleasure in their society half the
                  time—nay, the whole of it! But the rules of the Institute are positive on this
                  point, and the interchange of sly looks when the great doors are open, and covert
                     <emph>notes,</emph> forwarded on occasions when we can not detect them and use
                  preventive measures, constitute the principal offenses as yet detected. Recently I

               <p>I could but laugh. I was vexed; and at the same time I knew that it was wholly out
                  of my power to do any<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6389-00000122"/> thing to alter
                  this absurdity. A few days since I observed to the school, that any attempt to
                  crowd open the folding doors during recess, and any gazing through the forced
                  opening of the doors, or any rapping on the doors or window-blinds, to call
                  attention, would be followed by an immediate public exposure and expulsion. The
                  young ladies all seemed frightened, and not to know what I could mean; the young
                  gentlemen looked entirely innocent and wondering. Poor things! do I not know more
                  of them than they imagine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Dec. 12.—Marshall is indefatigable in teaching and training my
                  pupils. He will not overlook one important lesson or rule; and though so strictly
                  disciplinary, he is also companionable. The boys, at the breakfast and
                  dinner-table, sometimes argue with him, and run tilt against his democracy. His
                  replies not unfrequently unhorse them, and flounder them in the mud. In general,
                  the discussion is in very good part and respectful, though frequently very highly
                  spiced. I admire the principles that he avows, and really maintains. He will vote
                  for good men of his own party, if they are nominated to fill public offices; but
                  if not, will vote for good men of the opposite party. This exposes him to some
                  sharp shots from his antagonists, all of whom are young whigs.</p>

               <p>"Oh, your are extremely generous," said Eleanor, who has quite a love of politics,
                  and reads the "Daily" with great interest to keep up with the times. She also
                  seems to tke expecial delight in helping the boys against him;—"you are generous,"
                  said she; "a generosity, however, that leads you to give away to one that you may
                  take away the more from another. Is it not, sir?"</p>

                     sometimes to be severaly just.</p>

                     in its<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6389-00000123"/> resources, and popular in its
                     dogmas, rule out the retaliatory principle, and be lenient—merciful?</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"Good! good! good!" exclaimed the boys and girls, while Castlereagh looked up from
                  his dinner askance at Marshall, determined on helping him, if he was in trouble.
                  But he was shaking with merriment, and strong in his argument, so Castlereagh did
                  not interfere.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Henirietta.</speaker>
                  <p>You are fairly floored now, Mr. Marshall. I don't see one single chance for you
                     to recover yourself.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marshall.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, it looks rather dark, to be sure. But we must not forget that the truth
                     is with us somewhere; if so, we should not despair of finding it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Henrietta.</speaker>
                  <p>You may well do so, I think now. What <emph>can</emph> you say beyond mercy? If
                     your Administration is unmerciful, of course it is unjust.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>This highly amused and interested the boys and girls. Castlereagh looked a little
                  uneasy, but Marshall did not seem to mind it.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marshall.</speaker>
                  <p>Mrs. Castlereagh?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. C.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Castereagh laughed, and so did all.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Marshall, "mercy and justice, we know, sweetly harmonize in perfect
                  system of government. There can not be one without the other. You want that we
                  should separate them, and, by showing mercy, prove ourselves unjust, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, no, no!" exclaimed all. "That is a mere dodge—it is not the sentiment.
                  That is <emph>too</emph> bad, any how," and so forth, and so forth.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh calmed them down a little, and Sarah Matilda quickly replied.</p>
               <p>"The Administration does not need the show of mercy to make its injustice visible
                  and glaring."</p>
               <p>There was a great tumult at these words, and even Castlereagh could not refrain
                  from uniting in it. Marshall exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my poor, down-trodden democracy, what shall I do? I wish I had a few ladies
                  on my side to help defend it."</p>
               <p>Shella, Isabel, and Gertrude replied, "You shall have, Mr. Marshall; we will help
                  you."</p>
               <p>"You!" said Hayden.</p>
               <p>"Yes <emph>we,</emph>" said Stella. "I wonder if the poor man does not need
                  help?"</p>
               <p>At this there was another round of merriment.</p>
               <p>"We should never despise the day of small things." said Marshall; and the laugh
                  rolled over rather heavily against Stella.</p>
               <p>"You had better not despise it," said she, "for you would then, I fear, despise
                  the chief glory of your Administration."</p>
               <p>This, which was said archly and suddenly in retaliation, cut as keenly as any
                  repartee that had preceded it, and the boys were excessively proud of their young
                  companion. Marshall said the day was fairly gone, and begged for a little drop of
                  mercy. They all told<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6389-00000124"/> him it would prove
                  them "unjust," and so compelled him to fight it out, which he did very manfully
                  till the bell called them all away to school. Among other defenses that he
                  adopted, were these. He said,</p>
               <p>"If there are forty thousand whigs to be turned out of office, it is not so much
                  from want from of mercy to them, as to show political justice to others." "It is a
                  poor party that can not provide for its own." "The whigs after fighting against
                  us, and being even now opposed to our Administration, would demean themselves to
                  beg for office under us, or even to accept it; we accordingly do them a real favor
                  when we compel them to show their manhood and go out.' "Out Adminstration came
                  into power by the votes of its friends. These now claim its favors—who can show a
                  better right to them? To whom can they, according to any proper rate of
                  distribution, be given if not to them?" "When you come into office, eat your own
                  venison."</p>
               <p>On the whole, the argument was not very decisive on either side, and, a usual in
                  politics, it was left open for further discussion. But the boys and girls thought
                  Marshall a little harder pressed than he had sometimes been. Marshall cared little
                  for it, and went whistling to his room.</p>

               <head type="sub">IDLENESS AND IGNORIUS.</head>
               <p>AND how does it fare with the sermons in these days? Castlereagh is not forgetful
                  of his duty in respect to them. He uniformly prepares one, often two sermons each
                  week, and preaches them on the following Sabbath. He often labors in the night to
                  do this, and rises early. Sometimes he is weary, frequently he draws long sighs,
                  occasionally presses his hand against his head, and wears a look of care. Still
                  the work goes on. He visits the sick, conversing and praying with them. When any
                  of his people are removed, he prepares himself, and attends to all the duty of the
                  funeral service. He receives, as well as makes calls and visits. His item is
                  occupied. His strength is tasked to the utmost, as it would seem, and yet he
                  rather adds each day to his cares than lessens the number and burden of them. Some
                  interesting cases of seriousness in his society and in the school awaken his
                  solicitude, and lead to renewed exertions and to much watchfulness and prayer. And
                  withal he frequently prepares an article for the religious press, and is found
                  here and<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6389-00000125"/> there at ordinations, meetings
                  of association, and at temperance gatherings. His reading can not be dispensed
                  with, although it is often extremely hurried. Sarah Matilda reads to him if he
                  retires a little carly, till sleep closes his eyes. In this manner he obtains his
                  missionary news, much of it, and selects interesting portions of the
                     <title>Herald</title> and <title>Home Missionary</title> for his monthly
                  concert of prayer. She reads to him selections from the Quarterlies. She reads him
                  asleep over Butler's Analogy, and marks with a pencil certain suggestive
                  paragraphs to talk over when he shall be awake. He finds his Latin growing rusty,
                  and reads over Cicero, and Virgil. His Greek is slipping from his memory, and he
                  reviews the Iliad. His Hebrew, with or without points, is in danger of becoming an
                  unknown tongue, and he daily reads one of its unmouthable, back-track chapters,
                  having large use for Gesenius. He resolves that he will never let a day pass
                  without reading more or less in the classics, and in the Sacred text; for why
                  should he bestow so large a bounty on poor Idleness and Ignorius, as all the
                  knowledge he has of languages, that cost him years to acquire among his young
                  class-mates, and that fitted him for usefulness, and placed him as a scholar and a
                  thinker among men of this cast? A good deal of this sort of largess is, however,
                  being ever contributed, even by our young divines and scholars in other
                  professions and trades. It is given away for the newspapers and Quarterlies; for
                  the long, heavy sermons, which some men never quite understand; for Blackstone,
                  Coke, and Chitty; for the practice of the Materia Medica and surgery; for the
                  chemical analysis of soils. There are some "John Quinzys," some Josiahs, some
                  Everetts, alive in these <emph>decades</emph> of the Republic, who forget not
                  their studies in political life; few Burrits, Frosts, Mezzofantis. There are many
                  ignoriuses and scholastic <emph>drifters.</emph> And yet, we may well ask, why
                     <emph>should</emph> young men know so much, when their knowledge is rated less
                  than clerk-hire or factory-wages? Certainly not for the consideration of dollars
                  and cents. No, for striking a deep mark into the great century column that rises
                  in the pathway of their life. Dwight, Everett, Adams, Alexander, Napoleon, and
                  Washington, began their career of letters and of arms early. The stiff millioniare
                  in Wall street made his first fifty dollars in a "nect or nothing" speculation
                  before he was sixteen. His first five thousand when he was twenty-one. His first
                  hundred thousand before he was twenty-eight. If he had not been worth money at
                  thirty-five, he never would have been. Certainly Alexander had not
                     <emph>then</emph> conquered the world. Up <emph>early,</emph> then, young men,
                  if you are ever up. Climb the ladder before the dawn, and you will first see the
                  sunbeams.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh instilled these principles into the minds of his pupils, and found a
                  thorough assistant in Marshall, who was ever busy and progressive in all
                  departments of study, and prompt to meet every duty and<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000126"/> exigency. The young gentlemen of Lindenvale were
                  highly pleased with him for his ardent co-operation with them in their Lyceum and
                  public debates—Castlereagh and his church for his help as a Christian.</p>
               <p>"Marshall," said Castlereagh, "you will hardly go out to the Lyceum this
                  evening."</p>
               <p>"Not?"</p>
               <p>"Will you—it snows, I see."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, I can't prevent it snowing; and I don't intend the snow shall prevent
                  me, going."</p>
               <p>By the church, and especially those who attended the evening prayer-mettings, he
                  was highly esteemed, because he was always an attendant himself, and willing, if
                  so desired, to perform his share of the duty of the meetings.</p>
               <p>"You will doubtless study for the ministry," said Castlereagh to him in one of
                  their interviews.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, sir; I do not intend to do that."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, Marshall? why, I have rather set my heart on it! I have taken
                  great pleasure in your exhortations and other exercises in our social meetings,
                  and I know the feeling and expectation of all our brethren lean that way."</p>
               <p>"I have for a long time had my profession decided on, and think it altogether
                  likely that I shall pursue the course of study that I have marked out for
                  myself—not that I sat all undervalue the ministry, but that my wishes incline me
                  in another direction; and there I can, I think, see a wide field of
                  usefulness."</p>
               <p>"The ministry is not the only profession in which one can be useful," said
                  Castlereagh, "and yet it is probably the one of first important to all young men
                  who are pious, and having become educated, are looking abroad to find the place
                  they can most conscientiously labour in during life, and so fulfill their duty to
                  Christ. I think it has a far higher claim than that of the profession of the law,
                  exceedingly attractive as that may be."</p>
               <p>"I do not undervalue it, I repeat the remark. But it may be the positive duty of
                  some to engage in other professions, and so, by their life and whole example,
                  preach Christ among a class of men where the clergyman is not heard but with more
                  or less of prejudice, or where religion has far too few admirers anf
                  advocates."</p>
               <p>"There are, however, many distinguished lawyers in our country, who grace their
                  profession with piety; and I am of the opinion, that Christian lawyers accomplish
                  a very great amount of good. But it is, after all, a serious question for one to
                  decide, whether he shall give up the great and heaven-appointed office of an
                  embassador of Christ, for any of the professions and occupations that relate more
                  particularly to the affairs of time and the world."</p>
               <p>"We read of Luke, 'the beloved physician.' I have for many a year been decided in
                  my purpose to be a physician. But I have also the firm purpose of taking into my
                  profession, and applying it in my daily practice,<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000127"/> the very religion that led Luke to be esteemed and
                  called the beloved."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear friend, you have my hearty sympathy and prayers for your success. I
                  think your decision can not fail to lead you into a field where practical religion
                  may develop all her graces, and where you can not but honor the Saviour and be a
                  blessing to the souls of men. A truly pious physician is one certainly whom all
                  men regard with favor and confidence. He is wanted; so is the devotedly pious
                  lawyer. There are too many in all the professions who '<emph>drift</emph>' with
                  the current into the great waters of life, where their piety becomes absorbed and
                  so diluted as to be truly nauseating. What is wanted then, is, I am persuaded, the
                  firm, faithful man."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to say," said Marshall, "that as far as my observation has gone, there
                  are fewer men, in comparison with their numbers, in the different professions who
                  are unfaithful, idle, shrinking, time-serving men, than in the other states of
                  society and phases of life. And if this is so, it is a high testimony certainly in
                  favor of their education."</p>
               <p>"Education is, I think, favorable to religion," said Castlereagh. "I can not
                  perceive the soundness of any argument against it. An education fits one the more
                  readily to understand the whole world of matter, the entire kingdom of nature, and
                  the provinces of art and science, and to appropriate to himself their concealed
                  advantages. It gives him independece; it gratifies his nature; it makes his
                  companionable; it prepares him for public office and station of the highest
                  responsibility. Indeed, sir, I should prefer that my children, at the age of
                  twenty-one, were both highly educated, rather than possessed of twenty thousand
                  dollars each without an education."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I should agree with you, sir, although you are aware that there are
                  multitudes of very good men who would not."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know it; money is the great thing now-a-days, and always was, yea, always
                  will be, when men look merely or most intently on the worldly side of things. The
                  'MONEY-KING' is the great stock-jobber of all ages and places. He rules the
                  mind-market as well as as the stock and sales market, and inquires exultingly,
                  'What is the use of learning when men can become <emph>rich</emph> without it?' A
                  great many ministers of the gospel are, I imagine, heavy dealers, with tho
                  money-king jobber. I have met a large number who seemed absolutely posioned with
                  the idea of making money in their profession. They will descent on the subject of
                  salary beyond all its just proportions, and make you half sick with their
                  calculations and estimates."</p>
               <p>"It is undoubtedly the folly of many of us to be too eager for the 'pay' of our
                  professions."</p>
               <p>"We shall all be paid, Marshall, if we are faithful, even in the least, at the
                  great universal reward-day. Having a Master in whom we can trust, we can well<pb
                     n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6389-00000128"/> afford to wait, and, as Baxter said,
                  'Give away much and need little, living frugally on a little.'"</p>
               <p>Here the conversation, for the time, was dropped. Marshall went into the school,
                  as the bell was ringing, and Castlereagh sought his study.</p>

                              occupied much of your thought. I am happy that one so well calculated,
                              as I deem yourself, to carry out a design of this nature when once
                              undertaken, has the subject under advisement, for the cause of
                              education, in our time, is one of paramount importance and
                              embarrassment, which minds of the highest culture, and men of great
                              firmness and excellent judgment alone can meet and rescue from its
                              difficulties. You ask my opinion as to the desirableness of connecting
                              the two departments in one, or whether it may not be best to give your
                              attention to one sex only? And you also inquire if the care of the
                              school is any very material addition to my other duties? To these
                              question, turning only a passing glance or two, I answer the first of
                              them as follows. If your plan is to furnish a common school for<pb
                                 n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6389-00000129"/> the good of the families of
                              the town of Madison, by all means make it an institution for both
                              sexes. If it is more particularly for your own benefit, and ideal, and
                              has reference to a boarding plan almost, if not entirely, then I would
                              have it for one sex alone. You will need more expensive and enlarged
                              premises, peculiarly constructed, where it is otherwise, and more than
                              double sets of hands. The respect for the school may also be easily
                              lost under this last arrangement, and one's own careless ease and
                              comfort must be greatly endangered. He can not but have a great
                              anxiety of mind for his two classes of pupils brought hourly into so
                              familiar relations. I should point you to the excellent female school
                              at Hadley, commonly known as the Mount Holyoke Seminary, in
                              confirmation of the idea that one sex is better arranged thus by
                              itself, than in company, where a certain course of study is desirable;
                              and so to our colleges and high-schools generally, where boys and
                              young men are educated. But you are familiar with these, and I have
                              leave the subject.</p>
                           <p>"As to the other question, my answer may be found when I have sone. I
                              begin by saying, in general, the care of my school <emph>does</emph>
                              add materially to my other duties, by a great confinement to it, and
                              aborption in it of my mind. I came hither from the good old rural town
                              of Richmond, partly to do good, and partly to find relief from
                              exhausting labors. I also anticipated some pecuniary advantage to
                              myself and family from the Institute. I have found my time as much
                              occupied here as it was there. Indeed, my labors, although of a
                              different nature, ar manifold more than ever, while my anxiety
                              respecting the welfare of the school, mentally, morally, physically,
                              and pecuniarily, increases hourly. In the beleif that much time would
                              necessarily be called for by my connection with the school, it was
                              agreed, at my settlement, on the part of the Society, that I might
                              employ myself about the Institution as much as its interests might
                              seem to require. But I little deemed how much this would, in the end,
                              cover—how many hour it would sever me from my people—how greatly it
                              would affect my ministry—how absorbing, in a word, it would
                              become.</p>
                           <p>"You must look at things as they are, and not as you might wish them,
                              if you are thinking of an enterprise similar to mine. I feel deeply
                              interested in the subject—in my own work—and gratified with many of
                              its issues already raeached, but I am more fully than at first
                              acquainted with its cost.</p>
                           <p>"Your time will be in a great measure absorbed by the school. It does
                              seem to be as easy a matter now-a-days for a clergyman to teach, and
                              also fulfill the duties of his parish as it once was. You know very
                              well that the Rev. Dr. Bellamy, and the Rev. Dr. Smith, and Rev. Dr.
                              Porter, as well as scores besides them, gave instruction to
                              theological students and others. Dr. Porter, however, so says his
                              biographer,'suffered greatly in health from superadding the labor of
                                 giving<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6389-00000130"/> instruction to
                              youth, and afterward to theological students.' But the education of
                              the youth around them has always seemed to be a prime object, and a
                              common practice among clergymen, who formerly performed the duty with
                              much less apparent trial and distraction of mind, than the same may
                              now be performed. This is chiefly explained, I think, by the
                              simplicity of manners in past times. They neither gave nor expected to
                              receive then, as much attention to mere physical comfort and
                              convenience as they now do, and consequently there was more time, not
                              otherwise wasted and frittered away, to be devoted to the simple
                              object of study. But now we have no longer the plain simple red
                              school-house, or gambrel-roofed parsonage. You must construct a large
                              boarding-house three or four stories high, forty feet square, or
                              mayhap fifity by seventy, with a karge wing having basement rooms
                              throughout for various convenience of the establishment, for etc.,
                              etc., You must warm the entire edifice with furnaces, every room must
                              be comfortable. You must have a large gymnasia and other convenient
                              ranges of buildings. You can not lay out too much expense on your
                              grounds, nor exhibit too much taste in your arrangements. All these
                              require a great amount of help, and much oversight. In your
                              school-rooms, the utmost attention must be paid to classifying the
                              scholars, attending to their manners and progress. You must provide
                              every accomodation, patent seats and desks. If seats are cushioned and
                              the floors carpeted, the parents will not utter a word of complaint.
                              Your teachers and assistants must comprise a selection of the most
                              talented of every nation and college in the country. You must provide
                              all the text-books, all stationary, keep an account with every pupil
                              from three cents upward, furnishing him just as little as you can, and
                              just as much as he wants. I have to-day been interrupted in all my
                              studies by applications of this sort. A rap at the door of the
                              study—</p>

                           <p>"Again the door id opened, and two little girls come to inquire if I
                              will let each of them have three sheets of my pretty note-paper.
                              Presently a boy comes to buy a lead-pencil, and another to get a new
                              inkstand. Another to borrow my Porter's Rhetorical Reader. Then comes
                              a young miss from her teacher with a large pile of recent

                              waste, improvidence every where, and endeavour to figure up the cost
                              in a round bill at the close. To make out your bills you need a
                              fortnight's close attention. Put your sermons and parish all aside and
                              go about them. Look over your teacher's items of charges. Transfer
                              them to hour regular day-book. Put every item down. Run from your

                           <p>"Many, many thanks for your long epistle, in reply to mine. But for
                              its timely arrival and instruction, I much fear that I should have
                              involved myself in an enterprise which, in my present nervous debility
                              and general physical prostration, would have been my ruin. The people
                              of my parish, and of this community generally, urged me to undertake a
                              work here similar to your own, and offered me every desirable
                              assistance. But after reading over your letter, I at once saw the
                              peril of the undertaking. I realized as just before me a perfect loss
                              of all quiet in my study, and a great secular absorption of my mind,
                              and estrangement from my parish. All the good I might hope to
                              accomplish would be met by some corresponding civil, and indeed,
                              another person might better accomplish the good, without the evil. So
                              I resolutely threw away the temptation, and informed my society what
                              the reasons were that influenced me. Most of them appreciated my
                              motives; and now, with two hundred dollars added to my salary, I am
                              contented to devote my whole time to the good of my affectionate and
                              beloved people.<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6389-00000132"/> Our
                              citizens have now subscribed ten thousand dollars for the purpose of
                              erecting a fine edifice for a graded school, with all the desirable
                              modern improvements, and have secured an accomplished scholar as its
                              Principal. After your kind letter to me, that opened my eyes on the
                              harassing nature of the service I proposed to enter on, I shall be
                              thankful enough if my connection with the school may diminish down to
                              an occasional visitor, or, at most, that of a standing official,

               <p>WHEN the short Christmas and New Year's vacation expired, Henrietta returned,
                  bringing her youthful and only sister with her, to pass the winder and study
                  music, a remarkable fondness for which she had always exhibited, and as a young
                  lady singer, was greatly admired among all her acquaintances. She was accomplished
                  in all the branches of study common in her times, and possessed a mind singularly
                  tranquil and well-balanced. She was not free from an ideal of life that required
                  of her, vigorous and consecutive exertion and devotion; but the stranger would not
                  have noticed through her pale features, so remarkably in repose, any indication of
                  passionate enthusiasm for even her favorite study of music, much less for any
                  other mental pursuit. Yet Abbie had nothing of languor or dullness in her nature,
                  and in her daily attention to every duty, evinced the high qualities of industry,
                  and perseverance, in close affinity to a correct taste, and an uncommon
                  appreciation of every privilege. Being introduced into the family of Castlereagh,
                  she immediately commanded<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6389-00000133"/> the highest
                  esteem and attachment. Herself some what retiring, she derived assistance from the
                  easy freedom of Henrietta and her longer acquaintance at the Institute. She
                  entered upon her musical course without any unnecessary delay, and, as regularly
                  as the day came, devoted six hours to her practice. This was all she attempted in
                  the way of close study. About two or three hours she devoted to reading and an
                  occasional pencil sketch; the remainder of the day was given to exercise,
                  conversation, and amusement. Before many weeks passed away, it was generally
                  acknowledged that her progress in music such as to destroy all hope of rivalry;
                  and the prize, before hand, was adjudged to her by her companions. Between her and
                  Eleanor there sprang up a very intimate companionship; and she not unfrequently
                  contributed an anonymous article to the "Casket," which the latter and two other
                  young ladies, assisted by Fitz Maurice, Edger, Eaton, a fine Latin scholar among
                  the day-pupils, and Harry Otis prepared once in two weeks for the seminary. Every
                  one admired her graceful person and easy carriage. Castlereagh studied her pale,
                  intellectual fore head with ever-increasing interest, and formed for her high
                  anticipations as a scholar. He was proud of his young cousin, and especially
                  gratified to observe in her serious and decided regard for religious and more
                  principle.</p>
               <p>It was now-mid-winter. The bleak snow storms frequently raged, and high winds
                  whirled the snow into mountain-ridges along the road-sides and fences. But this
                  only gave the boys of the school the keener enjoyment. They leaped from the
                  fences, accomplishing a complete somerset in the air, into the deep snow; they
                  laid them down with outstretched arms upon it; they rolled over; they stood on
                  their heads; they crept into it; they made them houses and forts. They fought,
                  conquered, plundered—were then in their turn routed, and led away to prison. They
                  coasted down long and steep hills; they harnessed themselves to sleds, and drew
                  each other, especially rattling away at great speed with little Hobbie or Johnnie
                  on the sled. With glowing cheeks and panting lungs, and sportive eyes, they then
                  came rushing through showers of snow-balls to the school-room, when the
                  ever-thoughtful bell cried out them: <q>

                  winter term brings along with it much sport in the snow, and much inconvenience,
                  many a cough. Snow and wet in the halls, ice on the<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000134"/> windows, and doors, deep mud along the streets and
                  walks as the snow dissolves and the rains fall, cold rooms, shivering limbs,
                  stampting feet, blue lips, and chattering teeth.</p>
               <p>By and by the last days of February come. And then March. The days and nights are
                  equal; spring is near, and yet winter often lingers into April, coming back
                  suddenly with a foot of snow upon the newly spaded garden, and otherwhelming the
                  sweet spring robins with his fierce storms.</p>
               <p>Many are the sleigh-rides, as winter yet lingers, that the bright moon witnesses.
                  And many are the carriage drives by "Express" and other notable steeds that
                  Marshall projects and accomplishes, now with this lady of the family, and now with
                  that, when the snow is dissolved from the streets. Castlereagh's own younger
                  sister, Ann Eliza, passes the winter at the seminary in the capacity of an
                  assistant in music. She is of a jovial temper, witty, wary, playful; and Marshall
                  rambles away often with her a long distance on foot, or they ride together merrily
                  chatting out the evening hours, or they almost devour each other with hostile
                  political assults. Castlereagh hardly knows what view to take of such definitive
                  attentions. He is at length persuaded that it may be wise to take no view of them
                  but friendship's. Yet he would advise Ann Eliza jost less—to make less mirth over
                  a matter so important as a real gentlemen's attentions. In fact, Castlereagh has a
                  great regard for Mr. Idem, and himself would not object to calling him brother. He
                  fancies, however, that sister Ann Eliza has never thought <emph>his</emph>
                  thought, and keeps wondering at it. By and by he imagines that Henrietta herself
                  has thrown over him the silken cord, and that the bird is hers. Anon, that the
                  gentle Abbie has shot the love's arrow to his heart, and wounded him to death!
                  Stranger still, that she who always vexes him in his politics, and compels him to
                  wait on her when he can not well spare the time or money, the studious Eleanor,
                  has won his idolatry. Be these as they may. One evening, unexpectedly dark, she
                  accompanied Marshall in a carriage to the city, to hear the celebrated Mr. ——
                  deliver a lecture in the public hall. Returning home at a moderate rate, in the
                  very great gloom that prevailed, suddenly the wheels of the carriage interlocked
                  with another driving in the opposite direction, and, immediately, horses, wheels,
                  and shafts, were broken or released, and our two friends, and the persons with the
                  other vehicle, came near being hurled to the ground. This was an unexpected and
                  woeful dilemma to be in; but, at length, the party were able to reach home by
                  another conveyance. Many a good jest this furnished the young ladies at Marshall's
                  expense, who never failed to attribute their escape from a more serious accident
                  to the excellent qualities of the horse, "who," he said "moved at a slow and wary
                  step through the darksome street." Castlereagh was not taken into the secret at
                  all, Marshall affirming that it<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6389-00000135"/> was a
                  very slight affair, unworthy to be added to his burdens of care and vaxation. He
                  at length made the discovery of the secret, and Marshall did not hear the last of
                  it, certainly till spring. "Bless my stars!" said Ann Eliza; "what an awful
                  occurrence. How ought I to be glad that I was not there!"</p>
               <p>"Sure enough!" responded Henritta—"What should <emph>I</emph> have done?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Our</emph> stars were indeed favorable," said Abbie; "we can not be too
                  grateful."</p>
               <p>No, nor was Eleanor; for the occurrence led her to see, in the real alarm for her
                  safety, and anxiety that he displayed on her account, the true feelings of his
                  heart toward her. She did not say so, but, in reality, "blessed her stars" that
                  she was there to feel, beating for her, a heart she had long known as the home of
                  every generous and noble sentiment, and to enjoy the after-memory of the
                  condidence his words awoke in her own heart, when he spoke calmly to her, saying,
                  "You need not fear, no one seems to be injured in either carriage, and we shall be
                  able soon to resume our ride."</p>
               <p>One day, when at dinner, Castlereagh was called into the parlor to see a gentlemen
                  who had at that moment made his appearence. Entering the room, the gentlemen, who
                  appeared about thirty-five years of age, of medium size, rather slightly made,
                  with a somewhat languid expression, rose to meet and salute him. He was neither
                  very graceful nor awkward, but quite self-assured, and immediately began a
                  conversation, which ran as follows:—</p>

                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>You have a school here?</p>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, sir; we have a few boarding-pupils.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>So I suppose.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>Can you accommodate another?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>We might, perhaps, although our rooms are nearly, or quite occupied.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>I am from Virginia, sir; and have come to the North on this matter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Quite a distance from home to place a child, my dear sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>It is indeed. I never was so far from home before, my self. What are your
                     conditions?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>The price of admission?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. I suppose so.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Two hundred dollars a year, without extra studies.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't want any extras, as I know of; but plain learning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Is your child a son or a daughter?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>

                     <hi rend="i"/>(Who looked up rather wild and disconcerted.) You mistake, sir,
                     perhaps. It is I who wish to come to your school.</p>

                     thought—ah, very well, sir;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6389-00000136"/> rather
                     larger than most of my pupils—and, excuse me, I was certainly impressed with
                     the idea that you were older than you probably are.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>No consequence, sir. I am eighteen."</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Eighteen! good sir! excuse me; you Southern gentlemen sometimes have an older
                     look than really belongs to you.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I have, I s'pose got browned up some, tending the nigurs. The old
                     gentleman has kept me at it for these four or five years, and now says I must
                     go and learn something else, though nigur-tending is enough for a man if he has
                     a little learning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you have not been much at school of late, sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>Never went at all. I have helped the old man take care of the plantation and
                     nigurs, and, like other boys around us, have learned what I know from hearing
                     folks converse; and from my mother, who is now dead some four years.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>I take it you have a tolerable knowledge of reading, arithmetic, geography, and
                     so forth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I have a little, though.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cast.</speaker>
                  <p>You can read?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stranger.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, yes—slowly.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Castlereagh looked at the young man with feelings he had never before experienced.
                  Here was the son of a rich Southern planter, who, after the death of a good
                  mother, had been, till he was eighteen or twenty years of age, employed in the
                  care of negroes, to the utter neglect of his education—one who, if he could even
                  read and write, hardly knew enough of either to affirm it, and now, alone, had
                  come among strangers to repair this ruin of his nature, by a course of study which
                  at the first must place him, though a man grown, in the A B C itself of the
                  Seminary. Castlereagh asked him if he had letters of introduction. He answered,
                  "Yes, he believed so, in his trunks, but he cared little for them, as he had
                     <emph>the cash,</emph> and supposed that would be better than any letters he
                  could bring."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh declined receiving him as a boarder, but procured him an excellent
                  place in another family, where he could study with less interruption than among
                  his own boarding-scholars, who were all far in advance of him, and he was received
                  into the Seminary. On the second day, however, he came with a rueful countenance
                  to Castlereagh, saying that he did n't like the confinement of a school-room, and
                  believed he should return to Virginia. He left, accordingly, and Castlereagh never
                  saw him afterward.</p>
               <p>Distant from Lindendale a long, weary travel, is the beautiful town of S——. There,
                  in a darkened room, where, with careful tread, as with muffled feet, parents,
                  brothers and sisters move, and hardly breathe, and speak by signs and in softest
                  voices, a pale, emaciated, yet calm and hopeful Christian sufferer goes to her
                  rest. The sunny morning of her life has hardly passed,<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000137"/> yet is she called away. A father, whose gray hairs
                  give him a venerable aspect—whose fond and confiding child she is—bows over her
                  pillow, and takes it hard that she must be removed forever from his sight, and the
                  endearing love that he has cherished for her; that so much goodness, mildness,
                  gentleness and affection must needs be obscured, just when the brightness thereof
                  began, with its sweet and lovely radiance, to illumine home, and to fill every
                  heart with love. But she has words—few, faint, and hard to utter—which she speaks
                  for his comfort. And she says to him, "Father, weep not. I am going before you but
                  a short time. We will meet again. I wait for you in the bright world of glory. I
                  shall be there; thou and these, here. We are not far off the one from the other.
                  No, no, no—nor can be. I am sad to leave you weeping. But there is no real choice
                  left me. My heart is all with Christ. If I had a thousand hearts, I could but give
                  them to my Saviour. Father, mother, sisters, brothers,
                  farewell—farewell—farewell!". Then fainting, it was long ere they succeeded in
                  reviving her. She slept a little, and awoke. Still she was near her end.</p>
               <p>"Mother—Rosetta," said she, "you hold me in your hands and arms. Let me die close
                  to your hearts, that you may always think of me—that I may think of you, the last
                  earthly friends I wish to forget, when I cast off this mortal and perishable mold.
                  Sister?"</p>
               <p>"What, my dear?" inquired she.</p>
               <p>"You know my love for the dear Castlereaghs, especially for Mrs. Castlereagh, that
                  I loved and prized her dearly—next even to yourself and mother, dear. Take then
                  the fragment of a letter, which I began to writ to her in January last, and have
                  never finished. Send it, with my dearest love—my last, long, eternal love to her.
                  Will you, dear?"</p>
               <p>"I will. Oh, sister, yes, yes—every thing. But would that you need not leave us.
                  How <emph>can</emph> we live alone—without you?"</p>
               <p>"Dear sister, I shall not be far away. I hope to be near you till we all get over
                  the dark river. I love you—even in my death hour; and thus I throw my arms in one
                  more affectionate embrace around you." And the sisters wept.</p>
               <p>When the evening came, she died. This was the early death of the reader's friend
                  and old acqauintance, Miss Merrick. Not a purer heart ever beat in humankind than
                  hers. She was gentle and calm, yet firm; she was judicious, yet sympathetic; she
                  was affectionate without being simple or weak. He principles were studied out of
                  the example and gospel of Christ, her commonest pursuits being a constant
                  preparation for her departure hence; so that for her to live was Christ, to die
                  was gain.</p>
               <p>When the news came to Lindendale, the shole family were convulsed with grief.
                  Castlereagh wrung his hands in anguish of mind, packing his room, and exclaiming,
                  "Would that the kind angel had but sent one<pb n="266-267"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000138"/> precious lock, or word of personal remembrance to
                  me! She could not have known how deeply in my heart I prized her—how it has been
                  ever my highest wish to serve her. And now she has pined away—and died, and I have
                  known it not—I, who would have gone to her bedside to have kneeled down and
                  blessed her, and hear her voice, and pray for her gentle release;—gone, gone, gone
                  is she, and we shall meet no more below."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh and Sarah Matilda mourned over her departure long and sadly. for she
                  was endeared to them even as a sister. When Castlereagh mentioned the
                  circumstances on the following morning to the school, many an eye was filled with
                  tears, and some of her old pupils buried their faces in their handkerchiefs, and
                  sobbed aloud. They believed, every one of them, however. that she had fone to an
                  eternal rest, to be forever with the Saviour, whom she loved. and whom, when on
                  earth, she honored by her consistent, blameless conversation and example.</p>
               <p>Who should come out from the city the very next day but Gustavus? He came to take
                  tea, and walk back to his room after dark. The sad news of the previous day, when
                  communicated to him, deeply saddened his mind. He recalled their common duties in
                  the school when residing at the Institute, the many agreeable walks they had taken
                  together, her confidence, her goodness, her truth, and mourned over her with
                  sincere grief. "And yet," said he, "it is a glorious and a thrice-desirable
                  release. I would not offer, were it in my power, a bribe to Death, to restore her
                  to us. She is far too happy in heaven to incite even a wish in us that she might
                  again become an inhabitant of earth, sin-stricken and perishable as it is. My
                  grief is all allayed as I think of her unspeakable reward in the kingdom of God
                  above."</p>
               <p>These remarks, so appropriately offered by Gustavus, had their immediate and
                  desirable effect even on the mind of Castlereagh himself, who from this moment
                  took the consolatory Christian view of this unexpected event, and found if capable
                  of diffusing an unspeakable calmness and resignation over his entire being,
                  although it was in his heart long time to mourn the early death of Miss Ellen
                  Irving Merrick.<ref rend="super" target="#note_012" xml:id="return_012">*</ref>

               <head type="sub">EXCURSION UP THE MOUNTAIN—THE CAVE.</head>
               <p>HENRIETTA Ann Eliza, Gertrude, Abbie, Eleanor, accompanied by Castlereagh,
                  Marshall, and two or three of the younger boys, including Johnnie and Hobbie,
                  availed themselves of a bright Wednesday afternoon early in April, the snow having
                  disappeared, and the school being over for the day, to climb the Rock. They
                  ascended by the Seminary path. Finding itgreatly obstructed here and there by
                  large broken rocks and fallen branches of trees, Castlereagh's first thought was
                  that the winter's storm had broken down the trees, and the combined frost and heat
                  had loosened the rock.</p>
               <p>"What in the world does this all mean?" he at length inquired. "It is almost
                  impossible for our ladies to climb up here. Why, Marshall, I had no idea of
                  finding our excellent path in such a condition after the winter."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, I think that I can explain it," her replied; "although until now I did
                  not know it had received so much injury. The plight in which you find it is owing
                  to a misdemeanor of mine, I fear."</p>
               <p>"Ah! How so?"</p>
               <p>"Well, one day Erastus and myself having provided ourselves with some very stout
                  levers, clambered up the steep sides of the mountain, and where we found a huge
                  boulder that we could move, or a loosned fragment of a columnar projection, we
                  threw it over, and sent it bounding, roaring, and crashing into the wilds below.
                  And I remember that somewhere in this very neighborhood we found several large
                  rocks that we had no great difficulty in removing, and the high excitement we
                  enjoyed in seeing them roll down like great elephants, bounding from cliff to
                  cliff, till they made the final plunge, and then sending up a roar that echoed
                  like the thunders all around the base of the mountain. And we saw them frequently
                  in their descent strike a tree of considerable size, and crush it down before them
                  as if it had been made of clay. I think this bad state of things is really owing
                  to our folly."</p>
               <p>"That explains it," said Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"But don't remove the obstacles!" said Eleanor.</p>
               <p>"No one!" said Gertrude.</p>
               <p>"How shall we get up this steep place?" inquired Henrietta. "Poor Abbie, you never
                  can climb this ridge; it is impossible!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, fie! 'Retta," she replied; "I an not an invalid. I am very little lame; you
                  shall see me go where you can."</p>
               <p>"But I can't get over this great trunk of a tree. See it lies directly across an
                  up-hill and rocky path."</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6389-00000140"/>
               <p>"Well, there go the boys full of glee. The gentlemen will help us over somehow.
                  There goes Gertrude laughing and shouting. Now Eleanor is borne up over the
                  steepest place, and with a bound she is safe. Shall I try it, Mr.
                  Castlereagh?"</p>
               <p>"If you please; there—steady—spring! Away you go; and so goes Miss Henrietta—one,
                  two, three, and away; and where, Where is Ann ELiza?"</p>
               <p>"Here I am, brother!" shouted she, in a merry voice, far up the mountain, where
                  like a bird, she had flown without path, or help, or guide.</p>
               <p>Immediately Marshall scaled the rocks, and stood by her side. "Why Miss
                  Castlereagh," said he, "how could you reach this dangerous point in safety—the
                  least mis-step might have precipitated you down among these ragged points fifty or
                  a hundred feet."</p>
               <p>"Oh, fie, Mr. Marshall, I care not for danger, nor think of it. I have always run
                  among the mountains and wild hills of my native town, and can climb them in
                  perfect safety. Look here from this wild point into the valley at our feet. Is not
                  that winding stream sweetly picturesque and delightful? See, it rushes over the
                  rocks, and courses along at the base of the mountain, along by the dwellings and
                  workshops, here and there expanding into glassy ponds or lakes, and then
                  gracefully falling into a wide sheet over the dam that restrains it, winding
                  around a rocky point, disappearing for a moment behind a clump of thick cedars,
                  then again coming to view and shooting rapidly over its rocky channel into another
                  deep and dark pond, to be again cast over another dam, or turned aside through a
                  canal to whirl the machinery of a mill. Thus it flows on till escapes into the far
                  spreading lowlands that stretch away to the Sea. I love intensely a scene so
                  beautiful and vareigatd as the one before us; the stream, the village with its
                  houses, and spires, and streets, and driven vehicles, and murmuring voices."</p>
               <p>"It is lovely," said he; "there is nothing better unless the sea-shore, and the
                  rolling and roaring of the waves."</p>
               <p>"Oh! that is something horrible," said she. "I fancy I hear in it the wailings of
                  doomed and drowning beings."</p>
               <p>"Oh! the sea is magnificent, Miss Castlereagh! I have no fears of it, no more than
                  of your little creeks and rivers that hurt nobody. I love the roaring of the
                  sea-waves, and the swell of the ocean toward the shore. I would rather still round
                  Cape Horn in a gale than in a Calm. I am never afraid of the sea or water in any
                  shape—it is my element."</p>
               <p>"I dare say you were never born to be hanged," said she, laughing. "You are the
                  most inverterate lover of the sea that I ever knew."</p>
               <p>"You love the rocks, and the picturesque in nature, because you were reared among
                  the glorious hills of the North: I, who was born within sight of the crested
                  sea-waves, and played with the tide-waters in my childhood's years, caught there
                  an inspiration seawise<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6389-00000141"/> wise that I find
                  myself still cherishing wherever I am and whatever I may do."</p>
               <p>"I think you have given for your preference and admiration a very appropriate and
                  convincing explanation," said she; "and I have great love for the
                     <emph>smooth</emph> sea, and for voyages to Europe and elsewhere, that are even
                  accomplished with an approximation to danger, and the whirl of storms, but they
                  must not be truly alarming to any body, although full of incidents."</p>
               <p>"Romance, romance—fiction!" said he. "The sea is rough by nature, and his way is
                  dark, sublime, and earnest. The very sunshine of ocean life is magnificent—you can
                  hardly call it beautiful. The play-days on the sea are great anniversaries of the
                  rude elements, the storm-days are the primeval brotherhood of chaos and old
                  night—an approximation backward to the 'BEGINNING,' when the heavens and the earth
                  were made, and Light first cast his sheen upon nature."</p>
               <p>"You are eloquent, Mr. Marshall, but you really terrify me. Why, I shall never
                  dare to sail on the ocean, even to meet with one of its bright, smiling, sunny
                  calms, much less to encounter one of its ugly storms. No, no; I have no relish for
                  returning any where into the neighborhood of old 'Chaos and Ancient Night.'"</p>
               <p>Before Marshall could reply, a loud shout from the party far above them turned
                  their attention, and they heard the rumbling and crashing of a rock that, in
                  ignorance of the situation of those below, had thoughtlessly lessly been loosened
                  and sent on its whirling and crazy mission down the mountain. Although two hundred
                  feet above them, it would reach the point where they were in a few seconds.
                  Marshall knew, from the course it appeared to be taking, they were in great
                  danger. At the same instant Ann Eliza comprehended the peril they were in, and
                  sent up a shriek that, being heard above the crashing of the falling rock, called,
                  for the first time, the attention of Castlereagh and the whole of his party, to
                  the danger in which they had unintentionally involved them. A wild cry of alarm
                  from every one around him followed this discovery, and in the track of the
                  descending ruin, reckless of his own danger, he rushed to their rescue. But
                  Castlereagh's flight was far outran by the impetuous descent of the huge fragment,
                  and had it not been for the presence of mind of our two friends, he had come but
                  to see their mutilated and quivering limbs thrown far down into the rocky bed
                  below. The shriek of Ann Eliza was followed by a spring from the point she
                  occupied to a more elevated projection, slightly withdrawn from the pathway
                  natural to the rushing rock, and having a sharp spur of its own at right angles
                  with the line in which the bolt was coming. She was safe the moment she reached
                  this projection, and grasping firmly on an overhanging branch, swung herself quite
                  to its highest point, ten or fifteen feet higher than the table-rock which, a
                  moment previous, she had been, as she supposed, safely occupying. Marshall, at the
                  first, had<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6389-00000142"/> turned to seize her in his
                  arms and bear her from the danger, but her sudden movement prevented him, and as
                  he hesitated for a moment, while he watched the success of her effort, the rock
                  came so near him that he had barely time to throw himself off the ledge and alight
                  under its shelving cover, six or eight feet below, before the huge fragment, with
                  a bound of twenty feet, struck on the very place he had left, with a terrific
                  crash, and in severed, angry, smoking pieces, by various routes, passed safely by
                  him into the great basin of fallen rocks beneath. In another moment Marshall had
                  sprung again to his feet, and climbing to where Ann Eliza had escaped, he found
                  her pale and quivering with terror, and speechless with that intense feeling of
                  gratitude which a surprising deliverance from great peril is well known to
                  produce.</p>
               <p>"Courage, courage!" cried he. "We are safe."</p>
               <p>The next moment, and Castlereagh, wild with terror, flung himself fromt the rocks
                  above, and caught her in his arms.</p>
               <p>"We are all safe, sir—safe, wholly so," cried Marshall, observing how intense was
                  the excitement of his friend.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, sir—speak, Eliza; are you unhurt?"</p>
               <p>She rolled her eyes on him with deep affection, and whispered, "Safe."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" said he. "What inconsideration in us to roll down that block of
                  trap-rock directly upon you. Where did you stand, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Right on yonder narrow shelf, where the wild beast struck his fore-feet in
                  springing for his prey, but too late, as you see, and you can now hear his echoes
                  rolling round the mountain, as he dies in the valley from his wounds."</p>
               <p>The whole party were now gathered together, and Ann Eliza, recovered in a great
                  measure from the shock, refused to give up the ramble or to let one of the party
                  return home with her.</p>
               <p>"I am always meeting with incidents in my life," said she, "and am prepared for
                  them."</p>
               <p>Eleanor was unusually pale and excited. Marshall offered her his arm and hand to
                  help her along where the way was difficult.</p>
               <p>"Where were you?" she inquired of him "when the rock went by. You were not on the
                  same point with Miss Castlereagh?"</p>
               <p>"No," said he; "when I saw that she was safe, I leaped on to a projection below,
                  and crept under a shelving rock, just in time to hear it say 'WHANG, O!' directly
                  above my head, and see it leap frantic and in vain, after me into the empty air."
                  Eleanor grasped him more firmly by the arm:</p>
               <p>"Why!" exclaimed she, "how very near!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, not very; certainly not within six feet, and I positively safe."</p>
               <p>"Let this be a warning to us all," said Castlereagh, when they were fairly up the
                  mountain. "Let us be very careful hereafter never to roll stones down the rock
                  when any one is below us; nor in any place where<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000143"/> we can not see from the summit to the bottom, and
                  so be sure that no one is near, and in danger of being hurt. A little thoughtless
                  pleasure on our part, undertaking without regard to others, has come near making
                  us all more or less miserable for life. Thus far extend, not unfrequently, actions
                  that in themselves appear but very trifling."</p>
               <p>The party now hurried on, and soon reached the very remarkable "CAVE," in a huge,
                  riven boulder, to which early in our narrative, Fitz Maurice had conducted Sarah
                  Matilda.</p>
               <p>The reader should peruse the veritable history of this cave, by a departed worthy
                  of a renowned college of our land, entitled "STILES'S JUDGES," if he would become
                  impressed with its importance in the annals of the past. He will learn that at
                  least two renowned men, judges of a foreign king who was brought to the block,
                  once men of valor in the army of the great PROTECTOR, were sheltered in it from
                  the storms of the heavens and the search-warrants of the Restoration. This cave,
                  situated on the very summit of a mountain range, solitary and dreary, distant from
                  the city—not in the pathway of ordinary life—has been visited by <hi rend="i"
                  />Scholastics of Europe and America. Students, youthful scholastici of many a
                  class and college in the land, have paid their duty to the remarkable pile! They
                  have climbed up its dangerous, slippery sides, and leaped its yawning vortici.
                  Their names, with iron chisels, they have scarred deep into its unyielding sides,
                  and on its crest, names that will long defy the power of the elements—long
                  initialize them after they have themselves perished. Young men and maidens make
                  the distant boulder-cave of the regicides the end of their long ramble; nor
                  satisfied are they till, with tangled, torn, and draggled garments, they have sat
                  down on the crazy summit.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh led his young partly homeward by a north-easterly route, going down on
                  the eastern slope of the mountain to an old forsaken stone house, with a very
                  dreary, dilapidated look; the grounds around it overgrown with wild mountain
                  shrubs and bushes, and looking extremely desolate and forlorn. The party were
                  almost afraid to stop, and look into its desolate rooms, old as it was, and open
                  to the winds and storms of heaven. It seemed more like a shelter for the mountain
                  flocks, and a wild refuge for owls and bats than for any thing human—any being of
                  reason, learning, name, and refinement. "And yet," said Castlereagh, as they
                  expressed their surprise that any one ever should have occupied it, "here, in this
                  very house, and on those very grounds at one time, a family second to almost none
                  in this State, for pride, character, and position, had its home! Here, a learned
                  president of yonder college, paid his addresses to the damsel who became his wife;
                  this is the very mansion once occupied by the proud family of the HUBBARDS.<ref

                  President of Yale College, the learned author, the great scholar, roved among
                  grounds, cultivated with care, where the sweetest roses bloomed, and wandered side
                  by side, with the bright being of his heart's idolatry. Here many a gay scene has
                  been transacted, the hospitable mansion illumined till midnight for the enjoyment
                  of the numerous guests. Here, men on gayly caparisoned steeds, have galloped to
                  the headquarters of their chief. Here, ladies and gentlemen have met, and dined,

                  crumbled and forsaken, black with age, and rust, and moth, one of the central
                  houses of music, poetry, and eloquence. So fades the glory of the world."</p>
               <p>The party sauntered along homeward by the side of a sweet creek, on the east side
                  of the mountain, Hobbie declaring he was not tired a bit; and by and by, reaching
                  the village, they called at the post-office for letters, and soon reached their
                  home. The first stars of the evening were just appearing as they crossed the
                  threshold, and the bell was directly rung for tea.</p>
               <p>Sarah Matilda pressed her two boys to her heart, and said, "I know you are very
                  tired, children."</p>
               <p>"No, mother," said Hobbie; "only a little bit."</p>
               <p>"I am sort of tired, mother," said Johnnie.</p>
               <p>"I know you are by your looks, my son. But perhaps a good supper will restore
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mrs. Castlereagh," siad Henrietta, "I am very sorry that you were not with
                  us—we have had a most interesting and delightful ramble."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry that I could not go; but I have had company half the afternoon, and
                  been very much occupied the other half. Well, young ladies, tea waits for
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Oh! can't you excuse me, Mrs. Castlereagh?" said Abbie, sinking into a chair. "It
                  seems to me I never was so much fatigued in my life."</p>
               <p>The poor girl was really suffering from exhaustion, and Henrietta expressed her
                  fears that the walk had been too much for her. In a little time, however, the
                  whole company were seated at the table, and the supper hour was enlivened by a
                  recapitulation of the ramble, the events and scenes of the afternoon. Every one
                  congratulated Ann Eliza and Marshall on their Providential escape.</p>
               <p>"It was a thrilling affair," said Castlereagh to his wife.</p>
               <p>"It must have been an almost fatal one," she replied.</p>
               <p>"It won''t happen again in a hundred years," said Marshall.</p>
               <p>"Now that it is all past," said Ann Eliza, "I certainly do wonder how I escaped. I
                  am sure I could not a second time."</p>
               <p>"If I might be allowed to use such an expression," said Marshall, "it was really
                  very much like dodging a thunder-bolt."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Castlereagh; "it was a providential escape. Let us be thankful."</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6389-00000145"/>
               <p>"Fader," said Hobbie, "I am a glad there ain't any more hills and mountains there
                  is, to kill folks."</p>
               <p>"It is a very good remark, my son," said he, as the table was inclined to be merry
                  over Hobbs's smart speech.</p>
               <p>"Father," says Johnnie, inquiringly; "do you think any body <emph>was</emph> ever
                  quite killed in this way?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know, Johnnie, what to say. It looks rather that in some such way
                  persons may have been struck down and killed."</p>
               <p>"I know it looks 'reasonable,'" said he; "but I don't remember as I ever heard of
                  any body—"</p>
               <p>"Come putty near it to-day, any how, did n't they, fader?" says Hobbie.</p>
               <p>"Very, my son—very near, indeed."</p>
               <p>After prayer, an hour was spent in music. The boys and girls played a few pieces.
                  Gertrude and Ann Eliza also played; Johnnie played a duett with his mother, who
                  then gave the company some good songs, making her husband sing with her "The

               <p>IN two weeks the term would close. The principal examination of the year was
                  connected with the end of this term, and the scholars were required to go over
                  their studies carefully, and prepare themselves for the great trial. It was to
                  continue two days; and Monday evening was also included for declamation,
                  compositions and music, when the whole village of Lindenvale would turn out to see
                  and hear.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the French pupils reviewed, the Latin scholars, the mathematical
                  classes, from the highest to the lowest, the classes in astronomy, philosophy,
                  physiology, geography, grammar, history, reading, writing, spelling—all reviewed.
                  The pupils in drawing retouched, or hurried up their pieces; the music scholars
                  gave more time to their practice, and prepared themselves to sing and play, with
                  unusual effect, their favorite waltzes, schottisches, quadrilles and songs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the attention of all the teachers was called for by the great
                  amount of preparation making; and Castlereagh himself was incessantly active. In
                  addition to his other duties, the last fortnight was especially devoted to making
                  out the tution-bills, the careful examination of which, and transcribing to his
                  account-book, and posting his ledger, made a fortnight's very close confinement,
                  along with his other regular affairs. Necessarily, his sermons were laid over at
                  this period, and he either exchanged with a brother minister, or preached an old
                  discourse.</p>
               <p>Every bill contained a stationary account, as well as the regular tuition charges.
                  And this account, as kept by each of the teachers, often varied from a partial
                  account kept by himself, and especially from that kept by the pupil. Not
                  unfrequently, after a bill had been carefully made out and filed, the alterations
                  were so many that he, as the least of two evils, tore up the original and made out
                  a new one. His printed bills had their blank spaces completely filled, and often
                  he was obliged to write a long list of "Sundries," independently of the regular
                  order and spaces reserved. After going carefully over the charges as kept by the
                  teachers and by himself, and arranging the account satisfactorily to himself, as a
                  final thing he went round with bills, paper and pencil among all the scholars,
                  inquiring if they had received any other books, paper, pencils, pens, and so
                  forth, were charged. The first answer invariably was, "None, sir," but very often,
                     a<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6389-00000147"/> sober, second thought brought to
                  remembrance something not in the bill.</p>

                  <p>Well, there's a dollar and twenty-five cents. I'll put it in the bill.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Thus erasing and adding items to the bills, on the whole securing a few dollars to
                  the relief of the sinking fund for the department of books and stationery,
                  Castlereagh went to every pupil, and making assurance doubly sure, put the final
                  touch to his bills, and said, "All done." Still, it not unfrequently happened,
                  that a "conclusion" and a "finally" were added to these supposed endings. In the
                  course of his "experience" in the business of teaching, he adopted several
                  different methods of avoiding, or at least lightening, this labor. At one time he
                  required the pupils to furnish their own books; but they were always dilatory
                  about it, and procured different editions of the same authors, and different
                  authors of the same studies, to a confusion always worse confounded. Then he
                  loaned them books, charging so much a term; but the books were generally torn up,
                  or soon lost, and complaints made against the high charges that necessarily
                  followed this great waste. Again he furnished the books at a slight per cent
                  advance, but this run him into debt. Anon he required all books should be paid on
                  delivery; but, in practice, found it was very much like a cash store, with
                  abundant credit, after all.</p>
               <p>The bills were at length made out, and forwarded in sealed envelops—some going to
                  a great distance, by mail; others by the hands of the pupils to their respective
                  homes. The last two days of the term were generally paying days. Castlereagh had
                  his wallet and portmonnaie stuffed and wadded with bank-bills, and a generous
                  handful of silver and copper loose in his pocket. He never felt richer than then,
                  nor more despised "hard times" and bad fortune. Never felt more generous—never
                  thought so little of the scarcity of money—was willing to deduct any amount from
                  any one's bill—make any generous donation asked of him—fee the boys for this, and
                  fee them for that. These pay-days were flush days with him, and the only care he
                  seemed to have was for a larger wallet! And when the "flush days" were over, came
                  the pay-out days,<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6389-00000148"/> which never failed to
                  reduce the wallet somewhere to its original dimensions, and so the old
                  pocket-books were retained. The hard-worked teachers now had their flush days—so
                  had the grocers, the butchers, the booksellers, the dry-goods sellers, the "help,"
                  the bakers, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et id omne genus.</foreign> And the old debts
                  being paid up, Castlereagh began to see the slippery and evanescent nature of
                  "riches."</p>
               <p>Saturday previous to the examination was entirely devoted by all the teachers, and
                  by the majority of the school-boys and girls to ornamenting with evergreens the
                  school-rooms. The boys separated into clans, and roving through the woods,
                  gathered cedars, running pine, hemlock boughs, and ivy, which they brought in
                  large quantities to the rooms. The girls and young ladies with never ceasing
                  industry, wound it together, and with the assistance of the young gentleman
                  wreathed the windows, and the columns that supported the ceiling, and hung it in
                  graceful arches from point to point around and across the two large rooms of the
                  seminary, the great doors of which swung wide apart for the public
                  examination.</p>
               <p>Never was there a better examination than that of the Institute on the following
                  Monday, day and evening, and Tuesday; Castlereagh and all his teachers were proud
                  of their pupils. It gratified them to see collected a large number of the parents,
                  who came in some instances from the neighboring towns to witness the close of the
                  term, and with their own eyes notice the imporvement of their children.</p>
               <p>The house was on Monday evening literally crammed. There was hardly room for the
                  readers, declaimers, and musicians. But finally all made their appearance, and
                  with very few exceptions the parts assigned were sustained in the most admirable
                  manner.</p>
               <p>When Fitz Maurice spoke his original Latin oration, though few understood the
                  language, yet every body seemed pleased, and many protested that it was "good,"
                  "very fine," "capital," and as plain to them as "English." There were some,
                  however, who did not seem exactly to understand it, nor whether they were expected
                  to weep or laugh. Hayden in the coolest manner conceivable, with very fine effect
                  upon his audience, spoke an exceedingly comical piece, and Harry Otis an English
                  oration that every body listened to with perfect admiration. Edger Eaton's oration
                  was highly applauded, and so was a dialogue that followed, spoken by Carlos and
                  Wayne. The compositions were some of them very beautiful, and much to the credit
                  of the writers, most of whom were the young ladies. The young music pupils
                  followed and played, some of them, tolerably well, others showed a good deal of
                  taste and a fine execution. The last of these who was called and now came forward
                  was Abbie; she looked pale and deeply anxious, Castlereagh studied her countenance
                  as she came forward, and a fearful presentiment shot through his heart respecting
                  her. She was evidently<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6389-00000149"/> in poor health,
                  and it was with difficulty that she now walked erect and firm without betraying a
                  lameness that was rapidly increasing upon her. She, however, sat down to the
                  instrument, and sweeping her hands over the keys, every ear was opened, every
                  breath almost suspended as she sung the touching, yet simple song,</p>

               <p>There was a subdued, gentle, truthful earnestness in her manner, which more than
                  the song even enlisted the attention of the audience. She finished it, and
                  immediately rising, left the piano, while, whether in good taste or otherwise, the
                  gratified assemblage, now breathing freely, showered on her the most rapturous
                  favor. But Castlereagh wept. His heart was bleeding at every pore. He gazed after
                  her, and thought as she glided away, that an ominous shadow encircled her fair
                  form, and enviously vailed it from his sight forever. Long—long—after it he would
                  say, "Poor, poor Abbie! 'Take me home to die.'"</p>
               <p>A few rich songs from Sarah Matilda, a schottisch, a waltz, from Ann Eliza and
                  Gertrude, a speech from the Rev. Mr. Kirk Alling, and a few closing remarks by
                  Castlereagh, closed the gala affair. For ten or fifteen minutes the cheerful
                  wild-ringing bell of the Institute sent its rapidly whirling vibrations along the
                  bright circling atmospheric line of this rare night at Lindenvale, as away in
                  every conceivable form of ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and we know not what,
                  the people, young and old, went chatting and humming to their homes.</p>

               <head type="sub">CASTLEREAGH, JADED, WORKS ON—THE PORTORICO LAD.</head>
               <p>A VACATION of three weeks is at best soon gone, as every teacher will bear us
                  witness. It was short, and if sweet at Castlereagh's, often a bitter-sweet. There
                  was work to be done in the Institute, painting, re-arranging seats and desks,
                  white-washing, menidng carpets, cleansing rooms, a general overturning of the
                  paraphernalia of the dormitories, stove and furnace cleaning, scrubbing. The
                  grounds must be newly brushed, raked, and dressed, the fences repaired, and
                  ornamental. Then the neglected parish-calls press on your attention. You call on
                  Mr. and Mrs. A; you pass rapidly through a visit to the B's and B's; apologize to
                  the D's; drop in at the E's; inquire particularly at the F's; chat an hour with
                  the G's; sympathize with the H's; congratulate the I's; take tea with the J's;
                  dine at K's; ride out with the L's; blunder into company at the M's; get reproved
                  at the N's; hold meetings at the O's; give advice to the P's; write against Q's;
                  take a long walk for the R's; have a nice time with the S's; write in Albums at
                  the T's; funeral at the U's; bad news for the V's; warmly received at the W's;
                  prayer at the X's; concerned for the Y's; and write an epitaph at the Z's.</p>
               <p>The work of a quarter is attempted in three weeks, besides the forestalling of
                  work to come during the next three months; and the pastor's time is all parceled
                  out, morning, noon, evening, night, and used up several times over. Sermons must,
                  of course, be written during the lazy time of vacation. He receives more calls
                  then, as well as makes them, for he is, of course, at leisure!! Poor, jaded
                  Castlereagh!</p>
               <p>Castlereagh is sick.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh is nervous.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh is worn out.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh has a cough.</p>

               <p>"<emph>I am.</emph>"</p>
               <p>He suffered a cold to fasten on him during the spring, that became a serious
                  affair before he saw the last effects of it.</p>
               <p>But the term begins again, and lively boys and girls, and pressing duties force
                  him to be active, though weary, faint, and indisposed to any exertion. The
                  enervating spring annoys him, the cough depresses him, and yet you see him
                  refusing to yield, and attempting all that he has ever before done—and even more.
                  He plans a wider system for his school. He<pb n="292-293"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000151"/> will build larger, improve his grounds, enlarge his
                  corps of teachers, append the Normal element, introduce the Dunton penmanship, and
                  raise the standard of education as far as possible in each department of
                  study.</p>
               <p>ABBLE did not return. The other young ladies came back. Gay and mirthful Isabel,
                  the loving Stella, the placid Roxana, Eleanor, Ann Eliza, Miss Henrietta. The
                  latter came back with a sigh, for her sweet sister, Abbie, was evidently drooping
                  and paler growing, and suffering daily.</p>
               <p>There were some new boys from the city and elsewhere in the school as day scholars
                  or in the family, especially there came a lovely boy from Porto-Rico, in charge of
                  his New York friends. His parents were native-born Americans, but the lad was
                  Spanish born, and more or less familiar with the language. He had, however, been
                  two years in the United States when he came to Lindenvale, and had forgotten most
                  of the words, or, if not forgotten, he would never speak the language. S—— was one
                  of the sweetest lads in the universe. Castlereagh loved him intensely, and at the
                  table his seat was immediately at his right—not the best seat to be waited on
                  first, but an honorable one, and familiar. He was a small lad, and but ten years
                  of age, with flaxen curls and hazel eyes, and cuban expression. A sweet smile
                  expressed the joyous innocence of his nature; a simple truthful language, his love
                  of virtue; a free bestowment of his choice presents ents from the Islands, his
                  generous heart; constancy and progress in his studies, his native mental
                  endowment; and his activity and love of sports, his excellent physical
                  constituation. He was a child to be loved for his amiable and attractive nature;
                  whom to love was neither idolatry nor wastefulness, for he deserved and repaid it
                  all.</p>
               <p>Between Castlereagh and his father, D—— H——, Esq., there grew up in a short time a
                  very pleasing correspondence. Sarah Matilda and Mrs. H—— also wrote to one
                  another; the subject-matter of their correspondence being, on the one part, the
                  expression of a mother's love for her darling, absent son, and on the other, in
                  the most earnest and friendly manner, recounting the story of his daily life, and
                  assuring the far-distant mother that he had found hearts tender and true in their
                  love toward her darling one.</p>
               <p>S—— one day received a letter from his friends in New York, inclosing another from
                  his father, informing him that a vessel from the island had arrived in that port,
                  and would soon reach her harbor near Lindenvale, having on board for him several
                  packages of fruits and choice things, such as absent sons and school-boys love.
                  S—— betrayed no great excitement or emotion at these tidings, having all his life
                  had oranges growing in his sight, and within his reach in his father's grounds,
                  and being perfectly familiar with the taste and abundance of good things that the
                  soil and climate of Cuba produce. But to the other boys<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000152"/> and girls, reared in the north, to whom these
                  fruits and delicacies of a tropical clime were <emph>special,</emph> dear-bought
                  luxuries, the announcement of such an arrival to the care and disposal of one so
                  generous as S——, produced a flutter of excitement, and a nervous lookingfor of the
                  well-laden trucks, that quite indisposed some of them to hard study or common
                  enjoyments. At length the truckman came, his stout and noble horse sweating and
                  snorting under his heavy draught. It happened that the arrival took place just at
                  twelve, noon, when the boys were flocking from school, and they gathered in wild
                  and expectant groups around the discharging cargo. S—— was the only one of them
                  who did not bound with delight. He calmly whittled a pine stick, and seemed
                  particularly pleased to see the other scholars in their excitement, and to listen
                  to their facetious jokes. Never had a boy, under any circumstances, more friends
                  than he now had. You coulds see this one and that one slyly courting his favor,
                  and doing little kindnesses for him.</p>
               <p>"S—— knows me," says Harry Otis. "He and I are al'ays gude friends, ye know,
                  sonie. Eh?"</p>
               <p>"Did n't I," say little Hartwell Briggs, "find your ball, hey?"</p>
               <p>"Did ye, though?" says Hayden. "And what was that to the flogging I gave that
                  fellow, the other day, for stealing his penknife? Recollect it, don't ye,
                  S—r?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure," says the lion-boy of the occasion.</p>
               <p>"Well," says Johnnie, "S—— and I sit together, don't we, S——?</p>
               <p>"I tell you what it is," says Fitz Maurice. "S—— shall ring the bell to-day just
                  as much as he wants to, and nobody shall prevent him—eh, S——?"</p>
               <p>"Good! good!" says S——; for the ringing of the bell was often solicited.</p>
               <p>"Well," says Amos; "I tell you what S——, you shall ride on my back all round the
                  seminary to-morrow; and I'll climb the old liberty-pole with you on my shoulders;
                  and we'll eat the oranges, won't we, up at the cross-tree?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha!!" shouted the boys.</p>
               <p>"S—— shall sit with us," cried Stella and Roxana, from the veranda, "this whole
                  evening in the parlor, and we'll tell him the finest stories he ever did
                  hear."</p>
               <p>Of course, his confiding and affectionate COUSIN Isabel felt perfectly sure of
                     <emph>her</emph> share of the spoils.</p>
               <p>"I'll pin his collars on for him, 'good,'" says Gertrude, from the window.</p>
               <p>"And S—— knows who gets his hard sums out for him;" says Eleanor.</p>
               <p>Poor S—— kept on whittling and smiling, and the truckman unloading. There was one
                  large tierce of oranges; one barrel of beautiful syrup; one large package of
                  pine-apples; a large parcel of sugar-cane, bananas, pumpkins, casks of yams and
                  sweet potatoes. A very fine present, enough for all, and S——'s letters<pb
                     n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6389-00000153"/> told him to be sure and share his good
                  things with his schoolmates.</p>
               <p>Every boy in school was now given up to the work of eating sugar-cane,
                  pine-apples, bananas, and oranges. Each one carried an orange in his hand, which
                  he was fast reducing in size, and another, as large as could be safely ensconced
                  there, in his pocket. The favorite and pretty girls were loaded with presents.
                  Orange peel, whittlings and crunchings of cane, rejected bananas, were cast in all
                  directions over the grounds; and a happy carnival had the school. S—— was every
                  body's boy, and the generous nature of the lad had full scope for its widest
                  exercise. Yet he used some discrimination and firmness in parceling out his
                  tropical treasures. He had his intimate friends and his mere acquaintances. Half a
                  dozen oranges were none too many for a beloved cheek-by-jowl companion; while
                  another, less intimate and agreeable, received but one or two. The little girl
                  that stole smiles from him had the largest orange you ever saw tossed into her two
                  hands—and that not once—nor twice. Mr. Castlereagh was presented with a large
                  fruit-basket overflowing with the good things, and all the teachers were
                  generously remembered. As for the barrel of syrup it was rolled into the cellar,
                  and was served up on hot cakes at breakfast.<ref rend="super" target="#note_016"

               <p>The kind and interesting letters that accompanied the presents were not the least
                  agreeable part of the freight. And Castlereagh received with his a most valuable
                  parcel in the shape of a specimen of a choice plant, that is found but in one
                  place in the whole island, and is rare the world over, called the <hi rend="i"
                  />doradilla plant, of the family of ferns. Mr. H—— assured him that one part of
                  the parcel sent on had been preserved three years, and the remainder for a
                  considerable period; and that it possessed, although apparently wholly decayed and
                  dead, the property of reviving its life by inserting the slips in water for a few
                  hours. Castlereagh was delighted to find his experiments successful in this
                  particular. A green life-like fern-stalk greeted his eye in the morning, shooting
                  up out of the glass where he had placed a dried, and, apparently, dead slip of the
                  doradilla the evening previous. Mr. H—— was of opinion that there was the same
                  recuperative energy in the root of the plant; an experiment which Castlereagh
                  intended, sooner or later, to try for his own gratification.</p>

               <p>JOURNAL. <hi rend="i"/>May 1.—I have issued a new circular. It is printed on one
                  page of a letter-sheet, and two pages are reserved for correspondence. It cost me
                  considerable thought to arrange the form. As it is, the caption reads—"LINDENVALE
                  INSTITUTE—FOR BOTH SEXES." Then, in a single paragraph, there is a statement of
                  the situation and privileges of the Seminary. The teachers are named in both
                  departments. The studies, the tuition, books and stationery, rules and terms of
                  study, have their separate paragraphs. Then the names of the patrons of the school
                  are paraded, being picked up here and there over the whole continent. Then follows
                  a printed notice of the pupil's progress, which is forwarded to parents or
                  guardians from time to time, the blanks being filled out—</p>
               <p>"All communications should be addressed to Reverend Elbert Castlereagh, Pastor of
                  the church in Lindenvale," etc., etc. This seems to look very business-like. What
                  a great privilege it is to quote among your patrons, the great men of the country?
                  I think that those poor teachers who have no such opportunity must meet with many
                  embarrassments and much discouragement in their labor! But it really seems that
                  very few do find themselves in such a dilemma, for I have noticed this very day,
                  in one of my newspapers, some four or five advertisements of schools, all of them
                  "taking the liberty to refer" to distinguished scholastics, and honorable men in
                  colleges and elsewhere throughout the land. And one thing more—I have felt some
                  concern of mind for those venerable men who are so often mentioned as the sponsors
                  and god-parents of these baby-institutions, and who, the public are assured, will
                  give the necessary "characters," satisfactory to the most fastidious guardians of
                  children—lest, in fulfilling their guranties, they should finally run themselves
                  out of complimentary terms, or get confused in the use of them so as to underrate
                  one and overrate another, when the most serious consequences might be supposed,
                  sooner or later, to arise. A very great responsibility, surely, connects with such
                  an elevation in the public eye, as that of a learned man, a wise and judicious
                  man, who knows all about the character, and fitness for his work, of Mr. A. B.,
                  and of Miss C. D. for hers, and of every body else, over the unreasonable limits
                  of all the North American continent, and who gives his very distinguished name to
                  recommend institutions, inside of which he never entered, a circular of which he
                  never saw, and the course of which he knows little or nothing. So much for
                     theory<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6389-00000155"/> ory. But the
                     <emph>credit</emph> system is fashionable, and it is therefore hard to break
                  up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 2.—I am sorry to hear the discouraging news that Cousin ABBIE is
                  quite ill; that, after she reached home from school, she went abroad but once ere
                  her lameness so increased upon her as to confine her within doors, and that the
                  attack does not yield to the remedies employed. Instead of the rheumatism, the
                  family are apprehensive of that terrible and often fatal disorder, called the "hip
                  complaint." Henrietta is anxious, I notice; and every letter seems to discover
                  still more her apprehensions. She is unwilling to leave me if she can remain
                  through the term, but I know that her heart is with her mother and precious, only
                  sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 3.—Somewhat unwell, I have just finished a beautiful ground-plan
                  of a cottage; it is a gem—perfectly exquisite! Have been at work in my garden. I
                  must make a rule against the boys leaping the garden-fence after foot-ball. They
                  bound over it into my raspberry and currant-bushes, head first, like openmouthed
                  hounds in chase of game. Already my pieplants have been trodden down and crushed
                  so as very nearly to destroy them. My asparagus-bed has been trampled down, and a
                  young and thrify Catawba grape wholly ruined.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Boys!</emph> BOYS!! what are you doing there—leaping upon my vines and
                  bushes so carelessly? You will ruin every thing. Go through the gate, go through
                  the gate."</p>
               <p>But it is hardly supposable that forty or fifty lads, with blood up for a game at
                  foot-ball, can be induced to forego the excitement, and risk the chance of defeat
                  in their sport, long enough to swing open a gate! I must do something about this.
                  There comes the India-rubber foot-ball again. Dyke Silliman has hit it, and it is
                  twenty or thirty feet in the air. It flies over the fence—it alights—crash! It has
                  broken through the glass into my hotbed.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Boys! boys!</emph> BOYS! this will not do."</p>
               <p>"Beg your pardon, sir. It was a great mistake. We will do so no more."</p>
               <p>"Ah, boys! you are good to promise, and are very frank, and very hopeful—I only
                  fear your temptations."</p>
               <p>Little Hobbie sometimes gets off a good thing:</p>
               <p>"How many promises dere are <emph>and not do;</emph> ain't dere, fader?"</p>
               <p>"How so?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the boys promise, and promise, and promise, ever so many times, you know,
                  dey will certain do so as you say, and den dey go right away and <emph>not</emph>
                  do."</p>
               <p>Hobbie sees where the bad is, evidently. But, after all—it's no mitigation,
                  though—boys do but follow out the example of men. Mr. A. promises that your house
                  shall be built by the first of September, and completes it the last of November.
                  Mr. B. promises to vote for a stringent temperance law in the Assembly, but goes
                  with his party against it. Mr. C. will write you letters of introduction to some
                  friend of his on<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6389-00000156"/> business of importance
                  to you, but forgets it. Mrs. D. will be most happy to call on you, with her
                  refined and polished daughters, but fails of keeping her promise. "How many
                  promises dere are and NOT DO," says Hobbie. After all, one of the best
                  promise-keepers we have is the Locomotive. Governed by a positive rule, it heads
                  away against wind, tempest, and darkness, smashing up his fellow-locomotive rather
                  than losing his promise, and dashing into snow-banks with the fury of a white
                  bear, never giving up until an uncompromising necessity obliges it, and then
                  struggling to the last.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>May 5.—Alice writes me that she is going to New York to attend the
                  Anniversaries. I have thought of going down myself. To-day, I was much overcome by
                  hearing from Marshall that some of my best boys in the Institute were covertly
                  acquiring the monstrously evil habit of smoking cigars and chewing tobacco. After
                  reflecting sadly on this intelligence for a few moments<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000157"/> ments, and imploring the Divine assistance, I
                  walked into the seminary, and called to me the offenders—Harry Otis, Hayden, and
                  Williams.</p>
               <p>We were quite by ourselves and without any interruption. Hardly knowing in what
                  manner to address them, yet fully convinced of my duty to do so for their own
                  sakes, and their parents', and my own, and the good of the school—I inquired of
                  them the truth of the report. They admitted it, with apparent confusion, and some
                  hesitation, and with explanatory and mitigating circumstances. "But, my dear
                  boys," said I, "it will hardly admit of these mitigating explanations; the evils
                  of smoking and chewing are too great and too well known to be so lightly
                  palliated; and you know how offensive the habit is to your parents and to myself.
                  You know it is contrary to all the rules of the school, and that it would furnish
                  me with just cause to complain of your conduct to your friends at home; nay, to
                  suspend you from the Institute."</p>
               <p>They acknowledged that the habit was a vicious one, and they did not intend to
                  follow it, although they confessed that they could, even then, smoke the whole of
                  a cigar, and even chew tobacco, without experiencing any nauseating effect. I
                  inquired of them: "Where did you obtain your cigars? for you know it is against my
                  rules that you should visit the stores to purchaes any thing without my
                  permissions."</p>
               <p>They were rather troubled to answer this, but at length said they had sometimes
                  bought them at the toll gate, a mile or two distant, when they were rambling on
                  the mountain. "Yes," said I, "when I have trusted to your honor, and put the
                  utmost confidence in your requests to go and amuse yourselves with a walk, you
                  have abused it in a manner positively surprising and wicked. Who taught you to
                  smoke? Harry Otis and Hayden said that Williams was accustomed to it when he came
                  to school, and they had learned it of him. I further asked them if they ever
                  purchased cigars any where else. This troubled their young consciences somewhat;
                  but they at last confessed that they had once or twice bought them at the
                  hotel.</p>
               <p>"Truly, boys," said I, with great astonishment, "you have been engaged in a most
                  mean and criminal course of behavior. You see now where this habit leads you. It
                  combines to destroy both soul and body. you have concealed from me your conduct,
                  have betrayed my confidence, have been cutivating a vile and destructive habit in
                  secret, have not consulted in this your own good, nor your parent's happiness; you
                  have disregarded you example over other, and put in jeopardy the good name of the
                  school; for where is the parent with proper and serious views of life, who wishes
                  his little boys to acquire this habit, especially in a school where he has placed
                  him in the confidence that his habits would be all guarded according to his
                  highest wishes, and formed on the most correct models? You have been guilty of
                  visiting a hotel, where the fumes<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6389-00000158"/> of
                  rum and tobacco mingle with shoutings and blasphemies—where you become familiar
                  with habits of dissipation, and yourselves take the first steps in the downward
                  road to infamy and ruin. It is not so?"</p>
               <p>They assented to the truth of all I said. "Is this right?" They confessed their
                  error. Seeing that they were humbled and ashamed, I could not refrain from weeping
                  before them. Harry Otis and Hayden shed tears over their wayward and shameful
                  course. I grasped their hands, and exhorted them by all they prized in the world,
                  and all they feared in the next, to abandon, totally and forever, this ruinous
                  course of life, the first steps in which they had already learned. They, still
                  trembling with emotion, promised me they would do so, and hoped that I would
                  forgive them. Williams, being older, and more assustomed to such a habit, betrayed
                  less emotion than the others, but thoughtfully and seriously attended to all that
                  I advanced, and declared it, as his firm determination, never again, during his
                  connection with the Seminary, to indulge the habit, or, by his example, in any way
                  to foster it in others. I was happy to be informed that neither Fitz Maurice, nor
                  Amos, nor yet S——, had been guilty of this offense.</p>
               <p>I have blamed Sarah Matilda a little about this, for it seems she discovered some
                  tobacco, two or three weeks ago, in the jacket-pocket of Harry Otis, when mending
                  it, and, again, in a drawer of his bureau. But hoping that <emph>he</emph> was
                  above this indulgence, and intending ing herself to speak to him before disturbing
                  my mind about it, she had let the matter slide by unnoticed, and the boys meantime
                  were rapidly acquiring, even under our very eyes, an injurious and disgusting
                  habit for life. How I tremble for these boys! They have long been with me, and
                  give promise of most true and noble character. But what temptations lie in their
                  path—and how easily they may yield to them and fall! I shall not soon forget this
                  scene with them, nor cease to pray for their salvation.</p>
               <p>Sarah Matilda is troubled almost to death with the heedlessness and the absence of
                  a true ear on the part of many of her music pupils. Herself familiar with every
                  note and key in music, it is annoying, when in her room, over the practice-room of
                  the pupil, or any where else within hearing, to notice a scholar going through a
                  piece she has long practiced, a whole octave below the proper pitch, or, what is
                  still worse, a note or two below, sometimes commencing on a wrong key, and so
                  playing a discordant jumble of intervals as seriously as though all were right, at
                  which one might indulge himself in a hearty laugh if the matter were not so
                  distressingly vexatious and discouraging, leaving out also flats and sharps and
                  perceiving no difference, playing right with one hand and wrong with the other,
                  discords grating on the ear like the filing of a saw. So in <emph>time.</emph> It
                  distresses her that some of them have no time, but play slow and uncertain when
                  the execution is difficult, and hurried and ever accelarating when it<pb
                     n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6389-00000159"/> chances to be easy. She says it takes
                  away full half the pleasure of instructing to find such inattention, and such an
                  absence of the true appreciation of music in her pupils. But I reply to this, "'We
                  must have the bitter with the sweet.' If they murder it now, they will repent, and
                  do better by and by. They are learners—<emph>learners.</emph> What is awkward
                  to-day will become more and more easy and agreeble as they proceed. They are young
                  scholastics, and by and by they will 'drift' aright."</p>
               <p>"They never will 'drift aright' in the world!" she replies.</p>
               <p>"What! not by patient instruction?"</p>
               <p>"NEVER."</p>
               <p>She has made up her mind on this point, and when she says "NEVER," I always drop
                  the discussion, let the point be where and what it may. As I am not very well, it
                  has been determined that I shall go to New York this week, and so avoid the
                  necessity of preaching on the Sabbath. I will go and call on Brother Clifford in
                  my way, passing the Sabbath at his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>May 6. Truly horrible news is now pervading the city, spreading from
                  its center to every one of its lanes and concealed abodes, as well as penetrating
                  to the most distant parts of its suburbs. There is a general paleness and
                  solicitude on the countenances of the people, as they run here and there—and
                  anxiety, that will hardly be satisfied at any answer given to the inquiries put
                  forth, be the same good or evil. At first all is rumor!
                  Dreadful—supposable—possible—vague—flying—startling—idle—"It is, after, all"—so
                  says the new rumor—"but an affair of the locomotive and the baggage-cars. Indeed,
                  let us shake off the gloomy feeling and say, 'We are glad of it—the Company will
                  be more careful next time,'" But there is another rumor; it places the matter in a
                  different aspect, and men run hither and thither in wilder excitement than at the
                  first. Now the deranged wires begin to speak. And—and, hark! Surely the whistle
                  and rumbling of the delayed cars are heard. We shall all have definite reports at
                  length, and may carry to our homes sad and bleeding heart, or feelings of
                  gratitude above the ordinary rise of our emotions. (So abruptly ends the Journal
                  of the 6th.)</p>
               <p>Thus was the city of N—— H—— excited during the afternoon of Friday, May 6, 185-,
                  when the train of cars due there at eleven A. M. failed to arrive, and the report
                  was variously circulated in the course of a few hours that it had run into the
                  open DRAW-BRIDGE at NORWALK! At first it was said that many lives were sacrificed,
                  but this was followed by less painful news, and by and by, either from a strong
                  wish that it might be so, or from some information obtained more or less reliable,
                  it was circulated, and tended greatly to relieve the public suspense, that nobody
                  was injured, although the locomotive and baggage-cars were in the draw. Brief and
                  false reprieve. The first rumor was the truest, "MANY LIVES LOST." A medical
                     convention<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6389-00000160"/> tion in New York had
                  assembled there a portion of the best talent and influence to be found in this
                  profession throughout the country. And it happened that on this very train were a
                  large number of the delegates returning North. Quite a proportion of the eminent
                  physicians of the city of N—— H—— were absent attending the Convention, and it was
                  feared they might be, as well as many other business men who return home on
                  Saturday, on this ill-starred train. Fortunately the business men of N—— H——
                  return from the metropolis in one of the evening trains, and not in the morning
                  ones. But persons going further north and east do usually take the eight o'clock
                  express from New York, and accordingly in the Norwalk tragedy there were a great
                  many families at the north who were made to suffer.</p>
               <p>At a late hour in the afternoon, the cars came through from the scene of the
                  disaster, bringing to anxious friends in N—— H—— much personal relief in the
                  restoration to them unhurt of all their absent ones, although there were quite a
                  good number on the train, and some of them were in great danger at the time of the
                  disaster. This sad and painful accident occurred as follows: The express train
                  that leaves New York for New Haven, Hartford, Springfield, Worcester and Boston,
                  at eight o'clock every day but the Sabbath, was making its regular trip on Friday
                  the 6th of May, and arrived in good time near the South Norwalk Station,
                  forty-five miles or thereabouts from New York. From the South Norwalk Station
                  there is a beautiful curve in the track, eastward to a long bridge which has a
                  draw on its western extremity to let through small vessels and a steamboat. Such
                  is the extent of the curve that from the station the bridge is not seen at all,
                  and when past its central point, if under full headway, the train is too near the
                  draw to be arrested, even if there is the greatest danger to be avoided.
                  Accordingly there is a signal-globe at the draw, which being elevated on a tall
                  staff, it is seen above the dwellings and other objects situated between, by the
                  engineer of the train before he reaches the station and begins to traverse the
                  curve—for this <emph>express</emph> train does not in going to the north and east,
                  stop at Norwalk unless there is a necessity. On the present occasion, it happens
                  that the "draw" was open to let through a steamboat for New York, and she had just
                  cleared her length from the bridge when the accident took place. The signal-ball
                  on the staff was "lowered" according to the rule in all cases of this kind; but
                  the engineer, owing to some inexplicable deception of his vision, or neglect of
                  duty, did not perceive its absence from its usual elevation, and of course held on
                  at the same high rate of thirty miles the hour under which he had steamed up from
                  the city. There is, we know, a motive as we drive into a city or village, or
                  before the eye of a large company of persons, to make the team we are guiding
                  appear to the best advantage. And to an engineer of conductor<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000161"/> of a train of cars, which is the admiration of
                  every body, there can hardly be supposed wanting this common motive in the action
                  of the mighty "Iron Horse," snorting and chafing under his rein. It is thought,
                  therefore, that the train swept by the station and toward the bridge, which was
                  less than an hundred roads distant from the station, with a velocity equal to what
                  had been made during the rest of the morning. The engineer, conductor, fireman and
                  breakmen, were proud of their train, and perfectly easy and jovial. Express agents
                  and some few of the passengers were lounging, puffing, and laughing over good
                  stories in the smoking car. The passengers, to the number of four or five hundred,
                  read the papers, joked with each other, clustered in little clans, looked at their
                  watches, caught a glimpse here and there of the Sound, and believed themselves all
                  safe. Unsound and treacherous human confidence! Fatal celerity! Once round the
                  curve, and the danger became evident. The engineer preceived just before him the
                  yawning chasm toward which he had so rapidly been driving his train with all his
                  imminent, unavoidable danger. He instantly gave the alarmwhistle to the breakmen,
                  reversed the engine, and with his fireman leaped from the devoted train. The
                  fireman escaped without serious injury, but he was dangerously wounded. Instantly
                  the imperceptibly checked locomotive and train of cars rushed to the plunge. The
                  locomotive, impelled as well by the momentum of the train as by its own power,
                  made a graceful curve to the water from the track, and sinking rapidly from view,
                  buried itself in the deep water and slime hard up against the timbers of the pier
                  on the other side of the draw, a distance of sixty feet; immediately in the rear
                  of it, in a straight line, lay the two baggage-cars; above them the smoking car
                  and first passenger car formed another tier, while the second and part of the
                  third passenger-cars formed another. It was the work of an instant. Fifty human
                  beings were instantly plunged into this vortex, confined in the cars, unaware of
                  danger, and perished before they had, at least many of them, the first idea of any
                  catastrophe. A few escaped by great exertions and singular providence from the
                  smoking and baggage cars; but in the first and second passenger-car nearly every
                  one was killed outright or drowned. Twenty or thirty persons were more or less
                  wounded who escaped with life, some of whom afterward died, others entirely
                  recovered. In the rear cars none were injured. By this dreadful calamity, the
                  result, as it would see, of carelessness and inattention to existing rules and
                  signals on the road, husbands, wives, parents and children were torn from each
                  other, and communities far and near were made to suffer. The pride of many a
                  circle of friends in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Hartford, Bridgeport,
                  Springfield, and in many other cities and villages was taken away by this
                  deplorable event. Fifty human beings recovered in a short time from the<pb
                     n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6389-00000162"/> ruins, stretched side by side, pale,
                  cold and dead on the shore, the wailings of relatives and friends filling the air,
                  the groanings of the wounded and the lamentations of the people rendered the scene
                  one that entirely baffles all description. The coldest heart was moved to pity,
                  and eyes that seldom grew moist or warm with tears, filled and burst with
                  grief.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was shocked to notice among the list of the wounded, the names of
                  General H. and his lady, of New York, uncle and aunt to Sarah Matilda. He was not
                  surprised that he was on the train, for his business led him every few days over
                  the road. He now hurried his arrangements, and in the morning train went down to
                  Norwalk. He found thousands of persons there before him, many assembled from
                  excitement and curiosity, others earnestly seeking for an absent and lost friend.
                  He followed the crowd into the various rooms and places of deposit, where the dead
                  had been decently laid out, coffined, and numbered. It shocked and overcame him.
                  Every face he looked on was that of a stranger; but his heart was deeply,
                  powerfully agitated, for the stranger had his friends somewhere far or near, who
                  would mourn for him, and a home that would now be desolate. Those "dead
                  rooms!"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said he, "may I never never, never, see the like again; those dark, rigid
                  faces; those cold frames; those bruised limbs and scarred features; the dead
                  mother and child. Oh! what shudderings and oppressive emotions I experienced
                  there; what risings of will against Providence; what sensations of terror mingling
                  with pity induced me to hasten and flee away from the awful locality of such
                  scenes, and endeavor to <emph>forget</emph> what had impressed itself indelibly on
                  the heart for life."</p>
               <p>It was too harrowing. Castlereagh sought the dwelling to which his friends had
                  been removed, and was glad to learn that General H. was not much injured. They met
                  at the threshold of the door. Their voices trembled as they grasped each other by
                  the hand, and uttered an earnest "God be thanked." General H—— was scarred in
                  several places, but not dangerously wounded. His wife lay on a couch, severely,
                  and as it proved, fatally injured. She recognized Castlereagh and extended her
                  hand to greet him as he approached her. She spoke to him and to her friends
                  perfectly coherently, and though she was a great sufferer, her face being much
                  bruised and swollen, she smiled on them all, and betrayed no lack of interest in
                  their welfare. Yet the sight was a painful one to witness—the excitement of it
                  almost too great for endurance. That she might be kept as quietly as possible, few
                  saw her, or remained long in the room, and Castlereagh pressing her hand warmly
                  between his, and commending her to God, left her in charge of her own affectionate
                  children, who had already arrived from the city. In the house nearly opposite was
                  the family of Dr. G—— of New York, whose idolized daughter, pronounced and
                  believed to be dead, had been providentially<pb n="316-317"

                  long-continued and hopeful exertions of Mr. B—. Others of the wounded and
                  suffering were disposed here and there among the families of the kind people of
                  South Norwalk, and were receiving every needed attention.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh with a mind overwhelmed and saddened by what he had seen, went to New
                  York. On the following Wednesday Mrs. H—— died. She was taken back to the city,
                  and buried at Greenwood, sincerely mourned. Her husband, General H——, recovered
                  from his wounds, but never from the internal effects of the shock, and was
                  suddenly removed from life within two years after the event. He now sleeps by the
                  side of her, who with him, was a sufferer in the great and thrilling catastrophe

                  SCHOLASTICA.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE had a rather singular commuting of discipline to-day," said Marshall to
                  Castlereagh, one evening in June.</p>
               <p>"And pray, what was it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, there is Wilder Henderson, black-eyed, curly-haired, and playful as he is,
                  not over-fond of study, but capable of it, has been of late too neglectful. I have
                  talked with him, and coaxed him, and threatened him, but all to no purpose. For
                  two afternoons now, I have kept him after school, once more than an hour. This is
                  a great punishment, you know, with him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, certainly,"</p>
               <p>Well, while thus shut up with me, his friend and companion, Henry Kingsley, waits
                  for him, and when released they walk home a mile and a half together."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know—well?"</p>
               <p>"Well, to-day, finding that he must stay after school as a punishment for poor
                  lessons, he came to me and proposed that, as he and Henry wanted to get home as<pb
                     n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6389-00000164"/> soon as possible to-night, I should
                  give him a feruling in place of imprisonment. I took the matter into consideration
                  therefore, and calling him aside, we soon agreed on the main points. He agreed to
                  bear it in good-humor and not cry. I agreed to strike him on the hand three times,
                  and that, if he persisted in the same way, by which punishment became necessary, I
                  should increase the blows one each day. So we got ready, and I feruled him."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" exclaimed Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I put it right on."</p>
               <p>"And how did he bear it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! very well, indeed. The last blow he cringed under a little, but said, 'I did
                  it all fairly.'"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"After it was over, I asked Wilder how he liked it.</p>
               <p>"'Oh!' said he, 'it hurt some at the time, but it is all over now; and I am glad
                  of it, <emph>for I have saved a whole hour by it!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"Well, you did 'commute,' indeed—a singular boy Wilder, and has his peculiar ideas
                  of improving and saving time, it seems."</p>
               <p>"Decidedly, sir, and promises to make a scholar."</p>
               <p>"Yes; and do you think he will have many more inflictions of this sort without
                  coming under?"</p>
               <p>"I think he will give up after one or two more. The novelty wears off, you know,
                  after a time."</p>
               <p>"True; well try him once or twice more, and see if it produces any effect."</p>
               <p>The next day Wilder went through the same exercise, there being four instead of
                  three blows. He could with difficulty refrain from tears, but did not betray
                  himself. Inwardly, however, he resolved that he could not stand five, much less
                  six similar shocks of the tender nerves of the hand, and that on the whole, it
                  would be best to let play alone, and attend to his lessons.</p>
               <p>Marshall informed Castlereagh that the feruling ended there, and Wilder was ever
                  after one of his prompt boys.</p>
               <p>Marbles are beautiful play-things. How prettily do little boys look in pictures,
                  huddled together, and kneeling with lively and pleasant countenances over their
                  game. Their eyes follow it with wide-awake interest, and you say: "One of the
                  sweetest plays in the world!" So when you see boys the green, and along the
                  side-walk playing marbles, you long to be a boy yourself, and play with them. You
                  actually buy your pocket-full of marbles to give away. They are so smooth, so
                  variegated in color, and so different in size, with such an intelligent
                  nomenclature, "annies," "alies," "boulders," and "agates." And the games are so
                  many, and so pretty, and so innocent, and yet intricate to the mere looker-on,
                  while the boys all understand them; and "taw"<ref rend="super" target="#note_017"
                     xml:id="return_017">*</ref>
                   here, and "pink up" there, and "hill, "and "fire," and "span," as the game
                  may be "<hi rend="i"/>Cincinnati," "<hi rend="i"/>Ring," or "<hi rend="i"
                  />Role-hole."</p>
               <p>Yes, marbles are pretty play-things. But now, who<note place="foot" xml:id="note_017">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_017">*</ref>Webster spells it "taw," the boys pronounce it "toy," or "toi."</p>
               </note><pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000165"/> has ever passed along the walk, and gone near where
                  the boys were hot at marbles, without seeing and hearing things that sadly
                  lessened his interest in this juvenile and common recreation? Have you never seen
                  Tom and Bill in a miniature fight, on account of some alleged unfairness in the
                  game? Have you never heard Sam and George using the most violent language to one
                  another—"You did!"—"You did n't!"—I'll be ——! if I did!"—"You don't play
                  fair."—"You lie?"</p>
               <p>Have you never heard used all the rough oaths and Billingsgate of veteran sinners
                  and criminals by these boys at the beautiful game of marbles? Why, I DARE
                     <emph>not even write</emph> the words that I have heard along the street,
                  bandied from one boy to another in a ring of marble-playing, oaths, blasphemies,
                  imprecations! So I deem it likely that marbles, though a beautiful sport, has in
                  it some of the common fruit of the Fall. I love children and their plays. But
                  there is forced on my mind a conviction both saddening and mortifying, when seeing
                  and hearing the evils that I find may exist even in so simple and childlike a game
                  as marbles, that we are in danger of sinning when we indulge ourselves in objects
                  and pursuits that, though in themselves innocent or without any moral character,
                  are yet extremely fascinating, and promise us the greatest innocent excitement!
                  Castlereagh made it a rule that his pupils, though allowed to play at marbles,
                  should never gamble with them. He said to them: "I do not keep a gaming school. I
                  can not give you any permission to play marbles to win them one from another, and
                  so early to cheat and injure your fellow men. You may <emph>play</emph> with
                  marbles, but must not game." Yet, occasionally, even then, words would run high:
                  criminations and recriminations would issue forth from their young hearts and
                  mouths. He did not fail to call them to order for these offenses, nor to show them
                  the evils that easily grow up from those innocent amusements we all allow
                  ourselves. In this manner he hoped to impress on their minds a vivid sense of the
                  subtlety of sin, and lead them to watch against temptation. Yet, he soon found
                  that little Johnnie and Hobbie could not only play every game at marbles, but
                  could scold, fret, and quarrel over them. Ah! marbles may be indeed a beautiful
                  sport. But, Christian man, did you ever sell a boy marbles to play and gamble
                  with, without becoming accessory to his after life of sin and crime? Did you ever
                  hear boys at marbles make use of oaths—ever see them angry? And, Christian
                  brother, did you ever send your beautiful boy into a group of children at marbles,
                  without exposing him to temptation, and to hear bad words and witness a fight?
                  Yet, oh, sweet marbles! How beautiful are marbles! How pretty is the game! So was
                  Eden fair. Positively, I do not know a game that children play which is productive
                  of so much ill-nature, and that abounds with so many high words and fierce
                  contentions as marbles; kite-sailing, coasting on sleds, ball, quoits, "I spy,"
                  "Poison," "ring-round," "leap-frog," "haley over," house and parlor<pb n="322-323"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000166"/> games—no one of them is productive of so much evil
                  language and violent behavior as marbles. It is strange; I only mention the fact,
                  for marbles is certainly a beautiful game.</p>
               <p>Early in June, Henrietta came to Castlereagh with a letter, just received from
                  home, that made it her duty to leave the school. Abbie was suffering from her
                  complaint to a very great degree, and called earnestly for the presence of her
                  only sister. She left the next day, and Castlereagh supplied her place with other
                  teachers. Miss Y——, an intelligent young lady of the vicinity, succeeded Henrietta
                  for a week or two, after which Miss N——, a thorough and interesting teacher, took
                  care of the female department to the close of the term. Eleanor having a generous
                  proposal to go to the South as a teacher, left Lindenvale Institute about this
                  time. All were much grieved at her departure. Marshall, for three days, seemed
                  entirely tongue-tied and destitute of all means of happiness. This subjecting him
                  to some slight raillery from the young ladies, he assumed a carless, bold, jaunty
                  air, which seemed to imply his indifference to the subject—almost his ignorance of
                  the absence of any of the family, but which made the case neither more nor less
                  personally painful.</p>
               <p>We can not mention the "thousand and one" trials, and anxieties, and mingled cares
                  of the life that Castlereagh was leading. There never arose a day, how bright
                  soever it might be, that brought not with it some pressing conviction of duty,
                  some necessity of watchfulness, reproof, or apprehension. Even when all things
                  went well, there would rest on his mind the weight of responsibility, often
                  sufficient to sink him to the ground. He could not throw off the care upon
                  another. He could not assume the guardian's position, and have around him from
                  fifty to a hundred youth, in the most interesting, because the forming period of
                  their life, without an intense feeling of personal responsibility, and often,
                  therefore, when all was going well, when mirth and joy prevailed, when there was
                  great attention to studies, and respect shown to teachers, and some true sense of
                  life's privileges entertained, he, in the retirement of his study, composing his
                  weekly discourses, found himself intensely occupied with the great care of their
                  souls, and impelled to earnest, tearful prayer for wisdom to guide them in the
                  right paths. To him there was little rest. And while the Institute thus pressed on
                  him its various and weighty burdens, he was also striving to perform his
                  ministerial and pastoral duty, watching over the sheep of his flock, guarding the
                  tender lambs of the fold, and seeking for those who yet were gone astray and knew
                  not the voice of the Chief Shepherd. He was also to be seen wending his way to the
                  bedside of the aged, the sick, and the dying, snatching time from one care or duty
                  that he might employ it elsewhere, attending to secular things and spiritual; to
                  church, congregation, school, and family; to closet, study, and the sick chamber;
                     to<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6389-00000167"/> reading and
                     <emph>manuscript;</emph> to business with men of the world, and business with
                  men of piety and faith, laboring to serve one interest and another, to keep bright
                  and glowing the coals of life, in order that the "irons might be ever hot." Yet
                  who is he that escapes without burning his fingers badly from fires like these?
                  Castlereagh, while all was increasingly prosperous in outward respects—society,
                  school, and family—was breaking down under a burden such as consigned W—— to an
                  early grave, that sapped the vigor of B——'s manhood, that drove G——, the talented
                  and eloquent, to the verge of madness. A man may be a minister, a teacher, a
                  lawyer, a merchant, a mechanic, an editor, a doctor, a farmer, and succeed, but
                  make him all these and he will have in the same fire some few too many irons.
                  Withoug knowing it fully, Castlereagh was carrying on his mind too many heavy
                  loads, and his strength was tasked to the highest when others thought he might be
                  at rest. There was for him <emph>no</emph> rest. Every moment not claimed by his
                  society was claimed by the school, and what was not employed there, was sure to be
                  in the family. Driven on by these great divisions of the army of Duty, happiness,
                  health, and even life itself were imperiled. Before fully aware of it, his nervous
                  system became improperly and dangerously excited, a cold was followed by a cough.
                  The warm suns of June did not, neither did they of July, relieve it. Castlereagh,
                  who had scarcely known a sick day in his life, began to feel unwell, and to
                  apprehend that he had gone too far. Yet who can immediately stop in a career of
                  life, involving all one's capital, all one's plans, all one's relations to the
                  community around him? Nay, who but hopes yet to overcome his present
                  embarrassments and again go forward to the attainment of complete success? So,
                  between hope and distrust, one still struggles, and his bark, strained and
                  quivering from mast-head to keel, is at last <cit>

               <p>If he felt his danger, and the need of rest, Castlereagh hoped that a
                  constitution, buoyant and unbroken, would carry him safely through the troubled
                  seas; and if he looked forward to an ultimate change, he still kept on as before,
                  and, apparently, only planned the deeper, and assumed the heavier burden.</p>
               <p>So the summer went rolling by. Marshall had formed his plan of professional study,
                  and, as it involved a connection with the medical school in Philadelphia, in the
                  fall, Castlereagh, though very unwilling to lose his efficient services, was
                  obliged to look for another teacher for the following year. This he did in good
                  season, and, supposing he had engaged one about to graduate with his class in
                  college, and highly recommended, made himself very easy on that point.<pb

                  Henrietta was bending over the couch of her suffering and beloved sister. Eleanor
                  was far away. Marshall, Miss N——, and Ann Eliza, with other assistants, attended
                  to the interests of the seminary. In the midst of his customary labor at making
                  out the tuition-bills of the pupils, Castlereagh received the following note.</p>

                              release me, as I stipulated for at the time we last met, although,
                              then, I believed that I was in little danger of being called away.</p>

               <p>There was no help for this. Castlereagh resigned him, however, with a sigh. The
                  term closed; and commencement came and passed without his having been able to
                  engage another teacher. He wrote letters ters, therefore, to three different
                  colleges, but no satisfactory answers were received. "Let it go," said Castlereagh
                  to Sarah Matilda. "When I take my trip to Saratoga I will hunt up somebody. We are
                  almost sure, now, of Henrietta's return; for, at last, it is decided that Abbie is
                  relieved, and slightly gaining."</p>
               <p>On the <hi rend="i"/>nineteenth day of July, 185—, the summer term closed, and,
                  with it, Marshall's engagement and connection.</p>
               <p>"I shall ever remember you with deepest interest and pleasure;" said
                  Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," he replied; "<emph>this has been the happiest year of my
                     life!</emph> I shall never forget your sermons; your Wednesday evening
                  prayer-meetings; your family morning and evening devotions; your Institute; the
                  pupils; the wild rambles on these hills—your whole family circle. Remember me in
                  your prayers, and especially pray that I may not forget, in my attention to
                  worldly things, that the Son of Man cometh as a thief in the night."</p>
               <p>"I shall long pray for you, sir, as one of our well-remembered circle; may your
                  life be a long one, a happy, a useful one."</p>
               <p>There was the usual hurrying to and fro on the day the school closed. Early in the
                  morning Fitz Maurice climbed the liberty-pole, and flung to the breeze the
                  star-spangled banner which belonged to the Institute, and was always raised at the
                  beginning and close of the term.</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6389-00000169"/>
               <p>There were some affecting scenes witnessed at this time, as there always is, and
                  will be, when schoolmates separate. Fitz Maurice, after three years of study,
                  furnished with recommendatory letters from Castlereagh and Marshall, would now
                  leave for college. Amos closed his connection with the Institute; Marshall his;
                  Ann Eliza and Miss N——, theirs. And, besides these, there were fifteen or twenty
                  of the dayscholars who, as they came from a distance, would not all return—perhaps
                  few of them. The exercises of the day were gratifying to the teachers and
                  visitors, honorable to the pupils; and, with much earnest feeling, Castlereagh, at
                  the close, invoked on them the blessing of God. Then came the parting scene, when
                  hands were wrung for the last time, and "farewells" were uttered that were never
                  recalled.</p>
               <p>The sun went down, and darkness came, and stillness, and all but loneliness. The
                  wild ringing of the bell was hushed, the shout of wild enthusiastic boys was over,
                  the quick opening and slamming of doors had passed. A few lingered till the
                  morning, and early sought their night-rest; but most had gone to their homes, and
                  there was the usual quiet that follows the storm-time of a school-term.</p>
               <p>Before the midnight hour there was born unto Castlereagh a sweet little
                  SCHOLASTICA, a smiling, beautiful daughter, and Johnnie and Hobbie had a sister!
                  Welcome! welcome! sweet little FILLE! The cup of mercy and goodness is running
                  over. How dear is the little smiling daughter in the family of noisy brothers. She
                  comes the tranquilizer, the humanizer, the idol-pet. She is the added link that
                  makes life's chain complete, and the wonder is that you ever lived without her.
                  How the little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">garçons</foreign> came to love the little
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fille,</foreign> to kiss her velvet cheek, to smooth
                  her soft hair, to take her little hand, to watch for her first smiles, and to long
                  till she should creep and walk. How they danced and shouted, and threw themselves
                  on the floor, and bounded on the bed, and rolled over in their glee at every one
                  of her new little ways. And how they begged to carry her in their arms, and
                  declared they <emph>were</emph> big enough and careful. How, as she grew older,
                  they capsized carriage and all upon the grass, and cried with her, and said it was
                  "too bad; a badie, badie, old carriage, and they would never do so again." How
                  they stopped their ears when she scolded and screamed, and wondered if all babies
                  cried so! Poor things, they had forgotten their own babyhood!</p>
               <p>"Father," says Johnnie; "don't she grow handsome?"</p>
               <p>"Tolerable—yes—very."</p>
               <p>"I think she has pretty eyes," says Hobbie.</p>
               <p>"And what a sweet mouth," says the mother.</p>
               <p>"But, oh, mother!" says Johnnie; "do see her pretty nose."</p>
               <p>"See what a pretty foot she has," says Hobbs.</p>
               <p>"And what a dear little hand," says Gertrude.</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6389-00000170"/>
               <p>"Was there ever such a baby before?" says the mother.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sarah, ONE—and every mother has it," says the father.</p>
               <p>"See! see mother, she smiles!" says Johnnie.</p>
               <p>"Oh! baby," says impulsive Hobbs;" when will you run alone, hey?"</p>
               <p>"Take care, take care, little boy. You may hurt your tender sister;" says the
                  mother.</p>
               <p>"Fader," says Hobbie; "I wish we had a lot of brothers."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! good, my son—why so?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! because then we could play puss in the corner."</p>
               <p>"How many is a 'lot,' I should like to know?" inquires Johnnie.</p>
               <p>"Well, <emph>five can play it,</emph>" says Hobbie.</p>
               <p>"Why, we should have a houseful of noisy boys, indeed," says the father. "One in
                  every corner."</p>
               <p>At this the boys laugh and the baby smiles, and all conclude that they should have
                  a merry time of it indeed, if there were five boys in the house instead of two.
                  And says Sarah Matilda, "How nice to live in our own <emph>new house</emph> after
                  our own plan!"</p>
               <p>Castlereagh looks askance at her, and both smile at that idea. Alas! how many
                  plans, and few frames.</p>

               <p>THE health of poor Castlereagh must now be looked to. Evidently he is suffering.
                  The cough seems very obstinate, the expectoration profuse, medicine fails to
                  relieve him. He determined to visit Saratoga, and to take with him, as far as the
                  hills of Vermont, his beloved Johnnie, who was pining under the burning suns of
                  July and August, and perhaps extend his own trip to Quebec. We find him at
                  Saratoga. The following letter, termed "<hi rend="i"/>My Green Mountain
                  Excursion," will inform the reader how he reached that place.<ref rend="super"

                              <salute>"DEAR B——:</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>"It is wonderful in my esteem that there should be so wild and
                              magnificent scenery as the Green Mountains present untouched almost by
                              the woodman's ax or the miner's drill, so very near to the great
                              metropolis itself. It is but a short ride to them from your office.
                              Pray go and see them, and take a guide for the trout brooks and
                              lakes—it will do you good.</p>
                           <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6389-00000171"/>
                           <p>"The ride from New York, by way of New Haven, Hartford, and
                              Springfield, to Mount Holyoke, at Northampton, is very rapid, through
                              a delightful region of country, but singularly unvarying in its
                              scenery. The view of Long Island Sound, its bays, rivers, and islands,
                              is beautiful. The villages and towns you pass are enchanting and
                              home-like. The wide meadows teem with ripening fruits and corn; but
                              you grow weary by and by of so much taste and fullness, and order and
                              beauty. When your eye therefore catches a good view of a bold mountain
                              ridge, and you see other hills rising in wild grandeur beyond it, and
                              the blue hills and mountains go broken, and rugged, and towering,
                              leaning one upon the other toward the clouds, you first experience a
                              change from the monotonously beautiful to the sublime. Yawning is now
                              over, and you begin to wonder how the cars will get through, and
                              whether there will not be a grand 'slide' or two for your
                              accommodation as you thunder on. The traveler observes at New Haven
                              the bold and rugged bluffs of East and West Rocks, that have braved
                              and routed the dragoons of the tempest clouds in so many pitched
                              encounters, for, we know not the thousandth year! He looks with
                              awakened interest on the ranges of Meriden, the peerless Holyoke. As
                              you sweep up from the sea and along the river, and enter among the
                              mountain gorges, one tall summit after another rises into view,
                              stretching incredibly far away, till you fancy there is nothing but
                              hills and towering Alps in your path. And yet the river, the rail car,
                              and the stage, fine a way rather between than over them.</p>
                           <p>"We cross the State line of Massachusetts and Vermont. The mountains
                              are now near you, the valleys are narrower, the hills bolder, rugged,
                              covered with an ancient forest. At Brattleboro', where are the
                              much-frequented Hydropathic Hotels, Weselhoeft's and the Lawrence
                              House, we tarried a few days, and clambered up the Chesterfield
                              mountain, nearly one mile to the summit, where there is a rude tower
                              in a dilapidated condition, from whence there is a far-off scene of
                              mountain range that inspires the wildest enthusiasm, and turns the
                              soul's meditations on the POWER that created them—that built the
                              world. Below you, the Connecticut flows winding through the opening
                              gates of the mountains far downward to the sea. The busy, thriving
                              enchanting village is on its very bank, and rising gradually, studded
                              with cottages and farm-houses here and there, which ever decrease in
                              size and number as the eye stretches onward; is the upland in the
                              background that leads your eye at length to rest on the tall, dark,
                              and heaven-piercing summit of the Green Mountain range. We rushed down
                              into the valley by a winding stone staircase, by a curving path, by a
                              steep headlong slide, anon by a well-beaten road, and weary enough,
                              and ravenously hungry, bathed and dined at noon. As we could not now
                              visit the <emph>White</emph> Mountains, I determined to reach this
                              place by way of the<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6389-00000172"/>
                              <emph>Green.</emph> To do this, one must leave the railroad and take
                              the stage. Bennington lies at the foot of the mountains on the west
                              side, Brattleboro' on the east, forty miles apart—the whole distance
                              by stage. We left the latter village in the afternoon.</p>
                           <p>"The four and six-horse coaches of the olden time are now 'no more' on
                              this formerly great stage thoroughfare. Two horses, attached to a
                              covered Jersey-like vehicle that will seat six passengers comfortably,
                              draw you. Once in ten or twelve miles, fresh horses relieve the
                              wearied span. The first nine miles of this drive, though agreeable and
                              often wild, and not wanting in variety, is not peculiarly impressive
                              or inviting. Immediately after this, you find yourself creeping up the
                              hills by 'slow coaches' around long curves—up, up to high, and still
                              higher points of the hills. Then you reach the summit or a certain
                              ridge, turn abruptly a corner, and dash down into the valley on the
                              other side. The stream is below, the rude bridge over it. The stage
                              bounds across. You reach another ascending piece of the way. The
                              panting steeds again drag you up, and you strain your eyes away off on
                              the sublime mountains of the east, far, far beyond the village you
                              have left. Just before we arrived at Wilmington, the stage crossed at
                              sundown, the highest range it passes in twenty miles. There we saw,
                              apparently, the whole of the State of Connecticut and the greater part
                              of Massachusetts. Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke seemed but a short
                              jumping distance off. Monadnock, in New Hampshire, forty miles
                              distant, gave us his whole outline from the broad base to the
                              pinnacle. Ascutney, fifty miles off, shot up head and shoulders above
                              his compeers immediately near; and in the foggy, distant, cloud-like
                              drapery beyond, we deemed that we could see the outline of the White
                              Mountains. The village of Wilmington is in the mountains, situated on
                              Deerfield river (or a branch of it), having several hundred
                              inhabitants, four churches, with spires, a large and flourishing
                              seminary, stores and shops, a large hotel, and a large number of very
                              neat and commodious dwellings. It is well supplied with clergymen—one
                              of whom, I learned, lay at the time of my visit on a
                              sick-bed—physicians and lawyers. It is the only flourishing village
                              that occurs in this drive of forty miles, and I could but fancy it
                              grown dingy, somewhat, since the railroad had drawn off its coaches
                              and teams, heavily laden with passengers and freight. In the morning I
                              rose at an early hour, and would have seen the sun flashing his beams
                              over the eastern hills upon this beautiful valley of the Deerfield,
                              and gilding the mountain sides. But, no; clouds had gathered during
                              the night, not only obscuring the comet, but the moon and the stars.
                              It was also cold; fires were glowing in the stores, overcoats were
                              needed for the journey, and—hark! there is the tolling bell. At the
                              sunrisehour a low, mournful sound from the church tower echoed and
                              re-echoed among the hills, and carried up the serpentine way of the
                              streams, tells you—speaks to<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6389-00000173"
                              /> all the listening ears of the dwellers in the vale and on the sides
                              of the mountains, that the little sick and suffering child is dead!
                              The great King of Terrors is also in the mountain! Have I rode so near
                              to him? Is he not busy in the Southern cities, on the distant prairie,
                              in the hot and thronged metropolis? Yes; but he is also HERE! He is
                              every where, stopping life's current, and changing laughter into
                              wailing.</p>
                           <p>"My traveling companion this morning was a spare, sun-brown, wasted
                              figure of a woman sixty years of age. This was her first ride in a
                              stage! Sixty years of hard toil she had passed on these hill-sides,
                              reared her family, married off her children, save <emph>a boy of
                                 twenty-two,</emph> whom she now proposes, from maternal anxiety, to
                              visit, buried her husband, heard awful thunder-tones, and the swelled
                              torrent's roaring, and the tempest's uproar, but she has never been
                              within either stage or car! A godly, pious, Bible-reading, praying
                              mother—a Baptist. She goes to see her son; and <emph>he</emph> longs
                              for the ocean. <emph>He</emph> has heard of the "BOUNDING BILLOW." Ah!
                              William, William: thy mother and thee think differently of the world's
                              tossings and temptations.</p>
                           <p>"But what a magnificent ride we have through the mountain gorges, and
                              over their range. What heights ascend, wht summits bare, and rocky and
                              fearful, anon densely-wooded, and beautiful and far away, gaze on and
                              paint on memory's canvas. And the storm, too, yes, the cold heavy rain
                              comes on, and we button closely our overcoats, tie up the neck and
                              fold firmly the arms. The driver slouches his Kossuth, buttons to his
                              chin his 'fear naught,' and now, with two additional passengers, a
                              pretty school-mistress—who will leave us at some rude bridge and seek
                              her charge in the RED SCHOOL-HOUSE nigh to it—and a young gentleman
                              from Boston—having gained the highest point of land in his route, and
                              crossed the table-land, pitches boldly over the summit, and down along
                              the windings of as mad a streamlet as the mountains boast, urges his
                              high-mettled steeds. You look along the steep descent thirty or forty
                              rods, having gentle windings and numerous ridges or crossings over
                              which you are carried, sometimes with a violence that throws you
                              forward almost into the front seat, and the reaction casts you back
                              into a fearful proximity with the rear walls of the coach; then you
                              lose your umbrella bracings and cling to a post. Anon your feet lose
                              the quality of friction, and slide you nearly to their level, the
                              coach's bottom. But you regain as oft as you lose it, your
                              equilibrium, and smiling and chatting, brave the rapid, tossing and
                              jolting descent. The road is lost to the eye now. It makes a sudden
                              curve. There it is again, twenty, thirty rods before you; the ridges
                              awful to cros, the road steep and stony, the wild creek roaring along
                              its rocky channel, the road walled away from it—a dangerous proximity.
                              Away go to the Morgan bloods! Down, <emph>down,</emph> DOWN! Another
                              curve. The road seems lost. A little level is gained. We look up.<pb
                                 n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6389-00000174"/> The mountains are frowning
                              over our heads. We are going down into as wild a gorge as panthers
                              ever found, as the skulking savage ever loved. Again we are on the
                              verge of another descent. It is long, fearful, steep, worn by the
                              rains, close by the walls of the stream! Down go the bays, their ears
                              erect, their step light and careless, but see, how sure! Noble HORSE!
                              not a trip, not a falter, not a slide, not a misstep. If he were
                                 <emph>not</emph>—but he <emph>is</emph> sure! If the harness were
                              weak—but it is not. Is the driver afraid? He is <emph>not</emph>
                              afraid. Is he skillful? He is. Is he judicious? See, he lifts his
                              whip. The blow falls on his stoutest, best, wildest horse—it smarts a
                              second time and a third. We shall be hurled off the precipice! Not at
                              all. The horse must be trained to do his whole duty. We are in more
                              peril now than ever; the road rough, the descent sudden, and the blood
                              of the noble steed quickened to his very nostrils. We shall go down in
                              safety. Curving thus, and bounding thus, and hoping long for the end,
                              after a three, or four, or five-mile drive down the mountain, we reach
                              the stony level of Bennington, and dine leisurely (our nerves unstrung
                              by their excitement, the feeble widow vainly applying her handkerchief
                              to absorb her tears, either of suffering or of joy and gratitude)
                              alone at the hotel. Courage, good woman, you will soon find your son.
                              Your first stage-ride will, I fancy, not soon be forgotten—but the
                              next may be, if not so full of nature's wild and rough outside—so
                              grand and uplifting to the soul— more gentle and soothing, such as thy
                              shady side of earth's pilgrimage would seem to be thy due! Assisting
                              her to an easy top-buggy with a driver, I saw her depart to Pittstown,
                              over a smooth road, fifteen miles away, to meet her son.</p>
                           <p>"A good hard grip of J's hand at Bennington, a hurried dinner with
                              him, and I reached the cars again, lame, fatigued, and jammed in every
                              bone of the body, but completely happy! In the morning of the previous
                              day I had gone with Hll and Cr to the summit of the Chesterfield
                              range, and now had crossed the Green Mountains. I had seen more of
                              nature in her solitude, and beauty, and sublimity, in these few hours,
                              than I had hoped to see in weeks or months. Here, at our very doors
                              almost, is a world of wild green forest, and towering hills and
                              roaring streams, that may all be seen and appropriated to one's
                              enjoyment and improvement, and yet the traveler knows it not, or
                              hurries away, loth to delay his journey or to change its mode. But I
                                 <emph>will not</emph> soon forget the sweet sleep I had in thy
                              highlands Green Mountains! Nor thy sublime scenery, nor the perils (as
                              it seemed), and positively dashing drive down thy western slope and
                              gorges! Nor thy voices of truth, assuring me there are IMMORTAL
                              hills!</p>
                           <p>"At eight o'clock the same evening, I reached this place in the cars,
                              by way of Troy. But of course, after what had been seen in the wild
                              headlands of nature, every scene from the cars was tameness itself,

               <p>At Saratoga, if a man has any sort of respect for mineral beverages, the first
                  thing every morning, before breakfast, is a walk from the hotel to the Congress,
                  Iodine, or Empire Springs. When there he must not be too much in a hurry. It does
                  not look well to crowd, nor is it conductive to a calm imbibing of the sparkling
                  waters. One must stand and chat with his friends a few minutes, edging a little
                  nearer the fountain the mean time, and sharpening his thirst by looking how fast
                  the goblets are being filled and emptied. He must observe how carelessly the
                  people quaff off two, four, and six glasses, and how ceremoniously they smack
                  their lips, and try to wipe the tears from their eyes. Above all, he must feel in
                  his purse for a few coppers for the waiters, and not be a sneak in this respect.
                  It aids much in making way with five and six glasses to have an idea that the
                  waiters are not tired of dipping up for you. He must, by all means, put on an
                  easy, cheerful, healthy look, for nobody <emph>at</emph> Saratoga wishes to be
                  considered an invalid. Let him rub his cheeks into a glow, bite the pale out of
                  his lips, puff out his cheeks, flourish his cane in the air, walk erect, look
                  perfectly complacent, never cough out loud, nor talk about ill health, unless it
                  be of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> and dyspepsia. Call and fee Doctors
                  A., B., and C., because it is fashionable to take a blue pill, and pretend to be
                  prodigiously rigorous with yourself about health. Still this must be all assumed.
                  It must be assumed by those who see your gay and easy carriage, that you are one
                  of the most thoroughly observant dietetics, pilltakers, and water-drinkers at
                  Saratoga. This will atone for all seeming dissipation and inconsistencies.
                  Saratoga is a capital place to study character, yet the last place in the world to
                  learn it. Character there is generally put on, or seen the other side out. And yet
                  it is a clever set of anomalies, do and say what you will about it. He had better
                  be at home digging clams, boot deep in the mud, his current employment, who can't
                  play well a ten thousand-dollar part at the Springs.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh drank the waters, and walked in the groves, and rode in the cars, and
                  listened to the music, and visited the Indian encampment, the Lakes, the
                  Battle-ground—the Waterloo of America—the racegrounds, the beautiful country, read
                  the newspapers, visited the Post-office three times a day, became familiar with
                  the lions of the place, and was after all-exceedingly lonesome, nervous,
                  debilitated, not very well. He really went to Saratoga in pursuit of health,
                  hoping for quiet, and a retired, agreeable sojourn there. But every day he heard
                  more noise, grew more discontented, and thought of leaving. Hardly, however,<pb
                     n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6389-00000176"/> would he form this intention than a
                  waiter, with a card from some friend, would be at his door, and a ride or a walk
                  would postpone all action of that sort to another day. Letters from home kept him
                  cheerful, and after a time he really began to think himself curing up.</p>
               <p>One morning he observed at the breakfast-table, immediately opposite to him, a
                  young man with spectacles, very dark hair and features, with mustache, well
                  dressed, though negligently, and a determined eater, especially fond of strong
                  coffee. His self-possessed and easy manners interested Castlereagh, and the relish
                  of his coffee imparted a little of its aroma to his own cup. As he lingered after
                  most had left the table, and cried out, "Waiter! coffee," Castlereagh did the
                  same, and as they stirred in milk and sugar, they began to eye one another, and,
                  says the stranger,</p>
               <p>"I see you like coffee, sir."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was obliged to say "Yes," although he thought the stranger used two
                  words for himself.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the other, "I always drink coffee at the Springs. It's a happy offset
                  to blue pills and Congress-water."</p>
               <p>"Then you are not an invalid, nor a careful dietist?"</p>
               <p>"I am, sir, both—a great scrofula-invalid, and remarkably thorough in my diet,
                  always excepting, sir, you know, at the Springs!"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! I supposed it might come to that."</p>
               <p>"Yes. You see the waters don't do any body good while here, but after you get
                  home. I am laying a foundation here to build on when I once get away—do you
                  perceive?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes; I perceive a great many inconsistencies."</p>
               <p>"Just so—'inconsistency'—that's the word. Inconsistency at Saratoga is the very
                  order and science of health at home. A man gets used up at the Springs, and goes
                  home to diet and recruit."</p>
               <p>"A very ingenious and useful method of spending money and time," said
                  Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"Extremely so, sir," said the other with a smile;
                  "Waiter!—<emph>coffee.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was amused, and stirred and sipped gently.</p>
               <p>"Now, friend," said the other, "just take a fresh hot cup, and it will set you up
                  for all day; depend on it now—'my word for it,' as we say at WILLIAMS'."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, thank you," he replied; "I more fear it would put me down."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, not at all. Why, sir, strong coffee well made is a decided
                  stimulative, and will relieve the system instead of packing it and deadening. Now,
                  sir, I almost killed myself on weak coffee—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is bad, I know," interrupted Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. You see this scrofula development; well, sir, it made its appearance
                  under the diluted-coffee<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6389-00000177"/>
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">regimé.</foreign> But strong coffee is fast using it up,
                  you see, hey?"</p>
               <p>Castlereagh did not know how it was.</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes," says the other, "it is very plain. Why, sir, I weigh more, sleep
                  better, eat heartier by ten per cent. than a fortnight ago."</p>
               <p>"Possible?"</p>
               <p>"True, sir. And I go back in a year to Williams' a new man."</p>
               <p>"Hope you may, sir. Then you are not through at Williams'?"</p>
               <p>"Through! oh, no, sir. Another year, a whole year, sir. And I am glad of it, for I
                  love college, sir, and would stay there ten years if it were possible."</p>
               <p>"It is hard to break away from college."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dreadful, dreadful. But I am going to try it now for one year."</p>
               <p>"Why so?"</p>
               <p>"Because, rather run ashore for funds and a little in bad health. Why, sir, you
                  won't credit it me, perhaps, but it is a fact that I am now looking for a place to
                  earn money for a year to go back at the expiration of the time and finish out at
                  college. This I do with the consent of my good old father, heaven bless him."</p>
               <p>"And who, if I may be so bold as to inquire, is your father?"</p>
               <p>"My father, sir, is the Rev. R. James, of B——, Vermont, and I am his oldest son,
                  Horace——"</p>
               <p>Castlereagh leaped out of his chair, and stretched his arm across the table. "Why,
                  my dear young friend!" said he, "your father was my early preceptor, and fitted me
                  for college."</p>
               <p>"I knew it," said young James, "I knew you the first time you sat at this table a
                  fortnight ago. (Waiter! COFFEE!!) Why, my dear sir, do you suppose I have lived
                  from infancy in B—and have heard you preach every year on your annual visit to
                  your native town, without recognizing Elbert Castlereagh?"</p>
               <p>"Well, but why have you not spoken to me?"</p>
               <p>"Because you never before gave me an opportunity."</p>
               <p>"Extraordinary! Why, I remember you now very well. Your mother I recollect. Your
                  father I revere as I do no other man on the face of the earth. I hope we shall see
                  each other often while here."</p>
               <p>"It will be very gratifying to me, sir," said Horace.</p>
               <p>"And you are looking up a place for business out of college for the ensuing
                  year?"</p>
               <p>"I am."</p>
               <p>"It is to be regretted that you can not go immediately on."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but seriously, I am ashore for funds and in need of relaxation."</p>
               <p>"What business do you desire?"</p>
               <p>"I have no great choice, provided it pays well."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh invited him to his room. There they conversed together for an hour,
                  and when James left it, it was as an engaged tutor in the Lindenvale Institute for
                  the coming year.</p>

               <p>Castlereagh wrote a short line to the Rev. Mr James on the subject, and the
                  following note to Sarah Matilda.</p>

               <p>CASTLEREAGH arrived just in season to attend the funeral of AUGUSTUS, a very dear
                  friend of his in Lindenvale, who, after a long sickness, during which he gave
                  himself away to the Redeemer, died in the good hope of one of his own dear
                  children, weeping over his sins, and looking up into the face of Jesus with the
                  assurance of immortal life.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."</p>
               <p>A cold, funerals, preaching, the excitement and labor of term commencing, poor
                  health to work with—these prostrated Castlereagh, as he had never been before; and
                  his people began to say of him, in whispers at the first, which grew louder by and
                  by: "He has not long to stay with us!"</p>
               <p>Who has looked on the grim countenance of death, from scenes of activity,
                  prosperity, happiness, and usefulness, without a shudder—without manifold
                  shrinkings of heart and throbbings of his nature? Who has<pb n="348-349"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000179"/> not turned this way and that for shelter? who has
                  not prayed, and wept, and wrung his hands, and sighed, and cast an imploring eye
                  on his wife and children, and on all his house, and on every familiar object, and
                  by the multiplicity of life's home-scenes brought an argument against death's cold
                  presence that, he would fain persuade himself, should foil him? And yet, the
                  footsteps of the grave king, come they nearer still? Do the lineaments of his
                  countenance become more indicative of failing strength? does discouragement
                  accompany labored breathings, heavy eye-lids, paling cheeks, and trembling nerves?
                  Does he near you still, from whose cold touch the warm nature shrinks? And where
                  is the refuge—where the Rock inassailable to which you may fly and feel secure,
                  from whence you may exclaim: "Rejoice not over me, oh, mine enemy! neither make
                  thy boast over me, as over the slain?" Is there such a hiding-place and tower,
                  where the winged arrow can not fly? where the fallen nature shall fail of the
                  death-wound? Nay, there is none such. But there IS a weapon of victory over even
                  death. There is relief from the fear of his coming. There is that overcometh this
                  gret enemy of our life. AUGUSTUS, LUCY, MARY JOSEPHINE, found it. In FAITH they
                  were more than conquerors, and could exclaim: "Oh, grave! where is thy victory.
                  Oh, death! where is thy sting? Thanks be to God, who giveth us US the victory,
                  through our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was forced to contemplate the dark and fearful side of life now, and
                  to ask himself the solemn question: "Can I bid the world farewell?" After a long
                  and intense struggle, he was enabled entirely to rest his spirit in the hands of
                  Christ, and calmly endure the breaking over him of affliction's waves and billows.
                  They came.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the manifestation of ill-health, and the desire of his heart for
                  rest from care, he never had more business to occupy him than now. The time
                  arrived for the commencement of the school, and as he must go on, or stop, there
                  being no half-way course, he determined to proceed. His school was extensively
                  advertised—thoroughly known in the community, and he had more applications than
                  usual for admisssion into the family. His rooms were all full, and the
                  school-desks were uncomfortably crowded.</p>
               <p>Punctual to his engagement, Mr. James arrived the evening before the term
                  commenced. He was looking brown from exposure in his travels, was robust, and in
                  good spirits. He was kindly and warmly welcomed, and forthwith made himself at
                  home. Castlereagh, after introducing him to his family, conducted him to the room
                  prepared for his accommodation in the south-east corner of the Institute. Here he
                  could have an immediate care of the pupils lodged around him, and also attend to
                  their evening pursuits in the large STUDIO adjoining. This was a long ante-room,
                  looking out on the south, with a large stove, and tables in the center, desks,
                  seats, and benches along the sides, with reflectors<pb n="350-351"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000180"/> ors here and there to make it light, and the walls
                  embellished with highly-wrought maps, paintings, lithographs and heads. Nine doors
                  opened from it with as many dormitories, that looked out on the east, north, and
                  west sides of the Institute, embracing together a most unrivaled scene of beauty
                  and grandeur.</p>
               <p>It was a delightful hour from seven o'clock to eight in the evening, which those
                  pupils passed in the studio together, each one seated at his desk or table, Mr.
                  James overseeing their studies, and Castlereagh, or some other member of the
                  family occasionally dropping in. It never failed to interest Castlereagh as he
                  made one in their group, and witnessed their industry, contentment, and progress.
                  "Here," he would say, "if it can be found on earth, is happinesss. And here is the
                  promise of good-will to man and peace on earth. Here is the 'DREAM' fulfilled. It
                  was not in vain that I commenced this effort, although 'I am expiating' some of my
                  errors in the management of affairs. Was it not an 'heavenly impulse,'
                  notwithstanding so much of disappointment, trial, vexation, and suffering?"</p>
               <p>To the great joy of all, and rather unexpectedly, Miss Henrietta Buckley returned
                  and resumed her position in the school, her sister being apparently convalescent.
                  Fitz Maurice, Edgar, Eaton, Erastus, Underhill, William, Eleanor, Ann Eliza, and
                  many others, formerly in the school and family, had left. But new pupils came in
                  their places. Harry Otis and Hayden returned, but S—— did not. James Hallock,
                  William Roberts, and John Crosby were received.</p>
               <p>Ann Eliza Castlereagh left her brother to visit relatives at the West, and Sarah
                  Matilda urged her own sister, Blanche Haywood, to pass the year with her as an
                  assistant in music. The invitation, greatly to her relief, was accepted, and the
                  pupils in music were placed under her immediate care and instruction. The family,
                  with the boarding-pupils and teachers, now numbered from twenty-five to thirty
                  persons. This was as large a number as Castlereagh could accommodate, without
                  considerable expense and labor in altering his house, a matter, which although
                  often designed, his ill-health, prostrating his strength and checking his ambition
                  and prosperity, compelled him to abandon. He had already ascertained that the
                  "DREAM" was not all true. He had found many occasions of severe discipline, and
                  many scenes had risen before him that showed him the indiscretion of youth, and
                  how unreliable they were even in respect to his most practicable plans and most
                  cherished theories. He had come to see and feel the "wear and tear" of the
                  Scholastic—to experience the realities of the school-room and the burdens of the
                  practical school-teacher. Here was a class of fiery, headlong fellows. There a set
                  of dull, phlegmatic boys, and another group were surly discontents. Here and there
                  were found faithful ones and zealous students. But by far the greater part were
                  thankless of their opportunities and a long way off from the Millennium<pb
                     n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6389-00000181"/> lennium. It was hard work to get out of
                  them good lessons, and harder still to get them into any enthusiasm, hardest work
                  of all to inspire them with a religious ambition and a life-purpose of duty. He
                  came to know that there were fine scholars and pure hearts, and also to see how
                  delightful was the work to educate a certain portion of them; but he found that
                  they were a decided minority, and that life's <emph>labor</emph> was with the
                  great, dull Democracy. He found some comfort as he reflected on the future of
                  these same pupils, in this, that they would be the better for his
                  exertions—although not very high up, even then. Poor Castlereagh! about to reason
                  himself repaid, although far down the hill of his ambition. The romance of the
                  dream vanished. What remained was all the commonest hard work of life, the natural
                  consequences of the curse in the Fall. He found that his theories went into
                  practicalities with very indirect movements, and that although education is
                  eminently desirable, and religion indispensable to happiness and true greatness,
                  yet neither the one nor the other can be had cheap. There must be brain-work and
                  heart-work to accomplish results so truly desirable. In this he was not so much
                  disappointed as in the discouraging influence on himself of these labors, and
                  constant familiar intercourse with a work of such incessant exertion. He was in
                  five years worn to a shadow, and his energy of character lay all shriveled and
                  torn, like the faded banner that in the sleet-storm of December froze to the
                  Seminary flag-staff, snapped all night in a fierce gale, and was at last lowered a
                  mournful-looking memento of its former beauty. Still Castlereagh, as he thought on
                  his busy life of late, dared not say it had been better not to have been. He dared
                  not wish it other than it was, except that it might, with the same exertion, have
                  been riper in results. And at last he saw that men may plan, and dream, and work,
                  but it is God alone who giveth the increase, and God alone to whom is the glory,
                  and that in the weakness of the creature shines out the power of the Creator.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was pained to see the impress of anxiety and care wrought on the
                  countenance of Henrietta Buckley. She had evidently passed a tearful series of
                  weeks in the presence of her suffering, uncomplaining, drooping sister, Abbie. But
                  there came now some new hopes in her heart (and in the sick one's), and in the
                  hearts of brothers and of parents, that the loved one would be restored to
                  them—nay, they believed it. With one voice they bade Henrietta leave home and its
                  consequent confinement, and seek relief in those agreeable circles at the
                  Institute from which she had voluntarily banished herself so long.</p>
               <p>Entering warmly into one another's ideas of classification, the teachers, with a
                  little help from Castlereagh, who now walked about with a staff, brought the
                  Seminary, at present overflowing with scholars, into a very happy and promising
                  arrangement of classes. After the morning's devotions, four of the pupils
                     attended<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6389-00000182"/> tended to their music
                  practice or lessons. In an hour, they were succeeded by as many more, and so
                  through the morning and a part of the afternoon. The advanced class in Latin, and
                  the advanced class in Greek, were first heard by Mr. James, the reading classes by
                  Miss Henrietta. Then alternating, she attended to a large class of beginners in
                  Latin, while he gave instruction to the higher classes in reading, and the power
                  of letters and words. These exercises were followed by recitations in geometry,
                  algebra, surveying, and arithmetic. These came in four divisions. To them
                  succeeded geography and grammar. The branches more deservedly entitled ornamental
                  and light, were made the order of the afternoon. Also M. Dupont came every
                  afternoon from the city, and taught a class of twenty pupils in French.</p>
               <p>There were, besides Castlereagh, Mrs. Castlereagh, and Blanche, and those
                  instructors and teachers already named, four assistant pupils, one of whom had in
                  charge a class of juveniles of good families; and thus the work went daily on.</p>

               <head type="sub">INVOCATION.</head>
               <p>THE school progressed happily. Castlereagh was compelled to give it up almost
                  entirely into the hands of others, although seldom so unwell as to be confined to
                  his room. Occasionally he would seem to rally and be himself again. He often met
                  and conversed with his pupils, as formerly. But his evenings were frequently spent
                  in the retirement of his study or chamber.</p>
               <p>On one occasion he was disturbed by learning that the boys disagreed among
                  themselves, and, that for some days, two of them refused to speak to each other.
                  Again Hallock complained that Hayden had poured water from his window, in the
                  partition, on to his head when he was asleep. Hayden said "he only sprinkled him a
                  little because he wouldn't rise at prayer-bell." But Hallock, affirming that he
                  poured a stream on him, Hayden replied, "That whether it was little or much, it
                  was in retaliation for his filling his boots with water, and drowning in it his
                  stockings, 'to boot.'" One day Roberts came trembling and<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000183"/> crying, and said "that all the boys had pitched
                  against his door, broke it, crowding off the lock; and then fell upon him and beat
                  him. He did not know what he had done to deserve it. On inquiry, he found that
                  Roberts had armed himself with a club and a pistol, and then, calling the boys
                  cowards, dared them to attack him, which they did, and, routing him, he fled to
                  his room and barricaded the door. But unfortunately, one of the boys, in his zeal,
                  pushed against the panel too hard, cracking, and injuring it considerably." But
                  the informant was told, as in all such cases Castlereagh made it a point to inform
                  the party complaining, that he could not affix punishment to one party alone when
                  it was made to appear that both were guilty.</p>
               <p>Every thing of the kind excited Castlereagh, and greatly injured him. It retarded
                  his improvement, or it accelerated his decline. And "the year was bound," he said,
                  "to be unfortunate." Hardly had the term half expired ere it became imperatively
                  necessary that Henrietta should return home to recommence the sisterly care of the
                  now re-drooping Abbie. One of his bright lads was taken by his father to the
                  distant West. Another, coming out early one Monday morning from the city, was
                  knocked down in the street by a furiously-driven span of horses, and taken up
                  insensible. It was several weeks before he left his room. Another it was thought
                  advisable to dismiss, and still another, on account of sickness, left; and the
                  Institute, notwithstanding every attention on the part of Mr. James, who found his
                  hands and time wholly occupied, seemed to lose its former prestige, and, like its
                  proprietor, droop. Yet never was there a more cheerful winter passed in the family
                  than this. They were nearly all musicians. They were, many of them, friends of
                  long-standing, and felt at home with each other. They commiserated Castlereagh,
                  and sought to lighten his burden of care. They spent many a pleasant evening
                  together, and were happy also in the society of many young and interesting persons
                  of the village. The cheerful scenes at the Institute home, left no room for a
                  desire to rove abroad in quest of evening amusements. Seldom did either the young
                  gentlemen or ladies ask permission to spend an idle hour away, although, not
                  unfrequently, there were evenings when the whole family of boarders had
                  invitations out.</p>
               <p>During the winter Castlereagh seldom officiated in his pulpit. Many and many a
                  "bright, holy Sabbath day" he passed at home; often walking his study, stopping
                  for a moment at the window, from which he looked forth on his house of worship,
                  and, sighing in spirit at his seclusion from its hallowed services, and then
                  resuming his trembling tread across the apartment. Now ruminating on the ways of
                  Providence, and noting how various are the methods by which he administers the
                  reproof we have incurred by sinning; anon, perusing the Word of God, seeking, by
                     prayer,<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6389-00000184"/> his support, and acquiring
                  ever some clearer insight of his heart. These Sabbath days whiled away at home,
                  though days of rest to his physical nature, were often drooping days to his soul,
                  for they were the "iron that entered" it, the thorn that pained him. Why must he
                  be denied to tread "thy hallowed courts, thou city of my God?" By degrees, it
                  became something of a habit with him to suffer this suspension of his privileges,
                  to look out of his windows on the passing, cheerful group, strong, young, and
                  healthy, wending their way to the house of prayer. He acknowledged the justice of
                  the correction, and felt that he could offer up with his heart the utterances of
                  his lips, "Thy will, oh God, be done." Under circumstances of this nature, so
                  trying to a pastor's heart, dwelling on the blessings, and the necessity, and the
                  grace of the Sabbath; his thoughts would sometimes find expression thus:— <q>

               <p>The nature of his illness forbidding him much exercise or exposure during the
                  winter and spring, it occurred to him that as he could neither preach nor go
                  abroad, he might occupy himself in the work of preparing a manuscript for the
                  press. Writing did not seem to weary him, and as his expenses were considerably
                  increased by his indisposition, it being, in addition to other charges, often
                  necessary for him to hire preachers for the Sabbath, he thought himself at liberty
                  to employ his pen in that way. When he came fully to entertain the idea, he seized
                  his pen and sat down to write. The first dash of the ink showed him that he must
                  have something definite to write about. He must decide the character if his
                  work—whether it should be a dictionary, a spelling-book, a history—what kind of
                  history? a biography—whose? a tale of whom—and where? a scientific work—of what
                  science? a religious work, a poem, an autobiography, a compilation, a book of
                  psalmody, a book of sermons, a book of prayers and homilies? Finally he concluded
                  that he would write a book that should contain some interesting reflections on all
                  subjects, based on a compilation of unquestionable facts, to be called "The Modern
                  Factotum Omnium Gatherum." Pushing his pen along quite vigorously, he, at the end
                  of twenty-five pages, found himself against a stump, and concluded the subject
                     <emph>too</emph> general! Throwing the pen aside, he ruminated two or three
                  days upon the matter, and concluded to write a work of a practical, miscellaneous
                  nature, for common reading. He wrote ninety pages, and tore them up! For a week he
                  seriously contemplated writing a new school-book, on the ground that this was a
                  department of literature not fully occupied! but gave it up. By this time he had
                  begun to feel a real ambition in the enterprize, had bethought him of a new,
                  proper, and simple method of procedure, had decided on the kind of book he wanted,
                  its title and object, and sitting down anew, in six weeks he ended his manuscript.
                  Taking it to an excellent publishing house in New York city, it was published
                  anonymously, went, in a few months, through several editions, and yielded him the
                  snug sum of six hundred dollars. This was a relief to him, for as the spring term
                  drew near its close, Castlereagh was distressed to find that he was, to some
                  extent, embarrassed. The very great expenses of the year, united to his own
                  indisposition, had thrown the balance of accounts against him. He was therefore
                  gratified for the relief which so unexpectedly came to him, by which his notes due
                  in April and May, at the bank, were met without any difficulty, and some small,
                  uncomfortable bills discharged.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE PARLOR EXAMINATION.</head>
               <p>THE last day of the term arrived, the last half-day, and last half of that. There
                  were assembled in the large parlor of the parsonage the whole group of pupils
                  belonging to the Seminary, to receive their presents. The musical examination and
                  the closing address of their teachers were also to come off. The music was
                  performed with much good taste and spirit, some little misses playing admirably;
                  and among the young gentlemen, Harry Otis and Hayden excelling.</p>
               <p>The young ladies were seated in front of the piano and immediately around it,
                  while the lady visitors, their parents, and friends, occupied chairs near the
                  walls. The boys sat further back, and behind and around them were the gentlemen
                  present. The music ended, a large table, that occupied the center of the room was
                  uncovered, exposing to view the beautiful and varied presents—medals, fancy
                  baskets, elegant books, rich and highly-polished knives, beautiful portemonnaies,
                  and many an article exceedingly delicate and pretty of less cost and pretensions.
                  Castlereagh, pale and feeble, though not yielding to his complaint, nor murmuring
                  at its dispensation, found himself once more among his beloved young pupils, about
                  to reward them for their perseverance and success in their studies and varied
                  branches of mental culture, and to bestow, beside the prizes, some little
                  testimonial on every one of the good and happy number before him. He was also
                  reminded of his physical decay, of the shortness of time, and that this might be
                  the last of those interesting scenes in which, for five busy years almost run, he
                  had so often had a prominent and interesting part to perform. Johnnie, carefully
                  dressed for the occasion, stood near his father, and as the names of the
                  prize-holders were mentioned, the prize assigned was handed to the little fellow,
                  and by him taken and presented to the fortunate pupil. Thus were distributed first
                  and second prizes for scholarship in general; first and second prizes for
                  behavior; prizes in original composition and declamation, in penmanship, in
                  drawing, and for music.</p>
               <p>There is always danger, as prizes are usually conferred on pupils for superior
                  talent or success, that much ill-will may be engendered in the hearts of those who
                  are disappointed; that bitter feelings and caustic remarks may be indulged toward
                  the teachers, and the evil of discontent arise, and the malignant poisons of
                  jealousy and envy circulate, to the neutralizing of all the good that was sought
                  by the bestowment of rewards, and to the hinderance of a proper, healthful<pb
                     n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6389-00000187"/> action of many minds ever afterward.
                  Castlereagh had seen this, and he had adopted the course of presenting, at the
                  close of the school, a <emph>testimonial of regard</emph> to every one of the
                  scholars, not always equally costly, and <emph>prizes,</emph> at the same time, to
                  those who had fairly won them. The effect was eminently happy. He observed that
                  the mind of the pupil was painfully convulsed when, failing of a prize that had
                  been labored for, he came to the last hour of the term, and was made to see his
                  rival crowned and made a hero, and THE scholar, while himself, though but a single
                  half dozen marks below him, was wholly ignored! He observed that the fact of the
                  disappointed pupil not obtaining any notice, other than in a complimentary,
                  extempore remark general to the school, was very oppressive and mortifying. He
                  accordingly determined that while the prize system should not be abolished, he
                  would ingraft with it the testimonial reward system, which should be a personal
                  token from himself to each one of the pupils. It is true this would require some
                  expense, occupy time, and add to his labor. But it would gratify and encourage the
                  pupils. Castlereagh went repeatedly to New York and elsewhere to make selections
                  of articles appropriate to be distributed among them. Once he purchased, at no
                  very great expense, a large invoice of English illustrated books, which he
                  carefully assigned among his scholars, according to merit, greatly to their
                  pleasure. He had the satisfaction to notice that a present given to every pupil,
                  in the same public manner as the prizes, although called a present, and not a
                  prize, had the effect to soothe down the irritation of the school often consequent
                  on the presentation to certain ones of special marks of favoritism, and the
                  rewards for successful rivalry in the diplomacy of class recitations, while it did
                  not essentially alter the JUST value and position of the prize.</p>
               <p>When the prizes and gifts had been all presented, and every face was beaming with
                  intensest pleasure and gratification, Castlereagh addressed them a few moments in
                  a calm and cheerful way, assuring them of his interest in them all, and saying
                  that he did not despair yet of regaining in a good degree his health, that he
                  might continue to instruct them; but whether he should long survive or be quite
                  laid aside, he rejoiced in their youth, their health, their talents, their
                  happiness. He then invited them to accompany him in their thoughts while he opened
                  his mouth in prayer to God. They were all in a moment hushed to perfect order, and
                  listened most attentively; and many a one wept and bethought him of the
                  seriousness of life, the great, only theater of, and preparation for, death.
                  Castlereagh then bidding them all a kind "good-by," they soon went pouring forth
                  from the house, uttering their farewells, shaking each other warmly by the hand,
                  weeping, embracing, saluting. Oh, blessed days of school remembrances, how ye come
                  up, thronging visions of by-gone happiness and joy! Oh! how ye<pb n="366-367"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000188"/> hold out the tantalizing cup of other days—those
                  school days gone, never more coming back to gladden us, and bid us drink its
                  joy—bidding, but withdrawing it from our too eager lips.</p>
               <p>An open and familiar correspondence between Castlereagh and the excellent and
                  truly friendly father of Harry Otis, in relation to his son's future course, led
                  them both to the conclusion that it would be well for the young man to enter
                  another institution more immediately calculated to prepare him for the business
                  into which he would finally enter. Castlereagh knew it was best that Harry Otis
                  should leave him, but there were many tender chords that must break as they
                  parted—many hot tears gush forth—many a trembling word be spoken.</p>
               <p>The parting, however, came in the morning. All the evening and early morning, the
                  boys and girls were very busy "packing." Mrs. Castlereagh, and Blanche, and
                  Gertrude assisting here and there, especially the younger girls, some of whom were
                  to return no more. Alas! how can be spared the gentle, loving Isabel, whose
                  tractable, affectionate disposition and winning ways have earned her the frequent
                  caress, the ever-approving smile, the tender love of the whole circle. Go, dear
                  child, lavish thy full heart's treasures upon the happy group of re-united
                  sisters, bless with thy sunny presence thy fond father's cheerful home. Trunks and
                  carpet-bags disposed of, Stella accompanies Isabel on her farewell ramble over the
                  Seminary grounds. Each sheltered study-nook, each rabbit-coop and chicken-fold,
                  each see-saw and swing is visited. A formal good-by bestowed upon the school-room,
                  and the circuit finished, the warm-hearted creature threw herself into Blanche's
                  embrace, and weeping, wished <emph>almost</emph> she need not go.</p>
               <p>But at length the omnibus and stages arrived, and then there was loading, bustle,
                  hurry, confusion, shaking hands, and warm, affectionate adieux. Castlereagh leaned
                  upon his staff, and bade them one after another a cordial adieu, and kissed them.
                  He said but little to Harry Otis, but followed him with his eye, and kept near him
                  with his heart. At length, all were nearly arranged and seated in their places,
                  nearly all had said their farewells, nearly all had taken last embraces. It was
                  Harry Otis's turn to leap into the stage. It waited for him, but he stood
                  immovable. He could not move till he had taken once more, it might be the last
                  time, his beloved preceptor by the hand, and begged of him an interest in his
                  prayers and a place in his warmest recollections. Castlereagh seemed instinctively
                  to read his thoughts, and as Harry Otis turned toward him, he dropped his staff,
                  and casting both his arms around him, held him to his heart.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; I know what you would say, my son. I shall never forget you. Go, and
                  may the Almighty bless you and prepare you for his heavenly kingdom."</p>
               <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6389-00000189"/>
               <p>"Sister," said a weak, pale, emaciated sufferer, "I am near now to my last, long
                  night. <emph>This</emph> night you must abide with me, and sleep by me, and help
                  prepare me for <emph>that.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Human language can not depict the suffering that Miss Abbie Buckley experienced
                  during the long twelve-month wherein many a time it would have been sweetness
                  itself to die. Oh, no, she could not enjoy then so great a mercy, but she must
                  linger on, and abide the will of her Heavenly Father and Saviour. Hopes and wishes
                  had induced many a one to say that she would eventually recover. But the word had
                  gone forth to the angel, and he had been drawing down around her the folding of
                  his wings in their mighty compression, reducing the life-principle to a mere
                  dependency on their opening or folding up. A little space the breathing in her yet
                  occupied; but that little was too small to assure her of life—far too small to
                  answer the great end of life, and she felt that she must be gathered to her
                  fathers. For her there was a silent, painless grave, a sure rest, and beyond the
                  grave a peaceful and glorious home.</p>
               <p>So Henrietta staid all that night with her. She folded her in her arms, she fanned
                  her, she calmed her, she spake to her of Jesus, the sinner's friend and sacrifice.
                  She prayed with her, wept over her, fondly, oh, how fondly! loved her. Yes, for
                  she was a darling sister—the only one. They had lived and loved together. How many
                  days, how many nights they had passed together! How many visits made together! How
                  many letters written and received! How many little sisterly confidences enjoyed!
                  How many tears in secret dropped over their youthful sorrows! How they had grown
                  together to mature youth, and were looking forward on the bright coming future of
                  life! Alas, alas! was it in vain? Must the angel of death hover on his wing so
                  near! The lights in her apartment give a faint glimmering. The steps that move now
                  and then across it, are as soft as a child's. The breathings of the young
                  angel-bound spirit are gentle puffings of life's-breeze going down to a perfect
                  calm. The youthful bosom is fast waning its virgin life. The life-love of the eye
                  is burning fainter. The maiden ringlets fair, are comfortless. The lip-smile
                  begins to perish. The voice-melody, to sink in diminuendoes out beyond the human
                  organism, and to symphonize with the ethereal instincts and celestial divinities
                  of song. The senses palsy. The vermilion pencilings of material nature fade into a
                  lustreless pallor. The brow is marble, the cheek alabaster, the lip inflexible as
                  ivory. It no longer reddens and changes, and expressed mirth, and song, and love.
                  Too truly in the fainting maiden is it seen and sung, <q>
                     <p>"TAKE ME HOME TO DIE."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At the early dawn she passed from life like a beautiful bird of passage, who first
                  sings his departing song, and then on noiseless wings flies away on his<pb
                     n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6389-00000190"/> joyful, distant, aerial journey to
                  other climes. The younger sister yielded sweetly her life to Him who gave it, and
                  her days on the earth were ended. Ended the sweet voices of her songs. Ended the
                  lovely notes of her harp. Ended her sufferings—earth exchanged for heaven—prayer
                  for praise.</p>
               <p>During her weary confinement to the sick-room, she frequently sent to Sarah
                  Matilda and Castlereagh kind messages of affectionate remembrance, which they laid
                  up as treasures in their hearts. Human beings seldom suffer more in one brief year
                  than she suffered. So far, it was to every friend she had on earth a cause of
                  thanksgiving and of tear-drops of gratitude, that death came to end the scene, yet
                  mourned they the necessity of such a joy.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE GOOD AND THE EVIL INTERTWINE.</head>
               <p>WHEN the summer term commenced, Henrietta could not return, and Mr. James having
                  but few scholars, thought that with Gertrude's assistance, he might attend to the
                  recitations. Blanche Hayward still rendered assistance with music. The school had
                  fallen away from eighty pupils, many of them large, talented young gentlemen and
                  ladies, to thirty or forty, far younger and less advanced in studies. The
                  long-continued indisposition of Castlereagh brought a blight upon his school that
                  no energy or devotion in others could withstand or relieve. All saw it, all felt
                  it; but there was no other way than to submit to the inevitable fate. Mr. James
                  exerted himself faithfully to secure the remnant of the institution to Castlereagh
                  as a means of solace in his afflictions, and endeavored to buoy him up with the
                  hope of brighter scenes by and by. But the latter knew that he could do no more,
                  and that the vitality of his proud "dream" enterprise was irrecoverably gone. The
                  organic remains were yet visible, but the sarcophagus was ordered, the sepulcher
                  begun. See him. He lately dreamed such a glorious dream of life! Now, having<pb
                     n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6389-00000191"/> sought at every sacrifice to realize
                  it, lo! the result. He is emaciated, feeble, prematurely old, with awkward and
                  unsteady movement, exciting pity; cadaverous, hollow-cheeked, hollow-eyed, and
                  cane-supported. The boys and girls in their play move cautiously from his path,
                  lest they should stir the breeze too rashly against him, and throw him down. He
                  rests upon a staff, and repays them with a smile. He leans against the flag-staff,
                  and anon climbs the fence, and sits upon it, eyeing the sportive groups around
                  him, or gazing on the inaccessible mountains. By dreams decoyed, by dreams
                  bespoiled, this, <emph>this</emph> is Castlereagh. But yet he clings to life, or
                  life to him, and something seems to whisper, "fear not." He would again,
                  to-morrow, engage as thoughtlessly as at the first, were this calamity
                  overpast!—No, not with quite the same confidence, but with alacrity and zeal. It
                  would carry him off, to live idly; and if a little better in health, he would
                  regard it as a prohibition to rest. Yet there are teachings in sickness. He who
                  has never been ill, and long ill, dangerously, painfully so, has not enjoyed, in
                  all his good life, the benefits of those teachings which come from our Father on
                  his children, whom he loves! Writhe under them though we may and must, yet are
                  they the heavenly lessons for our good! He who has never been ill, knows little of
                  the tender compassion of friends and neighbors—knows little of his own love of
                  life—little of his great dependence on the Author of his being for every mercy,
                  even the commonest he enjoys.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh was indeed an invalid, faint and weary, but not utterly cast down.</p>
               <p>It is tiresome to live so; yet thus he lived. The summer was one of interest,
                  activity, and enthusiasm in the family, notwithstanding the sad decline of
                  Castlereagh. Every evening came some one of his beloved people to call on him, yet
                  every evening was he a sufferer, every night bolstered up in a chair, or on his
                  couch, vainly seeking for rest and sleep. How many weary hours of those summer
                  nights he passed, while others softly and soundly slept! Every evening the parlors
                  were filled with the gay and cheerful spirits who, either in the departments of
                  the school and family were associated together, or were intimate friends and
                  acquaintances in Lindenvale. Mr. James took much interest in these circles.
                  Frequently there were present Mr. S. A——, Mr. G——, Mr. O. H——, Mr. R. R. P——, Mr.
                  Z. M——, Misses R. A. ——, T. I——, S. M. H——. L. R. —— Hortensia M——, etc., etc.,
                  and these with Sarah Matilda frequently among them; Gertrude, Blanche, and her
                  sister Agnes, and Effie; and subsequently Gertrude's young cousin, Miss Catharine
                  Rutherford, her assistant in the school, whose admirable execution of the most
                  intricate and surpassingly beautiful music, charmed every hearer. These were often
                  met together, and Hayden, Wallace, Robert, Jairus, Stella, Cornelia, Johnnie and
                  Hobbie filling in, with a not infrequent call from Castlereagh himself, the
                  company at the parsonage was extremely cheerful, and<pb n="374-375"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000192"/> songs, music from flute and piano, conversation,
                  reading and games, with walks by the moonlight, on the mountain's brow, and along
                  the streams, and fishing parties on the ponds and lakes at twilight and in the
                  evening hours, and merry see-saw sportings on the grounds of the seminary, and
                  rolling of the foot-ball, and swinging in the stout, high swing—these, merry all,
                  constituted a summer scene of happiness and active pleasure seldom surpassed, and
                  one on which the memory fondly lingers. And in these hours thus rolling by, and
                  scenes no more to return, there were often felt the higher emotions and love to
                  God. Even their mirth had in it much of thoughtfulness and reverence; and it led
                  to sacred songs and cheerful friendly intimacies, never degenerating into rudeness
                  causing trouble and sorrowful remembrance.</p>
               <p>At the opening of the summer term, Gertrude, as we have said, assisted in the
                  female department. The number of pupils was limited. The boarders few.</p>
               <p>One evening Castlereagh said to Gertrude, "You are looking very pale and weary.
                  You are excessively fatigued or unwell—perhaps both."</p>
               <p>"I am not very unwell, brother, but I am fatigued. The care of the school-room is
                  new to me, and I have been very much annoyed to-day by two circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Pray tell me what they were."</p>
               <p>"The first was the careless spilling of ink by one of the young ladies, which
                  greatly disfigured one of the outline maps, and worse than that was her apparent
                  indifference about it."</p>
               <p>"Never mind the map, sister. Perhaps you were mistaken about her feelings."</p>
               <p>"If I could think so it would greatly tend to relieve mine;" and Gertrude with
                  difficulty restrained her tears.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, never mind, sister; this is a queer world—a—I had almost said a bad
                  world. There is always something in it pushing aside your hopeful dreams, and
                  spoiling many a happy plan. But these trials work off after a time, and do us
                  good. Never mind, never mind, child. What did she do?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! she said the ink was always spilling, and the map always in the way. She did
                  not even seem to care whether the ink was removed from the desk, or the map
                  cleansed and restored to its place."</p>
               <p>"What did you say to her?"</p>
               <p>"I told her that an accident of that kind was half atoned for by consistent
                  behavior and sorrow, and required her to show something of each before I should
                  again grant her any indulgences."</p>
               <p>"Very well; I can trust you. Now please mention the other trouble?"</p>
               <p>"The other—was—my own impatience under trials and little annoyances, such as
                  whispering, loud studying, unnecessary shuffling of feet, repeated inquiries for
                  assistance, and leave to do this, and to do that. It seemed to me there never was
                  so much of it before,<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6389-00000193"/> and that a very
                  small increase of it would drive me crazy."</p>
               <p>"The annoyances of the school-room are, I well know, constant and grievous; they
                  are very great trials; insurmountable, however, only as we lose the grace of
                  patience."</p>
               <p>"I think so, myself. But patience is sometimes attacked unawares, and where she
                  had placed greatest confidence, as Hobbie's experiment of melting ice in the
                  tumbler confirms."</p>
               <p>"How was that?"</p>
               <p>"You remember how he placed a tumbler, with water frozen in it, on the hot stove
                  in the parlor in order to melt the ice. Directly, however, the glass cracked and
                  fell apart, the water and ice escaped on to the stove, and hissed and steamed away
                  like an engine. His cries brought you and all into the room, you remember, and he
                  threw himself into your arms, wildly, exclaiming, 'Oh! fader, fader! I did n't
                  know it was <emph>explosive!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! Oh! yes. Little Hobbs, little Hobbs. Well?"</p>
               <p>"So our patience is sometimes suddenly, unexpectedly surprised."</p>
               <p>"True. We need great wisdom and care in all that we do. You will, I think, have no
                  difficulty in the management, and you will acquire more fortitude to meet these
                  trials as you longer meet them. And you know that your cousin, Katie Rutherford,
                  will be here to assist you in two or three days."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes; and every time I think of it, it seems to me I must fly to meet her, and
                  hurry her along."</p>
               <p>When Miss Rutherford arrived, the young cousins made a division of the time and
                  labor, which very greatly relieved Gertrude, and Castlereagh was delighted at the
                  cheerfulness with which the duties of the school-room were performed by them.</p>
               <p>Castlereagh having a furlough of six months' release from the cares of his parish,
                  attempted a little work in his garden, short visits to friends, and journeys.</p>
               <p>Accompanied by Sarah Matilda, he paid a visit to CLIFFORD, in his parish of L——,
                  where he passed a delightful, unforgotten fortnight in June. Too weak for long
                  walks or rambles, he could climb the hillocks and forest-crowned eminences that
                  rose on every side immediately in the vicinity of the beautiful town, taking care
                  to go up without haste. He could fish along the bubbling rivulets for trout. He
                  could pull up the weeds that threatened destruction to the young plants of the
                  garden, and hoe the young potatoes and corn. He also laid out a winding path to
                  the summit of Grove Hill, behind the parsonage, and worked it with his own hands
                  so that even he could climb it without any uneasiness or sinking of his frame.
                  Here he indulged himself freely in quaffing, every day, a large quantity of the
                  pure, soft, spring-water from the hill-side, and in frequent bathings in the same.
                  This fortnight at L—— greatly renovated him, and his flagging spirits revived. The
                  brothers and sisters held a sweet season<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6389-00000194"
                  /> together, daily communing as only brothers and sisters, long separated, can
                  best appreciate.</p>
               <p>But there was a painful trial awaiting him. Castlereagh daily resorted to one of
                  the public stores of the place to read the morning paper from the city. One day it
                  happened that as his eye glanced along the columns of the paper, it was arrested
                  by a short, soul oppressing notice. It was to this effect: "DROWNED while bathing,
                  near York, Pennsylvania, where he was engaged as an assistant teacher in Mr. B 's
                  school, Mr. WORTHINGTON IDE MARSHALL, aged twenty-three, a graduate of Yale
                  College, of the class of 1852." Castlereagh at first did not seem to know what he
                  was reading, and re-read the paragraph. He then was conscious of a sort of painful
                  compression of the heart, and began as he read it over and over, to think the name
                  appeared like some one with whom he had been acquainted. By little and little did
                  the whole mystery unfold itself in plain fearful fact, and nearly sinking to the
                  floor, gasping for breath, he moaned, "Gone! also. MARSHALL, the good, the pious,
                  the strong—one whom my soul loved!" Castlereagh, pale with the intenseness of his
                  grief, passed hastily homeward, thinking of that sad mourning sorrow of David, the
                  King of Israel, which led him to exclaim "Oh! Absalom! Absalom! my son! my
                  son!"</p>
               <p>It was with sorrow inexpressible that the news was announced by him on reaching
                  the parsonage. The surprise and grief of all when it was told them caused a
                  suspension of other conversation and led every one to indulge himself in repeated
                  exclamations of lament at the disaster, and of warm encomium of the departed.</p>

               <p>WHEN Marshall left Lindenvale, he betook himself in the fall to Philadelphia, and
                  entered his name as a student in the celebrated medical university of that city.
                  In the spring he was led to undertake the situation of a teacher in one of the
                  departments of Mr. B 's Sherwood School, at York, Pennsylvania. Here he intended
                  to reside for a few months during the season when there is a suspension of the
                  medical lectures.</p>
               <p>The labors of the school being over for the day, it was proposed by him and
                  another teacher to accompany the lads of the school to the river to bathe.
                  Desiring Mrs. B. to delay tea for half an hour beyond the usual time, away they
                  all went and proceeded to enjoy their bath. Marshall and his companion were strong
                  and expert swimmers. There is a dam across the river where they were bathing, and
                  they, leaping from it, swam down the stream for a long distance and returned
                  sportively toward the point from whence they had started.</p>
               <p>"I love the water," shouted Marshall.</p>
               <p>"Oh! it is magnificent sport," replied the other.</p>
               <p>"Yes! I used to tell CASTLEREAGH that I was a water-fowl. Ha! ha! Born on the
                  water! ha! ha! Love the sound and smell of it!"</p>
               <p>"It's royal!" cried the other.</p>
               <p>"I told him," said Marshall, "I loved to breast the sea-waves, and was at home in
                  the whirpool! ha! ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"Look out!" shouted a hoarse voice from the shore. But Marshall heard it not.</p>
               <p>"There's a strong current <emph>here,</emph>" cried he.</p>
               <p>"Strike off this way!" replied his companion.</p>
               <p>"There's an 'under-tow' here!" cried Marshall, breasting the tide that he felt
                  bearing him away. His friend turned to look upon him, and just at the instant saw
                  him struggling; his arms were thrown wildly in the air, his great strength
                  revealing itself for a moment as his form, convulsed with a desperate effort, rose
                  half out of the dark fierce whirlpool into the center of which he had been
                  incautiously and ignorantly drawn. The next moment he disappeared, and one of
                  nature's young braves, one of her noble sons, one of the faithful and promising
                  earth fund a watery death. From that dark whirlpool where MARSHALL died, no one,
                  if by chance engulfed there, ever returned alive. Not<pb n="382-383"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000196"/> long previous to his death, it had drawn in a large
                  boat containing a man and a boy, both of whom perished, and within a short period
                  comparatively, five persons had been lost there. Yet poor Marshall, a stranger, in
                  his ignorance went too near its vortex and perished also, though "born on the
                  wave," fond of the foaming cataract, and the combing sea, the water being his
                     element.<ref rend="super" target="#note_019" xml:id="return_019">*</ref>
                   In vain the supper-party tarried his return the desired half-hour; the
                  deep and angry whirlpool claimed his body, and played with it in its dark and
                  treacherous caverns. In three quarters of an hour the lifeless form was cast forth
                  out of them, and anxious, weeping, afflicted friends seizing it from its strange
                  and awful baptism, bore it in murmuring wailings to their home.</p>

               <p>"Wailing!" Well may they wail. There is wailing in the air, wailing in the deep
                  itself where he perished. The waters wail for their child. There is wailing afar
                  off. wailing in the distant homes, wailing in the MAIDEN'S bosom, wailing in
                  Castlereagh's heart—in Lindenvale; in Yale, at the festival of surviving
                  classmates; in the chambers of the sick; among the good who meet for prayer; among
                  those who roam the forest and climb to the mountains brow. Wailing for those who
                  called him teacher—yonung men and maidens. There is wailing that one such spirit
                  has so meagerly perished. That death should <emph>steal</emph> upon him so! Yes,
                  there <emph>is</emph> wailing, bitter, yet unavailing grief. Marshall died in a
                  moment—died in the element he loved, and thought he could control—died he in the
                  fullness of his strength, and the bright opening of his manhood! Let the hearts
                  all wail for him that loved him. He has gone quickly to his last, his cold, his
                  wakeless slumber—and yet! He will awaken at last!</p>
               <p>Eleanor had returned from the South, where she had been employed as a governess in
                  a family of children; and, having been called to bury her father, was engaged as
                  teacher of an interesting school of young ladies in a neighboring town when this
                  calamity befell her. Sad, drooping, sack--clothed MAIDEN. Go, cast thy sorrow on
                  the Lord, He only can whisper to thee peace. She retired to her home, the true
                  type of sorrow; and, when Castlereagh, long after, saw her, the traceries of a
                  soul-sadness were still on her young features; the sighing of her virgin heart had
                  not been quelled.</p>

               <p>"Yes," said Castlereagh to his school; "although he died young, suddenly, died
                  where there could be offered him no help, we may conclude the pangs of death were
                  soon over; and that he was prepared, even under the awful manner of his exit to
                  leave this transitory state and appear before God. He died a Christian—a young
                  CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR; and, in eternity, he will be employed in the ceaseless

               <p>RETURNING home to the old scenes with this additional shock to is nerves,
                  Castlereagh was no better. The gentle air he had breathe, and the quiet life he
                  had led, at Clifford's, were now but pleasant memories. He breathed again with an
                  oppressed chest. His fever rose high daily; he cough—oh! that maddening
                  cough!—returned on him; the catarrh annoyed him. Entering his garden the next
                  morning he was sorry to observe that, in his absence, the cow had found her way
                  into the grounds, and had eaten up his young peas and corn, besides trampling down
                  his strawberry-beds. One of his most thrifty young peach-trees had been broken by
                  the boys in their rude play around it. His grape-vine was partly blown down by the
                  wind, and the arbor needed his attention. The weeds were sadly in the ascendant
                  every where. One of the first objects that met his eye was a rude iron knife bent
                  in the form of a scraper, which was hanging in a young plum-tree, just as it had
                  been left there, a long time before, by Marshall. It was an instrument he had
                  fashioned with which to wee out the strawberry-beds.</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6389-00000198"/>
               <p>The last time he had used it he placed it in the true, where through the storms of
                  winter it had rested, and <emph>now</emph> rested, undisturbed. This little
                  memorial agitated him sadly, the other circumstances distressed him. Every little
                  trial vexed him. The weather was too hot; the children too mirthful; the school a
                  burden; expenses were enormous; debts were accumulating. His fine, intelligent,
                  numerous school, of from eighty to a hundred pupils, was reduced to thirty. Mr.
                  James, with the assistance of Gertrude and Catherine, had no difficulty in hearing
                  every lesson an class in the school. The old staff of teachers had been swept away
                  by the force of circumstances, oppressing and fatally crippling the proprietor.
                  Mr. James was too friendly and too philosophical to complain. He would have
                  preferred a full seminary of scholars, and those more advanced, but saw the
                  necessity of making, for Castlereagh's sake, the most he could out of the school,
                  and appearing interested. Castlereagh, wandering around his premises, became
                  painfully aware of the change that had taken place, and the great failure that
                  would occur if the effort was continued. Assembling his teachers in his study on
                  Friday evening, he laid before them his intention to close up the seminary as soon
                  as the term should end. There were many tears shed over the unhappy necessity, but
                  all acknowledged that this was the only feasible course open before him.</p>
               <p>"My life," said Castlereagh, "is in danger."</p>
               <p>"It may be saved," said Mr. James, "if you divest your mind of these cares."</p>
               <p>"A good ship, in danger of sinking, is sometimes saved by casting overboard the
                  cargo," said Blanche.</p>
               <p>"A very good idea!" exclaimed all.</p>
               <p>"It must be immediately done," said Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>"But how shall we dispose of the Seminary Property?"</p>
               <p>"Never fear for that," said Sarah Matilda. "How many persons will immediately
                  apply for it when once it is advertised for sale!"</p>
               <p>With this opinion all seemed to agree, and it was Castlereagh's intention
                  forthwith to divest himself of the great care of his Institution, which now was no
                  longer a pleasing solace in his hours of trial, or a comfort in seasons of
                  self-denial and active labors to do good, but a burden of intolerable weight—an
                  everrecurring theme of anxiety and disquietude. The tides of prosperity were gone.
                  Henceforth the dull subsiding waters of his life's stream would but bear him down.
                  The twilight DREAM had proved itself a dream, and DUTY alone was real.</p>
               <p>It was announced in the papers, on the same day that the term closed, that the
                  Institution was for sale, in consequence of Mr. Castlereagh's ill heath.</p>
               <p>We will not describe the closing of the school. Rather let the sympathizing and
                  meditative consider how sadly the soul of Castlereagh was stirred by seeing before
                  him the last remnant of his popular Institute, and, for the last time, undertaking
                  to reward them, and to<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6389-00000199"/> utter his
                  farewell speech and earnest blessing. Let them imagine, vividly, the great change
                  that must have taken place in him, in the school, in his emotions, and warmest
                  aspirations, and most confident belief at the Dedication of the Institute. Let
                  them dwell on the necessity that compelled him to his present course, and enter
                  into his feelings. They can not otherwise than feel a sorrow in his anguish, and
                  wish to draw over the scene the tender vailing of compassion.</p>
               <p>So ended the Lindenvale Institute as a seat of high students, the pleasure-seat of
                  literature under the young and enterprising pastor of Lindenvale. Like the
                  sea-tide, it had its rise, its flow, its ebb. Castlereagh could not contend with
                  his own fate. Overborne by a protracted, prolonged, and obstinate sickness, the
                  grand IDEAL of his life passed away from his grasp for ever. The midnight gloom
                  followed the sunlight of his Dream, and Castlereagh felt the iron had entered his
                  soul! PEACE! Let him weep!</p>
               <p>The key was turned, the massive doors of the Institute were closed, and in a few
                  days, where there had been daily, for several years, clouds of boys and girls
                  passing quickly over the smooth grounds of the school, and where were heard always
                  the gay shoutings of the merry ones—all was hushed—all was still, save the sighing
                  breezes, save the chirping sparrows. And there, wandering alone, leaning on his
                  staff, sadly, mourning, murmuring, leaning against the flag-staff, picking up
                  relics, gazing on the clouds, and weary of the hours of every day, there was the
                  drooping and disappointed Castlereagh.</p>
               <p>The autumn passed away and winter, yet was not the property transferred to other
                  hands. Castlereagh advertised it extensively, and received immediately letters of
                  inquiry in reference to it. There were made him many personal applications. Not a
                  few letters came to him from distant States, making the most minute inquires on
                  the subject. To each of these letters he gave long and precise answers, and
                  frequently took pains to draw a ground-plan of the buildings and a sketch of the
                  premises. He kept no account of the number of these applications, but they could
                  not have fallen far short of fifty. The most intense disappointment often
                  succeeded to the most confident expectation of a sale, and he became at last truly
                  weary of letters and calls on the subjects. He made excursions, varying in
                  distance from ten miles to an hundred and twenty-five, to fulfill engagements with
                  different persons who proposed to buy of him. But not one of these succeeded. Not
                  a letter of dozens received resulted favorably. Occasionally it happened that a
                  gentleman and his lady came from a distance, and tarried one or two days,
                  conversing about the purchase, with whom Castlereagh found sweet intercourse, and
                  in whose hands he would most cheerfully have confided the interests of his school.
                  Such was the case when his friend T—— and his accomplished lady, of M——,<pb
                     n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6389-00000200"/> Ohio, came, and were charmed with the
                  place, and prevented from purchasing it only by pecuniary difficulties then
                  pressing at home. But generally these interviews resulted in little pleasure and
                  in less pecuniary profit.</p>
               <p>There were various objections urged by the applicants: "The sum asked is too
                  great"—"the security is too stringent"—"the buildings are not in the right
                  shape"—"there is too much room"—"it will cost $2000 to put the Institution in
                  order." Some had supposed it distinctly a school-house, and not a residence, and
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versâ.</foreign> Some wanted it for a
                  boarding-school; others for a day-school. Some for boys, and others for girls. A
                  certain class would pay a large rent for the premises, and hire them for a term of
                  years; and various plans and propositions were made sufficient to prove, beyond
                  all controversy, that the real old genuine schoolmaster was abroad. By far the
                  greater part of the persons so making application were too poor to purchase; and
                  giving a long, last, lingering, <emph>wishful</emph> look at the prize they
                  coveted, turned away, and were heard of no more. Men and women of all ages,
                  fortune, and talents, were aroused and put afloat by the advertisement of
                  Castlereagh Institute for sale. It was generally believed that the proprietor had
                  made himself rich by his enterprise, and that if one could step into his shoes, he
                  would also obtain wealth. But they were careful how they bid on the premises; of
                  the risk they might incur of paying Castlereagh for his work of years and
                  expenses, by which, through advertisements in the papers far and near, by
                  circulars, catalogues, and extensive correspondence, necessary repairs and
                  improvements, he had brought up the Institution from nothing into an
                  immediately-paying one—the would at least insure any scientific and industrious
                  teacher a positive good living income. Yes; they cheapened down the
                     <emph>good-will</emph> of the Institute to nothing. <emph>That</emph> they
                  could attend to! You will find there is not a great deal of liberality of feeling
                  toward you, if you have property of this description to work off. And I fancy it
                  is so generally. But all schooldom seemed to shake itself and awaken, to look at
                  this opportunity of investing funds and starting in a new enterprise. The omnibus
                  did a fair business—the post-office paid well—railroad stock advanced—pen, ink and
                  paper were in demand—<hi rend="i"/>Hon. and <hi rend="i"/>Rev. titles were flush,
                  and also Esqrs., Drs., Capts. Still, the property hung on, and still the
                  advertisements in the larger papers went their weekly round over the whole extent
                  of the United States. Do not flatter yourself that you can dispose that because
                  the schoolmaster is abroad, with his silver-headed cane, he will buy you out the
                  first time he meets you. He earned his money by the square rule, and he will
                  cipher it all out in arithmetical numbers, prove it algebraically, and demonstrate
                  it by the toughest logarithms before he will decide on any <emph>risk.</emph>
                  Castlereagh had plunged headlong into his enterprise;<pb n="392-393"
                     xml:id="VAC6389-00000201"/> it involved him mercilessly; and yet it was poor
                  health that cast the deepest shaft in his wounding. He proved to this own
                  satisfaction that is entered on under favorable circumstances as to location, with
                  sufficient funds and good management the boarding-school is no dangerous
                  enterprise. Ordinarily it will pay well. The day-school is less remunerative, far
                  less agreeable. And the boarding-school, to result well in every respect, must be
                  established on an expensive well-furnished plan throughout. It had better cost
                  twenty thousand dollars than five thousand. But, it the country a showy,
                  well-regulated and extensive school may be established at a cost of ten thousand
                  dollars. To many this may seem extravagant. It will not appear so to any one who
                  tried it—to none but tyros. It will be necessary to economize in your expenses to
                  make the ten thousand go as far as you wish it may. This sum, large as it may seem
                  to a certain class of persons, will be refunded in the gross almost immediately;
                  and the net profit is considerable in every case where the Principal and his own
                  family can perform a good share of the instruction. There are few good schools on
                  such a basis as this, where the charges are less then two hundred and fifty
                  dollars for an academic year of forty or forty-four weeks for every pupil. Of
                  course, four of these amount to a thousand dollars; and ten times four are ten
                  times as much, or ten thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>There is very little difficulty in obtaining scholars, if you have an inviting,
                  extensive, and well-organized school. Failures more frequently arise where, with a
                  thousand or two thousand dollars, and every department crippled correspondingly,
                  one undertakes to engage in the business. He can neither charge conscientiously a
                  generous price for this terms, nor announce boldly to the public his
                  accommodations. Nor can he ordinarily secure other than third or fourth-rate
                  pupils; at least, he can't expect the first class, i. e., intelligent,
                  gentlemanly, well-paying pupils. He therefore, who borrows and pays interest on
                  two thousand dollars, to engage in the matter of a boarding-schools, will
                  frequently still owe the money, when the borrower of ten thousand dollars in a
                  similar enterprise, will have paid it, and become somewhat independent. Still,
                  there must be careful management, and as much of the teaching as possible done in
                  the family of Principal.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FOX-HUNT—THE AUCTION, AND OTHER ADVENTURES—LUCY.</head>
               <p>ACCOMPANIED By Gertrude and Catharine, Castlereagh commenced his annual journey to
                  the North in August. The month was excessively warm and dry. The asthma sorely
                  afflicted, and at times prostrated him to the earth. If he attempted to climb over
                  a wall, or to ascend a small hillock, or a flight of stairs, the effort would
                  often deprive him of all strength, and almost wholly interrupt his power to
                  breathe. The cough would greatly aggravate it, and the expectoration continually
                  weaken and annoy him. Moreover, August is said to be the asthmatic's hardest
                  month. Three hours every night Castlereagh was subject to its tender-mercies, and
                  oft during the hours of the day when others ate, drank, and were merry, he with
                  convulsive effort drew every breath, and leaning on his staff wearily, if from
                  home, sought to gain the hospitable threshold, and apply such remedial agents as
                  could be obtained. Yet what great tenacity we have of life! Although during these
                  paroxysms, he suffered so much that Gertrude and all her friends were very
                  anxious, fearing even the final sundering of the cords of life, and the departure
                  of the spirit itself, no sooner were they past and the convulsive breathing
                  quieted, than he rose up, walked his apartment, entered cheerfully into
                  conversation, and except at times when more than usually weak, was able to ride
                  off over the hills, or wander away with gun in hand long distances in search of
                  adventures.</p>
               <p>Young Henry one day coming in told Castlereagh, who was then stopping at the BRICK
                  COTTAGE of his brother H——, situated on his retired, rural farm, high up among the
                  clear hills, above the fogs, and jauntingly inclining its green sides to the east
                  and north, the abode of health, happiness and piety—that he had that very morning
                  encountered a fox in the swale while out after the pony. This aroused in
                  Castlereagh the hunter's ambition, and the next morning, with loaded gun, he was
                  on the way to the fox-ground long before sunrise. Stealthily he made his way over
                  the wall. His heart fluttered as he crossed the glen. His eye roved from object to
                  object as he climbed the sods, passed round this bog, leaped upon that, and
                  emerged on harder soil; then threaded the swale. His breathing became hot and
                  sharp as he thought he saw his victim, and waited, stooping behind a log, or
                  gently resting over the edge of a moss-covered boulder till he knew he had been
                  deceived. He examined his "fire-lock;" all was right, and he slowly advanced under
                  cover of every object which<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6389-00000203"/> the nature
                  of the ground allowed him, till he had gained a position that enabled him to sweep
                  the whole field with his eye without moving away. Here, with a huntsman's heart, a
                  throbbing anxious heart, he watched for sly Reynard, till his whole patience
                  wearied, and he became aware of the danger he incurred of losing his breakfast if
                  he tarried much longer. He accordingly rose up from his crouching posture, took a
                  long bold look through the swale, and then slowly, with trailing careless weapon,
                  gat him along homeward over the sunny side of a smooth hillock where in the winter
                  a fox and her young had been caught by the hunters in her hole. As he passed over
                  the sharp brow of the hill, his eye rested on the very object of his morning's
                  search reposing on the sand about ten or fifteen feet off! Yes, there was Reynard
                  himself! Sly, sleek, waggish Reynard! But he was not caught napping. Oh! no. His
                  eye and Castlereagh's met at the self-same instant, and both made a simultaneous
                  spring. Castlereagh sank instantly to the earth and brought his death-dealing <hi
                     rend="i"/>blunderbuss into position. The fox leaped at once six feet from his
                  lair. and swept down the hill with inexpressible activity. In fifteen seconds the
                  parties were no longer in juxtaposition favorable for death or victory, but the
                  advantage lay with Reynard. In the mean time Castlereagh with unsteady eye
                  traversed the barrel of his weapon and pulled at the lock. Why! oh genius of the
                  field! Why! oh envious fortune! Why! oh ye shades of gunnerdom and bog-boots!—why
                  was not that game bagged? Castlereagh pulled valiantly at the trigger of the lock,
                  and wondered why it refused to play. But there it was. In vain the sportsman kept
                  his eye along the gun-barrel on the bounding and cowardly retreating fox. In vain
                  he wished to see the flash, and hear the report, and see the victim fall. Alas!
                  the lock is but half-sprung, and <emph>can't</emph> go. Was there
                     <emph>ever</emph> such luck, such another lock, such a painful case? Quick as
                  possible under the circumstances, he brought the lock up to its place, and then
                  followed the flash, the loud report, and—Reynard—was—safe. Himself aware of it, he
                  halted now, turned round, raised one foot in the air approximating to the side of
                  his nose, wagged his tail, smiled a cheerful good-morning, and before the piece
                  was again loaded, was off, and half way to Knowtown, a parish that borders upon
                  Blamstown!</p>
               <p>After this adventure, Castlereagh declared he would hunt nothing but foxes. He was
                  wont to call the escaped Reynard <emph>his</emph> fox, and many a morning after
                  that left his couch early to waylay and murder him. But the fox, probably wisely,
                  never showed himself in the swale or glen as long as Castlereagh visited it with
                  powder and gun, greedy for his blood. The disappointed, hunter, in his letters to
                  his friends about this time alluded to the escape of the game in terms far from
                  commendatory of the gun or the animal. He was of the opinion that if the gun had
                  gone off at first he should have secured the fox; and if the fox had<pb
                     n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6389-00000204"/> been less agitated at his presence, and
                  more disposed to remain where he was, even the slight circumstance of the gun
                  being at half-fire, might have been rectified in season to have made an end of the
                  chase. As for himself, why to have played such an intimate part in this grand
                  fox-hunt was always glory enough, ignoring all his blunders, and the final escape
                  of Reynard. Castlereagh was further wont to say that foxes did not expect to be
                  killed now-a-days, mauger the improvement in fire-arms, because it was an igenious
                  age—an age reflecting as happily on brutes as on rational beings. Formerly one
                  rifle ball would kill any man, now-a-days a whole six-barreled revolver is fired
                  off on one poor victim, and even then he escapes or dies hard. "A man," said
                  Castlereagh, "does not expect to be killed now-a-days under any circumstances. If
                  a train is smashed up, he expects to live through it, although he may get bruised.
                  If a stage, with the Governor of Rhode Island<ref rend="super" target="#note_021"
                     xml:id="return_021">*</ref>
                   and his family inside, in crossing the Alleghanies, is thrown over a
                  precipice, and rolls over and over a hundred feet or more to the bottom of a crazy
                  hill, nobody is killed, not all wounded. Were one to fall from the summit of

                   perambulating the streets and paths and rural scenes and places of the
                  town, visiting the public baths, library, and places of general interest, as his
                  strength would permit, Castlereagh passed away a few weeks. On his return-way
                  home, he spent a few days with a relation at the delightful town of G——. One day,
                  said M—— to him, "You shall go with me—I have an easy vehicle, the day is
                  peculiarly mild—on a drive out of town, about five miles, where my business as an

               <p>"Yes," said Castlereagh, "I will attempt it. But what is the auction?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," he replied, "my old friend, the Rev. S. D——, jun., the talented historian
                  and divine of E——, has been dismissed, and his goods and real estate are to be
                  sold, preparatory to his departure to the West."</p>
               <p>"Well, that is a piece of news, I confess," replied Castlereagh. "I am truly glad
                  to bear you company. You know I was once acquainted personally with Mr. D——."</p>
               <p>"To be sure. Well, immediately after we have dined, we will set off."</p>

               <p>"I will be ready."</p>
               <p>They arrived on the ground in good season, ere many of the "bidders" came after a
                  rapid and most charming ride. Part of the way the road was through a plain, then
                  it ran along a wild embowered stream in a glen, anon wound up the mountain, and
                  over the high-rolling tumuli far up in the clear untainted atmosphere of the green
                  sunny hillocks, and refreshing juxtaposition to the clouds.</p>
               <p>Perched on the apex of a sharp hill, where the mornings sunlight first seemed to
                  fall, and his last evenings beams to linger, where in the distant south, through a
                  long, peculiar vista of sloping hills and converging forests, one looked down on
                  the meadows bosom of the far-distant, silvery, dazzling river, and surveyed the
                  countless ranges and piles of mountains in the great basin area, and on the east
                  beheld a glorious distant horizon, and on the west grand ranges of everlasting
                  hills, and on the north the same—there stood the venerable old parsonage, erect,
                  aristocratic, parallelogramatic, with its square front, its antique portico, its
                  faded white, its dimmed green on the blinds, its partially-racked gate-way, and
                  fence of rounded and sharpened pickets. Here were the old hospitable parlors,
                  dining-rooms, and kitchen, where for forty or fifty years, the father first, and
                  after him the son, had held the home of a parish priest among the people of these
                  rural glens and hills. And they were true SCHOLASTICS, drifting never on the
                  lee-shore of underdone mind, nor floundering on the quicksands of superficiality
                  and flatulence. All around the house is there the good, old-fashioned, untrameled
                  green lawn, wide for carriage turns, and for the colts and calves, and herd to
                  rove along safe from hateful hoof or horn. And sheds of various size, and hue, and
                  occupancy, ran along from the house to the old brown barn, that held a northern
                  shield against the bleak breezes and tempests.</p>
               <p>The old home was now to be resigned, the property, in-doors and out, to pass under
                  the hammer of the modern auctioneer, and ere the old line conservatist scholastic
                  lay in his silent house, Young America would plant himself on the rich prairie
                  soils of the West, and serve his generation more according to the age!</p>
               <p>On the ample grounds around the square old mansion, perched on the hill-top, as we
                  have said, there were spread out the collected utensils of household life, indices
                  of many generations of struggle against an accumulation of domestic luggage! from
                  oldest pattern, raw, unpolished andirons to modern, brazen-top, do.; from cradles
                  antique, and chairs beyond the memory of man, to those in modern vogue; cupboards,
                  wheels, tin-ware, rockers, stoves, desks, shelves, pots and kettles, timeless
                  clocks, and germless seeds; redundant moldy paraphernalia of cellar, garret,
                  closet, and ash-hole, by-place alley, and shelf-loft, brushed with dainty varnish
                  for the occasion, came out into the sunlight on this pleasant day once more, and
                     changed<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6389-00000206"/> owners once again, gaining
                  new storage for a time.—Poor old TIME—ever thus sadly borne down with past things
                  as well as present! Hard work to the auctioneer made they. Carriages, sleighs, and
                  harnesses, of long gone-by utility, shining in their oily dressing-gowns for the
                  occasion, went off to the very highest bidder—not very tall at that; so went the
                  fine, fat, sleek mooly cow and calf; so the old mare and colt; so went the hay. So
                  the well dried and packed wood; so the corn and fruits growing in the field; so
                  every thing; so the old weather-beaten HOMESTEAD itself—to the highest bidder all.
                  The highest bidder is king at auction!</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said the auctioneer, "we now offer you the house, sheds, barn, and
                  six acres of good land immediately adjoining. They must all be sold. Please make a
                  bid."—The men looked at each other, walked around, sat down, drew out their
                  knives, whittled, smiled, chatted—"How much? What shall I have?—Who bids?"—The
                  people did not seem disposed to hurry.—"Must be sold, gentlemen; now is your time;
                  house, sheds, barn, and six acres of land; what am I offered?"—Bidders rare,
                  profound silence.—"Howmuch, gentlemen!! Don't keep a man talking till night—you
                  know the worth of this good old mansion—now—now;am I offered a bid?" It was hard
                  work. The auctioneer took off his hat, and wiped and rewiped his brow.—"How
                  much!—how much? gentlemen, give us a bid!"</p>
               <p>"Four hundred dollars!" said a short, eary-loking Yankee.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, consider this, will you? I have offered me 'four hundred dollars' for
                  this valuable property. Why, gentlemen, are you beside yourselves? it is worth
                  more money to tear down and move it to Boston! Four hundred dollars!—How much,
                  gentlemen?"</p>
               <p>"Four hundred twenty!" said a second.</p>
               <p>"Four hundred twenty! ha! ha! ha! Oh, gentlemen, you have a curious way of running
                  down the price of auction goods out here; never mind—all fair, I 'spose. Four
                  hundred twenty dollars—are you all done? Four—"</p>
               <p>"Four hundred twenty-five, "said the first bidder.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir; four hundred twenty-five—just the cost of the cellar and
                  foundation—ha! ha! In these days—ha! ha! ha!—Railroad days—how exceedingly low!
                  Four hundred twenty-five dollars—property never in better order. A town here
                  second to none in physical elevation and rural advantages,—"</p>
               <p>"Four hundred—thank YOU, sir."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Forty!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Four hundred and forty meager dollars for this delightful 'vale of Avoca,' and
                  hill-top of science and theology."</p>
               <p>But the hammer came down irrecoverably at four hundred and fifty dollars to the
                  first bidder. No one would go a mill beyond. So the ministerial mansion<pb
                     n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6389-00000207"/> of both father and son, and six acres
                  of excellent land, found an able purchaser for four hundred and fifty American
                  dollars! After this, were sold a few acres of pasture-land at a spirited price,
                  and the great sale was over. The delicate, intelligent, bright-eyed mother, with a
                  baby in her arms, came to the door. Her husband and rosy-cheeked boys stood beside
                  her. Here was the parting scene with many an old familiar object, a long farewell.
                  Castlereagh rode up to the door, and was introduced.</p>
               <p>"Here," said he, "are many of your household idols, madam," pointing to the
                  auctioned goods around them.</p>
               <p>"After all, Mr. Castlereagh," she pleasantly replied, "they are not my real idols.
                  They have neither intelligent nor accountable natures. <emph>These</emph> are my
                     <emph>true</emph> idols," said she, embracing her children. "As long as I have
                  these in my care, I can not much grieve for those."</p>
               <p>"Castlereagh admired her fortitude and faith, and felt for her unmingled respect.
                  Yes, here was the Christian, American mother, of high bred-character, of true,
                  firm principle, of correct learning, intelligence, and refinement, who had been
                  the bright light of this home for many years, who was now parting with its
                  hallowed relics in obedience to the calls of duty that summoned away the pastor
                  from this field of twenty year's labor, to new, distant, and untried scenes; and
                  she could feel that she carried HOME with her, though house and goods were sold,
                  because husband and children, with their love and bright smiles, accompanied
                  her.</p>
               <p>The day's sale must have come a little short of a thousand dollars, and the
                  sacrifice from first cost a thousand. But let them who labor in the Lord, and die
                  in the Lord, take joyfully "the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves
                  that in heaven they have a better and an enduring substance." Farewell to the
                  parsonage in E——, farewell to its old ministerial gatherings of fifty years now

               <p>The weather was beyond all precedent hot, dry, and uncomfortable. In a day or two
                  Castlereagh found himself nearing his own home in the Boston Express train. To
                  every body's delight the heavens were overspread with clouds, thunders rumbled
                  loud and long, and a heavy, delicious rain fell on the parched fields and soft,
                  dusty roads. Castlereagh was exceedingly comforted buy this dashing shower and
                  cool moisture, but being dressed only in thin garments, he found directly that he
                  had insensibly contracted a slight cold.</p>
               <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6389-00000208"/>
               <p>Sarah Matilda, and Johnnie, and Hobbie, and <emph>baby,</emph> and Mina, were in
                  raptures at this return with Gertrude, but in the evening Sarah Matilda discovered
                  that he was suffering from the new attack of cold.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Castlereagh never walked so near the grave as during the subsequent
                  fortnight. The first week of September, through which he now passed, was the most
                  "distressingly warm" and suffocating of the summer. There was no rain, no breeze
                  no frost, no dew, but night and day the heat burned on. Castlereagh lay on his
                  couch, partly sustained by the arms of Sarah Matilda, partly by his pillows,
                  fanned by Gertrude, his temples bathed in camphor, his feet washed by Mina, his
                  children hushed, his friends anxious, and the doctor ever present with his
                  prescriptions, directing the utmost attention and quit.</p>
               <p>"Oh, what intolerable pain! what insupportable weakness! what a drooping, dying
                  nerveless sensation! <emph>can</emph> there be any help? Must this be the end? And
                  now am I about to leave you? DREAMS and DUTY, end they here?—end they thus? And
                  all life's REALITIES!" have they their period now? Am I so near the last shore of
                  time that verges on eternity?"</p>
               <p>Thus trembled the sufferer on his couch, faint, weary, gasping—near the GOAL! But
                  it happened, by the good providence of God, that in a few days the severity of the
                  attack subsided, and Castlereagh was enabled to sit up—by and by to walk his room.
                  And one night there came a sound of rain along the roof, and the rush of wind!
                  Castlereagh rose hastily, threw up the window, high, high! thrust out his face,
                  neck, and arms into it, and inhaling the delicious, cool, moist air, thanked God
                  for the mercy, and wept forth the grateful incense of his soul, inhaling as he
                  wept, and conceiving a new and joyous hope of recovery. So was in that same hour
                  with hundreds and thousands of invalids and sufferers in the land. That blessed
                  rain! That cooling wind!</p>
               <p>That first whole week in September, 185,—Castlereagh will long hold unforgotten,
                  both on account of his own sufferings during its direful sirocco, and on account
                  of what it wrought for others. It laid his friend Zelotes, in the grave; it cast
                  down the bosom companion of his boyhood—the tall, manly, noble-souled WOOD, and
                  left one of the most beautiful wives a widow, and a most cheerful and intelligent
                  group of children, fatherless. Yes—while Castlereagh lay on his suffering couch,
                  and seemed to be restored by the great goodness of the Lord, his friend was
                  suffering from a raging fever in the city of New York, whither he had gone with
                  his wife for a short visit, and was taken back to Utica—a child of death. "One
                  shall be taken and another left!" Oh! how it chills life's hottest hopes and
                  blocks her ways, to see so many die!—to part with the those you knew once, when
                  all was young and fair—about whom you have hovered and clung through many a year,
                  with only love's warmest emotion—whose hearts can never be replaced!
                     Castlereagh<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6389-00000209"/> reagh groaned in the
                  bitterness of true grief, when told that his facetious, story-telling,
                  reminiscence-gathering, cheerful, confiding, pious, PRAYING friend, WOOD, had
                  fallen down to rise no more, and was struck with the coincidence of their
                  sickness, at the same period of time, though far apart, and quite unaware of each
                  other's situation.</p>
               <p>A pleasant memory hovers around the grave of his friend. He was a jovial spirit, a
                  good man, a generous citizen, a believing Christian, and his dying hours were
                  peaceful in the Lord.</p>
               <p>In due course of time Castlereagh regained his usual strength, and he observed
                  that with the subsidence of the attack, the asthma, which had almost killed him,
                  was gone. A cold, will, it is said, often cure the asthma. His other complaints
                  were not insupportable, but they greatly interfered with the proper attention to
                  his pulpit and to his parochial duties.</p>
               <p>As soon as he found himself again comfortably well, Castlereagh went to New York,
                  partly that he might consult a physician about his health, and received, in a day
                  or two, the following letter:</p>

                              twilight arrived we went through quite a romantic scene at home. I

                              to sleep in the bedroom that leads out of the diningroom, and moving,
                              as I always do, with the utmost caution, lest she should awaken, when
                              suddenly the door swung open, and a woman rushed in exclaiming wildly,
                              'Save me! save me!' and she threw herself right upon the floor, at my
                              side, the very picture of misery and terror. I perceived also that she
                              was breathing quickly, as though she had been running. I was of course
                              startled, for I concluded she was a crazy woman. Her person was
                              untidy; her hair flying loosely about her, and her whole appearance
                              indicated suffering and poverty. Anxious about the baby, I contrived
                              to lead her out, assuring her that I would befriend her. 'But,' said
                              she; 'they are after me!' 'Who are after you?' I inquired. 'Those
                              dreadful monsters who have claimed my husband and led him away.' I was
                              much agitated as I listened to her and beheld her excitement, and her
                              youthful though miserable appearance. Assuring her of my protection, I
                              led her round into a more retired and dark room, where she immediately
                              concealed herself as well as she could. But how alarmed Mina and
                              Gertrude were, and Matilda, her friend, who happened to be with us, I
                              can not begin to describe. They thought she would murder me, and yet,
                              seeing two men approaching the house rapidly, they barred and locked
                              the door! Coming from the room where the fugitive had concealed
                              herself, I attempted to calm them, but they<pb n="410-411"
                                 xml:id="VAC6389-00000210"/> were beyond measure excited. The men by
                              this time came to the door and rapped loudly for admittance. Sending
                              Mr. James out to consult with them, I informed the girls that the
                              woman was evidently deranged, or excessively frightened, and that I
                              thought she would not harm any one. Mr. James came back now, and
                              informed us that the servant of an official from the Alms House was
                              sent by his superior to obtain possession of the woman as an escaped
                              inmate, and lead her back. That she and her husband had been out of
                              confinement a week, lodging in chambers in the village, and that he
                              was idle, intemperate, and thieving; that he had been complained of
                              again, and the officers had taken him, but that his wife, leaving her
                              two children behind her, had fled from the house, after grappling with
                              the man and nearly strangling him; and, without bonnet or shawl, had
                              fled here. The girls now became greatly interested in her. They stole
                              off to see her, and to speak encouraging words to her As for myself,
                              after learning that the men who were at the door were not the proper
                              officers to demand the fugitive; and, as she had fled to me, and
                              claimed my protection, I told Mr. James that I should not give her up
                              to any one but the proper authority. He, accordingly, went back, and I
                              also went out and spoke to them. The man who claimed her for the
                              overseer said, 'You had better let her go, she's a runaway. I can take
                              her right along, I have, a great many times—fact is, I always gets 'um
                              when I go after 'um.' Thinks I, 'my good sir, we'll see if you do this
                              time.' So I told him the woman had claimed my protection, and nobody
                              should remove her from under my roof except the proper officer! He was
                              terribly excited, and sent the other after the overseer. In the mean
                              time I returned into the house. The woman had come from the bedroom
                              into the dark parlor, and was wringing her hands and weeping bitterly,
                              and exclaiming, 'Alas! alas! my poor babes, my poor babes, my
                              wretched, forlorn husband!' The girls trembled and tried to comfort
                              her. I found, on inquiry, that her husband had been taken to the Alms
                              House in irons, for fear that he would escape, and that, determined,
                                 <emph>never</emph> to return there, <emph>she</emph> desperately
                              clutched the servant by the throat, and then fled from the house,
                              leaving her children uncared-for behind her. 'And now, there they are,
                              my poor babes, I must go back to them—and then, oh! it is horrible—I
                              must again go within those ugly walls. <emph>I</emph> who am—alas!
                              what, and who am I?' Mr. James continued to parley with the servant. I
                              found he was convinced that the woman had better be given up. I
                              stoutly refused to listen to it. In about two hours, all which time
                              the smart official at the door kept guard, the principal of the Alms
                              House made his appearance. He spoke to me about the woman, and said
                              'that she would be taken good care of, and that her husband and
                              children needed her assistance.' Overhearing his voice at the door,
                              and finding there was no further hope of avoiding her fate<pb
                                 n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6389-00000211"/> she gave up the effort, and
                              sulkily followed, down the walk, the men who vented their disturbed
                              feelings in sundry chidings and scoldings; and so she was conveyed
                              once gain to that abode ever detested by its inmates, though it loom
                              up ever so grandly and palace-like before the admiring citizens, more
                              fortunately outside!</p>
                           <p>"I hear sad news of our poor Josephine Leland Sickles! We knew before
                              that her fine anticipations were far from being realized—but little
                              did I dream of ever seeing her in a condition so painful and
                              revolting. I am going immediately to her friends to inquire about her,
                              and will do every thing in my power to comfort her.</p>
                           <p>"10 o'clock—I have seen the Summers's, and they, for the fifth time,

                              obtained permission, have received the family again under their roof!
                              How strange are the developments of Providence around us. Oh, what
                              dreadful havoc of human happiness and thrift has been caused by the
                              fatal cup of intoxication. May the day come, and soon come, when the
                              great sin of intemperance shall be no more.</p>

               <p>From September to January Castlereagh almost wholly abandoned his customary duties
                  in his parish, but resumed them in January, and preached nearly every Sabbath-day
                  till the middle of March. During this latter period he was called to attend
                  several dying scenes and funerals. The very aged and beloved Mr. Y——, after a long
                  sickness, was called away, and the old homestead lost one who, for ninety years,
                  had gone out and in across its threshold.</p>
               <p>Then the fair and delicate mother, Mrs. R——, went to her grave. Castlereagh called
                  to see her the evening of her departure. "How is the sick woman this evening?" he
                  inquired of a good neighbor, a plain man, standing at the gate.</p>

                     in the death-scene of Barkis. The highly dramatic character he has given to
                     the scene is, doubtless, original with him; but it is a very common opinion
                     among out tidesmen and coastwisers, that dying person "go out" with the
                     tide; and the author has here given an actual occurrence of the kind, where
                     the sufferer actually died at twelve, midnight, at low water!</p>

               <p>"Before new tide, you see, she'll leave us."</p>
               <p>Castlereagh passed into the house. The dying woman was coughing. She sent word to
                  call in the morning, when she would see him. But she died at midnight, at low
                  tide!</p>
               <p>The next day—it was winter now—the snow was deep. Castlereagh, on leaving the
                  house of mourning, whither he had gone to converse with the afflicted ones,
                  encountered the joyous, round and red and fair-cheeked boy of the deceased. Too
                  young to know the loss of a mother, he was playing in the banks of snow in high
                  glee!</p>
               <p>"Is your mother dead?" inquired of him a little, fat, demure, sympathetic child of
                  nature, a girl a little his elder, dressed in a red frock, and carrying a tin
                  pail. "Is your mother dead?" slowly and demurely said she, standing a little out
                  of the path in the snow, over shoes some, and gazing very pitifully on the
                  orphaned boy. "Is your mother dead?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! she's dead!!" promptly and blithely replied our young urchin, five or six
                  years old, with red cheeks and wide-awake eyes.</p>
               <p>"When—did—she—die?" slowly and mournfully inquired his interlocutor, standing over
                  shoes in the snow, the picture of sobriety and deep concern.</p>
               <p>"Died last night!!" cried the boy, as he leaped into a snow bank, and rolled over
                  in delightful fellowship with the free and flaky element, kicking the snow into
                  the air with his heels, and humming a sort of General Green's March to keep time
                  by.</p>
               <p>Alas! alas! alas! Poor frolicsome lad. Your MOTHER'S dead! She is
                     <emph>dead!</emph> Did you know that? Poor child. He laughs now; by and by he
                  will weep. His MOTHER'S dead.</p>
               <p>And hardly had their graves been covered ere there was buried another. The grave
                  was opened to receive the fair young Christian maiden, who, though snatched from
                  life by a complaint that knows no mercy, was supported to life's last curving
                  shore by the presence of the Blessed Comforter and Saviour. Her soul was
                  uncommonly tranquil and confiding. She often repeated the lines of a sweet writer,
                  as expressive of her trust in Jesus: <cit>

               <head type="sub">DISCOURAGEMENT—A SALE—A MARRIAGE AND ITS FINALE.</head>
               <p>IT was during this winter that Castlereagh experienced the discouragement always
                  more or less connected with a perception of one's low fortune. He found that two
                  years of sickness with all its expenses, and the inability to prosecute any
                  successful business, had thrown him into debt. He aroused himself to meet it as he
                  best could, and vigorously brought his daily expenses into the smallest possible
                  area. But with all his care such were high prices of food, such the expenses of
                  his pulpit, such the necessary cost of fuel, such the accumulations of interest,
                  that he was more distressed in mind than in body, feeble as was his physical
                  state.</p>
               <p>About this time the windows of kind heaven seemed to be opened just above him, and
                  there came in almost daily, from the hands of his good and generous PEOPLE,
                  heaven's almoners, every needed article, as it seemed, for his family's use. He
                  was no less gratified than surprised at this unlooked-for relief. May a thousand
                  times ten thousand thanks rest on their generous souls! Not satisfied with this,
                  they clothed him and his family a new with appropriate, and even rich, tasteful
                  apparel. They then made him a parish visit with a donation the most generous ever
                  bestowed on him, and continued throughout the whole of the cold dreary winter of
                  185—, to remember their suffering pastor. When the great day shall come, this that
                  they did for him as the embassador of Christ among them, we doubt not, will be
                  remembered of them. May they all hear the Saviour's voice saying unto them,
                  "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
                  done it unto me."</p>
               <p>JOURNAL. <hi rend="i"/>March 1, 185—. A happy record. A gentleman of piety and
                     <emph>character has bought of me the Institute!</emph> I have fully completed
                  the trade, and he has taken possession. The interest is no longer accumulating,
                  and eating me up; but is thrown the other way! Yes, <emph>interest-money</emph> is
                  now in my favor! We are again to hear the ringing of the Institute bell, and to
                  see the happy groups of boys and girls on the grounds so long deserted.</p>
               <p>What a long, discouraging, dismal, expensive, wearisome time of it I have had,
                  endeavoring to dispose of the Institution! Who could have prophesied it. Well, now
                  we will throw off its perplexing anxiety and see if there be any relief, the
                  burden no longer weighing us down. Lord, help us. Put underneath us thy strength,
                  and we shall be holden up that we fall not.</p>

                  <hi rend="i"/>March 12.—A marriage! Yes, a cheerful happy bridal in the parlow
                  this very morning. The party consisted of a young and beautiful lady, in the sweet
                  spring-time of her seventeenth or eighteenth year—trustful and calm in her bearing
                  above her years, and shedding a delicious fragrance of smiles on her young and
                  happy lover-bridegroom. Her dress was not particularly costly now showy, but it
                  became her delicate young frame, and she appeared a bright fair bird alighted on
                  earth from the shining skies. The happy bridegroom was a small, delicate-framed
                  youth, very slender, very dark-haired, very heavily-shaded lineaments, a keen,
                  intelligent eye, and a winning, pleasant smile. His dress was perfectly neat, and
                  his deportment easy and frank. They alighted from a handsome carriage drawn by two
                  grays, and were accompanied by a fine-looking, cheerful, full-cheeked young man as
                  groomsman, and a handsome young lady-friend as bridesmaid.</p>
               <p>Sarah Matilda, with Johnnie and the baby-child happened to be absent at the time
                  making a visit home. There were at the bridal, therefore, besides the parties
                  mentioned, Castlereagh, Gertrude, Mina, and Hobbs. The morning was a little damp,
                  a slight snow lay on the ground. The bridal party being ushered in, were accosted
                  by Castlereagh, (who having seen the genetlemen the evening previous, was prepared
                  for the arrival,) and were asked if the ceremony should immediately proceed.
                  Receiving their assent, the marriage riage rites were about to commence, when the
                  groomsman observed to the bridegroom that he was <emph>standing on the wrong
                     side</emph> of the bride. He smiled at this, and said it made "no difference."
                  The groomsman smiled too, but insisted that it was "our of order."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, never mind," said the bridegroom.</p>
               <p>"But you shall change," he answered. So he playfully but firmly took hold of him,
                  and placed him on the right of the lady, who along with her companion, smiled at
                  the gentlemen's passage with each other on the point of order.</p>
               <p>They were soon bound together by the firm cord of matrimony—"What God hath joined
                  let no man put asunder."</p>
               <p>Before leaving, the bridegroom requested of Castlereagh, that for the present, the
                  marriage should not be made public.</p>
               <p>"You would not have me write a notice of it for the papers?"</p>
               <p>"No! sir—no! sir, if you please," he quickly replied. Castlereagh bowed, and
                  said,</p>
               <p>"As you please, sir."</p>
               <p>The party directly left, sauntering easily down the walk to their carriage, and
                  drove back to the city. Happy, happy youthful lovers! may you have a long and
                  tender life of married joy!<ref rend="super" target="#note_025"

                  <hi rend="i"/>March 15.—Johnnie is engaged in the study of Railroad Guides. Also
                  the routes, names and places of railroads on the great map. He would study till
                  ten and eleven o'clock every evening, if we would allow of it. He seems to have
                  acquired the whole of this science. He knows every railroad, I fancy, in the
                  United States, every principal stopping-place, how long it takes to reach Buffalo,
                  Cleaveland, FREMONT, where his uncles, aunts, and cousins live, Toledo, Chicago,
                  Rock Island, Cincinnati, etc., etc., in those directions; COLUMBIA, S. C., in
                  that; Boston, Portland, in that; Burlington and Montreal, in that. He bids fair to
                  be a railroad man, I think. He and Hobbs are much pleased with the little fat
                  DUTCHMAN, who smokes his pipe, and attends so faithfully to the switching off and
                  on fifty or eighty locomotives daily, at the foot of the Harlem Tunnel, New
                  York.</p>
               <p>Hobbs in learning to read. It is rather hard work; but he gains upon it. He will
                  run like a deer. He is also a railroad man, and expects to be an engineer. Not
                  long since, he was sick a day or two, and took medicine.</p>
               <p>"Father!" says he, "do you like to be sick?"</p>
               <p>Having had a two years' trial of it, I answered without any hesitation, in the
                  negative. The boy was reposing in a convalescent state, on his mother's bed—</p>
               <p>"No, Hobbie; I can't say I love to be sick."</p>
               <p>"I do, father, I like to be sick for three reasons."</p>
               <p>"You do! Well, let's have them."</p>
               <p>"Because I can have RHUBARB, EGGS, and TEA!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! Hobbie, you have made out quite a case."</p>
               <p>The boy has always had a passion for tincture of rhubarb with paregoric, and a
                  great desire for tea and eggs; and as odd as the compound may seem, I really
                  imagine he would, at any time, make a delicious breakfast of it!</p>
               <p>One of our good neighbors, Mr. P——, visited England in November to see his father
                  and friends. He returned in January. We were speaking of his return Saturday
                  evening. The next morning I was late getting away to church, and the bell was
                  tolling. I hurried out, shut the door after me, and was making off—when the
                  earnest voice of Hobbie, "Father! father!" called me back.</p>
               <p>"Well!—speak out—what, my son?"</p>
               <p>"Only this, father; did Mr. P—— go to Africa?"</p>
               <p>"Whe—w—w—! Shut, shut the door: Africa?—" Poor Hobbs! Little idea has he of the
                  relative positions of the islands and continents of the globe. He has heard of
                  Africa, America, Europe; but where they are—how near—how distant—there's the
                  rub.</p>
               <p>Johnnie and Hobbie have been very busy of late with their scissors clipping
                  pictures from <title>Gleason's</title>
                  <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6389-00000216"/>
                  <title>Pictorial,</title> and from other papers that I have given them; and they
                  have pasted them with their small brushes into their scrap-books. I explained to
                  Hobbs the picture in <title>Gleason,</title> that represents SIMS taken by the
                  police to the wharf to be shipped off.</p>
               <p>"Father," says he, "I think they must have a <emph>pretty much</emph> police in
                  Boston; don't you?"</p>
               <p>Having found in the <title>Pictorial</title> a sketch representing the dashing
                  equestrian performances of Madame L—— from Paris, at Niblo's, he requested me to
                  read to him what was said of it; I complied. He then called the attention of his
                  mother to it, who after examining the sketch for a moment, cast it away,
                  saying:</p>
               <p>"Fie! I would not be there, and do as she does, if I could. I should prefer to do
                  and be something more useful."</p>
               <p>But Hobbie exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Oh! father, ain't it funny that she came clear over here just to do
                     <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
               <p>I have often noticed that children have correct ideas on many matters that seem
                  beyond their comprehension, and without the circle of their direct observation or
                  experience. What could be more to the point than Hobbie's phrase, "JUST TO DO
                  THAT!"</p>
               <p>We once sent John and Hobbs to the hill, where they had been sliding, to find the
                  latter's handkerchief.</p>
               <p>"Did you find it, Johnnie?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; we looked all round, and could not see it."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am very sorry, indeed," said their mother.</p>
               <p>"Father," said Hobbie, "I e'en a'most found it."</p>
               <p>"'E'en a'most found it,' how so?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I was looking, and I saw a red sort of a thing by a stick, and run to it,
                     <emph>thinking it was it</emph>—but it wasn't! I e'en a'most found it, though,
                  did n't I? <emph>and wouldn't you be glad, father, if I had!!</emph> Yes,
                     <emph>sir,</emph> I guess you would!"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>April.—We are still making plans for our new house! Sarah Matilda
                  drew a very desirable one the other evening. It combines taste with convenience
                  and abundant room for all our family. It is, if any thing, rather too large,
                  especially too expensive. What a world of pleasure this has given us, although as
                  yet, it is, literally speaking, building houses in the air.</p>
               <p>Mina is always encouraging me. The other day, when I was complaining that medicine
                  seemed to do me no good whatever, she answered, "You must not expect to receive
                  good from medicine while taking it, but just after you quit it."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! Mina, is that the case?"</p>
               <p>"True, an it is, sir. Many's the one who thinks his medicine must do him good
                  right off, when he takes it. No, no, that's not the way—but just after he quits
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! a fine comment on drugs, surely. Then, if I keep on in this way a
                  year or two, and stop, I shall begin immediately to feel the benefit!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; to be sure—just after you quit it."</p>
               <p>This is a new idea; it may be a true one.</p>

                              say, 'All that I wish to visit England for, is to see Ireland and
                              Wales.' At first, I thought the remark one of your extremely facetious
                              sayings, and I tried to lay it by. Still, it would rise every half
                              hour to my recollection with fresh interest, and I came at last to
                              regard the idea as a reasonable and comprehensive conception of a
                              trans-Atlantic excursion. We have now weekly news from London,
                              Liverpool, Birmingham, etc. We have read 'Guide' after 'Guide' to all

                              counties, parishes, bogs, fields and meadows—their noblemen, their
                              common people, their customs, their castles, cottages and hedges, an
                              indescribable charm like that of the best story of romance.</p>
                           <p>"Of Wales I know less than of Ireland. Her written history, however,
                              is to a certain degree accessible; and her people have a name in it,

                              the baronial castle of my friends, the N——s, in one of the thousand
                              pleasant retired estates of England, whenever, by the Court of

                              history. To these strangers, dwelling among us, I am indebted for many
                              an interesting story of Ireland's people in their exodus to America,
                              and for about all of my familiar, local ideas of their home and
                              country. Almost every one of them has something new and racy to say of

                              dashing Lord Forbes!—of the 'domain' of Lord Forbes—and of Lord
                              Forbes' young and noble son, the gallant Earl GLENARD, just come into
                              his inheritance that had been, during his minority, encumbered with
                              his father's debts? How extensive in his domain. How fond is he of the
                              chase. See him, and those dashing blades his companions, coursing
                              through the park! And there in Mr. O'Mootey's estate of Brientown,
                              that comes up to Lord Forbes' domain; and the people say they ought to
                              make a reunion in the families, and bring them into one estate. Lord
                              Forbes and Mr. O'Mootey had each a brother killed at Waterloo—General
                              Hayson Forbes, and Captain O'Mootey. And did not O'Mootey tell her
                              grandfather that he was longer a resident in the country than the
                              Forbes'? The O'Mooteys came out in the last part of Elizabeth's reign,
                              and the Forbes' in the reign of James. Is not that a good spice of
                              history to give relish to my Irish visit across the Channel? And do
                              you not see the Forbes and O'Mootey domains bordering each other,
                              where the rich proprietors have held sway so long, and in whose lordly
                              castles hang the portraits of a line of noble ancestors? And here
                              flows, by the cottage of her mother, the noble river of Ireland, the
                              SHANNON, with its lakes, and coves, and armlets; its green meadows and
                              flowery bogs spreading out before the eye, a most captivating and
                              varying lanscape. Do I not know the whereabouts of ROSSCOMMON county,
                              and its post-office, RUSKY? Of LONGFORD, the county town of Longford
                              county? And there is Father O'Brien, whom all the faithful love; and
                              Rector Crawford, the Episcopal clergyman who married the noble Forbes
                              and his lady. And what a rich and splendid mansion is that of Mr.
                                 <emph>Verse Koyle Crawford,</emph> facing Lord Forbes' domain. See
                              him weeping when the Lord Forbes dies!</p>
                           <p>"Ah! how many letters have Sarah Matilda and I directed to those who
                              have been left behind, containing one, two, and three pounds, in bills

                              since I read your letters to invalids last autumn. And I have in
                              common with many others, regarded you as one of the file leaders in
                              the great Forlorn Hope of Consumptives. It gave me<pb n="430-431"
                                 xml:id="VAC6389-00000220"/> great concern of mind last winter to
                              read of you as becoming weaker, and despairing of recovery, and a
                              great and happy reaction, more recently, to read of your positive
                              improvement. Do, sir, permit me to congratulate you on this hopeful
                              condition of your health—and not only for yourself, but for all that
                              oppressed multitude who look at you with the most intense solicitude,
                              it being certain to them that, if with all your energy, activity, and
                              faithful effort, the fatal tendency is not checked and overcome, then
                                 <emph>they</emph> must yield to an agonizing necessity and despair
                              of recovery. May your success save them from this if possible.</p>
                           <p>"My own case has in it nothing very distinctive from most other
                              invalids of this sort. I have been two years a sufferer, having lost
                              my health under the pressure of circumstances detailed in these
                              'Dreams and Realities.' I am now busily at work to repair it, but the
                              improvement is very slow. Yet at times I seem to spring up a little,
                              and to gather hope. I was very imprudent with myself both when health
                              was good, and when it began to fail. In resorting to remedial agents,
                              perhaps more imprudent still.</p>
                           <p>"I have amused myself in looking over the long list of medicines that
                              I have run up <emph>by little and little,</emph> as the tapster
                              exhausts his beer! 'Amused?' yes; and vexed—ashamed. I have uniformly
                              said to every one who inquired of me, 'I take very little medicine,
                              sir.' But I will give you a list which is perfect only as far as it
                              goes, how much further it might be extended, I do not pretend to say.
                              Of this I am satisfied, that so long as quackery usurps the place of
                              intelligent medical practice, so long will consumption frightfully
                              prevail. Consider this alarming fact in the following connections.
                              First: the patent nostrums and panaceas are unblushingly sold AS
                                 <emph>positive cures of consumption.</emph> Secondly; it is boldly
                              declared that the best medical treatment in the world can do
                                 <emph>nothing</emph> to relieve this disease. Thirdly; it is a fact
                              that the community have lost much confidence in the regular practice
                              of physicians in such cases, and as a consequence, have fled to
                              quackery! The invalid buys his panacea and sips it, neglecting to make
                              his case known to a physician, until on his dying couch, when alarmed,
                              disappointed, and ruined, he sends for one who arrives in time only to
                              dress him appropriately for the grave! My own opinion is that the
                              regular physician is now, and ever has been, more worthy of confidence
                              than the quack! In this saying, I include EVERY ORDER of intelligent
                              practice among the profession, and I can but embrace the conviction
                              that were the invalid seasonably to return from his eager chase of
                              universal panaceas to the kind, consistent, and intelligent care of a
                              discriminating physician, and his helper, the faithful nurse, it would
                              be well for him. The error <emph>may have</emph> been, in respect to
                              the regular practice, that it was <emph>too much</emph> relied on.
                                 <emph>Now,</emph> I am sure it is in this, that it is too little
                              trusted. And again, I think that less medicine, and a bolder effort at
                              physical hardihood, hydropathy in due proportions<pb n="432-433"
                                 xml:id="VAC6389-00000221"/> portions, and a plain, though generous
                              diet, with much exposure to the external atmosphere, will invigorate
                              and restore when a careful following of medicinal practice may have no
                              good effect. We rejoice to learn that you have derived so much benefit
                              from your system of earnest exertion. May your life yet throw forth a
                              lengthened and a goodly shadow.</p>
                           <p>"The '<emph>little</emph>' medicine I have taken, and manner of
                              practice pursued may be gathered from what follows: I tell the story
                              partly for the sake of those pale, feeble-limbed, fleshless folk,
                              component parts of the great distinguished corps of invalids, whose
                              disease, if it <emph>be</emph> a fatal one, is honorable to physical
                              nature in that it is concentrated at and around the truly vital and
                              organic regions of the air and blood in the human subject. I tell the
                              tale partly for their benefit, for they may idly enough be dreaming
                              that they also take but 'little medicine!'</p>
                           <p>"In the belief that my complaint was not a serious and permanent one,
                              I first supplied myself with liquorice in two kinds, and with
                              medicated candies and confectionary. I purchased all the cough-candies
                              that came up, and carried something of the kind in my vest pockets
                              daily. But the disease did not yield at all. I then procured me a box
                              of vegetable pills, and tried their effect; subsequently I purchased
                              Lees's pills; after this made use of anti-dyspeptic pills, tonic
                              pills, vegetable pills, hygeian pills, numbers 1 and 2, cough pills,
                              cathartic pills, etc. I made use of stimulants, tonics, and narcotics.
                              One good physician gave me a bottle of Malaga wine and bark; another
                              advised Port wine and iron; small beer, ale, and porter another
                              believed would help me; cider, for the carbon was recommended, alcohol
                              to bathe in, brandy, at nine dollars a gallon, it was thought would be

                              currant wine, and elderberry wine, and the best wines of commerce!</p>
                           <p>"I know not how many decoctions of everlasting, rue, birch,
                              cherry-bark, pine and winter-green, and sassafras, combined with due
                              proportions of true saccharine, and brandy or wine as pleasant
                              beverages, I have for more than two years been receiving at the hands
                              of my lady-parishioners—good souls, Heaven's own blessing on them!—who
                              sent it to me in bottles and large tin pails. They were determined I
                              should get well.</p>
                           <p>"I have made a free use of tincture of rhubarb, elixir paregoric,
                              elixir asthmatic, Seidlitz powders, Dover's powders, More's powders,
                              castor-oil, lemon and onion as a syrup. At one time I fancied the
                              ONION was about to cure me. I made a free use of it in various forms
                              of preparation—as food, as a syrup, as a poultice. I still think it
                              benefited me. To relieve my cough I have resorted to vinegar,
                              thickened with sugar and honey, seasoned with lemon, and have used a
                              wash for the head, of mint and alcohol, to check the catarrh. I have
                              made a tea of the root of the delicate waterbugle<pb n="434-435"

                              extensive and smarting eruption on the chest with croton-oil. The
                              mustang, pulmonary, and volatile liniments have been applied
                              externally to my throat, and caustics internally, and gargles of
                              nitrate of silver, catechu, and a decoction of white oak bark. Bread
                              and mustard poultices, hot toasted bread, and even hot flat-irons and
                              smart frictions by rubbing with flannel, anon cold-water bandages,
                              liniment, camphor, pain-killer, etc., etc., have been the treatment of
                              the chest, externally, when oppressed with pain. The inhaling tube,
                              the inhaling fluid, the gymnasia of the arms, and various methods of
                              inflating the lungs and relieving them by expanding—the treatment more
                              appropriately belonging to the chest, internally.</p>
                           <p>"But the complaint not yet being wholly routed, I must needs purchase
                              Blackman's Genuine Healing Balsam and Salve, <hi rend="i"/>alias a
                              sticking-plaster, against which I have always had a just spite, since
                              in my honey-moon itself! my wife advised me, for a pain in my side, to
                              put on, at night, a poor man's plaster, which I did, supposing it
                              would slide off as easily as a glove in the morning. But that plaster
                              clung to me for a month, and when, by our united skill and strength,
                              it was finally removed, with it went about all my power to endure
                              suffering. I could have wept at every step of the progress we made in
                              the case. So I have always preferred to die rather than use a
                              plaster—a regular <emph>sticking-</emph>plaster. The balsam was not
                              very injurious— two to four drops being called a dose! One of my young
                              friends declared, however, that with perfect impunity he had taken two
                              spoonfuls of it at a time. This you will hardly believe. I also
                              purchased a bottle of cherry pulmonic, a bottle of nervine, and a
                              bottle of pulmonary balsam. With these I made use of balsam copaiva!
                              and an alterative mixture, wine, and tonics.</p>
                           <p>"To cod-liver oil I am an utter stranger, though it has been often
                              recommended and even urged upon me. Not so with LOBELIA. I have found
                              that the tincture or syrup of lobelia would relieve the pressure from
                              the lungs, by clearing away the mucus and heavy secretions from the
                              throat. Better than this are the buds of the plant, as found in the
                              field. One or two of these will often entirely check my cough and
                              nauseating, set me into a quiet sleep. So I have taken, and still
                              take, a few drops of 'No. 3,' in water, and never fail of relief from
                              it. I think the lobelia, therefore, does really act favorably in
                              throat diseases. I think the same of Ayres's Cherry Pectoral, etc.</p>

                              wholesome preparation of this sort by a plain man, and a good personal
                              friend, who, having all faith in it, made me repeated presentations of
                              the compound, never accepting a penny for his trouble, and who, I
                              verily believe—for such is his goodness of heart—would make it every
                              week for me, ten consecutive years, if it would do me any sort of
                              good. I have, when troubled with difficult respiration, made use of
                              brown pack-paper, <abbr>i. e.,</abbr> tarred rope paper, saturated
                              highly in saltpeter-water, and smoked it, when dry, like a cigar.</p>

                              I have enjoyed the cold and warm, fresh and salt bathings of
                              Hydropathy. Have eaten Grahambread, and beveraged on water-gruel. Have
                              worn shoulder-braces, thickly-wadded stomachers, and
                              spring-supporters—and the wonder is, perhaps, that I am still

                           <p>"I have noticed that persons with consumptive diseases are ashamed of
                              them. I have hardly met with an exception. A consumption is called 'a
                              cough,' 'a cold,' 'a throat disease,' 'a bronchial difficulty,' 'a
                              catarrhal disorder,' 'a pulmonary tendency,' 'a pain in the chest,' 'a
                              weakness of the lungs,' 'a tendency to secretion,' 'profuse
                              expectoration,' 'an attack of asthma,' 'a weakness and loss of
                              strength.'"</p>
                           <p>"The victim of consumption carries around with him into society for a
                              long time, often, his pale, wan, or unnaturally flushed face, and
                              holds out his card of health to every body. He suspiciously
                              conjectures that every one who meets him, notices his peculiar
                              disorder in his features, and makes remarks at his leisure, the
                              general aim of which is to show that '<emph>he is dying of the
                                 consumption!</emph>' Now, a man with a disordered, unhealthy
                              system, whose heart, blood, liver, stomach, are diseased, whose nerves
                              are disordered, in whom a preparation is going on for a fever, or
                              paralysis that will crush him in a week, goes cheerily forth, imbibes
                              his ale, smokes his cigar, guides with a strong hand his fiery bays,
                              toiletes for the gay parlor, or dance, and every one says of him,
                              'what a fine specimen of health and long life!' Alas! the poor, pale,
                              unstrung, coughing pulmonaryist may outlive him years; but shame on
                              his disease, he can not hide it!</p>

                              turned aside. God only knows how heartily I join with them, and
                              sympathize with you, though a stranger, in your joy of health. For
                              myself, I ask no greater earthly boon than this; but the coming of it
                              lingers. It was a happy saying of Mina's, I believe, that one must not
                              look for any good in medicine 'while taking it, but just after he
                              quits it.' Were I to become a true convert to this opinion, what might
                              not be anticipated as the result of abandoning even the 'little'
                              medicines that I have hitherto employed?</p>

               <p>With this letter, Castlereagh brought his writings to an end. He had dreamed, and
                  toiled, and suffered. But none could know his sufferings. They were his own
                  experience, and through them he gazed back on the past, now noting here, and anon
                  there, some duty undertaken that cost him dear, but over which he could not sigh,
                  for he had been blessed even in his trials.</p>
               <p>The DREAM of that twilight hour, remembered still, long, long ago had been
                  demonstrated, but a dream. And yet, his life of DUTY, Castlereagh ascribed to its
                  potent charm. And where is he who has not builded on dreams, or airy castles, many
                  a stern plan of life, and pushed it forward, often even in the paths of cruel
                  trials and hardships? But it is over our life of suffering we bend with truest
                  approbation. And Castlereagh, when he left his home and native land for health,
                  bade Sarah Matilda, if she wept him dead, weep that he had done so little well,
                  and improved no better the angel visits of sorrow!</p>
