Now after these things a the time came when whT harertB the people of the land of Unculpsalm should choose tenikthoThT again a man to rule over them.         New Gospel of Peace. 2. For it was the chief delight of the people of that land to busy themselves about the choosing of their chief ruler; so that they occupied themselves with it by day, and talked one with another about it when they sat at meat, and when they lay down and when they rose up, and gave their thoughts to it in the watches of the night. 3. And when a chief ruler was chosen so it was that the people began straightway to strive one with the other as to who should be chief ruler after him; and he who had been made chief ruler sought first of all things to cause himself to be chosen again. 4. So that when any man came before him, or wrote a letter to him, asking that he would make him his officer, or cause justice to be done to him, or grant favor unto him, he said not, Hail! my lord that is chief ruler over the land of Unculpsalm, but, Hail my lord I chief ruler that is to be hereafter.  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8286-00000003"/> 4       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. 5. And about those days the army of the Bhum Urs marched into the South. Now these were not of Ur of the Chaldees, but of Bhum Ur of the Raoudees. 6. And the chief captain of the Bhutm Urs was a mighty soldier before the Lord; and he was called the Shear-Man because that he cut his way into the country of the Phirezahs which is called the land of Dicksee, and shore it in twain. 7. This did he entering it not from the North over the border of Masunandicsun, but south of the land of Ohlcaintuk, where the people are mighty and fearful to behold, for their upper parts be like unto a horse and their lower parts be like unto an alligator, and the sound of their neighing goeth over the land. 8. And the Bhum Urs left the land of Ohlcaintuk on the North, and went by the way of Chatter-niggah (for it is the country of the everlasting niggah) even as thou goest down to Hadal-antah which is in the land of Jahrji. 9. And it was at Chatter-niggah that Ulysses had overcome the army of the Phiretahs that Jeph the Repudiator had sent to drive the langkies beyond the borders of Ohlcaintuk, and that Joseph of Kalaphorni fought them upon the mountain top  above the clouds and drove them out of their stronghold. 10. And when Ulysses was made chief captain over all the armies of Unculpsalm, he sent for the Shear-Man and his Bhum Urs to come to Chatter-niggah. ". And afterward in the spring time of the year the army of the Bhum Urs marched southward into Jahrji, and went up against Hadal-antah to take it. 12. But the way from Chatter-niggah to Hadal-antah was long, and it lay through mountains and narrow valleys and strong places, and in these the Phiretahs fortified themselves. But the Shear-Man cut his way through them, after his manner, and stood before Hadal-antah. 13. Now when men saw that the way from- Chatter-niggah was long, and that the army of the Bhum Urs was fain to march slowly and fight warily, and when they saw that Ulysses himself   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.          5 and George the Mede still lay on the South of the chief city of the Phiretahs without taking it; ". The hearts of the feeble-minded began to fail them, and many of them joined themselves unto the sect of the Oueecneas. 15. Now there were certain Phiretahs which had fled into the land of the Kahnux which bordered the land of Unculpsalm on the north, and which was a province of the empire of Jonbool; and they dwelt there, working mischief against the land of Unculpsalm, and in this they were mightily holpen and encour- aged by the Kahnux. 16. And these men called unto them one named Kullah- Rahdo, one of the simple ones, which did their bidding, and said unto him, 17. Get thee unto Horatius the scribe who dwelleth in Gotham, and who is the chief of the sect of the Oueecneas, and say unto him that the Phiretahs are willing now to make peace with the men of Unculpsalm, and that it pleaseth us to receive an offer of truce from Abraham and his council that we may lay it at the feet of our master Jeph the Repudiator. 18. Now Kullah-Rahdo had published his folly to all the land of Unculpsalm, so that his name was a by-word for foolishness to all the men of that land. Likewise were the Phiretahs in the land of the Kahnux known to be crafty men and stiff-necked. Yet did Horatius the scribe hearken unto the message, and sent letters about it unto Abraham, saying, 19. That now he might make peace and confirm it with writ. ings, and pay the Phiretahs for their niggahs, and glorify him- self, and Horatius the scribe and Kullah-Rahdo for ever. 20. And he himself hastened to meet the Phiretah men at the plade of the Falling Waters. This did he because he was chief of the sect of the Oueecneas. 21. But Abraham said within himself, Behold now, do I not see through this matter as plainly as any man, unless he, be Hloratius, the scribe, or Kullah-Rahdo, his yoke fellow, may see through a millstone in which there hath been a hole made to turn it withal? /  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8286-00000004"/> 6       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. J7 22. And he sent a message to Horatius, but it was not written to him nor to the Phiretahs, but unto all nations and anto all peoples, saying: 23. If there be any man that hath power and authority to make a covenant, even a covenant that shall be kept, that the Phire- tabs shall lay down their arms and go each man unto his own home and obey the law's of the land of Unculpsalm, and that the Niggahs shall be set free for ever; let him come unto me, and no man shall do him harm coming or going. 24. Then did the hearts of the Phiretahs at the place of the Falling Waters sink within them. For they saw that Abraham was wiser than Horatius in his generation, and that their craft had failed them, and that Abraham and the men of Unculpsalm would fight the battle even unto the end. 25. But they put a bold face upon the matter, after their fashion, and they said unto Horatius, What is this to which thou hast bidden us?  We looked for an offer of peace, and behold thou hast brought upon us a buffet. Get thee gone, for we will none of thee. 26. Then Horatius gat him home quickly. And the people remembered how that in the beginning he had said, Let the Phiretahs go, with their Provinces, and keep their everlasting, Niggah. And the people laid all these things up in their hearts. CHAPTER II. 1 The Phiretahs march into the province of Schaddbellee. 2 The lKopur- hedds assemble at the city of the Ooze-yahs. 5 The Shear-Man taketh Hadal-andtah, 6 And the Kopur-hedds are cast down. 9 Philscurry- down discomfiteth Jew Bahlurlee in the valley of the Shinning Door, 13 And in. Kewhah. 17 Certain Phiretahs join themselves together, 21 Jind rr;b a village in the land of Unculpsalm. 26 Jonaydics ordereth them to be pursued into the land of the Kahnux. 1, And after these things the army of the Phiretahs marched again into the province of Schaddbellee, and carried off spoil, and burned a town therein. And when men saw this and saw   TI'IE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        7 that the Shear-Man had not yet cut his way into Hadal-antah, and that Ulysses still lay with the army of George the Mede south of the chief city of the Phiretahs, 2. Then the Kopur-hedds and the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmichrats and certain of the Oueecneas, gathered them- selves together at the chief city of the Ooze-yahs to declare whom they would set up before the people to be chosen chief ruler. 3. And the chief of the Kopur-hedds was Horatio, who was surnamed the Seemer, and the chief of the sect of Smalphri was Augmustus the money-changer; and Augustus they made ruler of the assembly for a little while, because he was chief of the sect of Smalphri, and because he was rich, but the chief man of the assembly and the ruler thereof was Horatio the Seemer. 4. And they declared that Litulmak was the man whom the Kopur-hedds delighted to honor, and whom the sect of Smalphri among the Dimnmichrats would choose for 'chief ruler of the land of Unculpsalm. 5. Now it came to pass that while the assembly in which Horatio the Seemer and Augustus the money-changer were chief men, did these things, that the chief captain of the Bhum Urs enticed the captain of the Phiretahs with his army out of Hadal-antah, and he fell upon him and cut his army in twain, and smote them hip and thigh, and pursued them until they were weary, and then marched back and took Hadal-antah. And this was noised abroad over the land as the men of that assembly departed to their homes. 6. Then did the countenances of-the Kopur-hedds fall and their hearts failed them as aforetime, when George the Mede obtained the victory over Robbutleeh, and when Ulysses took the city of Wickedsburg. 7. And they said one to another, why hath this calamity fallen upon us, and what is our iniquity that the armies of Unculpsalm should be victorious? 8. But the Dimmnichrats which loved the land of Unculpsalm better than they loved the triumph of their own faction, rejoiced ,  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8286-00000005"/> 8       THE NEW GOSPEL OP PEACE. greatly, and likewise did all the other men of that land, save them that had joined themselves unto the Kopur-hedda or unto the Oueecneas. 9. Moreover, about those days, Philscurrydown, a great captain in the army of Unculpsalm, who was mighty in battle riding upon a horse, and who was captain of horse in the army of George the Mede,        ' 10. Having been sent' by Ulysses, the chief captain, fell upon Jew Bahlurlee in the valley of the Shinning Door, which is the chief eitrance from the land of the Phiretahs into the land of the Iangkies. And because the Iangkies and the Phiretahs had chased each other back and forth through this valley, and because in the tongue of the men of Ouahlstreat, men who run back and forth are said to shin, this valley is called the valley of the Shinning Door unto this day. ". And Philscurrydown fought against Jew Bahlurlee three times, and each time he smote him and had the victory over him, and pursued him with slaughter, and took his engines of war, and more than half of them that were left alive he took captive. 12. And no more was heard of Jew Bahlurlee, until he fled and took ship and went and dwelt in Kewhah. And then he began railing and boasting after the manner of the Phiretahs, saying that he would have had the victory over Philscurrydown, save that he had only a few men, and that Philscurrydown had many   , 13. But when Philscurrydown heard this, he said, Behold this book, wherein are written the names of the men which I took captive from Jew Bahlurlee, and the numbers of his slain that I buried; and the numbers of the captives and of the slain are more than all that Jew Bahlurlee saith were in his army. Morever, the number of great engines of war that I took from him is greater than belongeth to his army, according to his, showing, and more than could be carried by them, as every man who is captain'of a company well knoweth.   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.          9 ". And then Jew Bahlurlee was put to shame before all men. For it was said a strong man may be discomfited, but only he that is mean in spirit seeketh to cover his caiamity with lies. 15. And Philscurrydown laid that valley waste with fire and sword, so that no army of the Phiretahs might live therein; and it is also called the Valley of Destruction unto this day. 16. Now Philscurrydown was small of stature, and he was of the race of the Pahdees. 17. And while he was driving Jew Bahlurlee and his army out of the valley of the Shinning Door, and laying waste that valley, certain of the Phiretahs who had gone into the land of the Kahnux, that they might work evil against the Iangkies, and who were made much of in that land, 18. Banded themselves together, and took arms in their hands, and went over into the land of Unculpsalm into a village of the Iangkies. 19. And they hid their arms under their garments, and the Iangkies knew not that they were Phiretahs; for the Iangkies and the Phiretahs being of one blood and one speech, when the Phiretahs carried themselves peaceably and went not about blaspheming and slaying, no one could tell that they were Phiretahs. 20. Now in this village there was no army, nor any fighting men, neither did the armies of Unculpsalm dwell in the country round about or pass through it, as. the armies of the Phiretahs did in the valley of the Shinning Door. 21. And after they had sojourned many days in the village and dwelt with the inhabitants thereof so that they might spy out the land, they dispersed themselves through the village, and at a certain hour with one consent they entered the houses and the sta;e q and the shops of the artificers, and beganto lay hands upon their gold and their silver and their horses and their cattle. 22. And because of the war there were few in the village save old men and women and children; for most of the young men were in the armies of Unculpsalm.   *    &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8286-00000006"/> 10       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. 23. And before the few that were in the village could gather themselves together, the Phiretahs mounted the horses they had taken and began to ride out of the village. . And those that attempted to hinder them they fell upon and wounded sorely, and went on their way rejoicing. 24. But the young men that were left in the village assembled quickly, and got other horses and pursued the Phiretahs. Yet could they not come up with them before they had passed the border of the land of Unculpsalm into the land of the Kahnux. So they escaped.  25. For the land of the Kahnux was part of the dominions of the Queen of Jonbool; and an evil doer in the one country could not be taken in the other save by a demand made by one --chief ruler upon the other. 26. But Jonaydics, who was captain in that region, said this is not the evil doing of one man against another man: this is the doing of the Phiretahs who have invaded our land from the land of the Kahnux, coming because they were our enemies, but carrying themselves not like soldiers but like robbers. 27. Therefore he commanded his officers saying, Pursue and overtake and spare not; and stay not your pursuing when ye come to the borders of the land of the Kahnux, but pass over, and if ye find the men, fall upon them and hew them in pieces before the Lord. And all the people said, Amen. CHAPTER III. 1 Zoord 5 Becometh chief counsellor. 6 Is hated by the men of Jonbool and the Pahvoos, because he prophesieth against them. "He causeth the command of Jonaydics to be disobeyed. 15 The Kahnux let lhe Phiretahsescape. 16 Zoord'sdecree. 1. Now the chief of Abraham's counsellors was Bilhe, whose surname was Zoord. 2. And Zoord was wise, and he had served the land of Unculps am a alslawgiver an4 a coumsellr from the timae .when   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        " t he was thirty years old until now the hairof his head was gray. And he was held in honor throughout the land of Unculpsalm, except among the Kopurhedds and the Phiretahs. ' 3. And even the Phiretahs although they hated his counsels found no occasion against him, and had respect unto him; for he was a courteous man and a subtle. 4. And men said that he should have been chief ruler instead of Abraham, if it had not been for Horatius the scribe. And they looked that he should oppose himself unto Abraham; but he was without envy, and served the land of Unculpsalm in pureness of heart. 5. And when Abraham said unto him, Behold now thou hast wisdom to govern and art'cunning to make laws and covenants, and art a man of experience among rulers, and can divine; and I am a simple man, without experience among rulers; be there- fore my chief counsellor; then Bilhe consented and became the chief counsellor of Abraham. 6. Now the rulers of the land of Jonbool, and the lords thereof, and the scribes and the pharisees, and the merchants and the shipmen hated Bilhe whose surname was Zoord. 7. For when they sought the downfall of Unculpsalm, and would have fought against her in the day of her calamity, he took away occasion from them, and he prophesied against them, declaring continually that the Phiretahs would come to naught. and that the greatness and the power and the glory of that land should endure forever. Wherefore the men of Jonbool hated him with an exceeding great hatred. 8. And the king of the Pahvoos and his counsellors said one to another, What doth it matter what this babbler sayeth? Let us not turn back therefor, but go on and get gold and glory in Mecsicho. But Zoord heeded neither the hatred of the men of Jonbool, nor the scoffing of the great ones among the Pahvoos, and he said unto them, 9. Behold now the pride and the naughtiness of your hearts; I tell you that the day is coming, and will soon come, when ye shall be at your wits' end in this matter, and shall repent your-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8286-00000007"/> 12      THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. selves in dust and ashes. But they heeded him not, and went on their way, both them of Jonbool and the Pahvoos. 10. And now again he took away occasion from them; for he went unto Abraham and he said unto him, ". Let my lord - live, forever, and be ruler of the land for a second time. Let my lord hearken unto his servant concerning the command of Jonaydics; which indeed would do justice unto the Phiretahs, and unto the Kahnux, and unto the men of Jonbool, but which would work confusion for us hereafter. 12. For either this band of Phiretahs are robbers or they are soldiers who obey the command of Jeph and of his officers. Now if they be robbers they have offended against our law, and must be demanded by thy servant to be punished; and if soldiers, then they have offended against the laws of the land of Jonbool, and we can neither demand them for to be punished nor join battle with them except within our own borders, unless we do that which is cause of war among all nations. 13. Let us not do thus unwisely; because we have an account to settle with the rulers of the land of Jonbool because of the ships that the men of Jonbool have furnished to the Phiretahs to our harm; and this matter is greater than the other by an hundredfold. ". Let my lord Abraham therefore issue a proclamation that the command of Jonaydics be not obeyed, that we may come to our great accounting with clean hands.  15. And Abraham consented, and the command was not obeyed. Ad demand was made upon the rulers of the Kahnux for the Phiretahs; but they gave them not up, but let them escape; for the people desired it, andthe judges winked at the matter. 16. Then Zoord issued a degree in the name of Abraham,- saying that no man might come from the land of the Kahnux into the land of Uuculpsalm unless he had a writing sealed with the seal of the ambassador of Abraham in the- land of the Kahnux, showing that-- he was neither a Phiretah nor other robber. And the writing cost five pieces of silver.   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.          13 17. And for because there was great traffic between those lands, and men went back and forth every day about their business, there went up a great cry thereat. And before many days the Kahnux sent messengers unto Zoord, and said, 18. Let not my lord lay his hand so heavily upon his servants. For my lord hath touched his servants where they are most tender, even in their business and in their pockets. Take now away, we beseech thee, thine hand from off thy servants, and let them go back and forth about their business as aforetime, and thy servants will undertake that their borders shall be guarded, that no Phiretahs nor no manner of robbers pass over them to do evil unto the land of Unculpsalm. 19. And when Bilhe, whose surname was Zoord, saw that they were in the dust before him, although he wielded not the sword, he was gracious unto them, and he revoked the decree. h CHAPTER IV. 1 The choi"e of Abraham the second time. 4 Andrew, whose surname was Jon sing. 9 Is set up to be the second ruler of the land of Unculpsalm. 10 And is chosen. "The Phiretahs seek to burn Gotham. 18 Phi. neas who was called Umbuggah. 20 Hiram the Publican. 1. And it came to pass, that after these things about the time of the new moon, the people met together in their cities, in their towns, and their villages to choose their chief ruler. 2. And Abraham   was chosen. And the multitude of them that gave their voices for Abraham   was so great, that the Kopur-hedds and the set of Smallphri among the Dimmichrats and the Oueecneas hid their heads and crept away from the sight of men. And Primus the scribe, who dwelt among the merchants, said, Behold I will write no more to instruct the people of this land and the rulers thereof; but I will pour out the wealth of my wisdom before the merchants. 3. Now there was chosen with the chief ruler of the land of Unculpsalm, a man to rule in his stead if he should die before  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8286-00000008"/> ,4      THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. he time for which he was chosen was ended, or if he'should be mitten with grievous sickness or have a devil. 4. And the men who had set up Abraham to be chosen a econd time, looked about for a man to be set up with him, to ule if need be in his stead. And their eyes fell upon Andrew, vhose surname was Jon-sing. 5. Now this Andrew had aforetime made garments for the Phiretahs. And he was cunning to make garments of woollen; ;o that they who before the time when Andrew came among hem, had worn raiment made by the sons of Mizphit, ceased from wearing it and bought garments of Andrew. Wherefore Andrew was hated of the sons of Mizphit. 6. And Andrew waxed rich, and came to be one of the law- givers of the land of Unculpsalm, and sat in the great council of ;he nation. And it was of the Niggahs that he was called Jon- sing. Likewise there were many Niggahs that called themselves Jon-sing. 7. And when the Phiretahs rebelled they said unto him, come with us, and be one of us! But he spurned them, and said, Get from before my face; for God do so to me and more also, if I rest day or night until ye are hanged, each one of you for this iniquity. 8. Therefore when the Phiretahs were subdued, and brought to naught in the province where Andrew dwelt, Abraham made Andrew governor thereof. 9. And the men said one to another, Behold now this Andrew, whose surname is Jon-sing, and who is governor of his province, is he not wise, and hath he not been faithful among the faithless and served this nation, taking his life in his hand? 10. Let us therefore set him up to be chosen as the second ruler in the land. And they set him up, and he was chosen. ". And about these days certain of the Phiretahs which had gone to dwell in the land of the Kahnux took counsel together to destroy the city of Gotham and all that was therein. 12. And they sent not an army to march against it and take it; but they took to themselves certain men, and said to them,   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        15 13. Go ye now into the city of Gotham, and go to the inns there, and take lodging as friends: and say each of you unto his host, Give me now a convenient chamber that I may lodge with thee; and look ye that your chambers be suitable unto that for which ye are sent. And some of you go unto the houses where men players and women players play before the people. ". Take also with you oil and brimstone. And it shall be that upon a day appointed ye shall with one consent pour the oil and the brimstone upon your beds, and upon the floors of the chambers under your beds, and in hidden places in the other houses ye shall pour them, and ye shall set fire to them, and so shall they be burned, and the houses round about. 15. In the night shall ye do it, that the city being fired in many places when the men are asleep there shall be none to extinguish the fires until the city be ready to be consumed even like unto Sodom and Gomorrah. 16. And certain of the Phiretahs were pricked in their con- sciences and said, Is it lawful for us to do this thing? For do not all men who go to an inn trust each unto the faith of the other while they are in the inn together, even although they be enemies? And doth not the host receive them, also trusting them? And are there not women and children in the inns which shall be consumed therewith?- 17. But the others would not hearken unto these, and an- swered them saying, We seek not to burn the women and children but only the houses; and if there be any women and children in the houses, their blood shall be upon their own heads. 18 And the men did as they had been commanded, and they set fire to many inns. Likewise also did they to the house of Phineas, who was called Umbuggah, wherein were many players and women players, and harlots, and marvellous beasts and fishes; even leviathan. And as it is written he causeth'the deep to boil like a pot, who can stir him up? Phineas had him there in the pot, and had one to stir him up. Also the whale that Jonah swallowed and his gourd that withered away; and Jonah was outside of the whale, and sat in the shadow of the gourd.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8286-00000009"/> 16       THE NEW  GOSPEL OF PEACE,.I 19. But Ken-Edee, chief of the watchmen, had heard of the device of the Phiretahs, and had set his watchmen to watch them. And they watched for the men, and took some of them andstopped the fires, so that the City was not burned, 20. Now the Phiretahs had set fire to many of the great inns in Gotham, but to the house of Hiram the publican they set not fire; wherefore men said, Behold how Hiram the publican is bound unto the Phiretahs and is one with them, for they set not fire to his inn, neither consumed they his habitation.  21. And Hiram answered and said, Go to, now, must I set mine inn on fire to show that I am faithful unto the govern- ment of Unculpsalm? And he laughed them to scorn. CHAPTER V. 1 The Shear.-Man cutteth his way to the sea. 3 Thomas discomfiteth a Phiretah Captain. 7 Ulysses marcheth against Robbutleea again nd a discomfiteth him.

And it came to pass that after these things the Captain of the Bhum Urs marched westward through the breadth of the land  of Dicsee even unto the sea shore. And the Phiretahs spoke very fierce words against him, and prophesied evil against him, and filled the land with their roarings after their fashion. 2. But the Shear-man heeded not the fierceness of their words or their prophesying or their roarings, and marched onward. And the Phiretahs called upon Robbutleeh to send help unto them, but Ulysses held him fast so that he could not. And the  Phiretahs fled from before the Bhum Urs and the Shear-man cut his way onward through the land.  3. Moreover, about his time the Phiretah captain whom the Shear-man had driven out of Hadal-antah, gathered together a  great army and marched against Thomas, a captain in the armies  of Unculpsalm, whom his soldiers called Safety.    THE NEW GOSPEL OP PIEACE.         17 4. (Now this Thomas came out of Pharjinnee, and was one of the Ephephvees. Yet was he faithful to the land of Uncul- psalm.) 5. - And Thomas marched backward, and drew the Phiretahs after him and away from the army of the Bhumt'Urs. And when he had drawn them far westward into the land, he went into a little city there; and the Phiretahs sat down before it, and boasted that they would take him captive and put his army to the sword. 6. Then Thomas gathered his army together, and marched out of the city, and fell upon the Phiretahs while their boastings and their cursings were in their mouths: And he discomfited them with great slaughter, and they fled from before him, and he pursued after them many days, and slew them as they fled; and their boasting was turned into wailing and gnashing o6f teeth, so that the city where Thomas fell upon them is called Gnashfill unto this day. 7. And after these things Ulysses saw that his time was come, and that the occasion wheref6r he tlad waited and watched and toiled for many days had been given unto him. 8. And he marched upon Robbutleeh while his army was yet in the forts and the strong places that he had made. And Ulysses had the victory, and drove Robbutleeh out of his forts and his strong places. 9. And it was the Sabbath day. And Jeph the Repudiator sat in the synagogue which is in the chief city of-the Phiretahs; and the chief men of the Phiretahs, Ephephvees, were about him, And as he sat there came a messenger to him from Robbutleeh, saying, 10. Thyservant is discomfited, but not yet destroyed. Never- theless he can no longer hold the city. Save thyself, thou and thy household and thy counsellors, and flee; for Ulysses is upon thee.  ". And Jeph went straightway out of the synagogue to his house, and began to gather his gold and his silver and his stuff. And the thing was noised abroad in the city, and there was B &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8286-00000010"/> 1o    / THE NEW GOSP'EIJ u' re-=ve. great commotion. And the Phiretahs fled from that city and from the villages round about, leaving only their women and children. And Jeph fled southward before them, uttering boast- ings, and making proclamations  12. And as Jeph was fleeing out of the city a company of Niggahs which had-joined themselves unto the armies of Jncul- psalm entered it from the other side; and as they entered they hfted up their voices with one accord and sang, saying, 13. Tell unto me Niggahs, and declare unto me oh ye of woolly locks and a dark countenance, have you seen the lord, have you seen the master?      ?  ". Whose beard is upon his face and above his mouth upon his face? 15. Have you seen him pass this way since the dawning, look-  ing like one who goeth hastily into a far country? 16. He saw the smoke, the smoke rose up before him on the river, and he said,   ' 17. Oh my soul, these are the ships of Father Abraham. 18. Then he covered his head; he put on the covering of his head; he covered his head speedily, his head-covering he put on with haste. lHedeparted, hewentswiftly:' he departed covering- his head with haste. i9. It seemeth unto me that he hath fed, and my soul saith within herself, he hath skedaddled. 20. Behold the master fleeth, the lord passeth away. 21. But the servant remaineth, the Niggah abideth for ever. 22. For he is the everlasting Niggah. 23. Lo now the kingdom cometh, and the year of Jubilee i at hand; and the Niggah shall rule in the land, and the master shall be cast down under his feet. 24. And the news of the fall of the city was spread abroad over the land upon the lightnings of the heavens. And there were great rejoicings, and feastings, so that that night all thep city of Gotham was drunken with wine. Likewise was it in many other cities of the Iangkies. And the Kopurhedds were abased, and the Oueecneas vanished away, so that not one of them   was found thereafter, and the sect of Smalphri among the Dim- michrats was swallowed utip in the victory of the Eunyunmen. 25. And Eobbutleeh essayed to flee westward with his army among the mountains.  But Ulysses pursued after him and overtook him, and fell upon him with great slaughter. 26. And his army saw that their cause was 0lost, and many of them fell behind, and wandered into the wilderness, or went homewd, for there was no power to keep them. But many were faithful unto the end. 27., And it came to pass that Ulysseswith his army got be- fore Robbutleeh with his army, and cut him off and hemmed him in on every side. And he could have fallen upon Robbutleeh and the remnant of his army and-put every man to the sword and cut them off from the face of the earth. 28. But he had, compassion upon them and respect unto them; for Ulysses was not a man of blood. And he sent a messenger unto Robbutleeh, saying: 29. Behold now the end has come, and thou and thine army are in the. hands of thy servant. Lay down thine arms now, and let there be peace between thee and me; and our Father Abraham shall pardon thee, and receive thee again as one of the children of Unculpsalm, and treat thee with honor, thee- ,nd thine officers, and all that are with thee. 30. Bat at first Robbutleeh would not; for he was stout- hearted and stiffnecked. But afterward he considered the matter, and for the sake of them that were with him he con- sented. 31. And he and his captains and his officers and his soldiers laid down their arms, and gave themselves up captives. 32. And there was an apple-tree where Robbutleeh gave him- self up. That it might be fulfilled as it was written, We will hang Jeph the Repudiator upon a bitter apple-tree. And that tree grew and multiplied so that it filled the whole land of Unculpsalm. 33. But Ulysses sent them  every man to his own home, saying only, See that ye obey the laws of the land of Uncul-   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8286-00000011"/> 20       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. psalm, and have respect unto the proclamations of our Father Abraham. And he gave them horses to ride upon; for the way was long and the road that they had travelled was hard. And he said, keep the horses, that ye may till your fields-and gather in your harvests. 34. Now-when the other Phiretah captains saw that Robbut- leeh had laid down his arms, they laid down their arms, all save one upon the farthest border on the -south-west as thou goest into the land of 3Iecsicho. 35. And it was in the spring time, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month that Robbutleeh laid down his arms; and before the sowing of the latter wheat was accom- plished, the other captains had done likewise. And about the time of the barley harvest, there was peace in the land of Uncul- psalm; so that the men who fought gathered in the latter wheat  harvest. For when the war was over each man returned unto his own home. CHAPTER VL 1 The Phiretahs aredismayed at their defeat. 5 Some submit themselves. 8 But others plan another ministration of the New Gospel of Peace. 13 They band themselves together to slay ,braham and his counsellors, and Ulysses, the chief captain. 18 The Durrektahs.- 28 Abrahai is slain. 32 The people mournfor Abraham. J 1. Now when the Phiretahs saw that Robbutleeh was dis- comfited and taken captive, and that Jeph the Repudiator was flying southward, giing out boastings and proclamations. 2. (This was before the other Phiretah captains had laid down their arms.) 3. -They were dismayed and said one to another, Now shall we be put to. the sword and carried away captive, and hanged upon treei, and roasted with fire, and have hot pitch poured upon us, and be ridden upon sharp beams very grievous to    THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        21 bestride, even as we did before this war unto the Iangkies when they came among us saying, Do ye unto all men even as ye would have all men do unto you. 4. Behold we are subdued; and our Niggahs, to keep which we would fain have destroyed the government of Unculpsalm, are taken from us. 5. And most of them submitted themselves and put their necks under the yoke. But some of them, as they heard that Jeph the Repudiator was flying southward, giving out boastings and proclamations, conceived wickedness in their hearts, and said, There yet remaineth unto us one opportunity. 6. For although peace seemeth to be coming unto the land, it is not peace according to the new gospel. 7. And it behoveth us that there shall be a new ministration of this gospel, for the ministrations that have been, from the time when Prestenbruux ministered it unto Charles the Summoner unto the day when Phernandiwud ministered it unto the watch- men of Gotham, and until the day when the Pahdees and the friends of Horatio the Seemer ministered it unto the people of Gotham, and the Niggahs that were therein, did not attain unto the power and the majesty and the might that pertaineth unto this gospel. 8. Let there be therefore a  new ministration which  hlall bring us peace according  unto the new gospel, which shall cause all ministrations which have been heretofore to seem as nothing, and which shall make an end of the government of Abraham the Honest; for we will not have this man to rule over us. 9. Then they took counsel together, and said one to another; Remember now the ministration of Prestenbruux how it came to naught, was it not because only one mplan was ministered unto, and he, even Charles the Summoner, was left alive?   Let us therefore do no such folly, but let us be thorough in this matter. 10. And they took counsel together to slay Abraham and all his counsellors, and Ulysses, the chief captain, and Andrew, whose surname was Jon-sing, in one night.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8286-00000012"/> (  22       THE NEW GOsPEL OF PEACE. ". For they said, Thus shall the government of Uneulpsalm come to an end, and the power of the Iangkies shall vanish away, and there shall be confusion among the counsellors, and the armies shall be without a leader, and weakness shall come upon the land as upon a man who fainteth by the wayside. 12. And we shall seize upon the government, and the Kopur- hedds shall join themselves unto us, and the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmichrats, and the friends of Horatio the Seemer. For did they not minister the new gospel in unto the officers of Abraham; and unto the Iangkies and the Niggahs that dwelt within Gotham, and the country round about? And we shall rule the land, and the new gospel of peace shall prevail. 13. Then a band of the Phiretahs bound themselves together by an oath, and they laid in wait to slay Abraham and his coun- sellors, and Ulysses the chief captain, and Andrew, whose sur- name was Jon-sing, on the s me night. ". Now at the time when the band of the Phiretahs con- spired together to slay Abraham and his counsellors, and Ulysses, and Andrew whose surname was Jon-sing, Bilhe, whose sur- name was Zoord, lay sick in his house. 15. And there came a day whereon Abraham had commanded the banner of Unculpsalm to be raised with great rejoicings upon the ruins of the fortwhich lay before Tchawlstn, and when he was to go to the hall of the players, that the men players and women players might play before him even as David played upon the harp before Saul. For his head was weary, and his heart was troubled, even in the hour of the triumph of the land of Unculpsalm. And Ulysses the chief captain was to go with him to the hall of the players. 16. And the liers-in-wait said, Behold our opportunity has come; for we can slay Abraham and the chief captain together, and one of us shall slay Bilhe the chief counsellor as he lieth sick upon his bed, and another shall slay Andrew, whose sur- name is Jon-sing, and others also the other counsellors. 17. And Abraham went to the hall, and sat in a little room in the gallery, he and his wife and one of his captains; and the   THE NEW GOSPEL OF   PEACE.      23 men players and women players played before him, and before the people that were in the hall round about. But Ulysses the chief captain went not to the hall with Abraham, but journeyed into the north country. 18. But the liers-in-wait said, We can tarry no longer, let the ministration be this night, even although the chief captain be not with Abraham. Moreover hath he not taken his journey upon a roadway of iron? Mayhap the Lord will deliver him into our hands through the hands of the Durrektahs. 19. Now the Durrektahs were robbers. 20. And they lived upon the roadways of iron (for there were roadways of iron in the land of Unculpsalm through the country and even in the cities thereof), and the Durrektahs enticed the people thereon, men, women and children, saying unto them:  21. Come unto us, for our ways like the ways of wisdom are ways of pleasantness and all our paths are peace. 22. And the people listened unto them, and went upon their roadways, and the Durrektahs took them and thrust them into prison, even prisons upon wheels, noisome and ill-smelling, so that they could not breathe. 23. And on the roadways in the cities the Durrketahs thrust the people by fifties and by hundreds into dungeons, even dun- geons upon wheels, until there was not room- therein for a man's hand, so that they could neither sit nor stand as it becometh men to sit or stand, but each was held up by being pressed against the other.            , 24. And the people seethed together in the wheeled dun- geons, even as the flesh of a kid is seethed in a pot; and the steam of their seething went up round about them and became the breath of their nostrils; and as they were dragged on in the dungeons, with what breath they had they reviled their tormentors. 25. And when the Durrektahs had taken the money of the people and put them  into the wheeled dungeons, ofttimes they killed them, dashing out their brains and breaking their arms  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8286-00000013"/> 24      .THE NEW GOSPEL OF rEAUf. and legs. So that whereas in other countries when one man hated another, he fell upon him with the sword- and slew him, or mingled poison with his meat, in-the land of Unculpsalm he was gracious unto him, and lent him money and sent him to take a journey upon a roadway of iron whereon there were Durrektahs. 26. Yet the people slewnot theDurrektahs; for the Ian es were long suffering and slow to anger, except men treated them with scorn and reviled them like the men of Jonbool; and the Durrektahswaxed rich and robbed and murdered diligently day by day; and no man hindered them.        ' 27. Wherefore it was that the Phiretahs looked that mayhap Ulysses should be put to death at the hands of the Durrelktahs. 28. And it came to pass that while the men players and women players played before Abraham as he sat in the little room, and before the people as they sat in the hall, one of the liers-in-wait entered the room privily and slew him by the side of his wife, and while men stood still with astonishment, he fled and escaped into the wilderness of Pharinee, even into the country of the Ephephvees. '  29. And at the same time another of the same band entered the house of the chief counsellor whose surname was Zoord, saying, Let me see the chief counsellor, for I am come from his physician.  30. And he made his way to the bed-side of the sick, and fell upon him and smote him with the sword, that he fell down upon the ground as one dead. Yet was he not dead. 31. And the lier-in-wait also smote the son of Zoord, and leaving him for dead fled also. But the hearts of the men to whom it had been given to slay the counsellor for war, and Andrew whose surname was Jon-sing, failed them. 32. And there was great sorrow throughout the land when it was known that Abraham was dead and in the lands beyond the sea. And even in the land of Jonbool, men bewailed them-   THE NE   GOSPEL OF PE ACE. :    25 selves that he was slain. For all men saw that he had been a just man and a merciful, and that he judged the land in right- eousness. 33. And the men of Jonbool sent messages to the land of IUnculpsalm, telling the people of that land their sorrow for the slaying of Abraham, and that they held his name in honor. 34. But the langkies answered and said, Ye do well thatye are sorry; but must a ruler of the land of Unculpsalm be slain by liers-in-wait before ye can see that he is worthy of honor? Go to, now, what valueth such honor to him or to us? 35. And men went out into the wilderness after the liers-in- wait, and pursued them upon horses, and one they slew, and the others they took, and they hanged them upon a gallows, and a woman that had been privy to their lying-in-wait. 36. And Abraham's body was embalmed and was taken through the land and through the cities and villages thereof, by the same way by which he had passed when he came from his house, when he was first chosen to be chief ruler, and over which he returned not again alive. And the people which had come out to meet him then to greet him with - rejoicing now came sorrowing, and as his coffin passed they uncovered their heads and bowed themselves down before it. And the land mourned Abraham many days. CHAPTER VII. 1 Andrew ruleth the land of Uneulpsalm. 7 The Irlers of Jonbool and tho Phiretahs tremble. Jeph the Rpudiator fleeth Southward.

For the counsellorsaui all the people said, Is not Andrew, whose surname is Jon-sing, chosen to be chief ruler in the stead of Abraham? Let the land be ruled as aforetime according to the Great Covenant -which is like unto the laws of the Medes and Persians and altereth not. 4. And Ulysses, the ;ehef captain, escaped alive out of the hands of the Durrektahs, so that the armies lacked not a leader; and the land was stronger than it was before the slaying of Abraharn.   , 5. For Robbutleeh and his chief officers, and even all them, save the robbers, among the Phiretahs which went about slaying each other with knit es and with shooting irons, declared against this manner of p]tting to death privily by liers-in-wait. And they said, Behol we are discomfited and subdued, doth it not behove us to smit to the conqueror that he may be merciful unto us andnot grind us to powder? 6.  all other nations and peoples were amazed,'and said, L   Bis is wonderful in our eyes that the Iangkies have sub- ued the Phiretahs, and more, that when their chief ruler was put to /death, although there were factions in the land, the government fell not into confusion; neither did the Iangkies fall upon the Phiretahs and put them to the sword, and visit their own sins upon them, treating them as they had been treated by the Phiretahs, but every man went his way in peace, and justice was done even as aforetime. Such a thing was not known before; no, not since the world began. 7. And the rulers of the other lands and the scribes sought to recommend themselves unto the governors and unto the people of the land of Unculpsalm. For they remembered how they had spoken evil of that land and thrust out the lip at it when they thought the nation might be destroyed and the people divided; how the shipmen of the land of Jonbool had builded war-ships for the Phiretahs and the king of the PahUvoos had sent over an army into Mecsiebo, which otherwise he had not   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        2" dared to do. For the rulers and the scribes said, Lest these Iangkies, having their army ready to be set in battle array and their war-ships builded, make war upon us.  9. Now as Jeph the Repudiator fled southward, uttering boastings and proclamations, messengers overtook him saying that Robbutleeh had been discomfited, and had laid down his arms, and given himself up captive, and that the other Phiretah captains would do likewise. And when Jeph heard this he stopped his boastings and his proclamations, and fled on the faster. But the horsemen of Unculpsalm followed hard after. 10. And there were with Jeph certain soldiers of the Phiretahs which kept guard over him night and day; and his wife also was with him. And when they rested by the way .they went not into villages and houses, but pitched their tents in the fields. ". And before many days the horsemen of Unculpsalm came up with them, and the Phiretahs fled before them and left Jeph and his wife and their servants in their tents. 12. And Jeph's wife said unto him, Jeph, the Iangkies be upon thee. Flee now for thy life, and take to the woods and the mountains; else they will take thee and hang thee, even as the Iangkie boys have sung, saying, 13. We will hang Jeph the Repudiator upon a tree; ". Upon an apple tree shall Jeph be hanged; 15. Yea upon a   tree that beareth bitter apples shall he-be lifted up. 16. And Jeph answered and said, How can I flee, seeing that the Iangkies have surrounded us on every side, and that they know me, and that I am not swift of foot to flee before them; and moreover that they will seize upon every man that cometh out from our tents and carry him away captive or mayhap put him to death instantly?      f 17. And his wife said Hearken unto me. Behold here are my garments: put them on straightway, and put this bonnet upon thy head, and go out of the tent boldly, and I will go with thee and say thou art my  mother.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8286-00000015"/> a28      THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. 18. Then Jeph answered and said, I may not put on thy gar- ments; for although it is written that a woman may wear the garment of her husband, even the garment which is unmention- able, and all men know that she often doeth it, it is not written that the husband maywear the garments of the wife. 19. Moreover I have not proved this raiment; and the inner garments are fearfully and wonderfully made, and are like unto a ladder, even a ladder upon which angels' feet are seen even as Jacob saw them when he slept at Padan-aram. And the guid- ing of these garments is learned only after many trials. And peradventure I shall wear them without showing what they are feigned to conceal, and then will the Iangkies know that I am  not a woman.  20. But Jeph's wife hearkened not unto his pleadings,--but persuaded him earnestly. And he suffered her to indue him with the garments; and she put them on'hastily; for the Iangkies came on apace and the peril was great. 21. And they went out of the tent, she and her husband. And they met certain of the Iangkies who said unto them, We seek Jeph the Repudiator.) Tell us now where we may find him, and it shall be well with you. 22. And Jeph's wife answered and said, thy handmaid knoweth not where Jeph is. He was among our tents, but when my lords the langkies came he fled, thy handmaid knoweth not whither. Suffer now thy handmaid to depart with her mother who is with her, that they may draw water and they will relurn again.                 e 23. And the Iangkies suffered them, and turned to look after them as they departed. And Jeph's heart sank within him as he went, and he began to go faster. And the garments cumbered him as he went. 24. Then he thought within himself, O that I might gird up my loins and flee; but I canot because of the fashion of the garments. Yet may I not lift up the outer garments about my knees, even as I have seen the women of Gothan lift them Up, gathering therm on each side in their hands, in the street which '                . ^ ,'  '  j .

And he lifted them. 25. And it came to pass that when Jeph lifted the garments and ran, the Iangkies looking saw his feet and his legs running; and they said one to another, 26. Behold now, and see: the garments are the garments of a woman, but the feet are the feet of a man; neither doth a woman when she raiseth her garments stride in this fashion with her legs, but minceth her steps. 27. And they saw it was a man, and they pursued after. And Jeph raised the garments higher, even unto the girding of his loins that he might flee the faster, and they fluttered in the wind behind him as he fled. 28. And the Iangkies outran him   and overtook him; and saw that it was Jeph the Repudiator who had boasted himself that he was chief ruler over half the land of Unculpsalm. And they sent him to Andrew whose surname was Jon-singyand Andrew cast him into prison.

And it came to pass after the slaying of Abraham that the Kopurheddsand thesectof Smalphri among the Dimmichrats said among themselves, Lo now had been the day of oar triumph had we not been at enmity with Andrew who sitteth in the seat of Abraham. 2. For Andrew was a Dimmichrat; but so it was that when  he was made governor over his province the Kopurhedds and the sect of Smalphri reviled him and spoke evil against him day by day, saying,  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8286-00000016"/> 30,      THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. 3. This man is like the beasts of the field, for he walloweth like a sow, and he raveneth like a wolf; and his ravings and his howlings are like the wild beast of the forests, he is faithless as a serpent, even as a cockatrice is he unto the men of his sect and his province. 4. Moreover he made garments aforetime for the Phiretahs, and caused them to turn away from the handiwork of the sons of Mizphit.  5. And when Andrew was chosen to be second in the land and to rule if need be in the stead of Abraham, then were the railings and revilings of the Kopurhedds and the sect of Smalphri against him tenfold greater than before. For they thought that thus they would commend themselves unto their masters the Phiretahs by reviling a man born among them who loved the land of Unculpsalm more than he loved the everlasting Niggah, and who had set his face against them in their rebellion. 6; And. chief among them who reviled Andrew was Assokald Edittah, the scribe in Gotham) who to gain the World had lost his own soul. 7. For although he reviled Abraham and his chief counsellors day by day, and had reviled them for three years, ever since he had sold himself unto the Kopurhedds in the second year of the rule of Abraham, yet he published it unto the people of Gotham that they should pray that the life of Abraham might be pre- served, lest perchance the rule might fall into the hands of this Andrew whose surname was Jon-sing, saying that he was like unto a beast, even to the unclean beast that is worshipped in the city of Swine-sin-naughty, and no fitter than a horse to rule the land of Unculpsalm. 8. For he bethought him not that Andrew might one day sit in the seat of Abraham. 9. Thus it was that the Kopurhedds were at enmity with Andrew, and that they bewailed themselves, saying, Behold now Andrew is a Dimnmichrat and we also are Dimmichrats ; woe unto us that'we have reviled him, else we might join ourselves unto him and set ourselves against the Phiretahs (now that they are   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.         31 conquered), and he would make us his officers and the govern- ment should again be in the hands of our faction, and we should be tax-gatherers, and sit at the receipt of custom. 10. And it came to pass that after a little while they did btrive to join themselves unto Andrew, and they bowed them- selves down unto him and said, Hail my lord chief ruler of the land of Unculpsalm that is to be. And they compromised themselves unto him. ". But of all that compromised themselves the chiefest was Assokald Edditah who had gained his World and lost his soul ; for he compromised himself daily before Andrew, and crawled on his belly in the dust before him, and said,-Be gracious my lord unto the meanest of thy servants; and let the light of thy countenance shine upon thy servant, and suffer thy servant to lick the dust from thy feet, and place thy foot upon the neck of thy servant, for thou art the light of this land and the saviour of this people; and it is meet and right and pleasant that thy servant should compromise himself unto thee and crawl upon his belly in the dust before thee, and that his body should be thy footstool.  Only be gracious unto thy servant and his friends; and unto thee be the power and the glory, and unto us the loaves and the fishes. 12. But when Andrew had heard this he said within himself Doth this scribeling think that a man forgetteth on one day that which was the day before?  Do I not know this man and they who bought him, and what they have been these three years when there was need of true men in the land? Now as I live, and as my soul liveth, and as I hate a rebel against the government of Unculpsalm, so more than a rebel do I hate and loathe a Kopurhedd. 13. And Andrew regarded not the words of the Kopurhedds, but passed them by as the idle wind, and kept his counsel in his own heart.                    . ". But nevertheless the Kopurhedds continued to bow down unto him, and the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmichrats magnified him, and the Phiretahs abased themselves before him,  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8286-00000017"/> 82     .THE NEW GOSPEL OV PEACE. and they among the Iangkies who worshipped the everlasting Niggah, and served him only, sought to join Andrew unto them- selves. For they each of them said, If Andrew will join himself unto us we can rule the land of Unculpsalm in the interest-of our faction.      i          : 15. But Andrew cared for none of these things, and gave himself diligently to ruling the land according to the Great Covenant. And as he ruled 'it the Kopurhedds and the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmnnichrats, and the Phiretahs, and the worshippers of the everlasting Niggah all went about crying, Great is Andrew whose surname is Jon-sing, and we are his pro- phets! Hail to him chief ruler of the land of Unculpsalmn that is to be hereafter 1 16. And about the time when Jeph was taken captive and coast into prison, Augustus the money changer, who was one of the chiefs of the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmichrats that set up Litulmak to be chosen chief ruler in the place of Abraham, went to the land of Jonbool;  17. And passed through it to the countries beyond wherein he was born and brought up, and whither aforetime when Phranclin ruled the land he had been sent as an ambassador; so that the men of those countries said, Behold they send a stranger unto us: Are there not men born in the land of Unculpsalm that are fit to be sent ambassadors, but must they obtain one of our people and send him back to us to speak for them? 18. And others answered Hehath bought this office of the Dimmichrats with a price. For he hath gathered together much gold and silver in his money changing, and he coveted honor; and he had such honor as may be bought.     i 19. Now when he came into the land of Jonbool, there met him other money changers, rich men whose servant he had been, and who had sent him into the land of Unculpsalm to write them letters from that land, with news that they might get gain thereby in their moneychanging. And they also were of the circuiL sion. a   . *    THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.         33 20. And when they met him they looked upon him in silence, and Augustus saw that they were wroth with him., 21. Then one of them whose name was Nathan opened his mouth and said unto Augustus, How is it that thou hast not written the truth unto us in thy letters? For day after day these three years hast thou assured us that the Phiretahswould prevail, that the land of Unculpsalm would be divided in twain, and that Jeph the Repudiator would be ruler over one half thereof. 22. Wherefore believing thee our servant in what thou sentest unto us ia thy letters, we have gone astray in our money-chang- ing; and thou hastnot only lost us muchmoney that we had, but hast hindered us of much money that we might have gained. Tell us now wherefore thou hast done this evil against us, even against us whose servant thou wast, and who lifted thee up and sent'thce over into the land of Unculpsalm?  It seemeth to us that thou art not cunning to be a money-changer or that the truth is not in thee. 23. And Augustus stood before them dumb, and answered not a word.  And after these things men heard of him no more.

And about those days there arose certain men, Pahdees, calling themselves Phainyuns, who conspired together to wrest the isle of Ouldairin from the Queen of the land of Jonbool. 2. Now it was from  the islo of Ouldairin that the Pahdees : came into the land of Unculpsalm. And they professed great love unto that isle, insomuch that they oftentimes gathered c  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8286-00000018"/> 34       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. themselves together and poured out drink offerings in honor of . Ouldairin, and put on green aprons and green apparel upon their sioulders, and put green branches in their caps, and walked about the streets carrying green banners. '.. 3. (For Ouldairin was also called the green isle, and they - that came from it into the land of Unculpsalm were called Green-auns). 4. And every man when he wished them to give their voices that he should be made a judge or an officer, must needs praise not the land of Unculpsalm and the Iangkies who framed the government and the laws thereof, but the isle of Ouldairin, and-the Pahdees who from the beginning neither established government in their own land nor administered laws anywhere, except in the city of Gotham. 5. Yet although the Pahdees came from that land because they were poor, and many of them became rich in the land of Unculpsalm, it was never known of any man that a Pahdee returned with his riches to the isle of Ouldairin, that he pro- fessed so much love unto, neither he nor his children. 6. But although the Pahdees never had established govern- ment or administered laws in Ouldairin, they diligently sought instead thereof to have schyndees therein, first with the men who sought to establish a government for them, but if not with them then with each other. 7. And the schyndees were great schyndees, and went on without ceasing from one end of the island even unto the other until there arose rone whose name was Nohl, who was a man after the heart of the Iangkies. 8. And he was of their blood and of their kind, and in very deecLbe was a Iangkie, and he ruled the Iangkies and the land whence the Iangkies had come. For this was before that land came under the dominion of the evil spirit Jonbool, and its people ceased to be like the langkies and became Jonboolish; whic came to pass about four generations after the fathers of the Iangkies went out of that land.   THE- NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        35 9. And Nohl was a great captain before the Lord., And ho went over to Ouldairin, and he fell upon the Pahdees Who had been making schyndees with his officers and- with each other and he smote them hip and thigh, and put every man of them to the sword. And he swept that land even as a woman sweepeth a room to garnish it.            r 10. And after that there were no more schyndees in Howl- daring, save the schyndees that every Pahdee maketh with some other Padhee, lest he should pine away and die. For if the Pahdees strove to make a great schyndee against the men of Jonbool the king of Jonbool sent officers with a little army and the Pahdees remembered Nohl, and the remembrance dissolved their knees and wrought confusion in their counsels. ". But now the Pahdees in the land of Unculpsalm said one to another, Are we not in the land of Unculpsalm, where the power of Jonbool cannot touch us nor his officers follow us? and we are many and receive money; let us therefore conspire to make a great schyndee in the isle of Ouldairin. 12. And they gathered themselves together and they took a large upper room, and they placed men at the outside of the outer door, clad  in raiment of green and gold, and having drawn swords in their hands. 13. For they said, How shall men know that we are conspir. ing secretly, unless we set a guard over ourselves? ". And they chose a chief man to rule them, and they called him the lUid-Sinter, which being interpreted, is the top middle;  for in the tongueof the Pahdees Mhid is top, and sinter is middle' 15. For they said, How shall men know of him what he i unless we call him the Hid-Sinter? For how can they kno% that he is not in the middle unless we call him the hid, and how can they know that he is not at the top unless we call him the sinter? 1 A. And it came to pass that after many days the Hid-Sinter  x sent out tax gatherers, and they went among the Pahdees and v hiefly among the Bihdees thoughout the city of Gotham and the other cities in the land of Unculpsalm , and they gathered    &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8286-00000019"/> 36       THE NEW GOSPEL OP PEACE. tribute- of the Pahdees and the Bihdees; and the sum thereof was great, even hundreds of thousands of pieces (f silver. i 17. Then the Hid-Sinter and his chief officers took unto themselves a house great and spacious in the city of Gotham, and they adorned it, and fared sumptuously therein, and poured out drink offerings night and day unto the isle of Ouldairin. 18. And they set up a government therein which they called the government of Ouldairin, and chose unto themselves certain lawgivers which they called the Sinnit. 19. And when men asked of them, How is it that this is the government of Ouldairin, seeing that Ouldairin is three thou- sand miles away, and is ruled by the Queen and the lawgivers of the land of Jonbool? that the Phainyuns answered and said: 20. Is not this man the Hid-Sinter? and are not these men the Sinnit? and do not these other men guard the door in gar- ments of green and gold with drawn swords that men may know that we are conspiring secretly? And the laws that the Sinnlit makes and the Hid-Sinter signs with his name, are they not declared to be the laws of the isle of Ouldairin? and can the Queen of Jonbool prevent this or pass the men who guard the door with drawn swords and arrayed in garments of green and gold? How therefore is it not the government of Ouldairin? 21. Now it came to pass that when certain of the Pahdees, Phainyuns, saw that the Hid-Sinter and his chief officers lived in a great house, and fared sumptuously every day, and poured out drink offerings unto Ouldairin night and mornintg, and livedjas if all their kinsfolk and acquaintance were dying day by day, and that there was a ouaic without end, 22. That their souls were moved with envy, and they said each within his own heart, Why should I not live-in a great house and fare sumptuously and pour out drink offerings unto Ouldairin, and have a ouaic without end? 23. But unto each other and unto the world they said, Behold the Hid-Sinter and his officers do not govern Ouldairia rightoously, and, they waste the substance of the people., ' *     ../   THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.         37 24. Let us therefore declare their government to  be at an end, and let us set up a new government with a new Hid- Sinter and a new Sinnit, even ourselves. And they did so. 25. And they declared that the first Hid-Sinter was no longer Hid-Sinter, but that their Hid-Sinter was the real Hid-Sinter, and was not only at the top and at the middle but at the bot- tom and at both sides at the same time; and moreover they especially declared that tribute money should no more be paid to the first Ilid-Sintor and his officers, but unto theirs. 26. But the first Hid- Sinter and his officers would not be set at naught, neither would they cease receiving tribute money; but they declared that the second Hid-Sinter and his officers themselves were naught. 27. And so it came to pass that there were three govern- ments for the isle of Ouldairin; one in the land of Jonbool and two in the city of Gotham in the land of Unculpsalm, and that neither of these governments could do aught to hinder the other. 28. But when the Phainyuns gathered unto themselves men, Pahdees, in toe island of Ouldairin, who went about there in the night time with swords and with spears and with staves, 29. The governors sent there by the Queen of Jonbool took these men and cast some of thelminto prison, and banished others into a far country. And the great council of the land of Jonbool mnade a law by which the governors of Ouldairin might take any man and cast him into prison and keep him there with- out trial; and they did-so with many men. 30. And so the end of the Phainyuns was that they brought it to pass, that every Pahdee in the isle of Ouldairin might be fast into prison and kept there without a trial. And therefore do the Phainyuns in the land of Unculpsalm believe that Ould- airin is governed by their Hid-Sinter and their Sinnit unto this day.   &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8286-00000020"/> 38       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. /' CHAPTER X.

And about these days certain men of the land of Jonbool, friends of the Phiretahs, to whom they had lent money, hoping to receive the same with usury, 2. (As it is written in the first book of this gospel, thus shall we be'avenged, and turn also every man an honest penny,) 3. Seeing that Robbutleeh had laid down his arms, and that Jeph the Repudiator was cast into prison, went to the ambassa- dor of the Phiretahs in the land of Jonbool, saying, Pay us that thou owest.  4. To whom  the ambassador answering said, I owe you nothing. For it was not unto me that ye lent the money, but unto the ambassador of the ruler of the Phiretahs. Behold  now there is no longer a truler of the Phiretahs, neither are there Phiretahs any more in the land of Unculpsalm, and so therefore am I no longer an ambassador; for no man can be an ambassa- dor when there is none to send. 5. Go now therefore and find your debtor, for I am not he; and when ye have found him, ye shall receive your own with usury; and so although ye be not avenged ye shall turn every man hishonest penny. 6. Then these men of Jonbool gathered themselves together and looked in each other's faces in amazement and perplexity; for the. said, We cannot find our debtor, for he has vanished from the face of the earth.- And they began to bellow forth their grievance; for there is nothing that grieveth the men of  ,   F e    *  *  THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.         39  3 Jonbool so sore as not to receive their own with usury; and the noise of their bellowings was heard throughout the land and upon the sea, even the bellowing as of the bulls of Basan. - 7. And after they had bellowed for a time, a certain man rose in their assembly, and said, Behold now there is no longer any ruler of - the Phiretahs, neither any nation of Phiretahs to pay us our money which we lent to destroy the government of Unculpsalm; but the rulers of Unculpsalm have driven out the rulers of the Phiretahs, and rule the whole land of Unculpsalm as aforetime. 8. Let therefore the government of Unculpsalm  and  the people thereof which inhabit the country of the Phiretalhs pay us the money that we lent that the government of Unculpsalm might be destroyed, as, it is meet and right for them to do. For whatever may be destroyed, there always remaineth some man or some thing to whom  it belongeth to pay every man of Jonbool his own with usury. 9. And the saying pleased the assembly; and they all cried out Eereer and Oor-ae, which in the tongue of the Hittites and Hammerites of Gotham is Hi hi and Bulhiphurewe. 10. But when the ambassador of Andrew said to the rulers of the land of Jonbool, Behold now the ships of war which the shipmen of Jonbool builded for the Phiretahs, and which went forth from you without let or hindrance to burn the ships of our merchants upon the seas did great damage to us and to our people with whom the men of Jonbool are not at war, but to whom the rulers of Jorbool profess friendship. ". Pay us therefore for the ships which have been burned,. because ye did not let or hinder your shipmen in building ships for the Phiretahs or the Phiretahs in taking them from your havens, but winked at their doings. 12. The rulers of the land of Jonbool answered and said, Go to, we will not pay, neither is it unto us that ye are to  charge your losses. Look ye yourselves after the ships of your merchants. It becometh not the rulers of the great land of Jonubool to let or hinder any man of Jonbool in turning an  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8286-00000021"/> 40       THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. honest penny whoever may suffer by reason thereof. The laws of the great land of Jonbool are as the laws of the Medes and Persians and alter not, except when it is to our profit to alter theml nor can we change them only to hinder our shipmen from building ships to destroy the government of Unculpsalm. 13. Then the ambassador of the land of Unculpsalm took counsel with Bilhe, whose surname was Zoord, and said unto the rulers of Jonbool: ". Behold now we are at issue in this matter. If ye will not pay for the ships which the ships of war that were builded in your eyes and which have come out before your faces have destroyed, let there be a judge appointed to pronounce judgment between us, according unto the testimony; and let the judge be one who is held in- honor in the land of Jonbool and in the land of Unculpsalm. 15. But the rulers of the land of Jonbool answerel and said, We will neither pay, nor shall there be a judge appointed between us. 16. This did they after the mannerof the rulers of the land of Joibool; and the men of Joubool after their manner cried Eereer and Oorae. 17. But the men of Unculpsalm said one to another, Con- tent: we can wait and see what time will bring forth out of this matter. This example may be worth more unto us than payment.              . 18. And when the Phainyunsin the land of Unculpsalm arose the hearts of the merchants of Joibool quaked and their knees knocked together; for they looked that the men of Unculpsalm should help and encourage the Phainyuns.

For about that time the rulers of many of, the prvinces of the land of Unculpsalm were to be chosen. And the sect of the Dimmichrats set up their men to be chosen, andthe sect of the Eunyunmen set up theirs. 3. Now they who had held up the hands of Abraham and his councillors throughout the war against the Pbireahs, without regard to their own sect or faction, called themselves Eunyun- men   ad or '6 ne ofe poncfrh rid  ndthese Hu men; and chief of these Eunyunmen was Andrew, whose sur- name was Jon-sing, whom the death of Abraham had made chief ruler.

But sometimes a scaffold waxed old, and because it was decayed and weak, it broke down! under him that was lifted -upon it, and he fell among the ruins thereof among the people; and being laughed to scorn, he was not chosen. J 7. And to prevent this calamity the old parts of the platforms and-parts that no longer were acceptable in the eyes of the people, were taken out and new planks put in the places thereof, so that at last the substance of the scaffold was entirely changed, and yet was it called by the same name. d b.; 8. :And- it- came to pass that when the time drew nigh to build the scaffolds, the chief men of the Dimmichrats in the pro- vince of Gotham, seeing that the scaffolds whereon the men of their faction had been lifted up in other provinces were looked upon askance by the people, although much of, the old' which seemed goodly in their eyes in the days when they looked upon it lying upon their bellies as they compromised themselves before the Phiretahs, had been taken away and parts of new fashion put in place thereof, - 9.

What shall we do for a scaffold on which our man may be hfted up and which will seem goodly in the eyes of the people now that they are standing up before the Lord like men, even as our old scaffolds seemed when we looked upon them lying on our bellies before the Phiretahs? For the people are possessed of the evil spirit Bak Bohn, and they will have none of those things. And they were at their wits' end; for they could not find wherewithal of their own to make a new scaffold that would -pleatsethe people.      THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.         43 ". But a certain man among them, a man of craft and sub- tlety, who also was a Durrektah, and robbed upon the roadway which leadeth unto the city of the Bisons, as thou goest unto the land of the Kahnux by the place of the Falling Waters, and which is called Gothamsentrul, opened his lips in the assembly and said, 12. Why should we take thought and trouble about building a scaffold on which to set our man when there is one builded already?              i 13. And they asked him, What meanest thou? and where is this scaffold? And he answered and said, Even the scaffold of the Eunyunmen, which is ready to our hand. Let us take it and set our man thereon, and the Dimmichrats shall say, Behold it is our men, and the Eunyunmen shall say, Lo, is it not our scaffold? and we shall have all theirvoices. ". And the saying pleased the assembly. And they did according unto the saying, and went secretly, and stole the scaffold of the Eunyunmen and set up their men upon it. 15. And all the people marvelled at the craft and the subtlety of the Durrektah, which did his robbing upon the road called Gothamsentrul which leadeth unto the city of the Bisons. 16. Now when the Eunyunmen saw what had been done, they were astonished, and knew not what to do. And their chief men assembled themselves together in sore perplexity, saying, 17. Woe are we; for our scaffold is not only taken from us but it is used by the Dimmichrats who set it up as their scaffold, and we cannot get it of them by suing them at the law; and if we make one like it, men will say that we have stolen the scaffold of the Dimmichrats; for they were before us in this matter. And the Eunyunmen were at their wits' end for a scaffold, so that some of them said Let us give our voices for the Dimmichrats because they stand upon our scaffold.  ..   .   -.. 18. But a certain man among them arose and said, Why are ye thus cast down, and why talk ye thus foolishy together? Let  ts build another scaffold of our own like unto that which the Dimmichrats have stolen from us; and let us set up our men u4po  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8286-00000023"/> "       THE NEW GOSPEL OP PEACE. it, and it shall come to pass that when the people see that both the scaffolds are the same, then they shall do what they have not done aforetime, and they will look at the men instead of the scaffolds, and see who they are and what they have been; 19. And it shall be that when they find one man is a Eun- yunman, and that both stand upon the same scaffold and preach from the same pulpit, that only those will give their voices for the other who are Dimmichrats, that care more for their faction than for the government of Unculpsalm. 20. And thoUgmh they still doubted and were sad at heart, the Eunyunmen did as this man-had counselled. And it was as he had foretold. For the people said, These men prophesy in the same words and stand on scaffolds which are like one to the other; but one of them is the friend of James who faced both ways, and of Phernandiwud, and of Horatio who is called Seemer.  Let us therefore give-our-voices for the other who is not of the synagogue of Satan.  21. So the Eunyunmen were chosen in the province of Gotham as well as in the other provinces; and the voices for the Eunyunmen wereas the voices of a great multitude, like unto the waves of the sea for numbers. 22. -Moreover about those days a new sentence, even a great decree, was added to the Great Covenant which set the Niggahs free in all the land of Unculpsalm, and in every province thereof forever. 23. And even the Phiretahs in theirprovinces consented unto this sentence; for they were no longer) Phiretabhs 24. And the people rejoiced greatly; and there went up a great shout from. all the land that there was no more any ever- lasting Nigah. And men's hearts were glad; for they were weary of the everlasting Niggah, and their souls sickened when they thought of the blood and the treasure that he had cost them, and they thought in their joy that they should- hear no more of him              .

And again about these days the time came when there should be a chief ruler chosen for the city of Gotham. 2. And four men were set up: but Phernandiwud did not set himself up. Yet did he set up one of the four; and the men of Tammunee which were Dimmichrats, but which had held up the hands of Abraham,'set up one also, and the Eunyunmen set up another. , 3. And he that was set up by the men of Tammunee was chosen; but he that was set up by the Eunyunmen was nearly chosen; and he that Phernandiwud set up had so few voices that men laughed him to scorn. 4. Likewise also the sect of Phyarmen disappeared; for the lawgivers of the province of Gotham declared that there should no longer be any Phyarmen. 5. And when Phernandiwud saw all these things, that the men set up for rulers were rejected only because they were Dimmi- chrats, and that the man of his naming was set at naught in the choosing of chief ruler for the city of Gotham; and -that there was neither any more everlasting Niggah or any more Phyarhaen, he perceived that the foundations of the world were shaken and that the end of the sect of the Dimmichrats was nigh. . 6. Then he said within himself, What shall I do? And like Pshawdee when he doubted whether he should join himself unto the Pharisees or unto the Phyarmen, so Phernandiwud, because there were no longer any Plhyarmen, doubted whether he should oin himself unto the Pharisees or unto the Phainyuns. a 7. But when he considered the Pharisees, and saw that they received no man among them  whose walk had been found  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8286-00000024"/> "      THE- NEW- GOSPEL"OF 'PEACE. slantindicular, he joined himself unto the Phainyuns. For he said within himself, Even althdugh the foundations of the world be broken up, the Pahdees will govern Gotham; and if I join myself unto the Phainyuns they can at any time make me chief ruler over the city. 8.- -Now to be chief ruler over the city of Gotham no longer brought honor or power to any man. For the lawgivers of the province had taken away the power, because of Phernandiwud and of the Palhdees; and Phernandiwud himself had taken away the honor. But the chief ruler of Gotham made many small officers and had offerings of pursentojobs made unto him. Wherefore although the power and the honor had departed, some men sought to be chief ruler over Gotham and, Phernandiwud was among them. ' 9. And there was an assembly of the Phainyuns at the hall of Peter the barrel-maker, and Phernandiwud went to the assem- :bly, and standing up he said, 10. Men, brethren, and Phainyunq, the duties of the up- right man are three. And the first is to keep the command- ments. All this have I done from my youth up. ". And the second is to take care of himself and his family. For is it not written that he, that provideth not for his own house is worse than an infidel? Wherefore my brethren ye know that in this I am better than any infidel, and have been from the days/when I was partner unto; Marahvine even unto this day. ,. 12. And the third is that a man should be ready to maintain the government of his country, and to sacrifice himself thereunto. :Wow I say unto you that to maintain the government of the land, of Unculpsalm it is needful that we go to war with the men of Jonbool about the island of Ouldairin; and for a man to sacrifice himself to his country he ought to offer himself up willingly to be chosen hief ruler of Gotham; and this I am willing to do, my brethren, X Blessed be the Phainyuns, and cursed bethe men ofJonbool. '  -. i3..Then-were thePahdees 'pleased with the:words of Pher- nian&amp;iwud; ;so.-thatthey broke out i ginto shoutigso and dainmgs   and shaking of staves which in the language of the Pahdees are called shall-lay-lows; and for about the space of half an hour they shouted Great is Phernandiwud, and great are the Pahdees and worthy to be rulers in Gotham, and glorious are the Phain- yuns among the Pahdees, and worthy is Phernandiwuld to be a leader among the Phainyuns and chief ruler of Gotham. ". And there was also at this assembly one named Jee-Eph- trane who had sought to have a road-way of iron and to be a Durrektah in the chief city of the land of Jonbool. And he bade the scribes to his house, and made feasts for them, hoping that they would persuade the people to pay money for his iron road-way, that he might live by it and become a Durrektah, and  a robber like the Durrektahs in the city of Gotham. 15. And some of the scribes went to his feast and drank his wine, but many would not go; neither would the people allow him to have his roadway of iron. Wherefore he was wroth with all the men of Jonbool, and chiefly with the lawgivers, and judges and officers thereof, and he prophesied against them by night and by day. 16 And at the assembly of the Phainyuns, Jee-Eph-trane took up his parable and said, Great is the land of Unculpsalm; and mighty and wise and good are the people of the land, and glorious is the banner of Unculpsalm; and chief among the people of Unculpsalm are the Pahdees, and chief among the Pahdees are the Phainyuns; but greatest, and mightiest, and and best and most glorious and wisest is Jee-Eph-trane. 17. Accursed be the rulers of the land of Jonbool who oppress the Pahdees in Ouldairin, and hinder them of their schyndees, and thrice accursed be the men, of Jonbool who would not- suffer Jee-Eph-trane to become a Durrektah and live by a roadway of iron in their chief city. For greatest, and mightiest, and wisest and best and most glorious is Jee-Eph-trane, who, because of the wickedness of the men of Jonbool, in that they would not suffer him to be a Durrektah, is the friend of the Pahdees and the apostle of the Ph ainyuns.  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8286-00000025"/> 48      THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. 18. And Jee-Eph-trane counselled the Phainyuns saying, Buy nothing that is made by the men of Jonbool, neither ye nor you)r wives nor your daughters; and when the merchants of the land of Jonbool see that the Pahdees will buy none of their merchan- dise neither in Ouldairin nor in Ashantee in the land of Uncul- psalm, 19. They shall set the land of Oaldairin free, and shall bow themselves down before the Pahdees, and say unto them,-Let our lords buy of their servants once more rainment for them- selves and for their wives and their daughters, and we shall be their bounden servants and bondsmen for ever. 20. But it came to pass that when the women of the Pahdees, even the Bihdees, heard of this counsel, they also, like the Iangkie women of Gotham who had assembled in the hall of Peter the barrel-maker the year before to pledge themselves in like manner, cried out, 21. Behold ye would make us look like unto Aphrite and like unto Adhowdee. Think ye that we are more foolish than the langkie women who brought to naught the devices of the Fuss women to make them look like unto Aphrite and like unto Adhowdee? Shall we see the Iangkie women dressed in glorious apparel from the land of Jonbool, while we go in common rain- meat mads in the land of Unculpsalm? No! not for all the island of Ouldairin. 22. So this counsel came to naught like that of the F'uss-wo- men because the Bihdees, like 'their mistresses the Iangkie wo. men, lived in fear by day and by night of the evil spirits, Aphrite andAdhowdee. 23. Thus was it and when the days drew nigh that the sect of the Dimmichrats should come to an end, that Phernandiwud and Jee-Eph-trane made unto themselves friends among the Phainyuns.                    .

The vision of Benjamin the scribe, the brother of Pher- nandiwud, which he saw sitting in his house nigh unto Pugh- tannung where he wrote the book called Deighnuze. 2. It was in the fourth month of the second year in which Andrew whose surname was Jon-sing was chief; ruler over the land, on a day about the sixth hour of the evening after I had eaten and poured out drink offerings unto Tammunee, that I saw a vision, falling into a trance, yet having mine eyes open. 3.; And I looked and behold I saw before me all the land of Unculpsalm, and all the people thereof from Ouay downeest even unto Mechsico, and from the ocean on the east even unto the ocean on the west. 4. And I saw that there was a mist and a smoke mingled together over the land, so that men walked about as it were in twilight seeing things darkly. And 'the mist lay thickliest from east to west along the middle of the land, so that the men of the north could not see the men of the south, and the men of the south could not see the men of the north. 5. And there were no more Phiretahs in the South; and in the North the voice of the Oueecneas was not heard in the land, and the Kopurhedd had hid himself in holes and corners; but he alone of the evil thing which the war engendered still lived, and his venom and his craft had not departed from him. 6. And I looked and saw certain men whose heads grew upon their shoulders with their faces looking backwards, so that when they walked they walked one way and looked another, and they stumbled and were uncertain in their going.  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8286-00000026"/> 50      . THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACSE 7. And it was shown to me in my vision that these were men of the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmrichrats which had not learnedand could not see that their sect had passed away. And they went about asking, Where are the Dinmmnichrats? Andwhat is now a Dinmichrat? And when they essayed to go forward they went backward; for their heads and their feet were at variance. 8. And I looked and saw one of these men sitting in sack- cloth and ashes; and I saw that it was Prince John the son of Littulvan, who had been chief ruler over the land of Unculpsalm. And as he sat in the ashes with his head looking backward between his shoulders, he laughed and spoke like one whose heart is glad with wine. And he took some of the ashes in his hand and said unto them that passed by, 9. Behold this gold dust from Kalaphorni, is it not richer than the gold of Ophir? And he held up his 'sackcloth to the passers by, saying, See the umptuousness of my raiment, and how I am clothed in silken apparel, even in silken apparel embroidered with gold. 10. Go now therefore unto Andrew whose surname is Jon- sing, and greet him from me, saying Hail chief ruler of the land of Unculpsalm that is- to be hereafter. Behold I, even I Prince John, clad in sumptuous raiment and sitting in the gold dust of Kalaphorni and looking forward, set thee up to be chosen chief ruler a second, time. And he laughed, -and the cheer of his countenance was like one who sitteth at a feast. ". And I looked again, and Isaw certain men who had -filled themselves with the east wind and who were puffed up exceedingly therewith, and had become so light that as they walked they kept not upon the ground among their fellows, but as they stepped rose into the air, even into the mist that brooded upon the land, ,  12.- And as they rose up from the;earth into the air they shouted, Niggahl niggahl niggahl Niggahl niggahl niggah I - :13, And I saw that the mist was made of the breath of these men as they rose up into the air and shouted.    THE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        51 ". And as I looked southward I saw certain other men who kept a smouldering fire in their bosoms; and they neither sought to put it out nor to fan it into a flame, but they cherished it, and breathed upon it, and as they breathed they muttered Niggah I niggahl niggah I Niggah I niggah Il niggah l 15. And I saw that the smoke over the land was that which came from the fire which these men cherished in their bosoms. 16. And I saw one man bowing himself down before the image of a Pahdee; and he said, Be thou my god, and I will worship thee, only make thou thy servant a ruler in the land. 17. And I saw another man bowing himself down before the image of a Niggah; and-he said, Be thou my god, and I will worship thee: only make thou thy servant a ruler in the land. 18. And the man who bowed himself down before the image of the Pahdee cursed the men of Jonbool; and the man who bowed himself down before the image of the Niggah cursed Andrew, the chief ruler, and reviled the Great Covenant. But there were some which bowed down before the image of the Niggah, not praying that they might be rulers in the land, but because he was the everlasting Niggah. 19. And I looked again, and I saw certain men seeking oil out of the rock; and I said to one of them, What meaneth this? And he said, I will show thee. 20. And there passed before mine eyes a lake that smoked and sent up fumes of fire and brimstone; and I considered and -saw that it was the lake which- covered the cities of the plain, even Sodom and Gomorrah, and that I was shown what had been in the beginning, because the lake yet smoked. 21. And upon the shore of the lake there walked a man searching diligently. And he who showed wpe this said unto the man, What seekest thou?  22. And the man answered and said Behold, the Lord hath just destroyed the cities of the plain with fire and brimstone and oil of the rock, and I was one of the nine just men in Sodom:to whom there was not found a tenth. And I only have escaped, and my house and my wife and my children are consumed.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8286-00000027"/> 52      THE NEW GOSPEL- OF PEACE. 23. And now-I seek here for oil of the rock that is left of the burning; for peradventure the Lord may have had a little over, that it may not be lost, but that I may take it and trade witIl it. 24. And the man who showed me this said, Behold he is the father of all them that trade in Gotham, and chiefly of them that have their merchandise in the oil of the rock. And the lake vanished away. 25. And as I looked, one of the multitude which sought oil out of the rock, fell upon his knees and prayed that he might strike ile; for in the Iangkie tongue this meaneth to find oil of the rock. 26. And there came to him a man in priest's garments and rebuked him, saying, Ye ought not to pray for oil, for to do thus is a wickedness and an abomination. But the man answered, and said, Go to, do ye not pray for rain? And if ye may pray for rain, which is but water, why may I not pray for ile? 27. And the man in priest's garments answered him nothing, but cried out upon Jhim anathema I 28. And in all this time, I heard voices coming out of the clouds over the land, crying, Niggah I niIggah I niggah I Niggah I niggah niggah I 29. And I looked again, and I saw a man walking slantin. dicularly, and holding his right hand behind him with the palm thereof upward. And I saw not the face of the man, but I said within myself, IIis walk is as the walk of Phernandiwud. 30. And I heard the voice of the man whose walk was slan- tindicular; and it was a smooth voice; and it said, Give me money out of the treasury of the people, and I will share it with thee. 31. And I saw men dropping money into the right hand of the man whose walk was slantindicular. And they were of the people called Ophisoldurs, and of the noble army of counter- actors      . 32. And I saw Robert of Jahji, who dwelt among the tombs, who was one of the lawgivers of Unculpsalm before the war, and to whom Phernandiwud had compromised himself, and 'I,   TEE NEW GOSPEL OF PEACE.        53 crawled on his belly when he demanded the arms which were kept by Kcn-Edee, chief captain of the watchmen of Gotham, from going to the Phiretahs of Jahrji. 33. And Robert, who dwelt amonng the tombs, approached the man whose walk was slantindicular, saying, Hail i my brother according to the order of the Dimmichratsl And the man whose walk was slantindicular passed by Robert without greet- ting, answering only, Vanity, vanity, all is vanity I Give me money out of the treasury of the people, and I will share it with thee.  34. And Robert turned away and met one of the people called Knuzebois, which dwell in Gotham, and which are small of stature but loud of voice, and which fear no man, neither have respect unto any man. And the Knuzebois are Pahdecs, and "the sons of Pahdees. 35. And Robert said unto the Knuzeboi, I trow not that ye of the North have gained much by your victory, seeing that ye treat us neitl er like conquerors nor like friends, and that the Niggah continue h to be the everlasting Niggah. When we who were Phiretahs are received again among the lawgivers of Unculpsalm, ye shall repent yourselves of all that ye have done these five years. 36. And the Knuzeboi answering. him, said, in an unknown tongue, Ewhud-am; for this is the speech and the manner of the Knuzebois. 37. And still the voices came out of the clouds above the land crying, Niggah I niggah I niggahl 1Niggah I niggah I nig- gah l 38. And I looked again, and I saw many beasts upon the land, even great multitudes, and chiefly round about the cities thereof. And I saw the beasts- afar off dimly, but I saw that the beasts were evil beasts and marvellous, and like unto no other beast that hath been neither shall be. And in my trance I strove to get nearer to the beasts, but I could not; for my striving was all within myself, and my feet took. no hold upon the ground,  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8286-00000028"/> 54      THE NEW GOSPEL OP PEACE. 39. Then there appeared a man before me with-a divining rod in his hand. And I said unto him, What are these beasts? And he said, I will show thee. 40. And he stretched-out his rod toward Gotham. And I saw one of the beasts that were around Gotham rise up into the air, and he came toward the man with the divining rod, and he passed before mine eyes. Flying he passed; yet not with wings; but sailing slowly like unto the flight of an eagle. For he was sustained by the power of the rod. ". And I beheld and saw that his body was as the body of a serpent behind, and before as the, body of a dragon, and the stench of his abominations filled'the air round about. 42. And the beast had three heads; and the head upon one side was as the head of a caterpillar, and it devoured as it went: and the head upon the other side was as the head of the unclean beast, even the head of a swine that walloweth in the xOires 43. And the head between these heads was as the head of a man; and it was lifted up on high. And the mouth thereof ipake wonderful things, and uttered boastings, and lies, and pro- phesied smooth things. And while the head thus spake, they who listened saw not the head of the caterpillar that devoured as it went, or the head of the swine that walloweth in the mire. ". Now the face of the head that was between the two heads and was raised on high was turned from me. An'd the man with the divinng rod said unto me, Wilt thou see the face of the beast? for his number is written in his forehead; and this is the beast, he and his kind that thou seest-in herds over the land, which afflicteth the land of Unculpsalm in this generation and shall aBifdt it hereafter. I IAnd I. answered him, Yea. 45. Then the beast as he was passing from my sight into the mist slowly a-nd as if with the flight of an eagle! that moveth not its wings, turned his face upon me: and I looked upon his forehead, and the number of the beast was four and eleven and forty-four.; andthe face of the beast was as mine own, even as mine own natural face when I behold it in a glass.   THE! NEiW. UMoi Ai VJx rj-&amp;&amp;v.       Ad ". And when I saw mine own face upon the head of the beast, and mine own eyes looked into mine eyes, the sweat of my forehead was cold and my flesh crept upon my bones. And I essayed to speak but I could not; for my tongue lay in my mouth like the tongue of one who is dead. 47. And as I strove, I heard the voices in the mist, crying, Niggah I niggah I niggah I and those in the smoke answering unto them, Niggah I niggaht niggah I 48. Then the vision passed away, and I came out of my trance. And when I considered the matter, I rejoiced in my heart, although the new gospel of;-peace had not prevailed, for I saw that the last state of that land was like unto the first.
