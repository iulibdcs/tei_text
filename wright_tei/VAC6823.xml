                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>SUNSET! can aught of all the lovely scenes of ever-varying nature, or of the brilliant splendors which art and ingenuity have so often presented to our eyes, equal, much less excel, the glorious beauty of that matchless scene! Cloud upon cloud, each tinged with a different hue, from the softest azure to the rich brilliant crimson, piled in ever-varying shapes above each other, and veiling by their curtain-like folds, the egress from our sight of that to which the earth owes its loveliness-the King of Day! Of a deeper and richer blue seems the heavens beyond-the veiling clouds are tinged with a still richer crimson-slowly and majestically sinks the sovereign of nature behind the far distant hills, and upon the azure bosom of the eastern sky rises to our view that harbinger of hope and love, the evening star!</p> 
                  <p>It was such a scene as this, replete with all the loveliness that nature could give, upon which was gazing a rough, but noble-looking Kentucky woodman, on the 16th of May, 1777. Though clad almost entirely in shaggy bear-skin, beneath the rough covering beat one of the most brave and generous of hearts; and though his brow was darkly browned by exposure, still in its broad and swelling outlines was discernible an intellect of which many a city fashionable, who would have looked upon the woodman as a vile object, not worth noticing, might have felt justly proud. From beneath heavy black eye-brows, whose shaggy thickness gave a fierce sternness to the expression of his face, gleamed a pair of full, keen, brilliant, searching grey eyes, but in whose stern glance now shone a gleam of softness, as they rested upon the lovely scene before him. A pair of firm, decided lips, not <emph>graced</emph> by either mustachios or <emph>imperial</emph>, told by their very contour, a volume of courage, firmness, and self-possessed bravery in the hour of danger; and those that knew the Kentucky back-woodsman, would tell you that those expressive lips were a true index of his character. Around his brow and cheeks, and extending to the very collar of his bear-skin coat, fell a tangled and matted mass of raven black hair-intermingled by a few threads of shining silver, speaking in their own silent language,<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6823-00000003"/> of care and trial that their wearer once had known. These silvery lines, together with the deepening wrinkles in the fine forehead of the woodman, indicated that he had not seen less than forty years, and perchance even more.</p> 
                  <p>A large, sturdy muscular form was that of the Kentucky woodman, with stout arms, that seemed as if one blow from them would knock the breath of life from any man's body; and a broad, full chest, whose perfect developments told of almost superhuman strength. But now, those brawny arms, that had so often dealt the deadly blow to the wild inhabitants of their almost interminable forest, lay listlessly by the woodman's side; and that broad chest rose and fell in regular undulations as the breath came from between the half-parted lips. Indeed, the stern woodman seemed no longer himself; for a soft, quiet, meditative calm had settled down upon his stern features, telling that there was <emph>heart</emph> as well as <emph>mind</emph> in the bosom of the rough-visaged hunter. Yes, even he, the Kentucky back-woodsman, who had grappled from his earliest youth, with the cold, hard realities of life, and had seen danger, peril and even death before his eyes, until they were all familiar as household words, could look upon the sunset scene with an eye of admiration of its beauty-and forgetting all life's stern realities, could find in his heart a chord that thrilled in unison with its loveliness!</p> 
                  <p>In the door of the rude cottage, that stood but a few steps from the tree against which the woodman was leaning stood his wife-as fine a specimen of a woodman's wife as could have been found. Tall, stout, broad-chested and strong-sinewed, with a jet-black eye from which flashed all the fire of a fearless spirit-an observer would have known, at first glance, that she was more than an ordinary woman. Her thick black hair was bound up at <choice>
                        <sic>the the</sic>
                        <corr>the</corr>
                     </choice> back in a firm knot-thus disclosing a finely formed head. She was dressed in the coarsest and plainest style; but still neatly, and with some taste. Indeed, Mrs. Martin, the excellent wife of John Martin, the backwoods hunter whom we have described, was a woman whom we should know, at first glance, would be valuable as a friend, but dangerous as a foe.</p> 
                  <p>"John," said the wife, hesitatingly, not quite feeling as though she ought to break upon her husband's pleasant reverie so unceremoniously, "John, the cakes and venison are smoking on the table, and the children are waiting for their supper,"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Polly, you may tell them I'll be in in a moment-they needn't wait for me," replied the woodman, as he slowly turned, and approached his wife, who still stood in the door of the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>"You don't seem as lively to-night as usual, John," said Mrs. Martin, with a slight shade of anxiety in her tone: "what's the matter?"</p> 
                  <p>"I was thinking, Polly," said the woodmam, half mournfully, as his lip trembled with some strong emotion within, "I was thinking of the time, twenty years ago, this very day, when we buried our first little one. The sunset clouds look at this moment just as they did then-and the last rays are falling now upon his little grave yonder. I can't help thinking of it, Polly, though it was so long ago-and I can't help feeling mournful, when I look at this beautiful sunset scene, and then at that little grave." The flash of the woman's dark eye was dimmed by tears at this allusion, and a film seemed to gather over those of her rough and stern, but kind-hearted husband. For a moment they stood there silent, each absorbed in thoughts of bygone days. But suddenly the bowed head of Mrs. Martin was raised as if in eager surprise-and the flash of her black eyes dried the tears that had filled them.</p> 
                  <p>"Husband!" she exclaimed, in a hurried whisper, "I hear the sound of horse's hoofs on the ledge! It is approaching very rapidly! Can you not hear them? Hark!"</p> 
                  <p>The woodman raised his head, and all traces of his agitation vanished instantly from his stern countenance. He listened eagerly. The sound of horse's hoofs, striking with a dull echo upon the rough stones of the ledge, over which the road passed, and nearing them every instant, could be distinctly heard by the woodman and his wife. They exchanged glances of significant meaning-for such an event was quite uncommon in that wild, rocky, half-cleared region, and it might be the precursor of danger to them. Mrs. Martin quietly entered the house, and took down from the beckets on which it rested when not in use, a Kentucky rifle-and again approached the door, and stood by her husband.</p> 
                  <p>The strange sound came nearer and nearer every instant; the horseman was evidently approaching at a rapid rate. The eyes of both the woodman and his wife were bent with an excited gaze upon the brow of the hill, upon which those who had been crossing the ledge, must soon be visible. First came a man dressed in the uniform of the Continental army and mounted upon a splendid jet black charger, whose mouth and sides were literally covered with foam. Not ten yards behind, in hot and eager pursuit, followed another,-dressed in the gay style of the sworn foes of America, and whose snow-white beast seemed as eager as his rider to overtake the pursued, whose chance for life now hung upon a most precarious thread. The bayonet of the tory was already poised to strike death to his victim-and it seemed that the terrible blow could scarcely be prevented, for though the noble animal of the American was dashing on with all his power, the tory gained rapidly;-and the blood-shot and glaring eyes of the noble beast told that such speed must end in a few moments with his life.</p> 
                  <p>On-on-swifter than the wings of the wind they came-the pursuer and the pursued. As a last resource, the American was dashing on in the direction of the cabin, with a faint hope that succor might there be obtained. The woodman and his wife gazed upon the scene in the strongest excitement,-for at the first glance, they had comprehended all.</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>That man shall not die!</emph>" said Martin, in a determined voice, while his stern lips compressed, and his grey eyes flashed with a lightning fire. "No man ever yet could say that John Martin ever saw one of his own countryman in trouble, and did'nt lend a hand to help him out. I'll save that man or die! Hand me my rifle, Polly-it's loaded with a double charge. It never failed me yet-and it will not now."</p> 
                  <p>"Give it to him in the heart, John-I would'nt have you miss him on any condition! If you miss him I'll shoot you!" exclaimed the excited wife.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't fear for me, Polly-I never missed a mark yet, and I shall not now-now, that it is a Briton's heart!" replied the woodman proudly.</p> 
                  <p>On-still on, they came-the foam flying in white clouds from the nostrils of the foremost animal, and almost covering the rider, while the pursuer gained<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6823-00000004"/> every instant. They were now within a few rods of the cabin-and the foremost rider, stretching out his arms imploringly towards the woodman, he almost shrieked-</p> 
                  <p>"Save me! Save me! I am unarmed, and my horse is nearly dead with fatigue! Save me! if you love your God and your country!"</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>I will save you!</emph>" sternly spoke the woodman, from between his clenched teeth. The unerring rifle was raised to his eye-he glanced along the barrel-and just as the tory was about to drive his bayonet through the form of the American, the quick, sharp report of the rifle rang upon the hushed air, and the Briton fell from his saddle-a corpse!</p> 
                  <p>"Thank God, and you, my deliverer!" fervently exclaimed the American, as he sprang from the saddle, and grasped the hand of the excited woodman.</p> 
                  <p>A moment the noble black charger stood motionless, and then reeling, he fell heavily to the ground, by his master's side-he was dead! There they lay-the human and the brute,-both lying in the icy embrace of death. And who shall say that the brute had not more nobly performed his duty than the other, though created in the image of God!</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>"MY noble rescuer!" exclaimed the American as he sprang forward and eagerly grasped the hand of the brave woodman; "words cannot express my gratitude to you, for your timely aid. A moment more and I should have been beyond the reach of human power-but by this noble act, I find myself once more safe and free. God bless you, my deliverer!" and the rescued man grasped the hard hand of the generous hunter, and pressed it to his heart.</p> 
                  <p>"Thanks are needless, my friend," said the woodman, touched by this manifestation of gratitude; "I have done only my duty. I have done only what I would do for any man, were he placed in a like situation, and I require no thanks for a deed of duty-the approval of my own conscience is all the praise I ask."</p> 
                  <p>"Generous and noble man!" exclaimed the soldier, enthusiastically, as he gazed with no little admiration, upon the dark and stern, but nobly intellectual features of the woodman. "I honor and respect you still more for the noble sentiments you have advanced. But such a deed must not be passed by without some more substantial repayment. Here," continued the American, drawing from his bosom a silken purse filled with gold coins and extending it to Martin; "take this, my friend, as a slight testimony of my gratitude. If is but a slight repayment, I know-but it is all I have to offer."</p> 
                  <p>A strange light flashed from the expressive eyes of John Martin. His proud lip curled half scornfully, as he drew back, and fixed his stern eyes upon the handsome countenance of the stranger.</p> 
                  <p>"Would you insult me, sir!" asked the high-souled woodman, proudly, as he drew up his tall form to its stateliest height. "Would you insult me-<emph>me</emph>, who have just rescued you from an untimely death, by offering me <emph>gold</emph> for the service? Did'st think I was base enough to accept it? <emph>No!</emph> as I am a man and a Christian, I'd starve before I'd take money for saving the life of a fellow-man! Put up thy gold! and insult me not again by offering to repay a deed of duty with that."</p> 
                  <p>"Pardon me, my friend," said the soldier, as he replaced the purse in his bosom, "pardon me, if I have <choice>
                        <sic>unconciously</sic>
                        <corr>unconsciously</corr>
                     </choice> touched your nice sense of honor. I feared you would not think it well in me not to offer a reward that might be of use to you-something more substantial than mere thanks. But you have declined it-and in such a manner that I cannot urge it. And, as you have forbidden me expressing my heart felt thanks for the priceless service you have done me, I can only say, that if ever you are in peril or danger, or stand in need of a friend-Walton Leslie will not fail to prove his gratitude."</p> 
                  <p>"The only repayment that I ask, my friend," said the woodman, with a kind smile, is that if ever you should meet a fellow-man in danger, that you will lend a helping hand, and aid him to the extent of your ability. By so doing you will best prove your gratitude to me, as well as to your God, for your fortunate escape from death."</p> 
                  <p>"I will, my noble friend!" exclaimed the soldier, warmly.</p> 
                  <p>A moment more, and the rescued man was kneeling beside the dead animal which had borne him so faithfully to safety, though at the expense of his own life. The jet black sides were still flecked with foam, and the large, glassy eyes were wild and staring in their deathly fixedness.</p> 
                  <p>"She was a noble animal," said the soldier, mournfully," speaking more to himself than to his companions, "and has been more than faithful, even unto death. My charger! I can but give a tear of regret to thy memory. Farewell! May my last end be like thine-may I breathe my last in serving God and my country!"</p> 
                  <p>"See, my friend, this riderless animal will now do for you," said the woodman, as he laid his hand lightly upon the arched neck of the tory's charger, which had been standing still, since its master had fallen a corpse from the saddle to the ground.</p> 
                  <p>"Sure enough it will," replied the soldier, rising from his kneeling position, and smoothing down the reeking sides of the noble animal. "She will do very well to take the place of my lost Fanny there. But then don't you want her as your share of the spoils?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nonsense!" laughingly replied Martin. "Take the animal yourself, and treat her well, for you must remember that the accident by which you became her master, came very near costing you your own life."</p> 
                  <p>"I never can forget it," replied the soldier. But," he continued, "I must mount her now and leave you for our camp. My men doubtless expected me before this time. I left them this afternoon, on a scouting expedition, and was most unceremoniously interrupted in the midst of a profound reverie, by the appearance of the British officer whose exit from this world of trouble and sorrow you so opportunely hastened.-We've had a hard chase of it, and I have gone many miles from my camp. My men will be expecting me, and will be very anxious for my safety: for they know that their captain never lingers beyond his usual time, without some reason of great importance. So I must leave you, my noble rescuer; but God knows I can never forget you."</p> 
                  <p>"But, Captain Leslie," said the woodman's wife, who had not before spoken, "you must not go until you have taken some supper. You have far to go, and will feel the need of it. If you will accept of our homely fare, you are more than welcome."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, Captain Leslie," spoke up Martin, witnessing the evident hesitation of<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6823-00000005"/> the soldier, "it will be for your benefit to take some refreshment before you start on your long ride. And this horse, too,-he needs rest, and would carry you twice as fast if he only could have some supper before he started. So it will be for your benefit every way to stop with us an hour or two-and you will reach your camp as soon, perchance sooner, than if you should go now."</p> 
                  <p>For a moment the hesitating soldier glanced at the reeking sides and foaming mouth of the noble animal before him, and his decision was made.</p> 
                  <p>"My friends," he said turning with a pleasant smile to the woodman and his wife, "your request shall be granted. This horse could not endure another two hours journey without being refreshed by rest-before attempting it, and myself, too-it would'nt harm me any to rest a few moments from my strong excitement. I will accept of your hospitality for both myself and this weary animal."</p> 
                  <p>"We have but homely cheer for a stranger, Captain Leslie," said the woodman, as they entered the rude log cabin, "but no man could ever say that John Martin would not share his last morsel with the way-worn traveller."</p> 
                  <p>"This is a noble rifle, Mr. Martin," said the soldier, as he took up the weapon that had been leaning against the cabin door, and examined it closely. "And, by my faith," he continued, with a sudden exclamation, as his eye fell upon a few singularly curved lines upon the barrel, resembling the hieroglyphics of the North American tribes, "it is an Indian weapon! Here is their mark, that we find upon no rifles but those which have once been in possession of the red men. You purchased it of them, did you not, Mr. Martin?"</p> 
                  <p>A shadow of mournful sadness passed over the countenance of the woodman. The soldier perceived it, and hastily continued-</p> 
                  <p>"Pardon me, my friend, if I have asked a too impertinent question, and touched a chord in your heart that thrills with other than pleasing emotions. Forgive me, my friend, my error was one of ignorance. I knew not that an allusion to the rifle could touch you so. Doubtless there are unhappy memories connected with it-but I did not mean to recall them."</p> 
                  <p>"I know you did not, and therefore you are freely pardoned," replied the woodman, wiping a tear from his eye with the rough sleeve of his coat; "but, as you say, there are unhappy memories, which the very sight of that rifle often calls vividly up. But come-I see supper is waiting, I'll tell you the story, captain-how I came by that rifle-it's a singular one, and a mournful one too-at least, to us."</p> 
                  <p>In spite of his eagerness to hear the story, the hungry soldier soon found himself doing ample justice to the excellent, but plain and homely repast set before him, while the woodman's <choice>
                        <sic>daugher</sic>
                        <corr>daughter</corr>
                     </choice>, a dark-eyed girl of seventeen, stepped briskly round as "waiter," occasion ally whispering to her mother, who was taking the corn-cakes from the ashes that "she should'nt think Captain Leslie had eaten anything for a month, by the way the victuals vanished!"</p> 
                  <p>"It's twenty-five years ago come next month-I'm forty-five now-that I first came here," commenced the woodman, as the dark eyes of the soldier told how eager he was for the story. "I had'nt been married but about a month, and I and my wife-Polly, here-thought we would settle right down in the wilderness, build us a log cabin, and clear a place all for ourselves, so we picked out this spot, and I cut off the trees round a spot large enough for a house and built this cabin. I was only twenty years old then: and my wife was'nt but nineteen. About a year after we had a son,-a beautiful little boy, but he was too lovely a creature for earth, for just twenty-three years ago to-day, we buried his lifeless body yonder,-you can see the little grave from here. There-the last ray of the sun is falling on the gray stone at his head-you see it, don't you, Captain!"</p> 
                  <p>"Very plainly," said the soldier, gazing at the grass covered mound.</p> 
                  <p>"Well," continued the woodman, moving his lingering eyes from the little grave to the handsome face of the stranger, a few months after we laid our first-born in his narrow resting-place. God sent us another little one, and in watching the unfoldings of his childish reason, we almost forgot our grief for our lost one. Harry, our second born, was the very counterpart of his angel brother-and all the love we had so lavishly bestowed on the one, now no more, was transferred to the innocent being whose future happiness and welfare now occupied all our thoughts. He lived and thrived, every day unfolding new proof that the childish intellect of our boy would some day be a mighty power. O, how we loved that boy! Our earliest born could not have claimed a larger share of our parental affection.</p> 
                  <p>"It was the third birth-day of my boy-and if ever father was proud of his little one, it was myself. It was a glorious afternoon-and as I was going to leave the house to go a short distance from our clearing to the next settlement, Harry came up to me and looking pleadingly in my face, said, 'Father, may'nt I go with you! I want to, and I'll be a good boy if you'll let me.' I could'nt do any other way than to consent. So we started off-I with my gun, which I invariably carried with me, in one hand, and holding the little fingers of my boy with the other. Harry, who seemed to feel wonderfully talkative, was asking an endless variety of questions, which I did my best to answer to his satisfaction.</p> 
                  <p>"Between our house and the next settlement was a narrow piece of very thick woods, with an almost interminable underbrush. Through this there was a sort of path, or cart road, but the brush on either side of it no one ever attempted to make a way through. But it's all cut away now-brush, trees, and all, and the old cart road has given place to the high-way. Well we were walking along, Harry and I chatting of everything we saw from the tall forest-oaks to the little lively red squirrels running up their smooth trunks, when all at once I heard a sudden rustling among the underbrush on either side of the road, and at least a dozen Indians, dressed and painted in the most wild and war-like style, sprang from the thick bushes, and stood directly before me. Harry screamed in terror at their wild appearance, for each bore in his hand the terrible tomahawk, and one of them, who seemed the leader of the band, bore a rifle gracefully on his shoulder. Startled and confounded as I was, I did not wholly lose my presence of mind-and true to the first impulse of a hunter, I did as any of our native born woodmen would do in such a case-I raised my gun steadily to my shoulder. The stern lip of the leading Indian who bore the rifle, curled with an expression of scornful derision-and looking me full in the face, he said calmly-</p> 
                  <p>"'Does the pale-face think that he<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6823-00000006"/> can escape our vengeance, and dare raise his weak arm against the children of the forest? The red man has sworn to take the life of the pale-face, and he never breaks his word.'</p> 
                  <p>"I must confess to the weakness of shuddering at this stern speech, so full of meaning, and feeling a most chilling thrill through every portion of my system. The hand that grasped my gun trembled slightly, as the Indian continued-</p> 
                  <p>"'Three moons ago, the pale-faced warrior, who was then hunting in the forest, met two of our tribe, and shot them both without mercy. The great spirit saw the deed and was angry. He desires that the warriors of the tribe avenge the death of the red men. The warriors have lain in ambush for him to-day, and they have met him. Pale-face, prepare to die; for the red men are ready to perform their work.'</p> 
                  <p>"A thrill of horror crept through my frame, for I knew by the stern words of the chief, and the still sterner faces that gathered around me, that their was no hope for me; for to have told them that I killed the two Indians in self-defence, and to save my own life, would not lessen my crime in their eyes; and I knew all expostulation would be useless; so I gave up all hope of escaping, though I determined to sell my life dearly. I watched my opportunity, and raising my gun, I aimed it at the chief and fired. But it seemed that he had anticipated my movement, for at the instant I fired, he sprang aside, and the ball passed him harmlessly. But quick as thought his rifle was pointed towards me; I saw a brilliant flash, and then all was a blank.</p> 
                  <p>"When I again awoke to consciousness, I was lying upon my back on the very spot where I fell. The stars were looking brightly down upon me, from the clear, cold blue above, and the moon was sailing calmly and unsympathisingly among them. My first thought was of my boy. I looked around me. All was still and silent as the grave. I attempted to call his name, but I was too weak to call loud enough for him to hear, even had he been near me. The blood was still flowing from a terrible wound in my side, and by me was a clotted mass of the once warm life current that had flowed from the rifle wound. Upon the ground near me lay the rifle which I recognised as the one which I had seen in the hands of the Indian chief, while my own gun, which I had discharged at him, was nowhere to be seen. Eagerly I attempted to penetrate the thick darkness with my straining eyes, to see if I might not discover some traces of my child; but I could see nothing; and in my eagerness and painful anxiety, I attempted to raise my head upon my arm, that I might have a further survey; but the effort was too much; the blood gushed with renewed force from the terrible wound, and again I relapsed into a state of insensibility.</p> 
                  <p>"For days and weeks afterward I was in a delirious fever, and hanging between death and life, clinging to existence by the slenderest tenure. During this time every possible means to find my child were used, but all to no purpose. He had in all probability been stolen by the Indians who had wounded me, and left me, as they supposed, a corpse. The Indian's rifle was brought home, but my gun could not be found. Weeks passed on, and slowly I recovered, but it seemed as if the light of peace could never again enter the bosoms of myself or my wife. But nearly twenty years have passed away since the incident occurred, other children have been given us, and in them we have found consolation for our lacerated hearts; but the void in our bosoms caused by the loss of that beautiful boy can never be filled.</p> 
                  <p>"This, Captain Leslie, is the history of that rifle. I would not part with it for its weight in gold; both for its intrinsic value, for it has been my constant companion ever since that fatal day, and has never yet failed me; and also for the associations connected with it. I cannot look upon it without thinking of my lost boy!"</p> 
                  <p>"And your child-have you never ascertained what became of him?" asked the young soldier, his handsome face expressing the intensest interest.</p> 
                  <p>"Never a word of his fate have we ever heard, nor do we know whether he is dead or alive. But it is not probable that he is yet living,-for, before this time he has doubtless been sent by his merciless captors to that spirit land from which no loved one ever returns."</p> 
                  <p>"A singular and deeply interesting story, truly," musingly said the young soldier. "I wonder not that you prise that rifle highly. Were I in your place, nothing could ever induce me to part with it."</p> 
                  <p>An hour more of pleasant conversation passed between the young soldier, the woodman and his family, when Captain Leslie declared that he must certainly return to his camp, though deeply regretting to leave such pleasant company.</p> 
                  <p>"As I see you are unarmed, captain, I will present you with a weapon of defence as a token of my respect and friendship," said the woodman, as he handed the young man a beautiful rifle-much smaller than the Indian one, but shaped in the same style. "It is loaded, and may be of use to you before you reach your camp."</p> 
                  <p>"Thanks-a thousand thanks for your kindnesses, my friend," said the young soldier, as he took the weapon. and sprang lightly upon the noble animal which was now brought to his side. "And, Mr. Martin," he continued in a lower tone, "why can you not join our army of true hearts that are fighting for their country? Your sons are old enough to take care of things at home, while such men as you are needed in the army. Can you not enlist under the banner of Washington, and assist us in striking a blow for freedom?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have often thought of it, Captain Leslie," replied the woodman, "and think I shall join you soon. I love my country too well to remain inactive. In the army I may meet you again-at least, I hope I may. The Indian's rifle shall yet deal death and destruction to our British foes."</p> 
                  <p>"God bless you for those noble words!" said the youthful soldier warmly. "And now, till we meet again adieu."</p> 
                  <p>"Adieu!" returned the woodman, as with a parting wave of his hand to the wife and daughter, the young soldier snatched the reins of his impatient steed and galloped rapidly away.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <p>THE rich glow of sunset had faded into the calm, deep azure of evening and one by one the silver stars came out, studding the rich deep blue with so many thousand gems. The full moon sailed cloudlessly among them, as if conscious of her queenly majesty, and half scorning the lesser lights that burned in their silvery brilliancy around her. A soft golden glow pervaded bush,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6823-00000007"/> tree, and flower-and their dark shadows, lying like giants on the ground, were perfectly outlined in the silvery light. The waves of the river, that rolled calmly on by the woodman's dwelling, seemed one blaze of glowing gems; and each wave, as it rose and fell, seemed like a maiden's bosom, heaving with life and joy beneath the outer adorning of pearls and costly gems</p> 
                  <p>"Beautiful! beautiful! This is the loveliest scene I have witnessed for many a day!" murmured Captain Leslie, as he checked his wearied charger upon the brow of a craggy bluff, and gazed down upon the lovely moonlight scene below. The animal, as if glad of a respite from his toil, walked onward slowly for a few moments, and then, perceiving that his rider appeared in no haste to get along, he stopped entirely. Leslie was too much engaged with his own thoughts to note that his onward progress was no longer continued; and leaning forward, and bowing his broad brow upon the arching neck of the noble animal, he gave himself to the reveries that were filling his mind.</p> 
                  <p>"How strange is the history of that woodman's rifle!" mused the young man, half audibly; "and where, I would give my fortune to know, can that child be which then so strangely disappeared! If he is living, he must have grown o man's stature, and if he is yet with the Indians, has doubtless adopted their habits and customs, and knows not that he is of any other race. His father and his kindred he would no longer know-but would hate them as the Indian ever hates the pale-face. But it is most probable that he is sleeping in his grave-that years have passed since his innocent spirit left this world of care and sorrow. I wonder not that the woodman values that rifle highly, from the sad associations-"</p> 
                  <p>His musings were suddenly interrupted by the rustling of leaves and crackling of branches near him, and looking up, he saw standing not ten feet from him, an Indian of the tribe which had once owned the woodman's rifle. He was leaning with his back to a gigantic oak tree, with his arms folded across his bosom, and a rifle standing against the tree by his side. Still and silent as a statue of marble he stood; with his wild, piercing eyes fixed upon a large thickly-leaved branch above him. An expression of firm, defiant courage rested upon his dark features, while his thin lips were compressed as with a stern will.</p> 
                  <p>For several moments the young soldier sat in his saddle, gazing at the motionless form before him, and wondering whether it was a being of flesh and blood, or a marble statue, devised by some cunning imitator of nature's perfection. The eyes still retained their fixed glare upon the branch above; but Leslie could see nothing there to attract his attention. But a sudden crackling of twigs and branches caused him to turn his eyes from the Indian's face to the limb of the tree above, and now he could plainly see the cause of the red man's fixed and motionless gaze. There, with his red eye-balls glaring with fury, like two coals of fire, his mouth half open, disclosing two rows of dazzlingly white teeth, and his feet crouched for the fatal spring was a full-grown, ferocious <emph>panther!</emph>
                  </p> 
                  <p>It is well known that there is only one inhabitant of the forest that the Indian fears-and that one is the panther. From this truly fearful animal even the red men of the forest shrink with fear and terror. And such is the nature of the Indian, that not even the bravest of them ever dares to raise his rifle to attempt to save his life from a panther's grasp; but when they come in contact with one, they give up their life as lost-for an Indian would scorn to save his life by flight either from man or beast. The panther is considered by them as an evil spirit; and when one of an Indian tribe is killed by a panther, it is supposed by his tribe that he had committed some crime that had offended the Great Spirit and the panther had been sent to punish him for his crime.</p> 
                  <p>To the young captain, who was well acquainted with the peculiar traits of Indian character, the singular conduct of the man before him was perfectly plain. Though he saw that the red man had the power to extricate himself from his perilous situation,-for an Indian's rifle is always loaded,-he knew that the superstitious awe of the animal would prevent his moving a muscle in his own defence. By the expression of firm resolve upon the Indian's countenance, Leslie could plainly see that he had prepared himself to die,-to die without a shudder, as an Indian and a brave man should.</p> 
                  <p>"By my faith, but I'll save that man, if he wont save himself!" mused Leslie, as he raised the rifle which the woodman had given him when he departed,-to his shoulder, and sighted it upon the panther. Neither the Indian or his foe had seen the youthful soldier approach; therefore deliverance was unthought of by the man who stood there in such a perilous situation. The panther crouched for the final spring,-his fore feet were already raised for the final leap, when the sharp flash of a rifle almost blinded the eyes of the Indian for an instant, and the next, with a terrible howl of rage and pain, the panther fell bleeding and writhing in the agonies of death, at his very feet! An instant, his burning eyes were turned with a terrible glare upon the young soldier-and then became fixed in the glassy glare of death!</p> 
                  <p>For a few moments the rescued Indian gazed upon the handsome countenance of his deliverer, and then stepping forward, he said in a tone that thrilled to the very heart of the young man-</p> 
                  <p>"The pale face has saved the red man's life. The red man never forgets a kindness-and if the pale face ever wants a friend, let him seek out the Eagle Eye. Farewell."</p> 
                  <p>And with a majestic wave of his hand the Indian turned and departed. The young man gazed after him until his stately form vanished amid the dark green foliage. Then snatching the reins of his horse, he rode rapidly on.</p> 
                  <p>"This has been an eventful day to me," he mused, as he rode over the rocky ground; "I wonder what strange incident will happen next?"</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <p>TWO months have passed away since the events recorded in the preceding chapters; bringing us to a warm, sultry afternoon in the month of July, 1777. The sun was beating down upon the parched earth with a scorching heat, while not the slightest breeze stirred the motionless leaves of the trees, or rippled the azure bosom of the waters. The beasts of the field were reposing in the grateful shade, while the air sought refuge from the scorching sun amid the leaves and thick foliage of the trees. It was an insupportably sultry day-and yet, on this day, the British and American armies<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6823-00000008"/> were drawn up on the plains of Monmouth, for battle!</p> 
                  <p>Gay with flags and streamers, and dressed in their brilliant uniforms, and presenting, on the whole, a splendid appearance, the well-formed lines of the British soldiery moved majestically on to the conflict of life and death. But with less haughty pride, though with more of noble dignity, the Americans marched steadily on to meet their cruel foe. A single banner, with its azure ground studded with stars, mingling their folds with the gay white and red, was borne at the head of the army-and that simple yet beautiful emblem of liberty, was more fraught with high meaning than the splendid flags and dashing style of the proud Britons. Calm and stern, and every eye flashing with the fire of a stern determination, the Americans moved proudly on to the battle-ground; yet even in those eyes of fire, there was often an anxious glance to the sky above, as if hoping to detect a cloud that might suggest a hope that the burning rays of the sun might ere long be shrouded beneath a veil of refreshing clouds.</p> 
                  <p>At the head of his army, and mounted upon a noble milk-white charger, rode Washington himself-occasionally glancing with an <choice>
                        <sic>axious</sic>
                        <corr>anxious</corr>
                     </choice> eye, at the approaching lines of the enemy, as if to tell their numbers at a single look. It was plain to be seen that they far exceeded those of the army of high-souled patriots. But this discovery did not dishearten them-it only nerved their spirits to a sterner resolve-to a firmer courage, and a resolution to die, if need be, on the field of battle-to give their last drop of life-blood for liberty and their country.</p> 
                  <p>Mounted upon a magnificent pit-black charger, whose feet seemed to spurn the ground upon which they trod, was Lord Howe, the commander of the British forces. A half scornful smile curled the lips of the haughty general, as he cast his eyes upon the band of patriots, marching so sternly onward, to the unequal conflict-and in his heart, he almost felt ashamed to stoop so low as to lead on the British chivalry to give battle to such a despicable enemy. The thought that, before the sun should set, the despised foe would be most brilliantly victorious over the flower of the British army, never once entered his mind.</p> 
                  <p>"Soldiers!" said Howe, turning in his saddle and speaking to those behind him, "it wouldn't be of any use to tell you to fight bravely in the approaching conflict, for I guess you would have to fight all alone. Those rebels, though they look so spunky now, will lose all the little courage they have got, when they get in full sight of our army, and see what a grand one we have, in comparison to their meagre, ill-looking ranks. Really, I shouldn't wonder if they should turn and run before trying to give us battle! It would be the best way for them, by St. George!"</p> 
                  <p>A shout of laughter greeted this peculiarly funny speech, and several witty replies were made by the officers who had heard it, which were invariably greeted with a roar of merriment.</p> 
                  <p>How different was the address of WASHINGTON to his men, and how differently was it received!</p> 
                  <p>"My fellow-countrymen," said the Father of his country, in a calm, dignified tone, as he bent his eagle eye upon the devoted band before him, "you do not forget your duties to yourselves, to your God, and to your country. I will trust you, for I am satisfied that my confidence will not be misplaced. Remember member, 'tis for your homes, your wives, your children, and for all that is dear to you, that you are fighting! Remember <emph>this</emph>, and I need say no more."</p> 
                  <p>There was a flashing of dark, stern eyes-a compressing of firm lips, and a shout, loud, swelling and heart-thrilling, and rising with the strong intensity of a firm resolve, rose from three thousand noble hearts-"God and our country-and WASHINGTON?"</p> 
                  <p>An hour later, and the two armies were face to face-rushing madly on to mortal combat. With the reckless eagerness of those who feel confident that the victory must be theirs, and are only panting to see the expected flight of their puny foes, the British rushed forward to the conflict. But with the calm firmness and unerring determination of men who know their duty, and are resolved to do it-men who would stand for right and justice, even to the cannon's mouth, the Americans boldly advanced to the strife of life or death. They hardly dared to hope for the victory over such greater numbers; but still they did not despair of it.</p> 
                  <p>Three hours passed on-hours that seemed to those contending armies to be lengthened into days. Every moment was improved; and history does not record a bloodier conflict than that of Monmouth. About an equal number had fallen on both sides: but now the Americans were slowly, very slowly losing ground, and giving way before the power of overwhelming numbers. But still the little band bore bravely on, determined to sell the lives which were of so much worth to their country at a dear price.</p> 
                  <p>"Colonel Martin," said Captain Leslie, addressing our old friend the woodman (who had some time before joined the army, and whose bravery had already won for him the rank of Colonel.) "Colonel, if we could only charge upon that victorious left flank of the enemy, with our two divisions, and thus draw off their attention, I think we might be once more gaining ground. Colonel, will you charge?"</p> 
                  <p>The glance of the woodman's dark eye was answer enough for the young captain. The two columns now poured a destructive fire upon the left flank of the enemy, and the result was the same as had been anticipated. Their attention was drawn off from the main body and again the Americans rushed on with renewed hope and strength, and this time to victory. For several moments Captain Leslie had been actively engage in a hand to hand conflict with a British soldier, and now, as he struck his victim to the earth, he looked up for the first time since their onslaught, and ran his eye over the combatants standing near him, endeavoring to distinguish Colonel Martin. But a few yards from him was the Colonel, engaged in mortal combat with a Briton; while just behind the woodman, with his gun raised, and aimed at the American's head, was the Indian whom Leslie had once rescued from the grasp of the panther. Quick as thought the young man sprang forward, and throwing up the barrel of the gun, the charge passed harmlessly over the Colonel's head. The Indian turned with a lightning eye.</p> 
                  <p>"Eagle Eye," said the young <choice>
                        <sic>man man</sic>
                        <corr>man</corr>
                     </choice> hurriedly, "do you not know me? Once I saved your life, and I ask in return for the favor, that you will spare my friend, the man whom your rifle ball would but now have pierced had I not prevented it. Eagle eye, will you spare his life? He is my friend."</p> 
                  <p>"The pale-face once saved the red<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6823-00000009"/> man s life," replied the Indian. "Eagle Eye has not forgot. The white warrior's life shall be spared."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment, Colonel Martin, who had observed Leslie, rode up to his side. The eye of Eagle Eye chanced to fall upon the Indian rifle he carried in his hand, and springing forward with a half-suppressed cry of surprise, he snatched it from the Colonel, and gazing eagerly for a moment at the hieroglyphics upon it, he asked,-</p> 
                  <p>"Pale-face, where did you get this rifle?"</p> 
                  <p>Seeing the singular earnestness of the Indian, Martin, in as few words as possible, related the history of the rifle. Eagle Eye listened with the intensest eagerness.</p> 
                  <p>"And then the pale-face has lost a little one?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have?"</p> 
                  <p>"How many moons ago?"</p> 
                  <p>"It was twenty years ago."</p> 
                  <p>"And would the pale-face like to find his son?" asked the Indian, fixing his stern eyes upon the face of Martin.</p> 
                  <p>"God knows I would give my life for him!" earnestly said the woodman.</p> 
                  <p>"Then," said the Indian, pointing to the astonished Leslie, who stood beside them, "the young white warrior is the child of the pale-faced hunter. It was Eagle Eye that stole him away. The red man gave him to another white father and mother, and the young warrior knew not that he was not their child. That rifle was once Eagle Eye's. Eagle Eye knows the rifle-he cannot be deceived. And if what the white warrior told the red man be true, then the young white warrior is the hunter's lost boy."</p> 
                  <p>Quick as thought the two sprang from their saddles, and throwing themselves into each other's arms, the fond words were spoken for the first time,-</p> 
                  <p>"My father!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE BOATMAN.</head> 
                  <p>IT was night-silent and gloomy night. Fair Luna, and her thousand smaller companions, had refused to exhibit their bright and pleasing faces, and the king of darkness had usurped the throne of power The day preceding had been one of unusual warmth and mildness-but the appearance in the sky now betokened much the approach of a storm. The moaning of the distant thunder at each moment became more distinct; and as the vivid lightning at intervals shot athwart the darkened sky, it revealed to the gaze a small boat, heavily laden, slowly wending its way down the broad and rapid waters of the Mississippi.</p> 
                  <p>At the time we date our story, the western waters were navigated only by those bold, daring, and turbulent spirits, known in romance and song as the "Mississippi Boatmen." The utility and power of steam and electricity was then entirely unknown or unthought of; and had any one advanced such an idea, it would have been scoffed at as utterly ridiculous and impossible.-Where now is seen a magnificent steamer booming along at almost lightning speed-her decks crowded with numerous gaily dressed persons, was then a small, open boat, laden with materials for the accommodation of the bold adventurers who had dared to tempt the wilds of the far west with their presence; while the wild songs and legends of the rude boatmen rang out on the silent water, echoed back by the savage Indian, or prowling wolf.</p> 
                  <p>Truly, these were the times that tried men's souls. The fierce warriors of the <emph>red men</emph>, considering that their just rights were trampled upon-and that the hunting-grounds bequeathed them by their fathers were about to be wrested from their possession-fought long and desperately, retreating or dying, at the cannon's mouth. The natural fierceness of their characters had been aroused, and they solemnly vowed, on the graves of their sires, to be revenged; that the whole race of the <emph>pale faces</emph> should be exterminated. This being the case, no settler felt himself secure-no one upon retiring to rest at night, knew but what upon waking in the morn, he should find his family murdered<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6823-00000010"/> dered in their beds. One of the principal causes of the inhuman barbarity was, that the poor, uncivilized creatures were led on by a set of demons in human form, who, to avenge personal and private wrong, resorted to this hellish mode, thereby causing the brutal murder of helpless females and infants. These fiends were principally American convicts, who, escaping from punishment, formed an alliance with the savages, and commenced a series of bloody actions that do not find a parallel on the pages of history. The red men being naturally superstitious, these white renegades, by a series of mysterious actions, with which their ignorant associates were unacquainted, caused the belief to become general among them that the renegades were special messengers of the Great Spirit, sent to lead them to battle.</p> 
                  <p>Having said this much, to show you the state of affairs at the period our story opens, with your consent, dear reader, we will return. The boat before spoken of contains four persons. The first was a powerfully built man, seemingly of about forty years of age. His features, as revealed by the almost continual flash of the vivid lightning, were regular, but dark from exposure and hardship. His hair was black and inclined to curl-and his piercing black eye told that he was a man of stern determination. But there was also something about him that was calculated to prepossess one in his favor. The high and expansive forehead-the tall and commanding form-that piercing black eye-and benevolent smile that ever rested on his dark, sunburnt features-all showed a strange combination of the human character, rarely found in one individual. In height he was slightly over six feet-with suitable developments otherwise. In all and all, he was a man whom one would ever desire as a friend, and dread as an enemy.</p> 
                  <p>Beside him stood a young girl. No more than sixteen summers had passed her-and from all appearances, one would suppose that the grim face of sorrow had never troubled her path during life. Her form was slight, but neatly and delicately moulded, exhibiting female grace and beauty, combined with a portion of that manly strength which characterized him by her side. Her features were rather dark from exposure-yet it only added more beauty of expression to her pleasing countenance. In form and feature, she so much resembled the person beside her, that at the first glance one would have pronounced them father and daughter. Her hair was black as the raven's wing, and hung in clustering ringlets about her sunny neck-and her eyes! Cease, presumptuous pen! thou art inadequate to the task. We will only say in conclusion, dear reader, that if we may be allowed to use the expression, she was divinely beautiful.</p> 
                  <p>The remaining two need little description. One of them gloried in the cognomen of Short Sam, the other, in that of Long Tom,-the names being probably derived from the dimensions of the bearers. According to their own statements, they had each been great personages in former times; Long Tom, who was a Frenchman, having been a count, and Short Sam a baronet. But let this be as it might, one thing certain was, that if it was true-they were merely the wreck of former days; as neither of them could at any time boast of more than a suit of coarse pilot cloth, and a few extra quids of the weed, which was something at least.</p> 
                  <p>Not a word was spoken for some moments after we first met them, as all seemed engaged in commune with their own thoughts. The man first described, who now stood at the fore part of the boat, gazed thoughtfully out upon the water-turning now and then to address a few words to the girl at his side.</p> 
                  <p>"I say capt'in," remarked one of the men at the oars, to him who stood forward. "I'm most dog-goned afraid we're goin' to have a dirty night of it, and nothin' shorter."</p> 
                  <p>"Most probable, Sam," briefly responded the captain.</p> 
                  <p>"Diable! By gar, we hav' von vat you call'm? tremendous harrycane!" exclaimed Long Tom, as he drew from a side pocket of his jacket a rusty snuff box, and took a pinch.</p> 
                  <p>"Hadn't we better be lookin' about for an anchorage afore the storm comes upon us?" asked Short Sam, as he followed the example of his comrade by producing a quantity of the weed, and crammed a portion of it in the larboard corner of his mouth.</p> 
                  <p>"I think it would be prudent-as the clouds at each moment become more dense-let me see where we are at present," said the captain, as he endeavored to pierce through the thick haze or fog that enveloped them.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I should guess that we <emph>aint</emph> far off <hi rend="i"/>Nob Nose, as near as I can calculate; notwithstanding the obstropulousness of atmospherical Shakspeare," replied Short Sam, with that lofty and self-important air that generally belongs to that class of individuals which he pretended to represent.</p> 
                  <p>"Zounds!" exclaimed Long Tom, the Frenchman, in a pompous tone, "you see von palace grand, in ze magnificent city of Paris, you no look at such tings; by gar, you no have a vat you call'em? inclination to do so, sar!"</p> 
                  <p>"O, cuss <hi rend="i"/>Parres, shipmate; you <emph>haint</emph> no <emph>idee</emph> how they do up things in Old Ingland. If you'd been in London onc't, ye might talk-you Frenchers don't <emph>onder</emph>stand the miscellany of conducting yourselves amongst we enlightened Inglish jintlemen and profound scholars," answered the ex-baronet, rather sharply.</p> 
                  <p>"You were correct in your opinion, Sam," said he, who was addressed as captain, and who seemed desirous to put an end to the discussion between the two men, before it terminated in something worse than a national dispute. "I can now see the Nob myself. We must run our boat into the inlet above it, where we shall remain during the night. But it begins to rain, lads; you must bend to your oars, or the storm will be upon us 'ere we are prepared to receive it. Marie," he continued, turning to the young girl at his side, "you had best go below, my child, before it rains to injure you. I will come down after we have arranged things on deck."</p> 
                  <p>"I will, father,-but-"</p> 
                  <p>"What, Marie?" asked the boatman.</p> 
                  <p>"I thought, father, that I discerned some forms moving on the shore, a few moments ago," she replied, in a sweet, musical voice.</p> 
                  <p>"You must have been mistaken, my child, for I saw nothing!" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps so,-but might it not have been Indians-and would it not be <emph>very</emph> dangerous to approach the shore, to-night?" asked the beautiful girl.</p> 
                  <p>"I think your fears are entirely groundless, my daughter," replied the boatman, "as the Indians scarcely ever visit this portion of the country-so, you may go below, Marie, and rest assured that no evil will befall thee."</p> 
                  <p>"I will, dear father," said the fair girl,<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6823-00000011"/> as she kindly kissed his weather-beaten cheek, and left his side.</p> 
                  <p>"God bless thee, Marie!" fervently ejaculated the boatman, as his eyes followed her descending form.</p> 
                  <p>"Monsieur Sam," said Long Tom at this moment moving his seat still closer to the other, "can't you give us von vat you call'im <emph>anecdote</emph> to pass off ze time until we arrive at ze "<hi rend="i"/>Nose?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well I guess I can, old hoss," replied the baronet, eager to find so ready a listener, "I'll spin you one of the <emph>alfireedest</emph> sea yarns you ever dreamt of; which occurred in my young days, when I followed the life of a sailor." So without further preliminary he related <choice>

                  <head type="sub">SHORT SAM'S STORY.</head> 
                  <p>"SAIL HO!" was the soul-stirring shout that came from the mast-head of our nymph-like craft, the "Carrie," as she nobly and majestically cut a passage through the murmuring bosom of the mighty deep. It was a mild June morning in the year 18-, and, as usual in the tropics, the wide expanse of water, constituting old ocean, was enveloped in a hazy mantle, causing <unclear>objects</unclear> on its heaving surface to appear dim and indistinct. A silence, almost death-like, had prevailed since our crossing the equator; for, as a general thing, sailers have a superstitious awe-a kind of dread of something invisible attending the crossing of that imaginary line, drawn around the earth. Knots of hardy sons of Neptune were gathered upon the forecastle, eagerly, yet continually conversing upon topics, which, if one might judge by the numerous expressive glances cast about them, were of no trifling import. Generally, they were congregated about the oldest and most experienced of their number, whose hair was frosted by long service and hardship-who, with knowing looks, related their life-experiences, mixing with the real and truthful, a sufficient quantity of visionary and superstition, to awe, interest, and delight their eager listeners.</p> 
                  <p>Many a wild and thrilling adventure was brought forth from Memory's treasures, and imbued again the spirit of life-while to make the tale more enchanting, the incidents related were made so to resemble our present situation, that it seemed that the actors in the drama were really before us. No wonder then, that the cry that greeted our ears, as before related, should startle us, one and all.</p> 
                  <p>"Sail ho!" echoed Captain Tracie, who at the time was pacing the quarter-deck, conversing with the lieutenant. "Where away, Lincon?" he demanded of the lookout.</p> 
                  <p>"Two points on the weather-bow, sir," shouted the man at the mast-head.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you make her out!" returned the captain.</p> 
                  <p>I can scarcely say, sir," replied Lincon; "she appears to be a schooner of very light tonnage, full rigged-but it would seem poorly managed, by the manner in which she lurches in the water. She carries a flag at her peak, but it is so hazy that I cannot see the emblem. There she goes! now I can see her colors, very distinct. By heavens, 'tis a signal!"</p> 
                  <p>"A signal! a signal!" was echoed from lip to lip, and a thousand conjectures were instantly made as to the situation of the signal vessel.</p> 
                  <p>"Silence!" thundered the captain, turning to the superstitious crew; "bring my glass, instantly."</p> 
                  <p>When he received it, he leaped into the rigging, and slowly scanned the horizon in the direction indicated by the lookout. A single moment brought to his practised eye all that was desired.</p> 
                  <p>"It is as Lincon said," remarked the captain, to Lieutenant Weston, who had taken the glass to view the schooner; "she is fast nearing us-in a quarter of an hour the matter will be settled."</p> 
                  <p>So it was. In little less than that space, the vessel was in speaking distance.</p> 
                  <p>"Schooner ahoy?" thundered the captain through his trumpet.</p> 
                  <p>But to the surprise of all, no answer was returned. The demand was repeated, but not with the same silence as before.</p> 
                  <p>"By St. Marco! this smells of <emph>mystery</emph>," exclaimed Captain Tracie. "We must sift it to the bottom. Lieutenant Weston, take you a boat, and an armed crew, and board that infernal craft. Perhaps the inmates may have perished for want of assistance."</p> 
                  <p>In a twinkling, the boat was in the water, and Lieutenant Weston, with a crew of seven hardy fellows, including myself, armed "<hi rend="i"/>cap-a-pie," leaped into it, and rowed swiftly toward the mysterious schooner.</p> 
                  <p>Strange were the thoughts that crowded upon my mind as we approached the object that had so excited our curiosity. It seemed as if I was about to become the spectator of a scene that would chill my blood in my veins. I had never as yet known such a thing as fear, yet the thoughts that sped with the rapidity of lightning through my brain, made me feel uncomfortable and restless. My companions seemed little more at ease than myself, yet they endeavored to conceal their emotions. Even I could observe a nervous twitching about the sternly compressed lips of Lieutenant Weston, a man who had faced death a thousand times without flinching,-which showed that he too was similarly moved. While thus engaged, we neared the sides of the schooner, which rocked silently upon the bosom of the ocean like a swan. We could now observe her more at ease.</p> 
                  <p>She was a light built craft, of scarcely sixty tons burden, her low sides painted with a glossy blackness, that reflected the rays of the sun with an uncommon brilliancy. Her light, taper masts, bright with varnish, contrasted exceedingly well with the trim of her well-tarred ropes, while the long, red flag, that floated proudly upon the passing breeze, gave her quite a piratical aspect; and had she been of greater dimensions, we might shrewdly have suspected that it was only a <hi rend="i"/>ruse, to take us by surprise. But there was something about her appearance that was more calculated to inspire feelings of awe, than fear; and I need scarcely say, that upon mounting the deck, cutlasses in hand, it was with the expectation of encountering a legion of demons from Pandemonium.</p> 
                  <p>Judge then our surprise, when we found it deserted! Not a living thing appeared, save a gang of voracious rats, that scampered across the deck, from where they had been eating the body of some dead animal. One thing that immediately struck us as something singular, was the perfect order in which everything appeared. Where one would have naturally presumed that confusion and disorder would be observable, was a trim and neatness, that the true sailor ever delights to behold. These things, combined with the novelty of our situation, served to return, in part, the spirits<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6823-00000012"/> of the <unclear>tars</unclear>, and many exclamations, such as, "a smart craft," "neat as a lady," etc., burst from their lips.</p> 
                  <p>"Stay, a moment," said Lieutenant Weston, at that instant, "and I will descend into the cabin and see if the captain is engaged." So saying, he disappeared down the gangway, sword in hand. Scarce a moment had elapsed, when an angry exclamation, or curse, was heard from below, followed immediately by a clashing of swords and rattling chains.</p> 
                  <p>Instantly we rushed down the gangway, to lend a helping hand to the lieutenant, who we supposed was in difficulty. The first sight that met our gaze, upon reaching the cabin, was the stalwart form of Weston leaning upon his sword, that was dyed with human blood; while at his feet lay a man in the last agonies of death, from a terrible gash in his side. As we entered, the man rose to a sitting posture, and turned to us his ghastly face, upon which rested an expression I shall never forget, and muttered something that sounded much like "vengeance;" then starting wildly to his feet, he seized a small, glistening box, or case, which we had not before noticed, and with a last dying effort hurled it through the cabin window, and sank back upon the floor a corpse! no papers, or evidence of any kind were found on board the vessel, to tell us the meaning of the strange scene we had first witnessed. According to his statement, Lieutenant Weston, on entering the cabin was fiercely attacked by the maniac (for such he evidently was,) and in order to preserve his own, had been compelled to sacrifice the life of the strange being. Many conjectures were made, as to what the casket thrown through the window into the sea contained, and it was generally thought that it was something valuable. We left the mysterious schooner as we had found her, and it is said by many old sailors, that oftimes she can be seen skimming over the ocean, having at her peak the blood-red signa, flag." Here the story of Short Sam was brought to a conclusion, and after receiving the compliments of the Captain and Long Tom, he leaned back in the stern of the boat and chewed his tobacco with the air of a prince.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE ABDUCTION.</head> 
                  <p>NOB NOSE, as it was usually termed was a high ridge or promontory, extending out into the river for some distance-the appearance and locality of which had caused the cognomen above to be applied to it. It was almost an entire barren rock, save here and there a few pine trees, that only served to render it more romantic and curious to the sight. In the days of which we now speak, the novelty of the thing was unthought of; and it had been converted into a sort of harbor or anchorage for boats traversing the western waters. On either side of the Nose, or promontory, formed by the projection of the rock, was a small basin, which was used for mooring vessels. When the boat before spoken of arrived opposite the Nose, her head was suddenly turned as she shot into the basin below, with great velocity.</p> 
                  <p>"Let go your anchor," exclaimed the leader of the boatman, as the vessel came within twenty feet of the shore.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, ay, sir," responded the men; and a splash in the water told that his command had been obeyed, as the boat came to.</p> 
                  <p>The appearances around them were gloomy enough, indeed! The dark, thick clouds above their heads seemed ready at each moment to burst, and let their contents upon them-peal after peal of the artillery of heaven echoed through the vault-a thick haze, or fog, had now gathered about them-through which could be discerned a dim outline of the high, rugged hills, that surrounded them on every side-as relieved against the darkened sky.</p> 
                  <p>The inmates of the boat on anchoring, immediately began to spread their weather-sheets to protect them from the coming storm. This was done by placing pike-poles upright, on either side of the boat, in holes made for the purpose, over which they spread a sheet of canvass similar to that of a wagon, but much stronger, fastening it on either side of the boat. This had scarcely been done, ere the rain commenced falling in torrents, accompanied by a fierce wind. The boat was partially protected from the latter by the high bluffs around them. After taking these necessary precautions for their external comfort, the inmates of the boat prepared to do justice internally. For this purpose, a large chest was moved from one side of the deck to the centre; and after spreading a piece of coarse linen over it, the two boatman, Short Sam, and Long Tom (who acted in the capacity of chief cooks and bottle washers), commenced adorning it with a few pewter plates, sea biscuits, dried <choice>
                        <sic>vension</sic>
                        <corr>venison</corr>
                     </choice>, roast potatoes &amp;c., &amp;c., it being the best fare the circumstances would admit of. When all was in readiness, the boatman called his daughter from the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>"Hast thou being sleeping, my child?" he asked, kindly.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, father, and I have had a terrible dream," she replied shuddering.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, my child; may I ask the import of thy dream, Marie!"</p> 
                  <p>"It was dreadful. I thought, or dreamed, that I was a prisoner, and that you was-murdered-dear father," replied the beautiful maiden as she hid her face in her father's bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"It was indeed a terrible vision, Marie," said the boatman, "but it was only a dream-and I trust it may never be fulfilled. But, come," he added, "our meal awaits us; let us eat, and then to rest, for we shall have to rise betimes to-morrow."</p> 
                  <p>O, how sweet, how refreshing, did that homely meal seem to those careworn adventurers, as they assembled around that rude board, where love and friendship reigned predominant. The repast being finished, the boatman conducted his daughter below, to her sleeping apartment; and telling her to throw aside all fears of danger, as nothing would harm her, he returned upon deck.</p> 
                  <p>For sometime afterward the three boatmen remained in deep conversation, relating legends, and exploits-until, one by one they laid themselves out upon the deck-and nought disturbed the silence of the hour save the howling of the storm without, and the deep breathing of the sleepers within. It was near the noon of night, and the storm which had for so long raged, had now entirely ceased. One by one the dark, heavy clouds disappeared, leaving the sky perfectly clear. The moon came forth accompanied by her numerous attendants, revealing the little anchor bound vessel floating like a swan on the bosom of the waters. Its inmates still slept. They saw not those six dark forms emerge from the dark forest on the shore, and one by one drop silently in the water and steer out toward the boat! No, they saw them not-for at that moment they were revelling<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6823-00000013"/> velling in the land of dreams. Rest on, silent sleepers, for it may be your last!</p> 
                  <p>In a few moments the swimmers had reached the side of the boat, when the foremost turned, and uttered in a low voice a few words in the Indian jargon, upon which his companions rested their arms upon the sides of the boat, and remained stationary. He who seemed to be their leader crept noiselessly up the sides of the boat, and lifting the curtain that sheltered it, stepped among the sleeping boatmen.</p> 
                  <p>By a light admitted through a small aperture in the canvass we are enabled to scan his features and person. In height he was scarcely over six feet, but powerfully developed otherwise. His features were none of the best, being wrinkled and distorted by time and exposure; which, although they were of a yellowish cast, it was plain to observe that he was not of the red man's race. His low, wrinkled brow, and twinkling gray eyes, were surmounted by a vast quantity of sandy-colored hair; while a moustache of similar hue garnished his upper lip. Upon his head rested a small green cap, ornamented with beads and bands of gold, from one side of which hung a long black feather. An old faded scarlet coat, denoting that an English officer had at one time been the possessor, covered his upper person-while a broad leathern belt was buckled around his waist, filled with pistols and daggers. From this, also, depended a short English sword and an Indian tomahawk. His lower extremities were covered with buckskin leggins and moccasins, ornamented tastefully with beads. Such was the external appearance of the individual who appeared so unceremoniously among the sleeping boatmen.</p> 
                  <p>For some moments after reaching the deck, he gazed around in silence, and at last moved noiselessly to the side of the captain. After gazing for some moments in silence upon the calm, stern features of the sleeper, he muttered, in a disappointed tone, between his clenched teeth:</p> 
                  <p>"Not here! I could have sworn I saw her on the boat this evening. But I must have been deceived. However, I will not go unrevenged. I'll settle with the father now, the daughter afterward." And as he said this he cast a glance about him, and seeing that he was unobserved, he drew from his belt a long dagger and held its glittering blade above the sleeper's breast!</p> 
                  <p>"Ha!" uttered the midnight prowler, with a start, as he dropped the point of the weapon, "I had not thought of that; a little more and all would have been lost. It must be so." And turning again to the sleeping boatman he hissed, fiercely:</p> 
                  <p>"Sleep on, old man; though thy life is spared, when thou wakest thou wilt wish it had not." Then drawing from his bosom a slip of paper, he placed it upon the captain's breast; and without a single remark descended into the boat's cabin.</p> 
                  <p>Marie, the boatman's daughter, slept soundly. The assurance of her kind father that no evil would befall her, had acted with good effect-and her pillow was troubled with none but pleasant dreams.</p> 
                  <p>The individual, who, as we before related, had noiselessly entered her apartment,-paused, and gazed upon the placid features of the sleeping maiden. And as he thus gazed, a strange tremor shook his stalwart frame. At one moment a shade, or cloud, would seem to cross his countenance,-then a smile, almost of humanity, would beam from thence. There seemed to be something in the appearance of the sleeper that affected him strangely. But these transparent indications of the inward workings of the soul did not long last. His brow grew darker still-a fierce gleam shot from his eyes, and he hoarsely whispered to himself:</p> 
                  <p>"Rejected! My haughty maiden, my time has come now. We will now see who is the suppliant. Once did I kneel to thee-now thou shalt kneel to me. Ha, ha, ha."</p> 
                  <p>So saying, he drew from his pocket a large bandage, and quickly placed it upon the face of the sleeping girl, completely hiding her face within its folds, and stifling her cries. He then lifted her in his arms as though she were a mere child, and mounted to the deck. The boatmen still slept. Their exertions during the day had so wearied their frames, that a long rest was required to resuscitate them; and as the individual spoken of mounted the deck with the lifeless body of the boatman's daughter in his arms, he felt that his object had been accomplished; and a smile of triumph sat upon his features. Without uttering a word, he crossed the deck to where he had first gained an entrance, and uttering a few words in a low tone to his Indian attendants, they left the vessel as silently as they came, carrying the inanimate form of Marie with them.</p> 
                  <p>The sun had just begun to appear on the following morning, and was tipping the heights of the surrounding trees with a golden hue, when the inmates of the boat aroused themselves from their slumbers, and began to make preparations for their departure down the river. Already had the anchor been hove upon deck, and the oars placed in their pivots; but the boatman's daughter came not to the call on her kind father. Wondering at her strange silence, the boatman went below to awaken her.</p> 
                  <p>Let us here draw a veil over the scene that followed, and leave the reader to imagine the feelings of the parent, upon finding his only daughter had disappeared-no one knew why, or whither-perhaps irrecoverably lost; but suffice it to remark that one of the men discovered upon the deck, near the spot where the captain had rested during the night, a scrap of paper containing the following:</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE LOVER'S OATH.</head> 
                  <p>NEVER in the breast of man did there ever beat a more kind or generous heart than that of Joseph Finley, the boatman; nor did there ever live a man who possessed a greater share of true manly courage. Born in the humble but honorable sphere of a tiller of the soil, he had at an early age chosen the boisterous life of a sailor for a profession; and as his parents were in rather limited circumstances, having a numerous family to support, he was permitted to follow his own inclinations. Until the age of twenty-one his life was spent upon the sea in the capacity of a man before the mast; but becoming disgusted with this mode of life, where there was so much to encounter and so little reward, he left the service, and soon afterward becoming enamored with the charms of a young lady, the daughter of a neighboring farmer, he<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6823-00000014"/> married her, and for a while settled down in tranquillity. But long he was destined not to remain so. About this period, quite un excitement was produced by the marvellous accounts of the far west, related by some adventurers who had returned from an exploring expedition in the valley of the Mississippi.</p> 
                  <p>The soil, game, and climate of this newly-discovered paradise were extolled to the sky by Boon and his companions, and this induced many persons to venture thither; intending, if pleased with the country, to remove their families afterward. Among these was Joseph Finley. He was pleased, charmed with everything he saw; and in the following spring, with hundreds of others, he bade adieu to his friends and native home, and removed to the far west. A party of the emigrants came to that part of the Mississippi where the city of Vicksburg now stands, and liking the situation, commenced a settlement, as it was called, and in the course of a few years had, by their untiring energy and perseverance, built up a fashionable village. After establishing his wife and child in a comfortable manner, for in the meantime Providence had blessed them with offspring-a girl of uncommon beauty-his adventurous nature, as if by instinct, led him upon the water again, and in the character of a flat-boatman he served for many years, at that time a very profitable employment.</p> 
                  <p>During the period to which we allude, the daughter had grown from a child to a beautiful maid of sweet sixteen. Her mother dying shortly afterward, she was left entirely dependent upon her remaining parent for that wise counsel and care so much needed by persons at her age. But during the life of the mother the child had not been neglected; and as Mrs. Finley possessed a thorough education herself, a portion of her time had been devoted to the improvement of her daughter's mental faculties.</p> 
                  <p>It is not strange that such a fair flower as the boatman's daughter, blooming as she did in the wild desert, should be eagerly sought after by those who came in contact with her. There was one who seemed more likely to obtain the coveted prize than any other. Ned Marston was that one. His father, in times long past, had saved the life of Joseph Finley, which brave action on his part had made them inseparable friends for life. When one encountered a difficulty, the other was ever willing to assist him; and if one fell in with a streak of luck or fortune, the other shared it with him. In their younger days, they both served in the same ship at sea, and in the same capacity; and when Finley declared his intention of removing to the far west, Marston said, "as they had so long weathered out the storms of life together, it would be useless to part company at that period of the voyage." So he, having married some time in advance of his shipmate, emigrated with him.</p> 
                  <p>Upon reaching their destination, as before related, each chose his favorite occupation; and while Joseph Finley returned upon the water, Marston chose the adventurous life of a hunter, passing the principal part of his time in the wild forest. Shortly after emigrating to the west, Marston became the father of a boy, but at the same time lost a wife and partner whom he "loved as man ere did love." His son Ned consequently received his first lesson in the woods, with gun in hand, and after following up faithfully his hazardous occupation for a number of years, no man in the valley of the great Mississippi was more dreaded by the savage foe, or considered the superior of Ned Marston as a hunter or pioneer scout.</p> 
                  <p>Young Marston, in point of age, was some three years the senior of Marie Finley, and for some years it had been a settled point between the two parents, that at the proper period their two children were to be united by the bans of wedlock, in honor to their life-long friendship. And if we must say the truth, this parental arrangement was not altogether disagreeable to the parties in question. For in the bold, manly, and independent spirit of Ned Marston, the gentle Marie could read the soul of one calculated to love, cherish, and protect; while, on the other hand, the young adventurer could not but acknowledge (to himself as a matter of course), that the delicate and winning graces of the boatman's daughter had so captivated his heart, that he could love none other than the beautiful Marie Finley! Thus matters progressed for some time; the old gentlemen both pursuing their favorite avocations, while the youngsters passed away the time in the most agreeable manner possible.</p> 
                  <p>About a year prior to the time of the commencement of our story, the quiet town of Vicksburg was visited by what was then an unusual thing, a stranger. No one knew from whence he came; for when questioned upon the subject, he always evaded a direct reply, without giving his questioners much satisfaction. He gave his name as William Wilson, which was all the village gossip could learn of his past history; and as a matter of fact, rumor as to who the stranger was was not idle. Faggs conjectured that he was a spy, sent out by the British to watch the motions of the settlers; and Baggs believed him to be a murderer, escaped from some of the prisons in the colonies.</p> 
                  <p>But let us return to the object of these remarks. He was a man of above five and twenty years of age; and his features, now darkened much by exposure and hardship, still retained the mark of beauty. From the moment of his first arrival, he had aroused the suspicions of young Marston, which might have been tinctured not a little with jealousy, as he had at different times noticed that the mysterious stranger cast significant glances at the idol of his affections, the lovely Marie Finley. At last these indications became too open and unguarded to be mistaken; and what before might have been the suspicion and jealousy of Ned, was now transformed into hatred and defiance. It seemed that the stranger noticed the change that had come over the young hunter, for he had avoided all intercourse with him, and renewed his attentions to the object of his desires; for he had already determined that the boatman's daughter should be his, in spite of all opposition to the contrary.</p> 
                  <p>His money was spent in all possible ways to win her smiles, while her tables were loaded down with presents, which, through courtesy, she was compelled to accept. At last, having tempered her as he thought to suit his wishes, he made bold to offer his hand, heart, and fortune. His offer was rejected. A fierce expression shot across his brawny features; and muttering curses of vengeance, he departed, no one knew whither.</p> 
                  <p>Some few days afterward, a hunter<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6823-00000015"/> arrived at the town, and after hearing the tale of the mysterious stranger, asked:</p> 
                  <p>"Had he you speak of grey eyes and a downcast look?"</p> 
                  <p>Upon being answered in the affirmative, the hunter said:</p> 
                  <p>"Then there can be little doubt about it; the man you speak of can be no other than Sam Harper, the renegade."</p> 
                  <p>The astonishment of the settlers cannot be conceived, when they learned that the deepest-dyed villain in the colonies had been in their midst. But he took good care not to make his appearance again. Nothing of note had occurred for nearly a year, and the threat of Sam Harper the renegade had almost been forgotten, when it was brought back vividly to mind by the occurrences in the preceding chapters.</p> 
                  <p>Upon Jacob Finley's arrival at Vicksburg, after the discovery made in our second chapter, be left his vessel in charge of Short Sam and Long Tom, and proceeding to his dwelling, locked himself in his chamber to meditate upon his misfortune, and to plan some way for the recovery of his daughter. It might perhaps have been an hour afterward as he set thus, when a rap at the door aroused him from the revery into which he had fallen,-and as he opened it, a young man sprang into the room, and shook him warmly by the hand.</p> 
                  <p>"Glad to see you, Mr. Finley. Hope you are in good health. Excuse me for not calling sooner. Just learned that you had arrived," were the ejaculations rapidly uttered by the young man, as he gazed into the face of the other, who was unable to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"Great heaven! Mr. <choice>
                        <sic>Fiuley</sic>
                        <corr>Finley</corr>
                     </choice>, what has happened? You look pale, are you unwell!" he quickly asked, as he noticed that the color had left the others cheek.</p> 
                  <p>"No Ned, not unwell-but," stammered Finley.</p> 
                  <p>"But-but what?" interrupted the youth.</p> 
                  <p>"Marie-Ned-"</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! Marie! What of her?" shouted the young man, as he grasped the boatman almost fiercely by the arm.</p> 
                  <p>"She's gone, Ned," slowly uttered the grief stricken parent.</p> 
                  <p>"Gone!" shrieked the youth, tightening his grasp so as to make the other wince.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, gone. That <emph>renegade</emph> Harper has robbed me of my child, Ned Marston," said the boatman, faintly.</p> 
                  <p>Instantly the hand that grasped the boatman's arm released its gripe, and the young hunter staggered back like one who had been struck a violent blow, while Finley sank into a seat, perfectly overpowered by his emotions.</p> 
                  <p>For some moments neither spoke. Marston stood as if in a stupor, and gazed vacantly on the floor of the apartment. Suddenly he started forward toward the door. There was a strange fire in his natural black, piercing eye, that caused Finley to gaze upon him with feelings of awe and admiration. A strange tremor, but not of fear, shook his manly frame. He paused a moment, and turning to Finley, he said, with a voice hoarse with conflicting emotions:</p> 
                  <p>"Finley, you have ever treated me with the kindness of a father-your daughter has bestowed upon me her affections, which you have been kind enough to sanction. I know that I am unworthy of you both, yet I feel that it is my duty to rescue her from the fate that awaits her. I hasten upon my enterprise ere it be too late. Tell my good father that I shall soon return; and comfort yourself, too, for I will bring your daughter with me, or die. I have spoken it. You never knew Ned Marston to make an idle promise. Farewell." So saying, ere the bootman could interfere to prevent him, his towering form strode from the apartment.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head> 
                  <p>AFTER leaving the residence of Mr. Finley, Ned Marston turned his steps toward the river side, and meeting with Short Sam, who was unloading the boat of her cargo, he inquired of him the manner and circumstances connected with the outrage before mentioned. Having ascertained this, he entered a building at the water's edge. In the course of half an hour he emerged, carrying in his arms a bundle of no ordinary size. At his side hung a long sword, which many of the settlers wore at that early day, and a broad leathern belt around his waist filled with pistols, gave him quite a piratical appearance. Having leaped into a small canoe which was drawn to the bank, he at once threw himself upon the oars, and the light bark shot out over the water, with a velocity astounding.</p> 
                  <p>Under the power of two strong and willing arms, it was not long before the little vessel had borne its inmate far beyond the sight of civilization. As might have been supposed, the destination of young Marston was "<hi rend="i"/>Nob Nose;" his object being to recover Marie Finley from the possession of the "<hi rend="i"/>renegade."</p> 
                  <p>The shades of night were fast closing around the terrestrial sphere, wrapping all in a sable mantle, when Ned Marston arrived at the margin of the little basin where he intended to leave his little vessel, and try his fortune in the forest. Nothing short of madness er love, which are ever so closely linked, could have induced the youth to thus risk his life to so many dangers and hardships. But the forest was his home-fear was a thing that he knew not, and as he stepped upon the shore, he drew his sword from its scabbard, and lifting it above his head, he exclaimed in an impassioned tone:</p> 
                  <p>"O Marie-Heaven knows that I love thee truly-and I swear to rescue thee, or die in the attempt."</p> 
                  <p>It was a wild scene-nothing less than an Indian encampment in the wilderness. The sun of a summer's day was just disappearing beyond a blue horizon, mingling its last rays with that of its unassuming rival, "fair Luna." Twilight had now come, blending night and day together for a moment, causing every object to appear as if enshrouded in a sable mantle. As we before said, it was truly a wild and romantic scene. The encampment consisted of about two dozen huts, or tents, composed of bark. In the top of each was a small opening, which emitted dense volumes of smoke from the interior, which had now settled down in so dense a body, as to completely hide many of the lodges from view. The encampment was built in the form of a crescent, or half circle; the vacancy in the centre being reserved as a place for physical exercise and amusement. This part of the village-or "race-ground," as it was termed, was now occupied by the juvenile portion of the camp, who, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, still continued their innocent sports.</p> 
                  <p>The elder part of the community<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6823-00000016"/> were usually seated at the entrance of their lodges, smoking their pipes, and watching the sports on the "race-ground;" while here and there, could be discerned a beautiful young Indian maiden, listening to the vows of the noble warrior by her side. Such in part was the appearance of things at the Indian encampment at the time we would introduce the reader. At the further extremity of the village was a lodge, situated a little apart form the others, which, from the numerous extra fixtures with which it was adorned, denoted that one of superior rank dwelt within. Without pausing for further description, we will now introduce the reader to its inmates. Upon a couch in the only apartment the tent afforded, was seated a young maiden. Her features wore a sad expression-and her red, swollen eyes, wet with the tears of sorrow, told that she had been weeping bitterly. Her form was slight, but of a neat and delicate mould; and her dark, raven-like tresses hung in disordered masses about her marble neck and shoulders. It was plain to observe by the complexion of her skin, that not a drop of Indian blood ran in her veins, and it was also obvious that she understood not the native tongue-as a tawny girl who sat at her feet endeavored to amuse her by her own unintelligible prattle in vain. While she sat thus, the door of the lodge was thrown rudely open, and a stranger entered uninvited. But the intruder needs no description from us-the reader has, I presume, already become sufficiently acquainted with the "<hi rend="i"/>renegade." He was dressed in the same costume, and the same demoniac expression rested upon his features.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, my cruel charmer," he exclaimed, as he drew a seat towards the couch, where were seated the two girls-who shrank back with terror, "I hope that I shall not plead in vain, as I before did. Here I should and could rule; but we cannot always thwart the course of true love." He paused, as if expecting an answer, but receiving none, he continued:</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, my beautiful maiden, I, who am ever so ready to avenge the wrongs of the oppressed, and to engage where the danger is thickest, am ever ready to fall down at thy feet and die with the pleasure I receive by being in thy sweet presence. Tell me, sweet being, do I plead in vain?"</p> 
                  <p>The dark eyes of the lovely white maiden flashed with an unwonted fire as she indignantly replied:</p> 
                  <p>"Speak not again to me of love, thou arch-traitor and base hypocrite. Thou murderer of defenseless females and children-thou midnight prowler and kidnapper, I would have thought that the conscience of one so mean and despicable, if there was one spark of humanity about it, would have awed thee to silence. I would have thought-"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold, woman!" shouted the renegade, fiercely. Springing to his feet and drawing his sword, he advanced toward the brave girl who so correctly portrayed his character, "Your fate is sealed-you shall die the death you deserve."</p> 
                  <p>"Renegade! villain!-do your worst! I defy you-you cannot do more than kill me!" exclaimed the heroic maiden.</p> 
                  <p>"I can do that, infernal hag," gnashed the monster, as he aimed a furious blow at the head of the heroic girl.</p> 
                  <p>But his weapon was turned aside by that of another, and as he turned fiercely around to confront his opponent, the eyes of Ned Marston the hunter gleamed upon him.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Ha, Marston!" thundered the baulked <hi rend="i"/>renegade, who with distorted features, black with rage and fury, more resembled a demon than anything else.-"How dare you intrude yourself upon my privacy? By heaven, you shall suffer death a thousand times."</p> 
                  <p>"Dare?-base villain!" exclaimed Marston, contemptuously, striking the other across the breast with the flat side of his sword. "Defend yourself instantly, ere I be tempted to take your worthless life as that of a dog."</p> 
                  <p>The sword of the <hi rend="i"/>renegade flashed in the dim fire-light, and crossed that of the youth. The <hi rend="i"/>renegade was no craven, nor was he a novice in the use of the weapon which he held; yet the moment his blade crossed that of Ned Marston, the confidence which he rested in his superior skill as a swordsman instantly deserted him. He knew that he confronted his superior. Pass after pass was given, and parried with a remarkable skill; neither having been seriously harmed. The <hi rend="i"/>renegade fought with desperate fury, which was met by his adversary with the stern determination to conquer or perish. Neither noticed the form which hovered over them, and eagerly watched the progress of the combat. Both were too fearfully engaged to notice this.</p> 
                  <p>"Die, infernal youth," exclaimed the renegade, as he caught a portion of his adversary's person exposed, and made a desperate lunge forward.</p> 
                  <p>With a wild scream, the form that hovered near glided before the messenger of death, and the sword of the <hi rend="i"/>renegade was sheathed in the body of <hi rend="i"/>Marie Finley.</p> 
                  <p>"Monster!" thundered Ned Marston, as he beheld this bloody deed, "Death is too good for thee!"</p> 
                  <p>"So saying, he plunged his sword to the hilt in the heart of the treacherous renegade.</p> 
                  <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>Upon examination, it was found that the wound of Marie was only a <unclear>slight</unclear> one; and staunching the blood in the best manner possible, Marston lifted the unconscious maiden in his stout arms, and bidding the Indian girl (who was greatly attached to Marie, and whose name was Nizza) follow him, he quietly left the village, without having been observed. It was not long before the beautiful Marie Finley felt the warm embrace of her kind father, who in <choice>

                     </choice> of the debt of gratitude which he owed Ned Marston, freely gave him the hand of his daughter; and we need scarcely say that her heart went with it.</p> 
                  <p>Nizza, the Indian maiden, for some time made her home with Ned and Marie Marston, attracting much attention by her extraordinary beauty; but was at last wooed and won by a youthful pioneer, and we are happy to state that happiness was ever afterward their portion.</p> 
                  <p>Short Sam and Long Tom still rowed their boat over the waters of the proud Mississippi, contenting themselves with a good supply of their favorite "weed," and the consolation that, though fallen from their former elevation, the pleasures of life were not altogether denied them.</p>

                  <p>"Paddle to yonder rock that projects out into the lake," said Tom Pips to his boatman, Jake Borland, "I believe there's front there."</p> 
                  <p>"The point away to the south, is a better place," answered Jake. "I've seen many a noble trout caught there."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, pull away for the rock," said Pips, impatient to throw in his line. "I can tell at a glance where the trout lie, if I never have angled in this lake. To the experienced eye of the scientific angler, the good places will always appear. There's a certain instinct about him which directs him to the right spots as unerringly as the honey bee finds her hive. Why Jake, I have explored almost every lake, river and brook, in the wilderness of northern New York, and killed more trout than you will ever see, or ever have seen; true, I never was on this lake before, but instinct tells me where the trout gather. Pull away, and I'll soon show you what a scientific angler can do."</p> 
                  <p>"All right," replied Jake, smiling in his sleeve at Tom's arrogance, and paddling for the rock. "But between me and you, Mr. Pips, I think more of experience than I do of your instinct."</p> 
                  <p>"Never mind, Jake, I will soon exhibit some of the results of that instinct you sneer at," said Pips. "Yes, and in the shape of some shining trout too. My eye seldom deceives me."</p> 
                  <p>The boatman pulled away as Pips directed him. The morning was somewhat lowry, and a breeze from the south rippled the surface of the lake, inspiring our angler with lively hopes that the day was favorable and would bring him good luck. Borland, too, thought the weather was propitious, and was anxious that Pips should have rare sport. Having long been acquainted with the lake, and angled in its waters ever since he was old enough to hold up a fishing-rod, Pip's boatman knew every inch of good fishing-ground without the help of Izaak Walton, or the philosophy of Sir Humphrey Davy. They were fast approaching the rock, and the more they neared it, the higher beat Pip's pulse.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, Jake! the spot looks more and more favorable the nearer we approach it," said Tom, putting on one of his best flies, and getting his tackle in readiness. "Such a spot, and such a fine morning are enough to awaken old Izaak Walton from his grave, and bring him forth with fishing-rod in hand, and book of flies in his pocket."</p> 
                  <p>"Who the devil is old Ike Walton, you gentlemen anglers talk so much about?" demanded Jake, laughing, and turning his quid into the other check.</p> 
                  <p>"Not know who old Izaak was?" asked Pips, in much apparent surprise, pulling a small volume from his pocket, and holding it up before his boatman. "There, Walton wrote this book; and there's nothing like it on the globe. You may read it a hundred times and continually find new beauties in it. Izaak Walton, blessed be his memory, was the greatest angler England over produced. Let any one who has a taste for scientific angling, read this book and study it well, and he need not be at a loss to find the best fishing grounds even in a lake or stream he has never visited. Yes, Jake, Walton was a wonderful man-I may say, a great man."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps he was," replied Jake, straining his eyes in a southern direction, and looking very earnestly.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you see?" was Pip's question.</p> 
                  <p>Before Jake could answer, a loud splashing was heard in the water, and a beautiful buck leaped upon the shore, stood a moment and looked at them, and then bounded away into the thick forest. It was all done in a single minute, and took Pips by surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"My God!" exclaimed Pips; "that was a splendid buck! If my rifle had been at this end of the boat he wouldn't have bounded but once, I can tell you. Why hand,t you given me warning, and I should have shown you what a dead shot I am"</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't see the buck until he had leaped from the water upon the shore," replied Jake,</p> 
                  <p>"Well, what were you gazing at, then?" inquired Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Yonder small boat, which is nearing the point <unclear>I</unclear> spoke of to you just now," answered Jake. "I'm thinking that boat is paddled by a person who <unclear>can</unclear> beat old Izaak or any other main in catching trout. I'm sorry she's going to that point, but she's always on the lake when the season and the weather is favorable. And she knows the good fishing ground, too."</p> 
                  <p>"She! She!" said Pips, anxiously gazing towards the small boat. "Who do you mean by she? Is it a woman who is such a skilful angler?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is'nt anybody else," replied Jake, smiling at Pip's anxiety. "I'll bet on her hand to catch more trout in one hour at that point, than some people can catch all day. And she has'nt so fine a pole as you have, and uses no tinsel flies, but the real live minnows."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't say pole, Jake," said Pips, "call it rod and don't say catch, but kill."</p> 
                  <p>"But you must catch before you can kill them," answered the rough boatman And as to pole or rod, it's all the same."</p> 
                  <p>"But who is this female angler?" inquired Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, didn't you never hear of Sarah Searsmont, or 'Fishing Sal,' as she is called in these diggins?" said Jake. "She's a hard one, I can tell you, and handsome as a picter"</p> 
                  <p>"Fishing Sal! handsome as a picture;" repeated Pips. "What have you got in your head, Jake Fishing Sal, and handsome as a picture! If she angles much, I reckon her skin must be rather rough and sunburnt."</p> 
                  <p>"True, she's somewhat tanned, but her complexion is dark, and her face looks well, after all," replied Jake. "And her form is beautiful-her hair and eye dark and shining as the raven's wing-and her limb as fleet as the deer's we just saw leap from the water s If we had gone to the point when I spoke of it, we should have occupied the ground before her."</p> 
                  <p>"Pull away for the point," exclaimed Pips. "We can try this place some other time. I must see this strange, beautiful girl. Your account of her has really excited my curiosity."</p> 
                  <p>They had more than a mile to go before they reached the point which was at the inlet of the lower lake, and formed by the outlet of the upper one, which was the larger of the two. They were nearly four miles apart, and connected by a stream called the Narrows. The reader who has ever visited these lakes, will at once perceive that we are describing the upper and lower Chateaugay lakes in Northern New York, which are located in the midst of the wilderness, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of large hills that might well be, and would be called mountains in some other States. These hills are covered with a dense forest quite to their summits, and afford a beautiful range for the deer. The trees are of large growth, and stand very thick. Twenty years ago, when our story commences, scarcely a single inhabitant, except Fishing Sal and her mother, occupied these forests. We must except also the occasional anglers and hunters who visited them. There is now no inhabitant on the shores of the upper lake, and but a very few on the hill sides of the lower one. The whole region is even now a wild romantic place, but was more so during our last war with England, and for several years subsequent.</p> 
                  <p>Pip's boatman was a strong muscular man, and the boat skipped over the rippled surface of the lake like a thing of life. Jake was fond of meeting this girl and hearing her musical voice and loud ringing laugh. She was most agreeable company when she was disposed to be, and when she was not, she could be as sulky and moody as an Indian. As might reasonably be expected, Tom Pips was highly excited in anticipation of seeing such a girl in the solitudes of an unbroken forest. He was a bachelor about forty years of age, having a large estate left him by his father, and full of angling and hunting propensities. Tom was not a dissolute or dissipated person, although he was excessively fond of wild sport. He was born in the city of New York, and always resided there except when he was on his fishing or hunting excursions. His winters were passed in the city; but the summer months generally found him in forests, seeking for trout and other game. He was in fact, a very scientific angler; and, yet he often, very often, met with bad luck, as all such do. The uncertainty of the game enhanced its pleasures, for every time the angler goes out, he expects to have better luck than he ever did before. Tom was always full of hope and never discouraged. He possessed a great share of patience, which is a great virtue in an angler. From morning to dewy eve, he could hold his fishing-rod and not be discouraged if he had one or two glorious nibbles during the day. He had never beheld a lady who was fond of his peculiar sport and never saw one kill a trout: hence his curiosity to have an interview with Fishing Sal.</p> 
                  <p>"Come Jake, pull away," said Tom, straining his gaze towards the point to which they were looking. It seems to me this boat don't go ahead so fast as usual."</p> 
                  <p>"We have a head wind," replied Jake, smiling. "Besides, I perceive you're impatient to try your skill with yonder maiden; but it will be useless, for she'll hook and kill two trout to your one, day in and day out."</p> 
                  <p>"Where does the creature live?" asked Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"With her mother, on yonder hill side," replied Borland, pointing to a hill whose base was not far distant from the narrows. "I can now see the smoke of their hut curling along the tops of the trees. Don't you see it?"</p> 
                  <p>"I see a smoke, but can it be possible that it proceeds from such a habitation?" asked Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"It is true as the gospel," answered the stalwart boatman.</p> 
                  <p>"A thought has just struck me," said Pips. "A very good joke you've played upon me."</p> 
                  <p>"How? what?" demanded Jake, looking rather anxious.</p> 
                  <p>"An Indian's hut!" replied Pips. "A squaw and her daughter! Come, we'll go back to the rock"</p> 
                  <p>"Not by a jug full," said Jake. "Her mother is as white as you are, and I have no doubt her father was too. No, no, Mr. Pips, I'm not joking I can assure you. The girl is really handsome, full of life, and absolutely bewitching, if she's disposed to be. I don't believe there's a girl in your great city more beautiful than she is, if she were dressed up in fine clothes."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you speak the truth?" inquired Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"I speak nothing else, and you'll say so when you see her."</p> 
                  <p>"Pull away then," shouted Pips. "I'm all impatience to see her."</p> 
                  <p>"Be careful, or she may hook you, Mr. Pips," said Jake, laughing, and lighting his pipe. "She knows how to bait her hook for a trout, and perhaps for a bachelor."</p> 
                  <p>"I will take care of that," said Pips. "Pull away, I want to see the creature kill a trout."</p> 
                  <p>"I dare say she has killed some before this time," said Jake. "The morning is fine and she knows it. She's better acquainted with the habits of trout than that old Walton ever was, if she can't write a book."</p> 
                  <p>"How long has she and her mother lived here?" asked Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know, but I heard an old man at Chateaugay Four Corners, say they have lived in the woods ever since the war with England. Fishing Sal was then an infant, and her mother taking some <choice>
                        <sic>afront</sic>
                        <corr>affront</corr>
                     </choice> from an American officer, started for the woods and has lived there over since."</p> 
                  <p>"But how could a woman and child subsist in a forest?" asked Pips, in surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Some say an old Indian provided for them until Sal grew big enough to hunt and fish herself," replied Jake. "But there are a good many stories about them, and I don't know as any of them are true. Sal nor her mother would never let me into the records of their history. I think her mother must have been a handsome girl, although she now shows the marks of age and trouble. I hav'nt seen them for a long while."</p> 
                  <p>"I feel more and more anxious to see these strange women," said Pips. "I will find out their history."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you may, but I have my doubts," replied Jake. "Sal is close mouthed on these subjects, and her mother's not very talkative, but you can use your skill and see what you can learn. The mother appears to be a kind, good-hearted woman, but that she once saw better days I have no reason to doubt."</p> 
                  <p>Jake had now paddled his boat within twenty rods of Sal and her canoe, which was an Indian birch and very neatly made. Her canoe sat like a gull on the water about a rod from the shore.</p> 
                  <p>"She takes the trout as they come through the Narrows from the upper lake, and round that point," said Jake.</p> 
                  <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth before the girl had hooked a very large salmon trout, and began to show him play.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens!" exclaimed Pips. "She has hooked one. How she plays him! Why Jake, she has a real angler's reel, if her rod is not so very beautiful."</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, she has always fished with a reel," replied Jake. "It is the first one I ever saw. Some say it once belonged to a British officer, but no one knows for certainty."</p> 
                  <p>"Paddle nearer and let me see the sport," whispered Pips in a low voice, as if he feared he might frighten the trout from the spot. "Gracious me, how the trout runs! He must be a noble fellow! See! he broke water! Heavens! he will weigh ten pounds! Didn't you see what a splashing he made? Now she has him turned, and begins to wind him up. How she makes her reel spin! There! he has turned again, and away he goes! Great Heavens! She manages him most skilfully! Now he comes again quite tamely! Mighty Lord! See! he broke water again and runs! Don't snub him too suddenly, young woman!" The last sentence he spoke in a louder tone of voice, and addressed Sal; but, before, he had been muttering to himself from the <choice>
                        <sic>exitement</sic>
                        <corr>excitement</corr>
                     </choice> of the moment. She turned her dark eyes upon Pips, and smiled.</p> 
                  <p>"Have no fears, sir," she said, in a very musical voice. At least Pips thought it was musical.</p> 
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6823-00000018"/> 
                  <p>"He's a very large one," said Pips, and may break away."</p> 
                  <p>"Not so large as some I have in my canoe," she answered, snubbing the trout, and gently leading him towards her canoe.</p> 
                  <p>"You must'nt try to lift him into the canoe by the hook, or he will certainly break away."</p> 
                  <p>"Very likely," she replied, raising a hand net, and scooping the trout safely into her canoe.</p> 
                  <p>"That will do, will it not sir?" she asked smiling as she threw the trout into her canoe, and began to put another bait upon the hook.</p> 
                  <p>"Admirable! most admirable!" exclaimed Pips in raptures at the skill she manifested. "My God!" continued Pips, "you've had rare sport this morning."</p> 
                  <p>"The weather is favorable," she replied, again throwing her hook into the water.</p> 
                  <p>"One! two! three! four! and two of them alive and kicking!" exclaimed Pips, as he gazed upon the trout in Sal's canoe, "heavens! what fine sport!"</p> 
                  <p>"Throw in, and share it with me, sir," she said, "there are more in the lake, and perhaps they will swim this way."</p> 
                  <p>Tom's tackle was all in order, and most scientifically did he drag his fly upon the rippled water-fall, while she sat gazing upon his nice movements. Tom handled his rod very genteelly, and gave his fly a very easy and natural motion, but he raised no trout.</p> 
                  <p>"I think, sir, you would do better with a small fish for bait," she said. If you havn't any, I will furnish you with some."</p> 
                  <p>At that moment a still larger trout than any she had killed took her minnow and away he ran, making her reel discourse most delightful music to Tom's ears as well as to hers.</p> 
                  <p>"She has hooked one now that will make you stare when he comes in sight," said Jake.</p> 
                  <p>"My heavens! how he makes the reel buzz!" exclaimed Pips, suddenly rising and gazing most intently upon Sal's line. "Gracious God! now he leaps from the water! He'll weigh twenty pounds!"</p> 
                  <p>"Not as much as that sir," she cooly replied, "but I think he's the largest one I've yet hooked."</p> 
                  <p>"The largest one!" repeated Pips, while the sweat stood in big drops upon his brow. "He'll weigh every ounce of twenty pounds! I saw the breadth of his tail as he broke water! There! there! now he comes! Be careful when he turns again, and don't snub him so smartly!"</p> 
                  <p>"You may take my rod if you please, sir," she said, "I should like to see you manage him."</p> 
                  <p>Tom gladly accepted her offer, and took her rod. The boats were lying side by side. He was greatly agitated, still he managed the game quite well.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! now he runs gloriously," he exclaimed, I tell you he will pull down twenty pounds, every ounce of it! He goes finely! I fear your line is not long enough."</p> 
                  <p>"I think the line's long enough, but he seems to be aiming towards bad ground," she replied, "there are many weeds in that direction which may entangle the line, I would stop him as he seems to be going slow."</p> 
                  <p>But, alas! Pips did not snub him soon enough. The trout had ran not only among some weeds, but also among some old roots of trees, and there wound up the line so that poor Pips could not clear it.</p> 
                  <p>"Gracious heavens!" he exclaimed, trying to turn the reel, "the hook is fast and the trout will break away! What can be done?"</p> 
                  <p>"Wind gently," she replied, "perhaps you may clear it from the weeds, I fear, however, that the trout may have reached some old roots before you attempted to turn him."</p> 
                  <p>Tom turned the little crank, and the line came with a jerk, bringing no trout and baring the hook. "My God!" shouted Pips in deepest agony, "he has escaped, and I fear the hook is gone!"</p> 
                  <p>"No matter, sir, I have other hooks," she replied with an indifference that was perfectly astounding to Pips, considering all the circumstances of the case. A larger trout than he had ever killed, had broken away, which made him sweat at every pore, and yet Fishing <gap/> as calm as a summer's breeze, and set about <gap/> another hook to her line very quietly.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <gap/> have killed him sure, if the weeds or <gap/> else had net entangled the line," said Pips, feeling as if she might possibly doubt his science and skill in the art to which he had been so much devoted from earliest boyhood.</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt of it," she answered, "you managed him like one having experience."</p> 
                  <p>"That trout weighs twenty-five pounds, and I would have given as many dollars to have landed him safely in the boat."</p> 
                  <p>"I think he would not weigh more than half of it," she said, smiling, "a trout when he shows good play, always seems much larger on the end of the line, than he proves to be on the scales. You thought the one I just caught would pull down ten pounds, before I landed him in the canoe, but he will not weigh more than five, if he does that."</p> 
                  <p>"There's some wisdom, Mr. Pips, in what she says," was Jake's remark, and Tom could not well gainsay it, but he still persisted that the trout was a tremendous great one. Sal had now thrown in again, and Tom began to whisk his fly.</p> 
                  <p>"Put a small fish on your hook, sir, and you will get a bite," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"I will try my fly a while longer," he answered, "I have on the same fly old Isaak recommends for trout of this species."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't care if old Jacob recommends it, she said, "live bait is the best now."</p> 
                  <p>At that moment the music of her reel was again heard, and at the same time, Pips had a bite which thrilled through his nerves like a shock of electricity.</p> 
                  <p>"You've got one, and so have I," she said, "now look out for the weeds yonder."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll snub him before he reaches that horrid place," replied Pips, perspiring and holding his rod with trembling hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Think you, sir, he's a large one?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"He feels like it," said Pips, tending his reel very carefully, and looking mighty anxious. Both were now intent upon their sport. She was calm and collected and he trembled in every muscle and fibre of his frame.</p> 
                  <p>"If you could see his tail perhaps you could tell better," she said, laughing quite loud.</p> 
                  <p>A loud laugh at that moment was terrible in the ears of Pips, for he was all the time fearful he might lose his trout, a very solemn consideration with him. Jake Borland also joined in the laugh, because he could not well help it.</p> 
                  <p>"For God's sake, wait until I kill this trout, and then we will all laugh," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"He don't seem to break water, and show his tail at all," said Jake.</p> 
                  <p>"By his motion I think he's a speckled trout," said Sal, winding up her line and safely landing a salmon trout that weighed nine pounds.</p> 
                  <p>"If he is, it's a mighty big one for a speckled trout," replied Pips, "see! now he leads up as gentle as a lamb. I have given him fine play. He comes! Hand me my gaff, Jake. Let us have all things in readiness."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, he's a fine speckled trout," said Sal, looking down through the water," he's a beauty! Be careful, or he may turn when he sees your motions."</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, aye!" responded Pips, seizing the gaff, and dexterously landing a four pound spotted trout in the boat. "O, heavens, he is a beauty, sure enough! That's the largest spotted trout I ever killed, or ever saw killed. Did you ever see a larger one?"</p> 
                  <p>"A quarter larger, at least," she replied, "but it is very seldom I kill one of the kind larger than that. It is a beautiful fish, and you've managed him very adroitly."</p> 
                  <p>"I flatter myself I did," replied Pips, "I have had some experience I can assure you."</p> 
                  <p>He again tried his fly for a long time, but could not raise another trout, while she killed three more. At last he consented to use the same bait she did, and caught one salmon trout that weighed over five pounds. The sun was sinking in the west, and Fishing Sal pulled up her stone anchor and started for home. But the reader may be assured that Mr. Pips accepted an invitation to tarry, that night at her mother's humble lodge, instead of hoisting his own tent which he always carried with him.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE LONELY LODGE-A WILD AND ROMANTIC SPOT IS PAULO'S GRAVE-BRIEF HISTORY OF AN HONEST INDIAN.</head> 
                  <p>On a side-hill, about fifty rods from the place where <unclear>Pips</unclear> and this singular girl killed their trout, stood a small lodge, made of logs and covered with the bark of cedar-trees. It was embosomed among the forest trees, and could scarcely be seen from the lake. Although small, yet it had two apartments or lodging rooms, besides a small place where cooking was done. A beautiful spring of pure cold water issued from the earth some twenty rods above this humble dwelling, and ran in a clear stream over a pebbly bed close by the north-side of it, and mingled its pure waters with those of the lake. There was a well-trodden path on the margin of this little stream quite down to the lake where this daughter of the forest kept her canoe. Save the above path, there were scarcely any other indications that a human habitation was near. True, back of the lodge, on the hill side, many trees had been felled and used for fuel, but the opening was hardly discernable from the lake, or from any point of the compass. The trees about this dwelling were of various kinds and of large growth, but the sugar maple predominated in this locality. From the appearance of the wood, around this habitation, it would seem a studied effort had been made to preserve the forest in its primeval grandeur.</p> 
                  <p>To this abode, thus situated, Pips and his boatman were conducted by the daughter, whose dress was peculiarly neat. She wore upon her head a beautiful hat made from the bark of the white birch; the brim was somewhat broad and the crown handsomely formed-the whole being sustained under her chin with a braided string of several colors. Her feet were covered with skilfully-made moccasins, in true Indian style; her dress was a skirt and a short gown, which reached just below her hips, made from calico, the predominant color of which was green. Her dress nicely fitted her very symmetrical form, and yet gave all her muscles full play. Her hair, which was long, dark, and fine, hung in rich clusters over her elegant neck and shoulders, giving her rather a wild and romantic appearance, and almost inducing one to believe, at the first glance, that she bad in her veins a large share of Indian blood; but, a second look always set that matter at rest. In the form of her features, and the general expression of her countenance, there was not a particle of evidence to show that any of her ancestors belonged to the Aborigines of our country. Pips thought she had the most beautiful face and graceful form he had ever seen; and Pips was no mean judge of female beauty.</p> 
                  <p>"Who can be Sarah's company?" the mother mentally asked, as she sat in the door of her cottage, and had a glimpse of Pips and Jake through the trees, as they were following Sarah along the path upon the margin of the little stream. "There are two men. Yes, I see them now more distinctly. One is Jake Borland, I'm quite certain; the other is a stranger, and a fine looking man. He's a real angler, from his dress, which reminds me of some of the British and American officers, some eighteen years ago. They were fond of angling, and one of them wore a dress quite similar to the gentlemen's. But I will not call such things to memory! Let the past be buried in oblivion, I have no power over it. These forests have hidden me from the world, and here let my thoughts be hidden also. What does the world care about me? and what is the world to me? But it might be something to my daughter. Alas! I sometimes wish she had not grown up so handsome, for her beauty calls to mind the gay circles in which I once moved, and in which she might shine but for this seclusion and solitary life in the forest. How often I think of what would be her fate in case death should remove me from these earthly scenes! And, even should my life be spared, how could we pass the coming winter in these lonely forests, now that our faithful Paulo is dead? What a friend has he been to us! When I think of him now, it seems as if a good Providence raised him up to be our guide and protector! But his aged body lies yonder, and his spirit has gone to Heaven! How sweetly and calmly he fell into the sleep of death! No Christian ever died a more peaceful and happy death. Paulo had a noble soul! But they approach"</p> 
                  <p>Thus communed this mother with her own spirit as her daughter tripped along the path, followed by Pips and Borland. Pips' romantic spirit was wrought up to the highest pitch of excitement. It seemed to him the trees, the lake, and the stream, never looked so beautiful as they did at this time. Every thing wore a charming aspect, and he felt as if he should be willing to live and die in such a place. His beloved city had, in a great degree, lost its charms. Now, the reader must not suppose from all this that Mr. Pips had fallen suddenly in love with Fishing Sal. No, that was not it exactly. Being naturally of a romantic disposition, his spirit was wrought upon by the novelties that surrounded him, and especially by the strange girl who was more than a match for him in his favorite sport.</p> 
                  <p>It is true that the thought occurred to him more than once, that his happiness might be greatly enhanced by living with this girl, and spending his days hunting and fishing with her. She was beautiful-nay, absolutely lovely; and, it is not very strange or unnatural that such thoughts should occupy the romantic mind of Tom Pips. A less romantic genius than he was might have had some such dreams. Sarah possessed great physical charms, and her heart was as pure as the mountain breezes that rippled her beloved lakes, and she was by no means destitute of intellect. True, her mind had not been trained at a boarding-school, nor her manners shaped by any conventional rules of fashionable society, yet her mother had taught her to read and write, and impressed upon her heart many valuable lessons, so that the fishing girl was no fool in conversation. Mrs. Searmont had been a well educated woman, and in her girlhood she was accustomed to polite society, and graced the circles in which she moved with her sparkling wit and her great personal beauty. Even after living so many years a forest life, far away from human society, many traces of her beauty, both mental and physical, were plainly to be seen. Her countenance evidently showed that her heart had not been a stranger to suffering, and yet she often appeared cheerful and happy as though all the past was a sealed book to her. In fact, she at all times endeavored, as much as possible, to keep a portion of her early life out of sight and out of mind. Her daughter knew but little of her mother's life, and when she became inquisitive upon the subject, her mother would adroitly change the conversation and speak of other things. Sarah often inquired why they lived in the forest so far from any human habitations, but she never yet learned from her mother's lips the true reason That was a secret which the mother never communicated to the daughter. One thing, however, Sarah learned, and that was, that she was not born in the lodge where they then lived. The girl was sometimes sorry for this, for she loved the place so well that she wanted it to be her birth-place.</p> 
                  <p>Sarah came running up, and exclaimed-"O, mother, I have caught some nice trout, and the men are bringing them for me."</p> 
                  <p>Pips carried those he caught, together with the largest one Sarah killed, and Borland brought along the remainder. The sun was just hiding his bright disc behind the hill back of the cottage, and the gentle breeze had settled into a dead calm. The lake was as smooth as a mirror, and scarcely a leaf stirred upon the trees. The pale moon was up, but it could as yet be seen but very faintly, for the god of day had not yet gone down. The time, the place, the circumstances, the mother and daughter, all combined to make Mr. Pips feel some very strange emotions-such emotions as he never experienced before.</p> 
                  <p>"True, madam, your daughter has killed some very splendid trout," said Pips, dragging along the string of fish and approaching Mrs. Searsmont Then pointing to his spotted trout, he continued-"Madam, permit me to say I killed this fellow myself. I have never seen so large a trout of the kind. It was great sport. If you permit us to lodge under your roof to-night, I should esteem it a great favor to have him cooked for supper."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly, sir; we never turn any one away who may seek a shelter here," she said. "It is seldom any one visits us now. Your trout shall be cooked, sir, as well as I know how to do it."</p> 
                  <p>"Thanks, madam," answered Pips "We are somewhat<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6823-00000019"/> what weary, and think we shall have occasion to be gratified for such entertainment. I always bring my tent with me on these excursions, so that I can have a good home in the wilderness at any time."</p> 
                  <p>"Then you like a forest life, do you?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Amazingly!" he replied. "Every summer generally finds me in the wood. Ever since I have been strong enough to hold a fishing-rod, I have sought the lakes, rivers, and brooks. I flatter myself that no man can beat me in hunting and fishing, but I confess I have found more than my match in your daughter today."</p> 
                  <p>"She is generally very lucky in such sports," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"I think so, if this day's sport be a fair specimen of her luck," replied Pips. "She's the first woman or man I have ever found a match for me in these sports. But, my dear madam, how happens it that your daughter is so well-skilled in the piscatorial art?" Faith, she must have been born with a fishing-rod in her hand."</p> 
                  <p>"I can assure you, sir, that she was not born with a silver spoon in her mouth," answered the mother, smiling at Pips' remark and anxiety of countenance.</p> 
                  <p>"No; silver spoons are rather scarce here in the wilderness," said Jake. "But, if the tools to eat with are not quite so stylish as you have in the city, I think we can contrive some way to make a good meal of your spotted trout. I'm hungry as a bear this moment."</p> 
                  <p>While the above conversation was going on, the daughter was busily engaged in preparing Pips' favorite trout for supper. He admired the skill and dexterity she manifested in preparing the fish for the frying-pan, and gazed upon all her movements with very peculiar emotions-such emotions as he had not felt for several years.</p> 
                  <p>"Right!" responded Pips, still gazing upon the beautiful lake girl and admiring her dexterity and adroitness in cleansing the trout of those parts which were not esculent. "I'm hungry, too, and long to be feasting on that glorious fish. That he will be admirably cooked, there can be no doubt. See how dexterously the young lady handles the knife. She can dress a fish more skilfully than a Cape Cod man."</p> 
                  <p>"Speak a little lower, if it so please you, sir," said the mother. "My daughter has never heard the voice of flattery in these forests, and I hope she never will."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pips was somewhat surprised at the mother's remark, for he did not feel as if he had told one half the truth. Now Pips was an open-hearted fellow and spoke just as he felt for the moment. And it seemed to him he had not flattered the girl at all.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, my dear madam," replied Pips, "I'm not accustomed to flatter neither man nor woman. I spoke only a fact, and I'm ready to swear to it this blessed moment. There, see! your daughter has already prepared the trout for the frying-pan, and hang me if any live fisherman could have done it more quickly or with greater skill, call it flattery or what you will."</p> 
                  <p>"I only spoke a word in season," answered the mother, smiling. "Men who have been brought up in large cities are sometimes apt to use extravagant language when they do not intend to flatter; but such language falling upon the ears of a forest-bred girl might have the effect which flattery often produces even when it was not intended as such. You will understand me, sir."</p> 
                  <p>"O, certainly, madam, and I fully appreciate your motives," answered Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"It is probable my caution is needless," she said. "I suppose you have a wife and family in the city?"</p> 
                  <p>"No such thing," answered Tom; "I'm a bachelor in every sense of the word."</p> 
                  <p>"Never married?" said the mother. "I'm somewhat astonished to hear that!"</p> 
                  <p>"Why so?" inquired Pips, laughing. "Do I look like a married man, a husband, or a father?"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, sir, I'm not a judge of such matters," she replied. "You're old enough, at any rate."</p> 
                  <p>"Now, madam, how old do you think I am?" asked Pips, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"About thirty-five," she replied, gazing full into his fair, round face, and smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"By George! you flatter me," he said; "I have seen forty summers, madam. I'm not one of those who wish to conceal their age."</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly, sir, I should not have considered you so old by five years at least," she answered; "and when I say so, I do not intend to flatter, for I mean just what I say."</p> 
                  <p>"I believe you, madam," he replied; "people generally guess my age less than it really is."</p> 
                  <p>"I wonder you have not been married," she said. "Did you never love?"</p> 
                  <p>"Let that pass, madam, if you please," replied Pips. "Some other time, perhaps, I may tell you. I believe men generally love once in their lives, but whether they can love a second time is a question I cannot answer from my own experience."</p> 
                  <p>"I understand you, sir, and will not press the matter farther," she said.</p> 
                  <p>The trout was now in the frying-pan, making most delightful music to Pips' ears, and sending forth a most grateful odor. Pips loved the smell of a trout when it was being cooked.</p> 
                  <p>"Next to the music of the reel when I'm killing a trout, the music of the frying-pan is the sweetest I ever heard," said Pips, gazing upon the frying-pan and snuffing the air. "And the odor of a trout is sweeter perfume than ever came from a bed of roses."</p> 
                  <p>"I must say there's no bad smell in a frying trout, especially when one's appetite is keen," said Jake, taking up a hatchet and splitting some wood.</p> 
                  <p>Sarah turned her dark eyes on Pips and smiled as she turned the trout in the frying-pan, and showed him the well-browned side of the fish. Pips scarcely knew which most to admire, the well-done side of the trout, or the lovely <choice>
                        <sic>expressson</sic>
                        <corr>expression</corr>
                     </choice> of the cook's countenance. Both excited most delightful emotions in his heart. Soon a small pine table was placed out in the centre of the room, and covered with a clean, white cloth.</p> 
                  <p>"Take out my flask and some of the hard bread," said Pips, addressing his boatman.</p> 
                  <p>A beautiful flask of brandy and the bread was placed upon the table. Jake also brought some cool water from the spring. Temperance at that time was not so far advanced as it is now.</p> 
                  <p>"A toast!" said Pips, holding up his small metallic tumbler which always accompanied his flask, and looking at Sarah as she was placing the smoking trout upon the table-"Here's to the maiden who cannot only kill but also cook a trout more skilfully than any live man or woman!"</p> 
                  <p>"I agree to that," said Borland, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Wait, sir, until you taste the trout, before you praise the cooking," replied Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"A wise remark, perhaps, on ordinary occasions, but my eyes have witnessed the process and the odor of the fish convinces me that the cooking is most admirably done," said Pips, taking a fork and cleaving off a piece of the trout. "See, how rich the color! Come, madam, draw near, and let us have a glorious meal. And you, my young lady, will sit by my side, and let me help you to the best piece, after I shall have helped your mother."</p> 
                  <p>They all sat down, and a sweeter meal was never. eaten in city or forest. Pips was very attentive to the cook and her mother, and ate most heartily himself. But Jake Borland stowed away in his stomach more than twice as much as any other one could eat. He was a strong, hearty fellow, and the way he took care of a portion of that trout, was a caution to all epicures.</p> 
                  <p>"I did suppose, Jake, when we sat down, that some of the trout might be left for breakfast, but I have no hope now," said Pips, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"I told you I was hungry as a bear," replied Jake. "Besides, I wished to show my approbation of Sal's cooking."</p> 
                  <p>"And, by heavens! you have done it most essentially," answered Pips. "It is fortunate that the trout was not larger, for if it had been, you might have had an apoplectic fit before morning I never saw a man eat so much at one meal."</p> 
                  <p>"Never mind, Mr. Pips, there are more trout in the lake, and she knows how to catch them," said Borland, smiling and pointing to Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"Kill, not catch, you mean," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, kill then, if that suits you better" replied Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"That reminds me of what the officers of the army used to say," said the mother.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Then there were scientific anglers among them, were there?" inquired Pips. "O yes! I now remember, your daughter's reel once belonged to one of them."</p> 
                  <p>"We'll let that pass for the present," said Mrs. Searsmont, in a voice of peculiar accent and tone.</p> 
                  <p>Supper was now over, and the full moon had risen in all her glory, <unclear>strewing</unclear> her bright beams over forest and lake, and bathing the hill-tops with her silver light. The scene was most beautiful, and Mr. Pips never felt better in his life.</p> 
                  <p>"My dear madam," said Pips, "how have you contrived to live in this forest with your daughter through the cold winter?"</p> 
                  <p>"Walk out with me, and I will tell you," she said, rising from the table and leading the way, followed by Pips, while Jake and Sarah remained in the lodge.</p> 
                  <p>She and Pips followed a footpath a short distance sack of the lodge to a grove of sugar-maples that grew upon the side-hill. In that grove was a mound of fresh earth with a few wild flowers growing upon it which were transplanted by the hand of Sarah but a few weeks previous. The spot was most beautiful and romantic The trees were in full foliage, and their green leaves, slightly moistened by the falling dew, glistened in the bright moonbeams, and made the scene most enchanting. Pips had strange emotions, for he knew not the object of the woman. Just as they approached this grove a deer started and bounded away down the hill.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, a deer!" exclaimed Pips; "I had one glimpse of her in that open space yonder."</p> 
                  <p>"We often see the beautiful creatures, but my daughter never kills them except for food," she replied. "But see'st thou that mound of earth?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," he answered; "the grave of thy husband, perhaps. It is a most beautiful spot."</p> 
                  <p>"Not the grave of my husband, but of one who spent many years of his life in caring for me and my daughter," she answered. "That is Paulo's grave, an Indian who lived with and provided for us. A nobler, more honest heart, never beat in white man's bosom. During sixteen years he toiled for me and my daughter, and with our own hands we dug his grave and laid his body in it. Just one month ago he died, and we buried him here; and, if ever mortal had true mourners, Paulo had. He was some ten years older than I am."</p> 
                  <p>"Gracious heavens!" said Pips, in a voice scarcely above a whisper. "Is there Indian blood in thy daughter's veins?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not a single drop," she replied. "Paulo was an honest, virtuous man, as ever lived in forest or city. Although I lived with him so many years, yet he never offered me insult-nay, sir, the thought never entered his heart. My daughter was born before I came to this wild, secluded spot, and but for Paulo I might have perished in the wilderness. I felt at that time as if I never wished to mingle in human society more, but why I so felt I shall not tell thee now. Paulo saw and pitied me, but why, God only knows. It seems to me a good Providence directed that Indian in my path. When I left the settlement and entered the wilderness I expected to die and my child with me. I was desperate, and not in my right mind, perhaps. Paulo offered to lead me back to the white settlements, but I refused to go, and went still farther into the wilderness, bearing my child in my arms. He followed me, and endeavored to persuade me to go back, but I would not, and passed on with an undying energy. I told him I would go where the beat of the drum and the reports of guns could not be heard. He told me he had a lodge some ten miles in the wood, and if I would go there I should be welcome. I gladly accepted his offer. He kindly took my child; and, ere the sun went down on that ever-to-be-remembered day, we were safely in his lodge, which was not far distant from the one we now occupy. He was a lone Indian, having buried his wife several years previous. Children he never had; but, oh! how he doated upon my little girl! Soon she became attached to him as to a father, and that attachment never ceased until his death. If ever a girl had reason to love, honor, and respect a man, my daughter had to love, honor, and respect Paulo. He did every thing in his power to please her while she was yet a child, and after she grew old enough he taught her how to fish and hunt. Before she was eleven years old she had caught hundreds of trout from the lake and shot down several deer. And before he died, she had become a match for him in these sports. Paulo was an excellent marksman, and often has he and Sarah tried their skill, until Paulo cheerfully acknowledged that she could beat him. 'Me grow old now, and no hold gun still as me could once, Cama Hutok,' he would often say, while a smile played over his dark features. He always called her Cuma Hutok, which, in the Indian language means 'leaping fawn.' O, sir, he was a most kind Indian, and treated Sarah with all a father's fondness and affection. After Sarah grew up as you have this day seen her, I never hesitated to let her accompany him wherever he wished to go, for I knew she was safe with him. I should not have dared to trust a white man to such an extent. I hope you will excuse me, sir, for speaking thus plain."</p> 
                  <p>"O, certainly, my dear madam," replied Pips, feeling a deep interest in the woman's story. "Go on with your narrative. I never was so much interested in my life. I could remain on this lonely spot all night, and hear you talk. Paulo was indeed a very wonderful Indian; I could shed a tear over his grave."</p> 
                  <p>"I and my daughter have shed thousands," she replied; "but why should we weep? Paulo has found a better country, and his memory is enshrined in our hearts. Have I not now told thee how we lived in this wilderness through the long winters!"</p> 
                  <p>"You have, but I should like to hear more," he answered. "Tell me why you thus fled from civilization into this wilderness?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not now," she answered. "None but Paulo ever heard me relate the story of my life. Even my daughter is ignorant of it. It is getting late now, and we'll return to the lodge. You must be fatigued, and need rest."</p> 
                  <p>Pips had too much politeness to urge the woman to tell what she did not seem inclined to relate, and they walked down to the lodge. Soon after Pips and his boatman entered a small apartment of the lodge, and sought that rest they so much needed. Although Pips was greatly fatigued, yet several hours elapsed before he could close his eyes in sleep. The story of Paulo, and the bewitching beauty of this daughter of the forest, kept his eyes open and his thoughts employed. He rolled from side to side, and somewhat disturbed Borland; but the boatman was so much fatigued and had such a load of trout upon his stomach, that he fell asleep and snored tremendously long before Pips could close his eyes. Such an evening, and so deeply interesting, Tom Pips never passed in city, town, or forest.</p>

                  <head type="sub">DEER SHOOTING-A VISIT TO PAULO'S GRAVE-ARRIVAL OR SABATTUS, A YOUNG INDIAN-PIPS FEELS STRANGE EMOTIONS.</head> 
                  <p>The morning broke bright and beautiful, and the sharp report of a rifle suddenly brought Pips and his boatman from their lodging room. Immediately after Pips heard the musical voice of Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"I've killed him, mother, and a noble fat buck he is too," said Sarah, standing with the rifle in her hand, and pointing towards the lake.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is he?" shouted Pips, as he came running from the lodge, followed by Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"Yonder he lies in the path," replied Sarah. "He was crossing the path when I fired, and did not leave his tracks, but dropped suddenly down. I think I must have shot him through the heart. O! I love to shoot this rifle, but I would not have killed that back, only I thought you might like some of his meat for breakfast."</p> 
                  <p>"I feel as if I should like a change," said Jake, pressing his hand upon his stomach. "That front laid hard. I believe I ate one small piece too much."</p> 
                  <p>"I thought so, too, for you have snored through the night like thunder," replied Pips. "But, Cumak Huta stand as you are, and let me measure the distance you fired."</p> 
                  <p>"Cumak Huta!" repeated the Leaping Fawn, with a loud ringing laugh that echoed through the wood in distinct tones. "Mother has'nt told you right, or you have forgotten. Cumak Huta! I wonder what good Paulo would say if he could hear that?"</p> 
                  <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6823-00000020"/> 
                  <p>And again she laughed most heartily at the mistake Pips had made.</p> 
                  <p>"Cuma Hutok," said the mother, smiling. "You have put the K upon the wrong word."</p> 
                  <p>"So I have, by George," said Pips. "But, never mind. Stand as you are, and let me pace the distance. It seems to me a long shot."</p> 
                  <p>Pips now approached Sarah, stood a moment in her tracks, and then began to march off in military style, followed by Sarah, her mother, and Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"One-two-three-four-five-six," said Pips, in slow and measured accents, until he reached the dead buck, and numbered one hundred and thirty paces.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, Cuma Hutok, you have made a great shot!" exclaimed Pips. "I always step more than a yard. You fired more than one hundred and forty yards! A great shot. See where the ball entered. You have indeed pierced the heart of the buck! A great shot! Cuma Hutok!'</p> 
                  <p>"I thought I must have hit him in the heart, he fell so suddenly," replied Sarah, standing erect and resting her hands upon the muzzle of her rifle.</p> 
                  <p>"Turn him over, Jake, and let us see if the ball passed through him," said Pips. "I wish I could have had such a chance."</p> 
                  <p>"If you had, it might have been lucky for the buck," said Jake, laughing, and turning over the dead animal. "No ball hole on this side. It reached his heart, and there stopped."</p> 
                  <p>"It went far enough," said Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and true enough," responded Pips, feeling the ribs of the buck. "He's a noble fat one. Such venison as this is worth eating. It is the next thing to trout. Come Jake, we must contrive to carry him off and dress him."</p> 
                  <p>The noble animal was soon lying before the door of the lodge, and Jake commenced dressing him. <choice>

                        <corr>Borland</corr>
                     </choice> was an expert in such business, for he had dressed many a deer before he ever saw Pips, his employe.-The mother now busied herself in cooking the venison, and the steaming meal was soon upon the table. While eating his breakfast, the thought struck Pips that he should be willing to pass the whole season in such a delightful retreat; but whether the beauty of the leaping fawn drove that thought into his mind is a question which Pips himself could not answer at that moment. There were so many things that charmed him on that occasion that he could not tell which had the most power over him.</p> 
                  <p>However, one thing was quite certain: the more he saw of the Leaping Fawn, the more deeply interested he felt. There was a wild beauty about her-a certain expression of her countenance-the motions of her symmetrical form-a something he had never discovered in any other female, which made a deep impression upon his hand, if not upon his heart. Now Tom Pips knew he felt some strange emotions swelling his heart, but he did not suppose these emotions were occasioned by the power of love-a power which he had once felt and which he never expected to feel again. In fact he had settled down into the belief that a man can never truly love but once. Having passed through this ordeal over this rubicon, he was deeply impressed with the conviction that he could not pass again. True, a New York maiden, whose name was Tabitha Spiker, had endeavored to persuade him out of that foolish notion as she called it. Miss Spiker loved him, and it was her second love, too; therefore she could reason upon the subject from actual experience. But more of Miss Spiker in subsequent pages.</p> 
                  <p>There were two subjects that always occupied a prominent place in Tom's mind-yes, more prominent than any others. These were Love and Angling. When Tom was not thinking of Angling, his thoughts were occupied with Love and its operations upon the human heart. Sometimes he would fall asleep, dream of killing trout, wake up in the morning, and mentally discuss the question whether he should ever love another woman or not. His thoughts were about equally divided between love and fishing. Having been left with a handsome estate, vested in houses and stock in the city, the rents and interest of which were amply sufficient to support him, he never troubled his mind much about worldly affairs: that is, he was not anxious to add to his property, and yet he was careful not to encroach upon the principal. He was willing enough to spend his whole income, but he generally had a small surplus left at the end of the year, which he occasion ally devoted to charitable purposes. Mr. Pips was very far from being a religious man, yet he was a moral one, and often did more good with his money than some members of the church. Although inheriting an ample fortune, yet he refrained from those vices which too easily beset many men who live in large cities. In early life he formed a strong attachment to the daughter of a poor widow, and would have married her contrary to the advice and remonstrance of his more aristocratic friends, if the death of the young lady had not occurred. The mother of his first love still lived, and he contributed liberally to her support. In that he exhibited a kind and tender heart Her name was Mrs. Watson, and the name of the daughter was Catharine, a beautiful girl but of slender constitution. She died of consumption, after Pips had been engaged to her for nearly six years. And she was scarcely twenty when she closed her eyes upon all earthly scenes; so that Catharine and Pips began to love each other long before they were out of their teens. She was but fourteen when he became smitten with her charms, and he had not seen twenty summers. If ever man loved truly, sincerely, deeply loved, Tom Pips loved Catharine Watson. Such were some of the pages in his history. Now, for many years he had lived in the memory of Miss Watson, and resisted all temptations, even those which Miss Tabitha Spiker had spread before him, with an energy, a skill, and perseverance, such as can only spring from the passion of pure love. Tabitha had an inexhaustible fund of patience, as well as of love, and she continually hoped and flattered herself that one day she would be victorious in spite of all adverse circumstances which seemed to beset her path. She was five years younger than Tom, and at the time these chronicles commence she was thirty-five years of age-a period in a woman's life when it may be reasonably supposed that love had seen its warmest, brightest days. But not so with this maiden, for her love for Pips seemed to increase with her years. Hers, however, was a second love which she strenuously argued was stronger than a first attachment; and, to convince Mr. Pips of the fact, she diligently plied all her arts. But enough of her for the present.</p> 
                  <p>After breakfast Pips was anxious to visit Paulo's grave again, and invited the mother to accompany him. He would have invited Sarah, but he did not know but such a visit in his company might grieve her heart too much, and therefore he forbore to gratify his own wishes out of tender regard for the Leaping Fawn. The sun had not been up more than an hour when Tom and this singular woman again stood in the grove of maples which overshadowed the good Indian's grave The morning sun threw his bright beams over the forest and the lake, and all nature smiled and wore a most pleasing aspect. Although Tom had not slept much through the night, yet his thoughts were vivid and his spirits lively. Mrs. Searsmont was highly pleased with her guest, and more communicative than usual, still she was not prepared to reveal the secret passages of her life to Pips or any other man, now the good Paulo was dead and slumbered in his grave.</p> 
                  <p>"My dear madam, the Indian who lies buried beneath our feet, was a very singular character," said Tom, "I feel quite a deep interest in his history."</p> 
                  <p>"Not so deep an interest as I and my daughter feel," she replied, "Paulo possessed a noble heart and an honest one in the sight of Heaven. He was a finely formed Indian, too, nearly six feet tall, and as straight as an arrow. Many rich and aristocratic men in your city would be proud of Paulo's form."</p> 
                  <p>"You say he once had a wife," said Pips, "did he never feel disposed to wed another woman?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, no, sir," she replied, "Paulo always said he could never forget his first love and form a second one."</p> 
                  <p>"Then the good Indian was not a believer in second love?" said Pips, looking very anxious and wondering whether the emotions the Leaping Fawn had excited within him, were akin to love. "Now, my dear madam, what is your opinion of second love?"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, sir, I don't know as I'm a proper judge of such matters," she replied, "all I can say is, that I have never loved but once, and surely I'm too old now to form another attachment."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Then you have loved?" he asked, "but why do I thus talk? Of course you loved your husband."</p> 
                  <p>She suddenly started as if something had pricked her to the heart, and gazed upon Pips, but made no reply. He saw that he had touched a tender chord, and wished to make some amends, but how to do so he was at loss to know. Pips was tender hearted, and especially was he sensitive on this occasion, and did not wish to injure the feelings of this singular woman. The pause in the conversation became painful to both, but neither knew how to break it. The woman, however, vindicated the rights of her sex, and broke the painful silence.</p> 
                  <p>"I perceive sir, that you have some curiosity to learn the history of my life, but all I can say now, is, that I am the mother of Sarah, that I have lived in this wilderness many years, away from all human society except my daughter and the Indian over whose grave we now stand, and that I have no desire to leave this spot again to mingle in the follies and gayeties of the world," she said. "Should I die, I hope my body will be buried beside this good Indian's, I seek no better grave. Once I might have trembled at such a thought and my pride would have been alarmed, but I have learned severe lessons and taught to be humble. God would not forsake me if wicked man did."</p> 
                  <p>"I fear thou hast been ill-used by some man," said Pips in a voice of sympathy.</p> 
                  <p>"Question me not upon that subject," she replied, "Heaven has given me space to repent the follies of my earlier years. Men often do wrong, and women sometimes act a foolish part. Love often makes a woman do that which her reason and conscience condemn. I did love, and most wildly too, but I will not call up the past. Long have I struggled to bury it in oblivion, but memory will sometimes call up its scenes however painful it may be."</p> 
                  <p>"You speak of dying," said Pips much affected, "but what would become of your daughter if your body should be laid in the grave?"</p> 
                  <p>"Sir," she replied in a grave manner, and pointing to the clear sky over our heads, "there is a power that has protected me in the solitude of the wilderness, and thinkest thou that the same power will not protect my daughter? Paulo has taught her how to live in the forest, and now he is dead. God may send another Indian to watch and protect her."</p> 
                  <p>Pips began to suspect that the Leaping Fawn might be in love with a young Indian, and that her mother might refer to him in her last remark. The thought, somehow or other, was very unpleasant to him, but why he hardly knew.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you acquainted with other Indians?" he asked, anxiously gazing upon her.</p> 
                  <p>"During my forest life I have seen many," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Is there one you are better acquainted with than with others." he anxiously inquired.</p> 
                  <p>Before the good woman had time to answer his question, Sarah came running along with the fleetness of the deer and said, "O, mother, Sabattus has come with lots of beaver skins!"</p> 
                  <p>Pips was struck to the heart, but why the announcement of a young Indian's arrival should thus shock his nerves he could not tell. Certainly he was not afraid the young Indian would shoot him, and yet Tom Pips trembled.</p> 
                  <p>"Has Sabattus indeed come?" asked the mother, "he has been a long time absent."</p> 
                  <p>"How long?" inquired Pips, feeling some encouragement from the long absence of the Indian, for he thought it strange the Indian could be long away if he loved the daughter.</p> 
                  <p>"Ever since early last fall," replied the mother.</p> 
                  <p>"See, here, mother," said Sarah, holding up a silver coin about the size of a half dollar, with a hole in it, through which passed a string. "Sabattus gave me this. He got it in Montreal, isn't it handsome?"</p> 
                  <p>"A very pretty present," was her mother's reply. "Sabattus is a good hearted fellow. He will be very sorry to hear that Paulo is dead."</p> 
                  <p>"I told him of it and a tear started in his eye," said Sarah, "see, he comes, for I told him good Paulo was buried here."</p> 
                  <p>Pips looked and saw the young Indian slowly walking up the path that led to the grave. Sabattus was a finely formed Indian, and stood as straight as a sapling pine. His black hair was long and hung in heavy clusters down his neck and shoulders. A cap covered his head, upon the front of which was fastened an eagle's head and some feathers of the same noble bird ran up from the top, bending towards his back and forming a segment of a circle. The countenance of Sabattus was stern and his black eyes were as keen and bright as the bird's whose head he wore as an ornament. His age was about twenty-five years, and he came like one whose thoughts were not on trifling subjects. Pips eyed him from cap to mocassons, with a most searching scrutiny. For the first time for many years he felt the spirit of jealousy, or rather, he seemed to feel as if he was gazing upon a rival. And yet he could not reason himself into a belief that he was jealous of the young Indian, especially when he took time to reflect and reason. He had not the most distant idea that he was in love, yet somehow he felt like a man in love. His impulses seemed to tend in that direction, while his reason and judgment told a different story.</p> 
                  <p>Sabattus came slowly up and looked as if he was treading upon hallowed ground. The mother greeted him most cordially. He gave Pips one single glance with his black eyes and then turned them upon the mound of earth that covered the mortal remains of the good Paulo. His face was solemn and immovable, and showed that serious thoughts occupied his soul. Pips gazed upon him with strange emotions.</p> 
                  <p>"Me sorry good Paulo dead!" said Sabattus in broken English, bending down and taking a handful of the earth, then crossing himself, he continued, "priest say we all be like this, one day. Me loved Paulo cause he good to Cuma Hutok and her mother." Pips thought the last remark of Sabattus sounded like love and was uneasy, but he governed his feelings and appeared calm and composed.</p> 
                  <p>"He was indeed good to us," said Sarah, in a voice that told how deeply she deplored the loss of the old Indian.</p> 
                  <p>Jake Borland now came up smoking his pipe and sending columns of tobacco smoke among the green leaves of the sugar maples and scenting the air all around.</p> 
                  <p>"Here's where you buried old Paulo, is it?" asked Borland, "well it is a nice grove of sugar trees, but the old fellow will never tap any more trees. He was a clever Indian and an excellent hunter."</p> 
                  <p>They all gazed upon the speaker as if they felt that he manifested too much coldness and indifference. Even Pips had such impressions. No one made answer, and Sabattus stood over the grave as motionless as a statute.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, by thunder, this is a real quaker meeting," continued Jake, putting his pipe and walking carelessly about as if the world went well enough with him. Then addressing Sabattus, he asked,</p> 
                  <p>"Was the old Indian your father?"</p> 
                  <p>Turning his eyes upon Jake in a fixed gaze, the young Indian replied, "me no son of the good Paulo, but me love him."</p> 
                  <p>"It's no use to love him now, he's dead," said Jake.</p> 
                  <p>"But we shall always remember how much we loved him," said Sarah, gazing upon Jake as if she thought he was hard hearted and cruel.</p> 
                  <p>Now Pips' boatman did not possess a cruel disposition, but he had but little sympathy for a dead or even a live Indian. He liked old Paulo better than he did most Indians, but he had heard too much of Indian cruelty to weep over the grave of one. The truth is, Jake Borland was strongly prejudiced against the Indians, and there was a reason for this prejudice. During the war, his uncle was killed and scalped by these red men of the forest, and he could not forget that circumstance.</p> 
                  <p>"How much more tender is the heart of woman than the heart of man," said Pips, feeling a strong disposition to take sides with the lovely like girl against his boatman, who he thought exhibited too much indifference considering the place where they stood.</p> 
                  <p>"That man's heart would he tender if Paulo had treated his mother so kindly as he has mine," said Sarah, pointing her finger at Borland</p> 
                  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6823-00000021"/> 
                  <p>"If your uncle had been scalped by the Indians, as mine was, you might feel differently," replied Jake.</p> 
                  <p>Young Sabattus gazed upon Jake and felt that he saw an enemy to his race in him, but he showed no nervous excitement although he felt some.</p> 
                  <p>"White man killed my father," said Sabattus.</p> 
                  <p>"And served him right, for your father was fighting for the British against the Americans," replied Jake, "every damned one of them ought to have been shot. They were our enemies and set themselves up as marks to be fired at."</p> 
                  <p>"Come, come, Jake, it's no time or place to speak of such things," said Pips, wishing to put a stop to such remarks, for he saw by the workings of Sabattus' face that the young Indian's hatred towards the pale-faces was fast rising.</p> 
                  <p>"Let him talk much as he please," said Sabattus, "the red man have all these hunting grounds long before pale-faces come over the water, but pale-faces drive away red man."</p> 
                  <p>"I really hope Sabattus, that you and Mr. Borland will end your disputes," said Mrs. Searsmont, "it is unpleasant for me to hear such conversation in a place like this. Forget and forgive, must be the maxim of Indian and white man. Come, we'll go down to the lodge."</p> 
                  <p>The mother now led the way and Pips and Borland followed, and Sabattus and Sarah remained at the grave, much to the chagrin and disappointment of Mr. Pips. He supposed they were following until he instinctively looked back and saw no one but his boat-man.</p> 
                  <p>"Your daughter is not coming, madam," said Pips, a few moments before they reached the lodge.</p> 
                  <p>"No matter," she replied, "Sarah will come down before long. I suppose she wishes to hear Sabattus relate the incidents of the hunting excursion in the northern wilderness, where he has been so long. She loves to hear the Indians tell their hunting stories in their own language."</p> 
                  <p>"Can your daughter speak the Indian language?" asked Pips in much surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, Paulo taught her when she was quite young." she replied, "if he were alive and you could hear Sarah and Paulo talking the Indian tongue, it would highly gratify you. She speaks the language remarkably well. You may hear Sabattus and her talk, many of the words are very musical Sarah likes the language much, and says it has more ideas than words."</p> 
                  <p>"How do you know madam, but this young Indian is making love to your daughter?" asked Pips, in a very grave, solemn manner. He may be doing it this very moment, a cautious mother would not trust them together."</p> 
                  <p>"I had much rather trust my daughter with an Indian than with a white so far as making love is concerned," she replied, "for the Indians are the most chaste and virtuous people in the world."</p> 
                  <p>"But then your daughter may fancy that young Indian!" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, suppose she does?" asked the mother smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"You would not let her become the wife of an Indian, would you?" he inquired, looking very anxious and feeling emotions for which he could give no reason.</p> 
                  <p>"If it was her desire and the Indian was as good as I believe Sabattus is," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think she loves Sabattus now?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"She never has, but how the sight of him after so long an absence, may affect her now, is more than I can tell," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>They had now reached the lodge, and sat down in front of it upon an old pine log which had lain there many years. Pips' position was such that he could not look back towards Paulo's grave, and he very often turned his eyes in that direction. The mother noticed him and so did Jake. The time seemed long to Pips, and he kept up his watching, but no Sarah and Sabattus came.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, Mr. Pips, the morning is wasting," said Borland, "it is now a fine time for trout. A gentle breeze is on the lake, and my opinion is that the fish will bite."</p> 
                  <p>"I think they will," replied Pips, turning his eyes up the path that led to the grave.</p> 
                  <p>"There's a kind of fish in the direction you're looking you would like to hook, eh?" said Borland.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pips frowned, and Jake was fearful that he might have offended him.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me," said the mother laughing, "Mr. Pips in quite old enough to be my daughter's father."</p> 
                  <p>"I only meant that he would like to adopt her as his daughter, take her to the city and show her the fashions," continued Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"I rather think, Jake, you don't know what you did mean," said Pips, again turning his eyes up the path.</p> 
                  <p>"I hear them coming," said the mother, "they are talking very busily."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and of love," thought Pips. But he spoke not his thoughts at that moment.</p> 
                  <p>Sarah and the Indian soon approached. They were talking in the Indian dialect, and seemed to be much interested, for they ceased not their conversation until some time after they reached the lodge. Pips would have given money to have understood what they said, but he could not catch the meaning of a single word, although he strained every nerve to do so. At last Sarah told her mother that she and Sabattus were going a fishing, and asked Pips to accompany them who readily consented. Soon they were on their way to the lake.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE BOAT RACE-TOM PIPS GETS A DUCKING-THE FAIR MAIDEN VICTORIOUS IN THE SPORT.</head> 
                  <p>How like a thing of life an Indian canoe skims over the water! So thought Pips as his boatman was pulling away after the fair maiden's canoe paddled by the well practised hands of Sabattus. Pips did not wish to loose sight of Sarah and her lover.</p> 
                  <p>"Pull away," said Pips. "How like Jehu that canoe glides along! Pull away!"</p> 
                  <p>"No live man can paddle this heavy boat as fast as that Indian can paddle a birch," replied Borland. "Tis'nt among the possibles. If you desire to keep that girl within ear shot, you must request the Indian to slacken his hand."</p> 
                  <p>"I see that this boat is heavy in the water," said Pips, gazing upon the canoe which was now thirty rods ahead of them and feeling emotions which he could neither define nor express. "I have a good mind to hail them."</p> 
                  <p>"Then do so now, or they will soon be beyond earshot," said Borland, smiling at the great impatience Pips manifested. It seems to me squire Pips, that Fishing Sal has hit you in the heart as well as the back. I mean no offence, but somehow you seem flusterated."</p> 
                  <p>"Halloo!" exclaimed Pips; at the top of his voice, raising his hand and making a motion for those ahead to stop.</p> 
                  <p>'Sarah heard the voice of Pips and saw his motion. She guessed what it all meant.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold up," said Sarah to the Indian whose paddle immediately rose from the water and rested in his hand. "They wish to come up with us. We'll net run away from them."</p> 
                  <p>Now Sabattus had paddled with an uncommon energy, for he secretly wished not to be in the company of Pips and Borland. The latter he disliked and the former did not please him under the then existing circumstances. Sabattus had a sort of instinctive impression that Pips was delighted with Sarah's beauty, yet he concealed that impression from the maiden, and instantly yielded to her wish to stop the canoe. Pip's boat soon came alongside.</p> 
                  <p>"My canoe beats yours," said Sarah laughing and winking at Sabattus.</p> 
                  <p>Pips saw that wink and to him it was full of meaning. Although it was simple, playful, and meant nothing; yet, Tom construed it into the language of love and ardently desired that the wink had been for him and not for the Indian. He had always laughed at the spirit of jealousy, at least, ever since the death of Catherine Watson, and even ridiculed it; but now he began to be conscious of feeling a small touch of it himself, and wondered what the loving Tabitha Spiker would say if she could know what peculiar emotions were pressing his heart.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Indeed it does, Cuma Hutak," replied Pips, who delighted to call Sarah by that name.</p> 
                  <p>"Sabattus knows how to make a canoe dance over the waters," she said, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>A faint smile played for a moment on the dark features of the young Indian like a gleam of sunshine, and then his countenance became as sober as a gravestone.</p> 
                  <p>"Any body can paddle a birch canoe much faster than he could such a boat as this," said Borland, feeling as if she was giving a gentle fling at him, and frowning upon Sabattus.</p> 
                  <p>"O, certainly," replied Sarah. "My canoe is'nt half so heavy as yours. We did'nt intend to run away from you, for we'll fish together and then see who beats."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, it's easy enough to tell who'll beat," said Pips, smiling most sweetly, and wishing he occupied the place of Sabattus. The truth is, the thought had struck him that he would ask Sabattus to exchange places with him. Pips had some experience in paddling a canoe, and therefore his request may not seem so ungallant, for his purpose was to paddle himself and not suffer the maiden to do so.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you think to beat," said Sarah. "Perhaps you will, for you've got a beautiful rod and fine hooks."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, Cuma Hutok," he replied in a hurried manner. "You will kill the most trout for I had a fair specimen of your skill yesterday."</p> 
                  <p>The boats had now come together, so that their sides touched, and Pips instinctively took hold of the birch and held on as if he did not wish to part with the frail craft. The eyes of Sabattus were on the hand of Pips, as much as to say "I wish you would let go your hold."</p> 
                  <p>"Morning best time to kill cm trout," said Sabattus. "We go along. Good way through narrows to upper lake. Cuma Hutok wish to go there."</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, we'll go through the narrows to the upper lake," said Sarah. "The trout are very large in that lake."</p> 
                  <p>Pips still held the canoe and debating in his own mind whether it would be prudent or right to ask the Indian to exchange places with him or not. His mental struggle was quite a severe one, considering how small the matter was. At last his desire overcame his scruples.</p> 
                  <p>"I should admire to go to the upper lake," said Pips. "And I love dearly to paddle a birch canoe. Perhaps you will be willing to swap places with me."</p> 
                  <p>Sabattus first gazed on Pips and then on Sarah as if he did not understand fully what Tom Pips meant.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps he does not understand me," continued Pips.</p> 
                  <p>A few words of Indian language now passed between her and Sabattus which Pips in his solicitude construed into many meanings.</p> 
                  <p>"O Sabattus understands, but he's afraid you'll tip me over into the lake," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"No fear of that, Cuma Hutok," said Pips. "I have paddled a birch many times in the course of my life and profess to understand the art."</p> 
                  <p>"Although Borland did not like Sabattus nor any other Indian, yet he had no particular objections to the change Pips proposed, for they were going several miles and Sabattus could help him paddle his boat.</p> 
                  <p>"Me let him paddle then," said Sabattus, rising up and stepping into Borland's boat.</p> 
                  <p>Pips carefully placed himself into the birch and seized the beautifully wrought paddle. Sabattus remained silent and sullen, and took up a spare paddle that laid in Jake's boat and plunged the blade into the water with a strong arm.</p> 
                  <p>Pips pulled away with all his skill and might and the canoe went ahead finely.</p> 
                  <p>"You make it go finely," said Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"I told you I understood it," replied Pips, still accelerating the speed of the birch that there may be no remaining doubt of his skill.</p> 
                  <p>The birch shot ahead of the boat and glided like a duck over the rippled water.</p> 
                  <p>"A most beautiful canoe," said Pips, while the sweat began to steal down his forehead.</p> 
                  <p>He had two objects in view in thus exerting himself with his paddle. First, to get away from the other boat and talk with Sarah and not be overheard-second, to show her his skill in paddling an Indian canoe.</p> 
                  <p>He was very anxious to ingratiate himself into her good graces, more so than he had been for years to impress the heart of any young lady. Some how or other Tom Pips felt exceedingly happy, but he could not help thinking what Miss Spiker would say if she could see him in such a situation.</p> 
                  <p>"He paddle well for pale face, but me can beat him," said Sabattus, plying his paddle with great skill and force.</p> 
                  <p>"I think we can," answered Jake. Let us give him a try, for he feels big enough now he has Sarah for a companion. I believe he has fallen in love with the girl without ifs or ands."</p> 
                  <p>The young Indian cast one look on Jake, another on Pips and his lovely companion, and then pushed the boat ahead with almost superhuman strength.</p> 
                  <p>"Go it," said Borland, exerting himself to the utmost. "Now she skims it! We gain upon them at every stroke.</p> 
                  <p>Pips saw the game and redoubled his energies Sarah understood it too, and fully enjoyed the sport The sweat ran in streams down the checks of Pip's.</p> 
                  <p>"They gain upon us," said Sarah. "I wish <unclear>there</unclear> was another paddle-see how finely Sabattus handle his paddle! He's very strong and understands it."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think Cuma Hutok, he could paddle the canoe faster than I now do?" asked Pips, feeling as if he did not wish to have any praise bestowed upon the Indian by the fair maiden unless he came in for an equal share at least.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, I cannot say," she replied. "You make the canoe go very fast."</p> 
                  <p>She was too cunning to offend Pips, but she knew very well that Sabattus could beat him at such exercise.</p> 
                  <p>"I think the canoe does skim over the water like a duck," said Pips, still exerting every muscle and perspiring at every pore. "But two against one is great odds. Besides, Jake Borland is strong as a moose."</p> 
                  <p>"Not so strong as Sabattus," replied Sarah. "See how every stroke of his paddle makes the boat jump ahead.</p> 
                  <p>"Pips began to despair. Still he kept his paddle going with all his might and skill, hoping that they would become fatigued, or slacken their speed from some other cause. He did not like to be beaten, especially in presence of the Leaping Fawn. The nose of the boat was now close to the stern of the canoe, and Pips in his desperate struggle to keep ahead smashed the handle of the beautiful paddle.</p> 
                  <p>Sabattus faintly smiled and the boat shot ahead of the canoe.</p> 
                  <p>"Gracious heavens!" exclaimed Pips, gazing upon the broken handle and feeling the keenest anguish. "I have broken this beautiful paddle."</p> 
                  <p>"More strength than skill!" shouted Borland, laughing and backing water.</p> 
                  <p>"Never mind," said Sarah. "Perhaps Sabattus will make me another."</p> 
                  <p>"Did he make this?" anxiously inquired Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"He did, more than a year ago," she answered. "He understands such work."</p> 
                  <p>"He did not make this canoe, did he?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Good Paulo made it," she replied, in a voice that told how much she revered the memory of the good old Indian.</p> 
                  <p>The boats had now come together again, and Pips was breathing very hard, and wiping the sweat from his face.</p> 
                  <p>"Rather sweating work, squire," said Jake. "We were a trifle too much for you, heavy as our boat is."</p> 
                  <p>"The paddle broke!" replied Pips, in a voice of trembling.</p> 
                  <p>"Not before the nose of our boat was about to kiss the stern of the canoe," said Jake, "Come squire. acknowledge beat and say no more about it."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, have it your own way, but I regret that I have broken this paddle," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Me make another," said Sabattus. "Me make it in a day."</p> 
                  <p>I thank you kindly," said Sarah. "We are now close to the narrows. You must let Mr. Pips have one of your paddles."</p> 
                  <p>Sabattus gave him the one he was using and received<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6823-00000022"/> ceived the broken one. It was not long, however, before he lashed up the broken handle so that he could use it. Pips was sorry for that, for he hoped he should be able to paddle away from them. They entered the narrows and kept along side and side. Pips was much fatigued, but he hated to give up his place and paddled slowly along. The scene was wild and romantic. The stream was quite wide and deep in many places, and the shores were lined with a dense forest. Occasionally a fallen tree would project out into the water and piles of drift-wood be seen upon shore. Pips endeavored to make himself very agreeable to his companion, fatigued as he was with the exercise of paddling. Sarah began to bait her hook as they neared a pile of drift wood that filled up nearly half the stream.</p> 
                  <p>"You going to try the trout?" asked Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"A moment by those old logs." she replied. "I have killed many a trout there. Let the canoe rest and I'll throw in.</p> 
                  <p>Pips stuck his paddle into the muddy bottom near the shore, and held the canoe. The others did the same and watched the movements of Fishing Sal. She threw in, and but a moment passed before she booked a fine spotted trout whose weight was nearly four pounds.</p> 
                  <p>"Heavens, how quick he took hold!" exclaimed Pips letting go his hold on the paddle, and leaving it sticking in the mud, while the wind and the current bore the canoe out into the stream, and some distance from the paddle before Pips was aware of the accident, so anxious was he to see Sarah kill the trout.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't let him go away," he said. "He's a very large one. My heavens, see him leap from the water! That's rare sport indeed! Dear me, the canoe is drifting away, and I have left the paddle in the mud!"</p> 
                  <p>Sabattus smiled, and Borland's loud laugh echoed through the wood, and Pips kept his eyes steadily fixed upon the line, fully determined not to loose a single view of the working of the hooked trout.</p> 
                  <p>"He plays beautifully!" exclaimed Pips. "Huzzah! he leaps again from the water and shows his bright spotted sides! A six pounder at least! Don't snub him too quick! Now he runs gloriously! He means to die game at any rate! Grace! what sport!"</p> 
                  <p>"I think he's hooked fast enough," she said, turning her reel and leading the fish towards the receding canoe. "He comes quietly now, but he did struggle hard for his life for awhile."</p> 
                  <p>"That he did," replied Pips. "Ah, you've turned him nicely. I think he will not turn again, but you must look out for him."</p> 
                  <p>"Your caution, squire, is good, but needless," said Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"Me think so too," said Sabattus. "Cuma Hutok know how to catch 'em trout."</p> 
                  <p>Sarah soon safely landed the fish and Pips weighed him with his small steelyards, a thing he always did when he or any other person caught a trout. He was always anxious to know the exact weight of every trout his eyes beheld. The habit had become almost a passion with him, and notwithstanding his great practice, still be always over estimated the weight of trouts, especially if he killed them himself.</p> 
                  <p>"He falls a very little short of four pounds," said Pips. "I thought he was larger; but he's a noble fellow for a spotted one."</p> 
                  <p>"Trouts generally look large to you, especially if they are upon your book," said Borland.</p> 
                  <p>They now passed along up the narrows. Sarah insisted upon paddling awhile and giving Pips a little rest, which she thought he needed, but he refused for some time, out of the spirit of gallantry, of which he possessed a good share, and at last yielded with a becoming grace, when she took the paddle, and they glided smoothly along through the narrows. Pips was a good judge of female beauty, and he felt as if he had it before him in all its perfection. The very motion of her arms, as she paddled along the canal, contained much poetry for him. Every movement was free, natural, and exceedingly graceful. It must be confessed that the sensitive Pips was in a dangerous position. Yet he felt quite secure, and rested with conscious safety upon his favorite theory, that he could never love a second time. Sabattus was careful to ply the mended paddle in such a manner as to keep the boat quite near the canoe. He and Borland were somewhat silent, for they were not good friends. Their hearts were full of prejudices against each other's race, and the canker worm of jealousy was gnawing at their vitals. Borland used his paddle very sparingly, being quite willing to seek his own ease, and let Sabattus do the work. Jake was a shirk whenever he had an opportunity to be one.</p> 
                  <p>"This is a wild and romantic stream," said Pips, gazing upon the symmetrical form and graceful motions of Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"I love such scenes," she replied. "Every tree, old log, stump, and pile of drift-wood, seems familiar to me, for I have seen them almost every day, through the summer seasons, since I was a little girl."</p> 
                  <p>"I, too, love such scenes much better than I do the noise and confusion of cities," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"I have heard mother speak of the cities," replied Sarah, "but I never saw any places but these, since I can remember."</p> 
                  <p>"Would you like to visit the cities?" asked Pips. "They would afford you many novel sights."</p> 
                  <p>"Mother has asked me the same question," said Sarah; "but I can't tell whether I should or not. I should not like to leave these beautiful lakes, my canoe, and fishing-rod."</p> 
                  <p>"But you could return to them occasionally in the summer season," he returned, beginning to feel as if he would like to take her to his own city.</p> 
                  <p>"O, see yonder!" she exclaimed; "a beautiful deer is in the water, swimming across the narrows!"</p> 
                  <p>Just as Pips turned his eyes in the direction she pointed her paddle, a doe rose from the water upon the shore. A moment more, and a sharp report of Sabattus' rifle pierced the ears of Pips. The animal made one bound and fell among the thick elders.</p> 
                  <p>"Me kill him," said Sabattus, paddling away for the spot where the deer landed.</p> 
                  <p>"Sabattus is death with a rifle," said Sarah, pulling away after the boat.</p> 
                  <p>"I must say the work was quickly done," were the words of Pips.</p> 
                  <p>Soon they reached the spot, and the doe was found quite dead, about two rods from the water's edge. The young Indian's countenance did not change at his good luck, and yet he felt a secret pride and satisfaction with the performance of the feat. Pips wished he had made such a shot, and the fair maiden extolled it very highly. Sabattus hung up the doe upon the limb of a tree, and they passed on. Soon the upper lake appeared, and Pips was all life and animation. Having reached the head of the narrows, which was the outlet of the upper lake, Sarah began to prepare her fishing apparatus, and so did all, except Borland. As good luck would have it, Sabattus caught the first trout, which was a very large one. Now came Pips' turn, and he hooked one before Sarah did, and it was quite as large as the one the Indian killed. Tom was all excitement; and, as he played the fish, big drops of sweat stood upon his brow, and his heart beat quick. It seemed to him that it was the largest trout ever killed in those waters.</p> 
                  <p>"It is a monstrous big trout," exclaimed Pips, as the fish exhibited his dorsal fin above the surface of the water and splashed it with his broad tail.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course it is," replied Borland. "Be careful or you will lose him."</p> 
                  <p>"Never fear me," said Pips; "Ive killed trout before to-day."</p> 
                  <p>At that moment the trout leaped from the water and made a desperate struggle to tear himself from the hook. The sight of his bright sides, the fear he might break away, or some other thing, excited Pips so much that he lost his balance, and the canoe slipped away from under him, and down he went into the lake.</p> 
                  <p>"Be not frightened!" exclaimed Sarah, seizing his fishing-rod, which he had dropped, and reaching him the paddle.</p> 
                  <p>"Me save him," said Sabattus. "You save the trout."</p> 
                  <p>Tom was a good swimmer, but he was so frightened that he lost his skill and sank before he could seize the paddle Sarah held out to him. In a moment Sabattus paddled the boat to the spot where he sank, and caught him by the collar of his hunting-coat as he rose</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Sabattus will save him!" exclaimed Sarah, while the trout was running and making music with the reel.</p> 
                  <p>She managed the trout, and Sabattus took care of Pips, hauling him up so that his arms rested on the boat and kept him up. Soon as Tom had blown <choice>
                        <sic>the the</sic>
                        <corr>the</corr>
                     </choice> water from his mouth and nose, he asked, "Has the trout broke away?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, no; he's well hooked, and plays beautifully," replied Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"Help me into the boat, and give me my fishing-rod," said Pips, raising himself up, and almost capsizing the boat.</p> 
                  <p>Sabattus now assisted Pips, while Jake steadied the boat, and Mr. Pips was soon safe. Sarah handed him his rod, and he began to reel up the trout, regardless of the ducking he had received. Pips, after the exhibition of much skill and the display of no little science, secured the fish, weighed him, and carefully laid him on the bottom of the boat, before he even thought of the danger he had escaped, or returning his thanks to Sabattus for rescuing him from a watery grave.</p> 
                  <p>"Strange my philosophy was so upset that I couldn't swim," said Pips, "I thank you kindly for assisting me. I think I could have swam when my head broke water. I kicked the muddy bottom, and then my senses seemed to return to me."</p> 
                  <p>"I concluded you plunged in after the trout," said Jake, laughing. "Birch canoes are ticklish things."</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt about that," replied Pips, taking off his coat and wringing out the water.</p> 
                  <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Sarah, "I've hooked a big trout now! He's a heavy one!"</p> 
                  <p>Tom's eyes were strained almost out of his head, as he heard the whizzing of the reel. In due time she tamed the fish and safely landed him. Tom's steelyards told the story, that Sarah's trout was just as heavy as both the others.</p> 
                  <p>They sported until quite late in the afternoon, and then returned to the ledge. Sarah came off victorious, for she had killed more than all the others, and Sabattus beat Pips. That night Pips had some strange dreams.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE PECULIAR EMOTIONS OF PIPS-HIS JEALOUSY OF SABATTUS-THE TRIAL OF SKILL WITH THE RIFLES.</head> 
                  <p>Another morning came, but Pips did not rise so early as usual, for his sleep had been greatly troubled by dreams, the subjects of which were trout; the fair, lake maiden; Paulo, the dead Indian; Sabattus, the live one; and last, though not least, Miss Tabitha Spiker. These various subjects flitted through his mind in strange contusion. The more he saw Sarah Searsmont, and examined her wonderfully symmetrical form, and the heavenly expression of her face, the more Miss Spiker seemed to occupy his thoughts. While examining the beauty of Cuma Hutok, as he now loved to call her, he never failed to compare it in every particular with that of Tabitha, who had, by continued working, wore a place into his heart. As he awoke late in the morning with his dreams fresh in his memory, the following thoughts ran through his mind, which he imperfectly muttered with his lips:</p> 
                  <p>"This Cuma Hutok is a wonderful girl, considering her wild and secluded life. What a finely shaped head she has! It is much rounder than Miss Spiker's, and her eyes are much more dark and expressive. Tabitha is rather too tall and slim, while Sarah is just tall enough and big enough in every respect. Miss Spiker's motions are somewhat measured, formal, and stiff; Cuma Hutok's free, easy, and graceful; Miss Spiker's arms and other limbs are too long, and her hair isn't so dark and thrifty as this girl's. O, no I must not pursue these comparisons, for they make Miss Spiker look really more ugly than she is. Miss Spiker loves me, and that perhaps is more than any other woman ever will do! Surely I have no evidence that Cuma Hutok loves me. Perhaps she loves Sabattus. And yet it seems to me she can never give her heart to an Indian! Besides, I can't believe her mother would willingly consent to such an union. I don't know how it is, but I have never seen a girl since the death of my own, my beloved Catharine Watson, whose beauty seems so perfect. And how she loves these wild sports! But the sun is up, and I must be up too."</p> 
                  <p>Pips rose partially up, and gazed around the limited sleeping apartment. Borland was awake, and had been listening to Pips, and trying to catch some ideas from his half uttered sentences.</p> 
                  <p>"Squire Pips, did you know that you talk in your sleep?" asked Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"No," was the reply of Pips. "I can't think I do. am not given to such a habit-at least, I have never been told so by those who have slept in tents and rooms with me."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! that was before you saw the charming lake girl," said Borland, rising up and rubbing his eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you think of this girl?" inquired Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Think?" repeated Borland; "think! Why I think she's a most beautiful wild flower. She has grown handsome within two or three years. Squire, how happy you and she might be sleeping together under your nice tent, after a good day's fishing!"</p> 
                  <p>"Don't speak of that, Borland," replied Pips, while all his dreams came fresh into his memory.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you think enough about it without talking," said Borland. "I think I heard that Indian and Fishing Sal jabbering away an hour ago, outside. From the sound of their voices, they appeared to be going somewhere."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think so?" asked Pips, springing from his couch and dressing himself.</p> 
                  <p>Borland yawned, scratched his head, laughed, and rose up and put on his clothes.</p> 
                  <p>Pips soon sought the mother, who was busily engaged in preparing breakfast for her guests, for she and the others had partaken their morning meal.</p> 
                  <p>"Good morning, madam," said he, gazing round after the lovely daughter. "I believe my boatman and I have overslept ourselves this morning."</p> 
                  <p>"You were fatigued, I suppose, yesterday, but I shall soon have some trout cooked," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you-but where's your daughter this morning?" asked Pips, feeling that the absence of Sarah was rather grievous.</p> 
                  <p>"She and Sabattus have gone to visit Paulo's grave," she replied. "They love to go there and speak of the good Paulo's virtues."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't they talk of other things, madam, think you?" he anxiously enquired.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, sir, I cannot say," she replied, beginning to think seriously that the portly, good-looking bachelor was somewhat smitten with her daughter's charms She had satisfied herself that he was rich, and possessed good moral principles-and the reader will not be surprised if he be told that this mother had not lost all her ambition, especially so far as her daughter was concerned. Now that Paulo was dead, she began to feel as if a change in her life might be made for the better. Although she revered the memory of Paulo, and highly respected Sabattus, yet she thought too much of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">caste</foreign> to consent willingly to her daughter's marriage with an Indian. She very well knew that the young Indian loved Sarah, and even dared to hope secretly that he might marry her. But such love and such a hope were secrets in his own breast, for he had never divulged them to mortal ears, not even to mother or daughter. And the thought had never entered the innocent and unsuspecting heart of the fair maiden. The mother had never mentioned the subject, and hoped Sarah had not thought of it. True, after Paulo's death, Mrs. Searsmont did not see how she could pass through the approaching winter, unless Sabattus did return and live with them. And, sometimes, in her more desponding moments, the thought of her daughter's becoming the wife of an Indian did not so much alarm her as it did at other times; but, on the whole, her pride of blood could not consent to such an arrangement of her domestic affairs.</p> 
                  <p>Pips was silent for a few moments because he hardly knew what to say. She watched the workings of his face, and tried to read his inmost thoughts. Now, she was a shrewd woman, and was well versed in the science of human nature, but she could not satisfy herself of the state of Tom's feelings. And this is not to be wondered at, for Tom, himself, could not define them in fact, he didn't know how he did feel, and couldn't persuade himself that he was in love with this forest-bred<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6823-00000023"/> bred girl, and yet he sometimes thought such a thing might be possible.</p> 
                  <p>"You don't suppose, sir, that my daughter would really become the wife of an Indian, do you?" she continued, after a lapse of some moments in silence.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, madam, I cannot say," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, you have repeated my answer to you, and paid me well," she said, smiling. "I may have given you some reason to suppose that I would consent to my daughter's marrying one of the sons of the forest-but, seriously, I do not think of it."</p> 
                  <p>"And suppose your daughter falls in love with Sabattus, what could you then do?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't think she ever dreamed of such a thing," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Young girls often have dreams which they never communicate to their mothers. The young lady who loved me did so long before her good mother knew it. Ah, my dear madam, that was a pure, a sincere affection, such an one as Heaven approved."</p> 
                  <p>"And you loved her in return, I suppose," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed I did, he replied. "Loved her as deeply, as sincerely, as ever woman was loved. And how can I ever love again.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you never can unless the right object should be presented," she replied "I respect that love which long remembers its object."</p> 
                  <p>"I think you have experience in such matters," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Alas, too much experience!" she answered. "But let that pass. It is sometimes painful to remember even him or her whom we have loved. Excuse me. If I spend my time in talking, you will have a late breakfast."</p> 
                  <p>While the mother and Pips were thus conversing, the daughter and Sabattus were standing over the grave of Paulo. The young Indian thought much of Paulo, but other thoughts were occupying his mind on this occasion. He sometimes even dared to hope that the fair maiden might love him: at any rate, he was anxious to know whether she did or not, but how to find out was the great question in his mind.</p> 
                  <p>"O, I can hardly realize the fact that the good Paulo sleeps beneath these wild flowers I planted on his grave!" she said. "I wish I could hear him speak once more."</p> 
                  <p>"You'll not hear him again on these hunting grounds but you may when you go up to the Great Spirit," replied Sabattus in the Indian tongue, the same in which she spoke.</p> 
                  <p>She was silent and thoughtful, but he broke the silence, for his heart was full.</p> 
                  <p>"The cold winter is coming, and the good Paulo is dead!" he continued. "And how can you and your mother live alone?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have often thought of that," she replied. "We shall miss him more then than we do now, if possible. Shall you go north to hunt next winter?"</p> 
                  <p>"And leave Cuma Hutok and her mother alone?" he asked. "Who will cut down the trees and keep them warm?"</p> 
                  <p>"Then you will live with us, will you, good Sabattus?" she asked, in the innocence of her heart.</p> 
                  <p>"If Cuma Hutok and her mother desire it," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"O, we should like it," she said, not dreaming of love which so agitated his heart.</p> 
                  <p>She imagined that Sabattus could live with them in the same manner in which Paulo had until his death. He was not fully satisfied how she understood him, but he had not the courage to question her farther upon the subject at that time. He hoped all was or would be right. Soon after, they returned to the lodge. Pips had just finished his breakfast, and walked out as they approached. She bid Pips good morning and ran into the lodge. He immediately followed her in season to hear what she said to her mother.</p> 
                  <p>"O, mother, Sabattus says he will live with us the coming winter," said Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"Hush daughter," said her mother, fearing Sabattus might have told his love</p> 
                  <p>The good girl was surprised at her mother's remark, and know not what to make of it. And Pips was quite agitated, but he couldn't divine the cause of his agitation. He was not yet prepared to believe that he felt the power of second love although he was satisfied that some peculiar sensations were excited in his heart, such as he had not experienced for many years</p> 
                  <p>"Can this be love?" he would often ask himself, and as often endeavor to convince himself that the flame of love could not be again kindled in his heart.</p> 
                  <p>There was quite a pause in the conversation which was painful to all, and especially so to Pips. The word "hush" which the mother had repeated to Sarah kept ringing in his cars and he could not divine its meaning, as thus spoken. He was just in that state of mind when a small word like that, thus used would suggest many ideas, some of which, if not all, must necessarily be quite erroneous.</p> 
                  <p>"You were saying something to your daughter, as I came in," said Pips, enduring the silence as long as he could, conveniently, and wishing to say something to break it.</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, but nothing of any consequence, nothing that would interest you," she replied. "Sarah's tongue sometimes runs at random and I was checking her, that's all."</p> 
                  <p>"I thought she was speaking of Sabattus," he said still feeling anxious to know why she used that monosyllable.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I was speaking of him," said Sarah. "Sabattus is a good Indian."</p> 
                  <p>"I think he is, but then you are too handsome to associate with him," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, don't you think Sabattus is a very handsome Indian?" asked Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"For an Indian, he looks pretty well," he answered.</p> 
                  <p>"Indians are as good as anybody-at least some of them are," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, come, daughter, you are talking rather too fast," said her mother, beginning to fear that Sarah might say something not so agreeable to hear at that time, for every moment her suspicion that Pips fancied her daughter, was gaining strength.</p> 
                  <p>"I love to hear her talk," he said, hoping she would explain all.</p> 
                  <p>"Not so well as you love to see me hook the great trout do you," she asked.</p> 
                  <p>Borland now made his appearance and interrupted the conversation by proposing a shooting match. Pips prided himself on his skill in using the rifle.</p> 
                  <p>"O, I should be delighted to fire at a mark!" exclaimed Sarah. And so would Sabattus. But I suppose he would beat us."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps not," said her mother. "Squire Pips has a beautiful rifle and no doubt, knows how to use it too."</p> 
                  <p>"I think I can shoot better than I could last summer when Sabattus beat me," said Sarah. "Come, let us go and see who can hit best."</p> 
                  <p>She took down her rifle and led the way, followed closely by Pips. Sabattus was sitting upon a log and communing with his own thoughts.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, Sabattus, we are going to fire at a mark, and you must join us," said the animated girl. "I intend to beat you this time."</p> 
                  <p>The Indian first gazed upon her, and then carefully examined Tom's rifle. He was determined, if possible, to conquer Pips in the proposed game. He had more than one object in view in so doing. To be beaten by Pips at that particular time would have mortified him exceedingly. Pips had the most beautiful and costly rifle, but Sabattus was generally sure of his game with his. Sarah's was smaller than either; but a very fine gun. Borland was anxious to see the sport, and measured off the ground along the traveled path. One hundred paces was the distance agreed upon, but Borland stepped a little more than a yard, therefore, the distance was about one hundred and ten yards. He spotted a large maple about four feet from the roots, and then drew a circle on it with the end of a burnt stick. Within the centre of this circle, which was six inches in <choice>
                        <sic>diamater</sic>
                        <corr>diameter</corr>
                     </choice>, he made a black round spot about as large as a silver dollar. The tree was white where he severed off the bark and wood, so that the black circle and centre spot showed very plain.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me be the manager of this sport," said Borland, when he returned from marking the tree. "I will see that there is fair play. You must all fire three times each."</p> 
                  <p>This was assented to by Sarah and the others. Sabattus looked grave and charged his rifle very carefully. Pips was somewhat agitated, for he was anxious to beat the Indian. He was perfectly willing to be beaten by Sarah, provided he could beat Sabattus. The mother was present, and stood near Sarah and cautioned her to be careful and not be in a hurry. She was anxious to have her daughter come off victorious for a good many reasons that might be named.</p> 
                  <p>"Sarah's the youngest, and must fire first," said Borland. "Then Sabattus, and last the squire. Remember now three shots apiece"</p> 
                  <p>Sarah stood erect grasping the barrel of her rifle about a foot from the muzzle with her right, while her left hand dropped by her side. The butt of her rifle rested upon the ground. Pips thought he never saw her when she looked so beautiful. Her hair hung in dark clusters over her neck and shoulders, her cheeks were somewhat flushed with the excitement of the occasion, and her eyes sparkled like diamonds. She was indeed beautiful. No wonder the bachelor's heart was quickened in its pulsations by such beauty. He would first gaze upon her and then upon the distant mark on the maple tree, while the young Indian stood erect and motionless as a statue. Occasionally he would turn his eyes upon Sarah for a moment and look away towards the mark as if he would measure the exact distance.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, young woman, now we are ready to hear the report of your rifle," said Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"Fix your bright eye steadily on the centre spot, and bore a hole right through it."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall do better than I expect, if I place a bullet within the circle," she replied, gracefully raising her rifle to her face and then dropping it again.</p> 
                  <p>"Could you see the mark along the barrel of your piece?" asked Borland.</p> 
                  <p>"I think so," she calmly replied, again raising her rifle and firing.</p> 
                  <p>The instant the gun went off she and Borland started for the tree. The race was an exciting one, but she got before him in the path and kept the lead, much to the gratification of Pips and the rest of them, especially of her mother who gazed after them with an interest a mother alone can feel.</p> 
                  <p>"I have hit near the centre!" exclaimed Sarah in a loud ringing voice that echoed through the wood. "See, the width of my two fingers nearer would have carried the ball directly into the centre!"</p> 
                  <p>"A capital shot!" said Borland. "I think it will not be beat the first time."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know," she replied. "Sabattus has a true eye and a steady nerve."</p> 
                  <p>They marked the bullet hole and returned with the news. Sabattus was calm as a clock, and felt along the barrel of his rifle as if he were coaxing it to do its duty most thoroughly. Pips watched every movement of the Indian most narrowly. At last Borland gave the word. Quick as thought, the bullet sped and struck within half an inch of Sarah's, but hardly so near the centre spot. Sarah and Borland again ran to the tree, while Sabattus stood erect and motionless as the body of a pine. Sarah returned and reported she had beaten by half the width of her thumb nail. A faint smile passed over the Indian's face, and Borland came back and told Pips to steady his nerves and keep cool. The advice was good, but Pips could not give heed to it. He was evidently agitated, too much so to make a good shot. Of this he was conscious himself, but the word was given and the bachelor fired. Instantly Sabattus started for the tree, and was first there in spite of the fleetness of the Leaping Fawn.</p> 
                  <p>"He no hit only the ring," said Sabattus to Sarah, as she came up followed by Borland.</p> 
                  <p>Such was the fact, for the bullet of Pips had struck upon the ring and cut it apart nearly over on the top, so that he over shot. Sabattus was pleased but he concealed his feelings. Again they all fired, and Sabattus struck the edge of the centre mark, Sarah's bullet hit just below the Indian's and almost cut into it. Pips got this time clearly within the ring, making a better shot than he did the first time, but he was beaten by both the others. The third trial was more exciting than the previous ones, but the Indian came off conquerer over both, and Sarah beat Pips. Sabattus preserved the gravity of his countenance, but <unclear>he was</unclear> highly pleased with his performances. He cared not about beating Sarah but he was determined to be victor over Pips.</p> 
                  <p>The mother hoped that Sarah would beat all of them. She flattered Pips and told him, as they stood near the tree, that he had made excellent shots, assuring him that a deer would stand but a poor chance for his life before his rifle. Borland was glad that Pips was beaten, although he wished he had been beaten by some white person and not by an Indian, for he hated the whole race. Pips was not satisfied, and asked Sarah to join him and fire once more. She did so, and this time she hit the centre and made the best shot of all. Pips did better than he did before, but Sarah's shot could not be beaten. Tom felt better, because his last shot was his best one.</p> 
                  <p>The more Pips saw this strange, beautiful girl, the more he was bewildered and bewitched. He tarried here several days and overstaid his time, for he had promised to return to the city on a particular day of the month when he had some business to transact which required his presence. If Pips had not been there, Sabattus would have gone down to Lake Champlain and disposed of his furs, but he would not go and leave the coast free, for he became satisfied that Pips was fascinated with the beauty of Sarah. Borland did not hurry Pips; for he was on wages and liked his work. He would have been willing to have passed the summer there, for Tom was good pay. The mother was very attentive to the bachelor and hoped something favorable to her and daughter would grow out of his visit to her lodge. Pips did not speak of his love to either daughter or mother, for the very good reason that he didn't know certainly he was in love. Borland took sides with Pips, not because he had any very special regard for him, but because he hated Sabattus. Thus we must leave Pips for the present and turn to other matters.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MISS TABITHA SPIKER'S PHILOSOPHY OF LOVE-A SCOTCH GIRL AND AN IRISH COACHMAN.</head> 
                  <p>The curtain again rises and the scene changes from the unbroken wilderness to the city; from the wild, romantic scenes of forest, river and lake to the noise, bustle and confusion of fashionable and busy life. Mr. Tom Pips had been absent from the city more than six weeks, when he did not purpose to be gone more than half that time. There were several who wished to see him, but there was one more particularly anxious than all the rest. To her the days seemed long and the nights tedious. In the upper part of the city, or what was then considered the upper part, stood a neat, well-finished, well-furnished brick house, which was painted a light pea green, with the windows handsomely blinded. Three thrifty horse-chestnut trees stood in a narrow pent yard, and shaded the house in deep shadows when the foliage was fully developed There was a quietness, a neatness and a beauty about this <choice>
                        <sic>tenment</sic>
                        <corr>tenement</corr>
                     </choice> which never failed to attract the notice of those who passed it, especially if they were not in a great hurry, as many of the citizens of New York are somewhat prone to be. This tenement was what is called a single house, but it was two stories high, with a small porch in the rear and a limited garden, which was principally devoted to the raising of flowers, of which the occupant and owner was very fond. The parlor too, and the front windows, were always ornamented with vases of roses, and other flowers of a peculiar species. And occasionally the door steps were covered with the same kind of vegetation, especially in the summer season.</p> 
                  <p>The occupant and owner of this tenement was a single lady who had seen in this world thirty-five summers and as many winters save one. Her parents had been dead several years, and this house and some profitable stocks had been left her, the interest of which gave her a very genteel support, not however, without the practice of a somewhat rigid economy. This she always practiced in every department of her household. In form she was tall, slim and straight as a maypole. She had been lucky with her teeth, for she had never lost but four, and these were well supplied by the art of the dentist. Her hair began to show a small sprinkling of gray. This bleaching process of single hairs she narrowly and anxiously watched every time<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6823-00000024"/> when she combed her head, and not unfrequently she would pluck out by the roots a single spear which began to grow more white than the rest. This labor became more and more arduous every moon, yet she persevered until she found her hair was really growing thinner and thinner. That somewhat alarmed her, and yet she could not patiently endure gray hairs, especially while she was receiving the attentions of a portly, well formed, and good natured old bachelor. The name of this lady was Tabitha Spiker. In earlier life she had loved a young man most sincerely, and expected to become his wife, but a few weeks only before that event was to have been consummated, relentless death stepped in and consigned him to the tomb. She mourned the loss of her lover in sorrow and in tears, but at last her heart began to put out its feelers after a new object, and she gradually took off one piece of crape after another, until the habiliments of mourning were cast aside and her affections became fastened upon Mr. Tom Pips, who has figured somewhat conspicuously in the preceding chapters. Having had so much experience she was well qualified to discuss the theory and philosophy of love in all its phases. The subject was perfectly familiar with her and her tongue exceedingly voluble. Her servant girl was of Scotch descent and possessed rather more than an ordinary share of personal beauty and intellectual acumen. Her name was Mary Campbell. This girl had been taken when quite a child by Miss Spiker's parents, and had lived with them until their death, and still continued the servant of Tabitha. She was about eighteen year of age when our story commences, and a most <choice>
                        <sic>inveteraate</sic>
                        <corr>inveterate</corr>
                     </choice> reader of Scott's novels. No works of fiction in her estimation equalled his. Her parents were pure Scotch. Mary was considered very handsome by most persons, but Miss Spiker did not thus esteem her, and the reason may have been that Mary was rather short, round and plump, a form which Miss Tabitha could not admire, for she was decidedly in favor of tall forms, slender waists, very erect positions and long necks. Especially did Miss Spiker extol long necks, for she always said that, heads appeared much more graceful upon them than upon short ones. Mary's neck was rather short, but it was as white as the driven snow. Tabitha would have given a great deal if her complexion could have been like her Scotch servant's, but, alas! time makes great havoc among earthly things. Once her skin was quite smooth and white, but now it was a little wrinkled and sallow, especially when compared with Mary Campbell's.</p> 
                  <p>Although Miss Spiker was very particular, and would have a place for everything and everything <unclear>in its</unclear> place, yet she was a kind mistress to Mary, and did not hesitate occasionally even to consult her and follow her advice, for she knew that Mary was very shrewd and a close observer of things. Three weeks had elapsed since the departure of bachelor Pips upon his fishing excursion. The day when he started was set down in her almanac, and the time noted when he said he should return. One morning she sat at her parlor window, surrounded by flower pots and turning the leaves of her almanac. Having found May 20th, she began to count the number of weeks from that to the present time.</p> 
                  <p>"It is three weeks yesterday, since Mr. Pips left the city," she said to herself. "It is high time for him to return. Strange he loves to go into the wilderness so much alone! I wish I could break up that habit. Well, when we are married, I shall have more power over him, and I will exercise it. too. Married, did I say? Perhaps he never will consent to that! and yet the day before he left, he talked more favorably than I ever heard him before. He was then in a good frame of mind, and how I dreaded to have him go away at such a time! But he would go, for he said he had been dreaming of trout for two weeks, almost every night. I wish he would dream of me and not of fish! I wonder if he does not often think of me in the night, under his tent in the solitude of the wilderness? I wish I could know his thoughts! I almost hate the very name of angling! He goes away every summer and suffers himself to be eaten by the flies of the wood, and all for the sake of killing a few trout. It is said every man has one weak spot, and surely angling is a weak spot in Mr. Pips. But I will not borrow trouble, for it comes fast enough without</p> 
                  <p>Mary Campbell now entered, with a smile upon her face, and cunning in her dark blue eyes, for she knew what her mistress was thinking about, because she saw the open almanac in her hand.</p> 
                  <p>"See here, Mary," said Tabitha, giving her the almanac. "See if I have counted right. I make it just three weeks, yesterday, since Mr. Pips went away on his foolish fishing excursion. The month runs out as the bottom of the page, and I don't know but made a mistake when I turned over the leaf."</p> 
                  <p>"The twentieth of May," replied Mary, "ane, twa, three. Yes, three weeks yesterday, precisely."</p> 
                  <p>"And, don't you think, Mary, he will return this week?" asked the loving maiden.</p> 
                  <p>"I canna tell," replied Mary, loving to use the Scotch language which she learned more from reading the Antiquary and some of Scott's novels, than she did from her parents, who died when she was quite young. "Men oftentimes love angling better than they do their leddies. Ye must na think too muckle o' angling gentlemen, wha' gang far awa' in the thick wood and along the pleasant streams."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't you think such lovers of romantic life are more prone to cherish affection for the ladies, than those who have no such taste for such sports?" asked Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"I canna answer su' a question, but you ha' more experience than I have," answered Mary. "Su' men may fa' in loo sooner and forget it quicker. The pear that ripens first soonest falls to the ground."</p> 
                  <p>"That is very true, but Mr. Pips you know, Mary, once loved, and deeply loved too,," said Tabitha. Such an exercise has softened his heart, and made it still more susceptible of a second impression."</p> 
                  <p>"I understand ye very weel," said Mary. "But, I ha' some different thoughts. The wax that ha' once been melted and scaled, the letter will na receive the second impression of the seal so plain as it did the first, if ye heat it ever so muckle."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, Mary, you must not compare the human heart to sealing-wax," said Miss Spiker.</p> 
                  <p>"And where's the difference?" asked Mary, smiling. "The twa must be heated before they will receive impressions. And if heated too often, they lose their power to take impressions."</p> 
                  <p>"But, my dear girl, Mr. Pips' heart is not a lump of sealing-wax," said Tabitha, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"I hope not, for if it were, ye might melt it all awa'," answered the Scotch maiden. "Mr. Pips has a gude heart, I reckon, and surely his form is manly and weel proportioned."</p> 
                  <p>"You may well say that," replied Tabitha. "I think he's a fine looking man, and I feel quite sure that his heart is in the right place. He has a feeling heart too."</p> 
                  <p>"Na doubt o' that," said Mary. "But these feeling hearts may sometimes feel too muckle"</p> 
                  <p>"You don't mean to say that you think Mr. Pips can love more than one lady at the same time, do you?" asked Tabitha, manifesting some surprise and expressing not a little fear.</p> 
                  <p>"Na, na," replied Mary, "I dinna mean su' a thing. Mr. Pips is too gude a man for that. But do you think he will ever love again?"</p> 
                  <p>"That's the great question which troubles my mind," replied Tabitha. "One thing I'm quite sure of, if he loves any woman again, I believe I shall be the person. And I indulge strong hopes that he already begins to feel the power of second love."</p> 
                  <p>"May your hopes prove weel grounded," said Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"You believe in loving a second time, do you not!" asked Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"How can ane tell that wha never felt first love?" replied Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"True, Mary," said Tabitha, "one cannot. The human heart must have experience before it can understand and appreciate the philosophy of any thing. Before I was of your age I loved a young man most deeply."</p> 
                  <p>"And did he love you?" asked Mary, smiling at the frankness of Miss Spiker.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed he did, and before I loved him," answered Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"The leddies loo' the men because the men first loo' them," said Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"You have many things yet to learn in the affairs of love," replied Tabitha. "Experience, my good girl, experience. Nothing like experience to open one's eyes, and show the workings of the human heart, that great book which but few read with a proper understanding of its contents. I commenced its study at an early age, and am still engaged in exploring its hidden mysteries."</p> 
                  <p>"And do you find any thing new, now?" asked Mary, concealing a smile which she felt rising from her heart to her face.</p> 
                  <p>"Every day I turn over a new leaf and read something new," replied the elder maiden. The heart is deep and long, and deep study can only fathom its recesses."</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you confine your researches principally to the hearts of the gentlemen, do you not?" asked Mary, while an arch smile lurked round the corners of her handsome mouth, and her eyes sparkled with suppressed mirth.</p> 
                  <p>"True, I do," replied Tabitha. "You know we are more interested in them. It is the great business of a woman's life to search out and win a good, kind husband Marriage is the appointment of Heaven, and the woman who marries well enjoys human life just as our creator intended, and according to the laws of nature. O, Mary, I hope you will study this subject and not throw yourself away on some unworthy man. A happy marriage is a heaven upon earth, but a had marriage is a foretaste of that other place. The ways of Providence are sometimes hard to be understood by finite mortals. Now, Mr. Pips lost his first love, and so have I. He mourned our losses, and for a time brooded over our misfortunes, but after all there will good come out of these severe trials. But for them there are some lessons we could never have learned. If such a Providence had not so ordered it, how could I have ever known the power of a second attachment which has opened to me new beauties and given me higher views of human life."</p> 
                  <p>"And do you think Mr. Pips will ever have his eyes so widely opened?" asked Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"I have no doubt of it," replied Miss Spiker. "Our last interview was a very impressive and solemn one. I never had clearer views in my life, and more ready language than I had at that interview. I discoursed for more than an hour upon the philosophy of love, and set before Mr. Pips' mind many things he never thought of in his life. I spoke of new hopes and of new affections, of beauties unseen except by the eye of experience, of green islands springing up in the ocean of life, and of fragrant flowers growing upon its shores. He began to open his eyes, and bright visions began to flit across his soul. He left me, and pressed my hand more tenderly than ever before. That pressure I now feel, or seem to feel it. Ah, Mr. Pips has many things to think of, while he's in the solitude of the wilderness. My words, my thoughts, my views, will come up fresh in his memory while he is under his tent during the night, or sails over the bosom of the peaceful lake in the day, or wanders upon the margin of some stream, in search of his favorite sport. Second love is born in his heart, and its beauties will unfold themselves in his dreams by night, and in his wanderings by day. It is a heavenly plant, and when once rooted in the heart, it will grow and flourish until it bears most precious fruit."</p> 
                  <p>"Aweel, aweel, my gude mistress. Ye ha' ganged far awa' into the regions of imagination," said Mary. "Ye ha' ganed a bright world to live in, and may no murky clouds darken your sun, or obscure the light o' the fair moon. May a' be blithesome and gay, and the music o' the fair birds delight ye."</p> 
                  <p>"It may seem to you like fancy or imagination, but second love does indeed create such a world," answered the excited Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Ye may ha' a' things in yer new world, but if ye ha' na fishes, Mr. Pips will na lik it," said Mary, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, you don't understand, dear girl. When Mr. Pips sees all these new beauties which a new affection unfolds, he will forget the fishes and remain about his hearthstone. If his dear Catharine Watson had lived, his affection would not have slumbered, and angling would have lost its charms; but she died, the flame of love became dim, and he sought after sources of pleasure and recreation. That flame begins to burn again and in its new and brighter beams he will discover all the beauties I have spoken of. Think you not that such things will make him forget his wild sports and enjoy domestic bliss?"</p> 
                  <p>"My mother used to say, ye could na teach an old dog new tricks," replied the Scotch girl. "Mr. Pips has lived forty years and loved angling ever since he was a wee bit of a bairn."</p> 
                  <p>"No matter, the power of second love remodels the whole man, if I may so say, making him all over anew so far as his heart is concerned, and giving him entirely new views of human life."</p> 
                  <p>"It does na change the body, does it?" enquired Mary, looking archly at her mistress.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, now you are joking, Mary," responded Tabitha. "Mr. Pips has a fine manly form, and I would not have it changed. Don't you think he is very good looking?"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed I do," answered Mary. "And I don't wonder you love him."</p> 
                  <p>"It is his good, kind heart which makes me love him," said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"True, but if that gude heart dwelt in an awful looking house, ye wa'd na like it so well as ye do now," said Mary. "I'm quite sure I should not fa' in love with su' a homely looking man; if his heart was ever so gude."</p> 
                  <p>"Mary, you're young yet, and know not when you may love," replied Tabitha. "It's an old maxim that love goes where it <choice>
                        <sic>it</sic>
                        <corr>is</corr>
                     </choice> sent."</p> 
                  <p>"And sure, mine will na be sent ganging after an ugly looking fellow," said Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"While your heart is not bound by the silken cords you can boast of your independent feelings, but when love's silken net is thrown over you, than you will begin to sing new songs and new channels of pleasure will be opened to you. Wait, Mary, until experience has taught you, before you attempt to discourse of love matters. I'm expecting every day when some young fellow will make an impression upon your heart and open your eyes, so that you can see the hidden mysteries of that new state of existence which all generally see, sooner or later in life."</p> 
                  <p>"Now, that makes me think of a love letter I received yesterday from a young gentleman," said Mary, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"A love letter!" repeated Tabitha. "A love letter! And have you received one? Let me see it, and I can judge of the strength of his affection. Who's the author!"</p> 
                  <p>"Jimmy McCrate, the widow Barlow's Irish coachman," replied Mary, pulling the love missive from her bosom, and kissing it in sport. "And wad ye like to see how Jimmy can spread his thoughts and feelings on paper?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I declare, that's a curious affair," said Tabitha, holding the letter between her finger and thumb and gazing upon it with curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>"Ye may read it if it please ye," said Mary. "Jimmy wad na do only the polite thing."</p> 
                  <p>"I like him much better than I do his mistress," said Tabitha, slowly unfolding the letter, so as not to rumple or tear it. Miss Spiker always considered such documents very sacred, and she handled them accordingly. She read as follows, in a measured, peculiar tone of voice:</p>

                                 <emph>My dear Mary:</emph> I hope ye will excuse me for writing I have often seen yer swate face at the window, and my heart feels the power of a second love. Before I came to this great counthry, I did love Mary O'Neil, but death took her away from my sight. Since that mournful time I have seen no girl but you, whom I could love. O, Mary Campbell, ye look like my own Mary O'Neil, and I fale all my ould love rising in my heart. I could not hold in longer, and so I have tould you the secret.</p> 
                              <closer>
                                 <salute>Your lover until death,</salute>

                  </q> 
                  <p>"There, my dear Mary, that man loves you most deeply," said Tabitha. "Couldn't hold in longer, and has unburdened his heart. Ah! it is a second love, too! Don't you see how natural it is? He believes you resemble his once loved Irish girl. It is that which has rekindled the ashes and cinders of his first love. O, Mary, depend upon it his love is sincere! I have not the least doubt of it. Every line of his short letter breathes an honest spirit. He loves you twice as much as he did Miss O'Neil. I like such honest<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6823-00000025"/> confessions. If he had been disposed to deceive he never would have spoken of his loving another girl. No, no, Mary, Jimmy McCrate has uttered the true feelings of his soul. But, then perhaps, you cannot reciprocate his love. I always feel anxious that true love should never be disappointed. I have too much regard for our race to wish otherwise. Don't you think you can love him?"</p> 
                  <p>"The Scotch and Irish blood don't mingle easily," replied Mary. "Jimmy is very genteel in his appearance, and no doubt possesses a gude heart."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and the widow Barlow says he is very prudent and lays up all his wages," said Tabitha. "He has now in the Savings Bank more than three hundred pounds, so says his mistress."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall never marry a man for his money," replied Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"Nor I either," answered Tabitha. "But when other things are right money furnishes no impediment. Wealth is convenient, but not essential to human happiness"</p> 
                  <p>Mary now took her letter, and repaired to her own room, where she read it over several times with feelings somewhat different from those excited by the first reading. Miss Spiker had made some impressions upon her, for she had a hearty laugh over the letter when she first received it, but now the affair seemed to wear a different aspect, and she began to believe that the coachman did actually and sincerely love her. No young girl can remain indifferent towards a man who she knows loves her, for she will either return his love or hate him more. As Miss Spiker had stated, the coachman was a very prudent fellow, and withal quite genteel in his dress and manners. Having driven Mrs. Barlow's carriage several years, he had become an excellent driver and a very polite man. But for the pock-marks upon his face, he would be very good looking, if not decidedly handsome. His form was genteel and his motions graceful, perhaps some fastidious person might say he was rather too measured in his motions, and too precise in his movements. Mary herself had such impressions from the little she had seen of him.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE WIDOW WATSON AND THE MYSTERIOUS LITTLE GIRL-A STRANGE WOMAN APPEARS.</head> 
                  <p>In another and less fashionable part of the city was a small wooden house occupied by Mrs. Watson, the mother of Catharine, whom Tom Pips once so ardently loved. The tenement belonged to Pips, but he generously gave the rent of it to the good widow and occasionally something besides. She had resided here a good many years, and her daughter Catharine died in the same house. Mrs. Watson was somewhat advanced in years, yet her general health was quite good. Mr. Pips was much esteemed and respected by her, as well he might be. Her husband died some four or five years before her daughter, and left her to grapple with poverty. He was naturally a good hearted man and very skillful in the mechanic arts, but intemperance impaired his usefulness and sent him down to a premature grave. The daughter, Catharine, was an exceedingly beautiful and interesting girl. All who knew her thought so, but none more than Tom Pips. And it was very fortunate for the widow that he did entertain such feelings, for he made her life comfortable and treated her as kindly as if she had been his mother. She too loved him as a mother would a son.</p> 
                  <p>At the same time Miss Spiker was examining her almanac to see how many days Pips had been gone, Mrs. Watson was leering through her spectacles upon the same annual and for the same purpose.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips has now been gone one day over the time he set," said Mrs. Watson to herself, pushing her spectacles back upon the top of her head and above the border of her cap, and laying the almanac in her lap. "Well, he enjoys himself in the wild wood, but if my daughter had lived he would not have gone angling so much. I'm glad he finds so much to amuse him innocently in the world. Never did man love woman more than he did my daughter. O, what weeping by her bedside when death was about to mark her for his own. It seemed to me he could never be reconciled, but he did become calm and thoughtful and behaved like a true christian. For that I have ever been thankful He has been good to me. I can hardly endure the thought of his being married, but I ought not to oppose him, if he wishes to have a wife. I'm quite sure he can never love another woman. It is strange Tabitha Spiker hangs round him so much, but she believes she can make him love her yet; I don't believe it, and yet she may induce him to marry her out of sympathy, for he has a tender heart and hates to see any one suffer. I hope he will never wed her. Some how I don't fancy her, but I suppose she is a good hearted woman. She's too precise and particular for me. She told me he other day she expected to marry him, but what new reasons she has for such an expectation I did not inquire."</p> 
                  <p>While the old lady was thus communing with herself, a loud knocking was heard at the door. She answered the summons and a woman and little girl stood there. She bid them come in and be seated. They did so. The woman was well dressed and quite genteel and handsome. The girl was apparently three years old and remarkably beautiful. Her hair was long, very dark and hung in rich curls about her neck. Her skin was very delicate and her complexion brunette.</p> 
                  <p>"You have a sweet pretty little girl with you," said the old lady, examining her very closely through her spectacles, and then peering at the woman. It is your daughter, I suppose, and yet ye don't look much alike so far as I can see, but I'm rather blind."</p> 
                  <p>"Little Jenny is a clever girl, but I'm not her mother," replied the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"I thought so," said Mrs. Watson, feeling quite proud of her sagacity. "Perhaps you may be her aunt."</p> 
                  <p>"No, madam, she's not a relative of mine," answered the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"No relative!" repeated the widow, apparently somewhat surprised. "Who is she then?"</p> 
                  <p>The woman smiled at the old lady's curiosity and motioned the little girl to her, for she was running about the room and spying all the wonders of the place.</p> 
                  <p>"She's some gentleman's daughter, I can say," continued the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"You're not far out of the way this time. Don't you want a little girl to live with you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'm too poor," replied the widow. "Come here, little girl and let me see you; what's your name?"</p> 
                  <p>"Little Jenny," answered the girl, running up to the widow and familiarly leaning upon her lap.</p> 
                  <p>"You're a nice girl," said Mrs. Watson, running her fingers through Jenny's curls. "How old are you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Three years the tenth day of August," replied Jenny, reaching up and kissing the old lady, which greatly pleased her.</p> 
                  <p>"You and Jenny seem to be very great friends already," said the woman. "You say you're too poor to take the little girl. Suppose you could have money with her?"</p> 
                  <p>The old lady stared through her spectacles at the woman and felt great curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>"You need not be surprised," she <choice>
                        <sic>contined</sic>
                        <corr>continued</corr>
                     </choice>. "Here's a roll of bills containing one hundred dollars, which I will give you if you will take Jenny and bring her up. Perhaps you will receive more money one of these days."</p> 
                  <p>The widow was so much astonished that she could hardly speak.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm really in earnest, madam," continued the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"But who is the little girl?" anxiously exclaimed the widow. "Where did she come from? Who are her parents? How can you give her away?"</p> 
                  <p>"These questions I am not at liberty to answer," replied the woman. "But one thing you may be assured of, I have full power to give away this little girl. I have a sealed package also which must not be opened until the person receiving it shall be authorized to do so by a letter through the post office. When that letter will be sent I cannot say. Now, what think you of taking the money, package and little Jenny upon these conditions?"</p> 
                  <p>"I hardly know what to think!" replied the widow. "You greatly surprise me."</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose so," replied the woman. "But you must not question me farther, for I cannot answer any questions tions in relation to this matter. I believe you are a good woman, but whether I am or not, you cannot know. If you take this little girl you will be well rewarded. Jenny is a pleasant girl, but she has not seen her mother for a long time. The package when opened will give you mere information than I am at liberty to impart. Now I wait for your answer. What say you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Will you live with me?" asked the widow, addressing the little girl and smoothing back her curly hair from her forehead.</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, replied Jenny, "I like you."</p> 
                  <p>The widow catechised the woman and tried to penetrate the mystery that hung over the child, but all to no purpose. Not a word could she get from her. After a long conversation, the widow took the money, package and the little girl, and the woman departed.</p> 
                  <p>The little girl did not seem at all reluctant to part with the woman who brought her there, but was apparently well pleased to be left with the widow Watson. There was something very strange and 'mysterious in the whole transaction. The old lady endeavored to find out the whole name of the girl, but the girl did not seem to know that she had any other name except little Jenny. Neither did she know the name of the woman with whom she came there. Mrs. Watson learned from her that she had been in the country and that she lived with an old man and woman. She seemed to know nothing in relation to her father and mother, but she did say there was a man who gave her the dress she were and kissed her a good many times. Mrs. Watson was not long in coming to the conclusion that Jenny must be an illegitimate child and that her father was rich and perhaps respectable as the world counts respectability. The girl was peculiarly beautiful, lively and interesting. And the widow soon began to feel a very tender regard for her. The package was <unclear>very</unclear> neatly done up and written upon the outside in the words following, "not to be opened until authorized by a letter through the post office." Long did the old lady examine this small bundle through her glasses and feel it all over, but she had solemnly promised the woman not to open it, and she was determined to keep that promise sacred although her curiosity was much excited to see its contents.</p> 
                  <p>Carefully she laid it away in the top drawer of her old cherry-tree bureau, the only one upon which there was a lock. Little Jenny grew more and more familiar every moment, and the widow began to regard her with almost a grand-mother's feelings. Jenny was full of life and animation and withal somewhat roguish; yet she was dutiful and kind. For hours the widow catechised her to ascertain the story of her life, but she could gather nothing very satisfactory. It was evident to her mind, however, that the child was never long under the care of her mother, or any one person. It seemed, from the broken and desultory account she gave of her brief existence, that she had lived in several places and with several persons who had taken care of her. Her memory was most clear and distinct in relation to her living where there were green fields and trees, for she often spoke of them, and pretty flowers. The more the widow heard the more anxious and curious she was to hear more, and the greater was her bewilderment. Among other questions which the old lady asked the child, she so far forgot herself as to ask her where she was born, but Jenny could not, of course, give the old lady a very correct account of that interesting event.</p> 
                  <p>The day were away and the evening came, when little Jenny nestled beside the widow in the same bed. Mrs. Watson felt as if the child was good company. Both rose quite early in the morning and Jenny made herself very busy in domestic affairs, trying to help in getting breakfast and doing all she could towards accomplishing that feat; but it must be acknowledged that she rather retarded than advanced the progress. She looked more beautiful to the widow than she did the day previous, especially when she was combing her bright curly hair, and fixing her up for the day. Soon after breakfast a man knocked at the door and left a small basket filled with Jenny's clothes, but he answered no questions which the widow asked him, saying he knew nothing about the child and affording not the least satisfaction to the widow. The circumstance rather tended to increase than to allay her curiosity. It seemed to her the man was a stranger to Jenny and to the whole affair, for the child did not recognize him at all, and probably had not seen him before. The basket contained many useful articles which go to make up a child's wardrobe. The day was pleasant and the widow and Jenny walked out, and wandered along through some of the less frequented streets. Jenny was blithe and gay as a bird when it carols to the morning sun. They had been out nearly an hour and were on their return home when Jenny pointed with her finger, and exclaimed "I see man."</p> 
                  <p>The widow looked in the direction Jenny pointed and saw a man partially dressed in a military uniform, standing at the corner of a street that turned down towards the East River. He was but a few rods distant and, gazing upon them for a moment, he passed down the street. Jenny seemed to recognize him, or at any rate, she acted as if she had seen him before, or some one dressed like him, but she could not speak his name or tell much about him. However, she told enough to excite the widow's curiosity, so much so that she turned down the same street and followed the officer. But the military gentleman was swifter upon a march than she and Jenny were, and soon passed from their sight. The widow reflected much upon the circumstance, but it only bewildered her the more in regard to the child's history. Sometimes she thought the military officer might be the father of Jenny, and the more she thought of it the more was she convinced that such was the fact. They followed in the same street where they last saw the man, hoping to get another and a nearer view of him, but their efforts were in vain. The gentleman escaped from them, and whether by accident or design was known only to him. The widow suspected it was by design, for he seemed for a moment to gaze very earnestly upon them and then start suddenly away; at least, it seemed just so to the widow. They reached home, and the widow was quite fatigued, for she had taken a much longer walk than usual. Having returned to her humble dwelling she asked Jenny a great many questions in relation to the officer and put them in every form which her ingenuity could suggest so as to bring them down to the capacity of the child, but all the answers embodied but a very little information, and nothing upon which she could rely. One thing, however, was made quite certain. She became satisfied that Jenny had seen the officer before, or some one wearing a similar uniform. That was all she could draw from Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>Another day passed and the child grew more and more dear to her. The third day after Jenny was so mysteriously consigned to her care, just at nightfall, the woman who brought her there, called. The widow was delighted to see her, and flattered herself that the mystery might be cleared up. The child did not seem to be half so overjoyed to see the woman as Mrs. Watson was. True, she recognized and ran to meet her.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm very glad you have called," said the widow "You can't imagine how anxious I am to find out the history of this sweet little girl."</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, madam, I can very well imagine your anxiety upon the subject," replied the woman. "I should feel anxious myself, were I in your situation."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope you will give me some further light," said the widow. "It seems to me I am entitled to it. How do I know but the parents of the child are wicked people?"</p> 
                  <p>"If they are, Jenny is not answerable for their crimes," replied the woman. "From what I know of the child she possesses a good heart and a sweet disposition."</p> 
                  <p>"I believe it, but it seems to me quite unnatural and very strange that parents could abandon such a child and leave her in the care of strangers."</p> 
                  <p>"Grandmothers are even more tender hearted than mothers, oftentimes, and I am sure you will feel and act towards Jenny like a fond grandmother," answered the woman, while a smile passed over her face. "You may be assured that the father of Jenny is considered by the world a very respectable man, but perhaps so much cannot be said of her mother. You know, madam that men can do some deeds and move in the higher ranks of society, which, if women do, sink them very low in the estimation of the world. There is something out of joint here, but it is difficult to find a remedy as society at present is organised.</p> 
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6823-00000026"/> 
                  <p>"I think I understand you," replied the old lady, peering through her spectacles at the woman, and manifesting a great curiosity. "But I hope you will-</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, madam, you must not question me," interrupted the woman, anticipating what Mrs. Watson was about to say. "I cannot tell you anything about the parents of Jenny. We live in a strange world, and truth is often stranger than fiction. I consider a woman as good as a man at any time, but the laws of cultivated life make too great a distinction between them, in relation to some acts at least. If I could have the remodelling of society I would make a most thorough and complete revolution, placing the men where the women now are, and showing them the great evils of some of the features of the present system of rules and regulations. Men have more rights than the women and truly they show themselves the lords of creation. Grace! If I had the power I would make a woman respectable who might give birth to an illegitimate child, and consign the father of it to infamy and shame! But now, how is it? How do the laws of society bear upon the question? What is public opinion? And who makes these laws and this public opinion? The man to be sure! Now let me suppose a case. Suppose little Jenny is an illegitimate child, which I do not admit, but only make the supposition. Her father holds up his head, walks proudly among the most respectable, is courted, flattered, and even thrust into high offices, while the mother covers her face in shame, sneaks away from the public gaze, shuns her friends and acquaintances, feels that her character is gone, or if more desperate, she looses all self respect, despises the world, tramples its laws under her feet; in one word, she becomes a wanton and laughs in the faces of men! Now, this is all wrong. Let the man be branded as the greater sinner, and the woman have all the sympathy which belongs to humanity. But, madam, I did not come here this morning to <unclear>preach</unclear> you a lecture. I only came to enquire after Jenny, and to see if her clothes had been safely delivered."</p> 
                  <p>"You have spoken much truth," replied the widow. "Let me tell you what I have been thinking."</p> 
                  <p>"That you can tell, but do not catechise me about Jenny's history, for that is a sealed book as far as I am concerned," said the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"I believe Jenny's father is a military officer," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>The woman suddenly started, but soon appeared calm and quiet. The old lady being somewhat nearsighted, did not observe the motions of the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"And how came you to such a conclusion?" asked the woman very cooly and smiling.</p> 
                  <p>The widow now told her all the circumstances in relation to what Jenny said, and to her seeing the officer, and that she firmly believed that officer was the father of the child.</p> 
                  <p>There are a good many military officers in our city and some of them are no better than they should be," replied the woman, smiling at the anxiety depicted on the face of the widow. "I shall neither affirm nor deny anything you may say, but you will probably have to guess many times before you hit upon the father of Jenny."</p> 
                  <p>"There is a strange mystery hanging about this little girl," said the widow. "Perhaps I may involve myself in trouble if I keep the child. I begin to have some fears and apprehensions."</p> 
                  <p>"Give yourself no trouble on that account," replied the woman. "I can assure you I had full authority to give you the child, and you may feel quite easy in keeping her. It is not intended to put you to any expense."</p> 
                  <p>"O dear madam, I am not afraid of that, for the money you have given me will last a good while," said the widow. "I never had so much at once in my life. I hope I shall manage it prudently. Mr. Pips almost supports me, good man. He was once engaged to my daughter, but she died! Mr. Pips, however has never <choice>

                     </choice> the mother who bore her. O, my Catherine was a good girl, and people said she was very handsome."</p> 
                  <p>The old lady would have spun out that subject to a <gap/> if the woman had not interrupted her <gap/> other topics.</p> 
                  <p>
                     <gap/> call again and see how you and Jenny get along," said the woman. "I have, however no particular interest in the matter, I have done only what I was requested to do."</p> 
                  <p>"But did the person requesting you to find a place for Jenny, know me?" asked the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"O, no, but the whole affair was left to my discretion," answered the woman. "For several days I had been seeking a place for the child, but I found none that suited me so well as this. The moment I saw you and learned your situation, I thought you were the person to leave the child with, and I have no reason to repent of the choice I made. I believe Jenny will be treated kindly here, and that is enough for the present.</p> 
                  <p>"When shall I receive a letter through the postoffice authorising me to break the seal of that package?" anxiously inquired the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"That indeed, is more than I can tell," answered the woman. "That is no business of mine. Such a letter will never come from me but from another person. The package I trust, will remained sealed, until that time, be it longer or shorter."</p> 
                  <p>"O certainly," replied the widow. "I never break my promises."</p> 
                  <p>"I believe you, good woman, and now I must bid you a good evening."</p> 
                  <p>She did so, and departed. The widow was now involved in greater doubt and mystery than ever. The more she tried to lift the veil which hung over the affair, the thicker seemed to grow its folds, and more difficult to penetrate. The woman herself was a riddle the widow could not solve. She could not tell what to make of her. Whether she was a virtuous or a vicious woman, Mrs. Watson could not satisfy herself. She talked eloquently, and showed herself willing to be a great reformer of the age, but the widow was greatly troubled to make up her mind in relation to her. Mrs. Watson was placed in very peculiar circumstances, and how anxious she was now for the return of Mr. Pips, that she might tell him the whole story, and get his opinion of the affair. Never, since the death of her daughter, had there been a time when she wanted to see the angler so much. Again and again she examined the pages of her almanac, to see if she had made any mistake with regard to his departure, and the time that had elapsed since that event. She had made no mistake, and she was hourly expecting his arrival. Pips always called upon her immediately after his return, even before he visited the loving Tabitha Spiker. Day and night succeeded each other, exceedingly slow in her estimation, especially as they did not bring the return of Mr. Tom Pips.</p>

                  <p>"It seems to me as if Mr. Pips would never come!" said Miss Tabitha Spiker, to herself, about three weeks after the time he had appointed to come home. "I fear some dreadful accident has happened to him! He may have been drowned in the river or lake, and I not there to extend him a helping hand, or to witness his good spirit take its flight to a better world! O, Mr. Pips, would that I could know thou wert safe, I could endure thy absence a while longer. But I fear thy body has become food for those fishes thou lovest to catch so well. No, no, I must not give place to these fearful forebodings. I will hope for the best. He would have written me, if trouble had come upon him. And yet he might have been in the deep wood, far from any post-office. I wonder if Mrs. Watson has heard anything from him? I don't like that woman very well, for she feels as if Mr. Pips ought always to remember her daughter, and never love another woman. O, what a selfish old widow! But I have a good mind to go and see her-she may have heard from him."</p> 
                  <p>And away she hurried to Mrs. Watson's, and found that good woman with the almanac in her hand, reckoning up the weeks, days, and even hours, Mr. Pips had been absent. As Miss Spiker entered the room and her eyes fell upon little Jenny, she almost fainted, for some evil spirit whispered her that the child might claim Mr. Pips as its father. She was so much overcome, for a few moments, she could hardly speak, and sank into a chair.</p> 
                  <p>"What is the matter Miss Spiker?" said the widow, "Don't you feel well to-day?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"The lady sick," said little Jenny, running towards her and gazing into her face.</p> 
                  <p>"O, madam, whose child is this?" anxiously inquired Tabitha, in a trembling tone.</p> 
                  <p>"She belongs to me now," replied the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"O, heavens, I fear the worst!" exclaimed Miss Spiker, gazing wildly upon Jenny, to see if she could trace any resemblances in her face to Mr. Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"What!" said the widow, dost thou know anything of the child's history?"</p> 
                  <p>"I fear I know too much," replied the excited Tabitha. "O, that I should live to see such a day!</p> 
                  <p>"<choice>
                        <sic>Gracions</sic>
                        <corr>Gracious</corr>
                     </choice> Heavens!" exclaimed Mrs. Watson. "Speak! Dost thou know the parents of Jenny?"</p> 
                  <p>"O dear me, have you seen her mother?" asked Tabitha, in great agony, now feeling quite sure that Mr. Pips was the father, and desiring to know how the mother looked. "How old is she? is she young and handsome? Do speak Mrs Watson, and let me know the worst! Did she bring the child here? Did you converse with her? Does she expect to marry the father of her illegitimate?"</p> 
                  <p>"You greatly surprise me!" replied the widow, staring wildly at the excited maiden." A woman did bring the child here, but she said she was not the mother."</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt of it," answered Miss Spiker. She is the mother! Did you learn her name? Is she young and handsome? How was she dressed? Did she look as if she belonged to a good family? O, dear, my heart is dreadfully pressed!"</p> 
                  <p>"I think she is about ten years younger than you are," replied the widow. "She appeared very smart and talked eloquently, but her name I did not learn. She was well dressed and good looking."</p> 
                  <p>"O, heavens!" exclaimed the troubled maiden, anxiously peering into Jenny's face. Dear me! I see some very striking resemblances! Yes, in the forehead, and expression about the mouth! O, my soul, what emotions agitate my bosom! It seems to me I cannot survive this shock. What did the woman say?"</p> 
                  <p>"She gave me a hundred dollars, and hoped I would take care of little Jenny," replied the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"A hundred dollars!" repeated Tabitha. "She has thrust the child upon you because its father has been so long absent. She believes he has deserted her. And O, Heavens! perhaps he will never return! Yes, yes! I see the expressions of his handsome face in this girl's countenance!"</p> 
                  <p>"Whose expressions?" demanded the widow. "If you know the father, speak and tell me, for the woman refused to give me any information."</p> 
                  <p>"I see it all!" exclaimed Miss Spiker. "No wonder she refused to tell you! I would not believe that he could have been so deceitful."</p> 
                  <p>"Who?" anxiously inquired the widow, in tones of voice that showed how deep was her curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, Mr. Pips, to be sure!" replied Tabitha. Don't you see him in the beauty of the child's face?"</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips!" repeated the widow, manifesting the greatest astonishment, and gazing into Jenny's face. "Mr. Pips! Gracious heavens! What do you mean? Mr. Pips! You don't mean to say he is the father of this sweet little girl do you?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is all there!" replied Tabitha, pointing to Jenny's face, and then burying her face in her hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me, exclaimed the old lady, hugging Jenny more closely to her bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't you see striking resemblances?" asked Tabitha, in a voice stifled by her hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Jenny is handsome and so is Mr. Pips," replied the widow, smoothing back the glossy curls from the child's forehead, and gazing anxiously into her face.</p> 
                  <p>"See that beautiful forehead!" said Tabitha, looking out from under her hands, which still covered her face, and almost sobbing. "Don't it resemble Mr. Pips'? I see it all!"</p> 
                  <p>"It seems to me I do now see some resemblance," replied the widow, examining Jenny's forehead very closely through her glasses, and carefully feeling its outlines.</p> 
                  <p>"The expressions about her mouth too!" faintly said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"It is a beautiful mouth," responded the widow, imprinting an affectionate kiss upon the child's lips, and folding her to her bosom.</p> 
                  <p>"O, it seems as if my heart would break!" sobbed the excited maiden, viewing the whole affair in a different light from that in which the widow saw it.</p> 
                  <p>"O, I have always pitied Mr. Pips since the death of my daughter!" said Mrs. Watson. "Never did man love woman more deeply and sincerely than he did my Catherine! He has deeply mourned his great loss. Poor man, he hardly knew what to do!"</p> 
                  <p>Now the old lady felt quite certain that Tom Pips was the father of the child so mysteriously left with her, and began to hunt up excuses and apologies for his conduct. Kind, good-hearted woman! She loved Jenny the more and really felt as if she were the child's grandmother, now that she believed she knew who her father was!</p> 
                  <p>"Pitied Mr. Pips!" repeated Tabitha. "Pitied him! And so have I. But he has done very, very wrong when be knew I loved him so deeply, so sincerely! He ought to have married me long ago. O, dear, Mrs. Watson, this is a sad, a heavy day to me!"</p> 
                  <p>"But he never loved you, Miss Spiker," said the widow. "And would you marry a man who did not love you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I think he does love me!" replied Tabitha. "O, if you could have heard him talk at our last interview, before he went away into the far off wilderness, and have seen how tenderly he pressed my hand, you would think that he loves me! O, Mrs. Watson, he hardly knows his own heart!"</p> 
                  <p>"Do you suppose he ordered the child sent to me?" asked the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"How could he, when he is absent?" said Tabitha. "No, no, I have guessed out the whole thing. He has been gone so much longer than he said he should, that the mother began to think he had forsaken her, and so she brought the girl to you."</p> 
                  <p>"But, the hundred dollars she gave me!" said the old lady. "Why should she be willing to part with her own child, when she had the means to support it? It does not look natural!"</p> 
                  <p>There was now a long pause in the conversation, and Miss Spiker was wrapped in deep and anxious meditation. Her thoughts went over the whole ground, and she reflected seriously. Mrs. Watson's questions severely taxed her philosophy, and at first she could not answer them even in a manner satisfactory to herself. At last she thought she saw a way out of the perplexity.</p> 
                  <p>"Some mothers hav'nt much regard for their children," said Tabitha. "They become so much abandoned and lose so much of their self-respect that they care not what they do."</p> 
                  <p>"Very true," replied the widow. "But if this woman was so much abandoned that she had no love for her child, why did she give me the money? I should think she would have kept that for her own convenience. Such women generally hold fast the money that's given them."</p> 
                  <p>Miss Spiker was again bewildered, and cast about for other reasons, but she could find none very satisfactory. That Mr. Pips was the father of Jenny, she had no doubt, and Mrs. Watson was strongly impressed with the same belief.</p> 
                  <p>"A thought strikes me!" continued the good old lady. "Perhaps the mother belongs to a high family, and has money enough."</p> 
                  <p>This opinion gained strength, the more she reflected upon the transaction. She well remembered how earnestly the woman talked upon the subject of certain crimes, and how much she condemned the laws of society which consigns a woman to infamy and lets a man escape, when both have been equally guilty of the same indiscretions and immoralities. She told Miss Spiker what the woman had said upon that subject, and how earnestly she conversed. Miss Spiker, could not endure the thought that her beloved Pips had been connected with a lady who moved in the upper circles, and yet she feared that such might be the fact, for he moved in that rank because his wealth gave him a passport to it. Long and deeply did these women reflect upon the subject, and imagine a thousand things in which there was no reality.</p> 
                  <p>"You may be right," said Miss Spiker, after a long pause. "I don't think Mr. Pips would ever descend very low in search of female society, especially in his later years."</p> 
                  <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6823-00000027"/> 
                  <p>"Miss Spiker, I don't wish to hurt your feelings, but I don't believe Mr. Pips is courting you at all," said the old lady, throwing back her glasses and gazing on Tabitha with her naked eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, Mrs. Watson, how strangely you talk!" replied Tabitha, returning the widow's gaze. "He has been courting me these four years!"</p> 
                  <p>"More like you have been courting him twice four years," answered the old lady. "No, no, Miss Tabitha Spiker, let me tell you Mr. Pips, if he's alive and returns again, he will never make you his wife. A younger, a more beautiful, and a lovelier woman he will marry if he weds at all."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha Spiker walked the room in violent agitation, seeming to forget the child, the sealed package, the strange woman and every thing except the widow's last words. These transfixed her heart like barbed arrows and rankled there with terrible power. Her feelings were wrought up to such a pitch that she could have scratched out the widow's eyes with a good relish; but she concealed her feelings as well as she could, for she did not know but circumstances might so happen that the widow's influence might be of service to her at some future day.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't blame you for thinking so," said Tabitha, after a long pause. "You don't know Mr. Pips so well as I do. Because he once loved your daughter, when they were both young, is no reason why he should not love again. Every age in man as well as woman, has its peculiar love. The love that is appropriate for one age is not suitable for another and a more advanced age. I have studied these matters most deeply."</p> 
                  <p>"Love is the same in all ages and the whole world over," replied the widow, sweeping away the maiden's fine spun theory by a single sentence and kissing little Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha lingered awhile longer, looked at the drawer that contained the mysterious package, gazed on the little girl, traced the supposed resemblances to Mr. Pips in the child's features and finally took her leave. Her visit had been an exciting one. And her excitement did not subside even after she had reached her own domicil, for Mary Campbell noticed that she was laboring under very peculiar emotions, such as she had not seen her exhibit on any former occasion. Mary supposed that her mistress had seen Mr. Pips, and that he had treated her very coldly, therefore she hesitated to question her. Tabitha threw herself into a rocking chair and rocked herself with unusual violence, reflecting upon what Mrs. Watson had said and breathing very hard.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW WOMEN WILL SOMETIMES SEEK REVENGE-THE CHARACTER OF A MILITARY OFFICER-THE PLOT THICKENS.</head> 
                  <p>Mrs. Barlow was a fine dashing widow, left without children and possessing a handsome fortune. Her husband had not been dead more than four months ere she began to cast about for some other man to share her heart and her fortune. She lived directly opposite to Miss Spiker's residence, but they had never visited each other, for Mrs. Barlow considered herself one remove at least above Miss Tabitha, and the latter knew it. This would have been enough to make Miss Spiker despise and hate her; but there was another, a deeper, a more aggravating cause of disquietude on her part. Mr. Pips had always been in the habit of visiting Mr. Barlow and his wife before the former's decease. That was all well enough even in the opinion of Tabitha, but Mr. Pips still continued his visits after the husband's death, and more frequently. The widow was full of life and animation, and once promised Mr. Pips that she would accompany him on an angling excursion if he would take care of her and show her how to kill the beautiful trout. So far as prudent, economical house-keeping was concerned, Miss Spiker was greatly Mrs. Barlow's superior; but in talking, laughing, joking and entertaining, wine-drinking and whist-playing company, Mrs. Barlow far excelled Miss Spiker. When death lets loose such a woman from a husband who has a long time been debilitated and confined by sickness, she is apt to throw off the habiliments of mourning too soon, or, if she still continues to wear them, to forget her situation and to join in the <unclear>loud</unclear> laugh and the merry song. It was so with Mrs. Barlow, insomuch that some of her acquaintances began to talk about her, especially those mothers who had daughters they wished to dispose of in marriage, to the best possible advantage.</p> 
                  <p>But the widow Barlow was perfectly independent and cared for nobody. She dashed along regardless of the slanders of foes or the remonstrances of friends. In person, she was quite short and thick-set, yet her motions were quick and somewhat graceful. She was round and plump, with bright, laughing blue eyes, oval face, auburn hair, small feet and hands, and well shaped arms. Her neck was short, but her shoulders had a fine slope, which in some good degree atoned for the shortness of her neck, and made her look taller than she really was. Miss Spiker always hated such <choice>

                     </choice> form as Mrs. Barlow's, and did not hesitate to make fun of it. She nicknamed her "Mrs. Chubby." The widow heard of this through Jimmy McCrate, her coachman, and in the spirit of retaliation called Tabitha, Miss Spike. Jimmy told Mary Campbell the name his mistress had given Miss Spiker, and Mary communicated it to her mistress. These small trifles made those ladies enemies to each other. No doubt Tibitha was the first aggressor, and the widow was not slow in performing any part of life's drama which circumstances might assign her. Mrs. Barlow one day went so far as to put a bonnet on the end of a rod seven feet long, and thrust it out from her chamber window which fronted Tabitha's. That was not in good taste, but the widow was so vexed at being called Mrs. Chubby that she thirsted for revenge, and was not at all scrupulous about the means she employed to gratify that thirst. The rod and bonnet did not long <choice>

                     </choice> out of the window, but long enough, however, for Miss Spiker and Mary Campbell to see it. Tabitha was greatly enraged, and Mary laughed as if she would burst her sides, especially when she was away from her mistress, for it would not do for her thus to laugh in her presence. Miss Spiker taxed her ingenuity most severely, to get up something as an off-set to the rod and bonnet, but she could hit upon nothing that seemed to satisfy her; and at last consulted the Scotch girl upon the subject. Mary delighted in such sport, and the coachman slyly winked at it. Jimmy was a very cautious, discreet, as well as genteel young man, and would not wish to do any act which might derogate from these <choice>
                        <sic>qualites</sic>
                        <corr>qualities</corr>
                     </choice>, on which he so much prided himself.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha had a small churn which once belonged to her grandmother, who lived in the country. This churn was a sort of heir-loom in the family, and Miss Spiker had always taken special care of it because it was her grandmother's. In fact, Tabitha took very special care of everything, so that nothing was lost.</p> 
                  <p>"What shall I do, Mary, to come up with Mrs. Chubby?" asked Tabitha, the same day the rod and bonnet appeared from the window opposite. "I have been thinking what I shall do, for I am determined to come up with her in some way. She's a very saucy woman; she feels vexed, I suppose, because Mr. Pips tarries longer with me than he does with her."</p> 
                  <p>"A bonnet on that little old churn, set on the window stool," replied Mary, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Good gracious, you've hit it exactly!" exclaimed Tibitha, running into the kitchen and bringing out the churn.</p> 
                  <p>The churn was soon rigged out with an old bonnet, and placed in the chamber window. Tabitha and Mary occupied the same room, and placed themselves so as to see out of the other window, and look across the street. Most anxiously did Miss Spiker watch to see when the widow might discover the churn and bonnet. She was in high glee, and felt as if she had done something that must forever put down the saucy, dashing widow. For nearly an hour did she and Mary watch by that window without seeing Mrs. Barlow, or any movement on her part.</p> 
                  <p>"The saucy woman don't seem to be stirring," said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"She'll see her image ere long," replied Mary. "There, Jimmy, her coachman, comes with her carriage. She's going to take a ride. When she comes out she will make the discovery, I hope."</p> 
                  <p>Jimmy drove up to the door, and as he sat upon the box he turned his eyes towards the window in hopes of getting a glimpse of Mary's lovely face, as he was went their wonted places. The girl appeared to be very fond of the old lady, and hung round her as a child round its grandmother. Miss Spiker noticed every movement of Jenny, and marked every lineament of her lovely face. The more she gazed upon her and observed the expressions of her countenance, the more striking resemblance to Mr. Pips she thought she discerned, until she began to wish the child had been left with her, instead of being placed under the care of Mrs. Watson. Although she believed Mr. Pips was really the father of the lovely girl, yet she would have been glad to have the care of her. Perhaps, she thought that if she had the little girl it might be the means of smoothing the path to her marriage with Mr. Pips, a matter which seemed now more questionable than ever before. Her love was that of a peculiar character, and mixed with so much earthly matter that it could bear more severe crosses and put up with more offences than a younger and purer affection could. Having fixed her heart upon this marriage and fully resolved to accomplish it, she could pass over some things and deem them trifles, which a warmer, purer and less earthly passion might have considered mountains and impassable barriers. Love in a maiden of her advanced age and peculiar temperament is a very different emotion from that felt by a younger, more enthusiastic and less calculating heart. True, Miss Spiker had a very great theory in love affairs, but it played more around her head than operated upon her heart. It has already been seen that her affection for Mr. Pips would sometimes be spasmodic and exhibit intense momentary feeling, but those violent spasms would soon pass off and leave a kind of earthly dross behind which had more of cold calculation in it than any thing spiritual or pure.</p> 
                  <p>After much deliberation and reflection upon the subject, and turning the matter over in her mind so that she could see it in every aspect, she thought it advisable to sound the old lady and find out whether she would be willing to part with the little girl upon any condition.</p> 
                  <p>"You're so old now, I shouldn't think you would wish to have the care of a child," said Miss Spiker.</p> 
                  <p>"Never too old to love such a sweet creature as little Jenny," replied the widow. "Old, forsooth! I guess I know how to bring up children better than some younger people who never had any, nor never will have."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't doubt your charity," said the maiden. "I only spoke of the trouble it might occasion you. Children are always more or less troublesome.</p> 
                  <p>"If you had such a girl as Jenny, I reckon you would not think her troublesome," replied the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose not," said Tabitha. "I will take Jenny off your hands, and take good care of her, and you may keep the money."</p> 
                  <p>"You will eh?" said the widow. "Not while I live, none shall have Jenny, but those who have a better right to her than I have. Besides, I didn't tell you I received a sealed package from the woman, which is not to be opened until I'm authorized by letter. The package may contain something very valuable."</p> 
                  <p>"A package!" repeated Tabitha. "A sealed package! Let me see it. Perhaps I may know the hand-writing upon the outside."</p> 
                  <p>"Are you acquainted with the writing of Mr. Pips?" asked the old lady. "Who knows but it may contain his will? Stranger things have happened in the world!"</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha's curiosity was excited to the highest pitch, and the old lady went to her bureau and took out the package, which Tabitha examined with strange emotions and feelings. She discussed her peculiar theory of love with all the power she possessed. She had once seen his hand-writing, and from that circumstance she felt qualified to judge of it. She examined the superscription upon the package, turned it upside down and viewed it in every conceivable way before she ventured to express an opinion. The widow's eyes were upon her, for she began to believe Mr. Pips might have sent the package.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you think?" asked the widow, while Tabitha was looking at it, feeling it, and trying to peep into the inside of it.</p> 
                  <p>"It seems to me that the hand-writing bears much resemblance to that of Mr. Pips." replied Tabitha, pressing the package between her thumb and finger, as if she would read its contents by that process.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you really think so?" anxiously inquired the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"I do," replied Tabitha, still feeling the package.</p> 
                  <p>"There's some great mystery involved in this," said the widow, beginning to think Mr. Pips had made his will and gone to parts unknown, if he was not actually dead.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed there is, and if I were you I should wish to know what all this means," said Tabitha. "If I were placed in your situation I should open the package by all means. It might be done and no one ever know it. No doubt you will receive a letter through the post office before many weeks authorising you to open it; therefore there can be no great harm in anticipating that event."</p> 
                  <p>"O, I wouldn't open it for the world!" replied the good old lady. "I have solemnly promised not to do so until I have liberty, and will keep my promise as sacred as the apple of my eye."</p> 
                  <p>The hope of Tabitha was instantly crushed, not more by the words of the honest widow than by her manner.</p> 
                  <p>"There's a mystery hanging over this affair I cannot comprehend," said Tabitha, assuming a very serious aspect and looking very thoughtful. "Can it be possible? Yes, it may be true that Mr. Pips has gone forever! O, heavens! he may be dead this very moment! I shouldn't be surprised if the package contained something about me. He said at our last interview just as he was about to leave, and while holding my hand, that if he never returned again he hoped my life would be a happy one! O, how fresh those words now seem in my mind! It seems to me that I can almost hear the peculiar tones in which he uttered them, see the expression of his countenance and fool the warm pressure of his hand! If he has gone never to return, he must have written something about me in this package. Perhaps it contains for me, a lock of hair, and perhaps something about his little girl!"</p> 
                  <p>And Tabitha seized Jenny and almost smothered her with kisses; but the child broke away from her as soon as she could, ran to the widow and buried her face in her lap. Tabitha's mind was in a very peculiar state. She was so excited that she was ready to believe almost any thing. Even the wildest flights of her imagination she would receive as realities. And it must be confessed the widow was so operated upon by the mysterious affair, and the influence of Tabitha that she was not in full possession of her sober senses. Every moment the affair assumed a stranger and more mysterious aspect. Tabitha ached all over to see <unclear>the</unclear> contents of the package, and the widow's curiosity was hardly less. Miss Spiker urged the opening of the package with all the ingenuity she was mistress of. And there were periods in her arguments when she fancied the widow was about to yield and break the seal. In Mrs. Watson's heart there was a most violent struggle between curiosity and her conscience, between inclination and duty. But her honor and integrity came off victorious over all temptations from within and from without. She put back the package into her drawer and locked it up.</p> 
                  <p>"There, Miss Spiker, it must lay in this drawer until I have authority to open it," she, said. "I have made a most solemn promise and I must keep it in spite of all the temptations that may beset me. I am at anxious as you are to have this mystery unfolded, but I must wait for the proper time. No doubt I shall see the woman again who left it with me."</p> 
                  <p>"O, would to Heaven I could be present when she comes!" exclaimed Tabitha. "It seems to me I could induce her to tell us all she knows!"</p> 
                  <p>"I think you could not get a word from her," replied the widow. "I tried her every way I could think of, but in vain. She's a very cunning woman."</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt of it, or she could never have led Mr Pips astray from the path of virtue, which he has uniformly trod," answered Tabitha. "But I would tell her the relation which I sustain towards Mr. Pips, and that might induce her to reveal the secret."</p> 
                  <p>"What relation?" demanded the widow in surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"The relation our courtship establishes between us," coolly replied Miss Spiker. "That would excite the woman and she would divulge all."</p> 
                  <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6823-00000028"/> 
                  <p>to do, for she often sat in that chamber to watch the tide of humanity as it rolled by. He smiled and brought his hand suddenly down up his thigh, as if he had discovered something that pleased him. Mary saw his smile and his movement.</p> 
                  <p>"Jimmy sees it!" whispered Mary. "See him look and laugh! He's a pleasant fellow."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope he will tell Mrs. Chubby," said Tabitha, stretching her long, slim neck, that she might see every movement."</p> 
                  <p>"He will point it out to her," replied Mary, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>The coachman now descended from the carriage, and the widow came dashing out. Tabitha's heart beat against her slender sides, and Mary's blue eyes were fastened upon Jimmy and the widow. At last the coachman pointed with his whip towards the bonnet and the churn.</p> 
                  <p>"See!" whispered Mary: "Now look out for an explosion. She will soon see her image!"</p> 
                  <p>"By the powers, mistress Barlow, the elderly maiden opposite is after making butter," said the coachman. "See, she has got out her churn."</p> 
                  <p>"The saucy, ill bred Miss Spike!" exclaimed the widow as she turned her eyes in the direction Jimmy had pointed with his whip. "I'll pay her for that!"</p> 
                  <p>And back she hurried into the house, and soon the rod and bonnet were thrust from her chamber window. Standing on one side of the window so as not to be seen, she made the rod and bonnet dance quite a jig. Miss Spiker saw the whole, and seized the churn with both hands, and made that dance so violently that the bonnet fell off and dropped down upon the side-walk. But that accident did not discourage her, for she still kept the churn going up and down with rapid motions. The coachman smiled, and Mary laid down upon the floor, rolled over and laughed most heartily. The widow also kept the rod and bonnet going, determined not to be beaten by the old maid Spike, as she now mentally called her antagonist. For the full space of ten minutes these ladies continued to make these representatives of each other dance in a very merry mood. At last Miss Spiker, being somewhat fatigued with her violent exercise, lost her hold of the churn and it tumbled upon the sidewalk and broke into many pieces.</p> 
                  <p>Although the genteel coachman seldom allowed himself to laugh loud, deeming such an act a violation of the rules of politeness, yet on this occasion he could not restrain himself within the bounds he had prescribed for his conduct, and broke out in a fit of loud laughter.</p> 
                  <p>"There, my grandmother's churn is gone!" exclaimed Tabitha, running her head out of the window, and looking down upon the broken fragments of the precious heir-loom.</p> 
                  <p>The widow Barlow joined her coachman in a round of laughter, took in the rod and bonnet and went down, feeling as if victory was hers, this time, at least. She soon entered her carriage and was driven off.</p> 
                  <p>"Do run down, Mary, and gather up the pieces of my churn," continued Tabitha. "They must be glued together again. I have kept that churn ever since I was a little girl, and it mus'nt be lost now."</p> 
                  <p>The cunning Scotch maiden was so much weakened by her violent laughter that she could hardly obey the orders of her mistress. After awhile, however, she did gather up all the fragments and brought them into the house. It was a terrible accident, and the churn was so essentially smashed that it required a good deal of mechanical skill and ingenuity to put it together again.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Tabitha, lifting up both hands, and gazing upon the pile of fragments. "How terribly the churn is broken! We must contrive some way to put it together again!"</p> 
                  <p>"I think we can do it, if we can't we must employ Mr. Cameron, the watchmaker," replied Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll find some old glue in a tin cannister on the upper shelf in the closet," said Tabitha, gathering up the pieces and trying to put them together.</p> 
                  <p>By perseverance, industry and the mechanical skill of Mary, the churn, in the course of the day was mended, but such mending did not improve it as it does an old violin. The churn never looked so well after it was broken and mended as it did before; still it answered as a memento of a good old grandmother long since deceased. We have been thus particular in giving an account of the above transaction because it furnishes a good insight into human character, and shows how extremely ridiculous some people will make them selves, when they get by the ears, become prejudiced, and seek for revenge. Women as well as men are but children of a larger growth. Mrs. Barlow took her airing in the carriage, and felt exceedingly happy during her ride in thinking of the broken churn. Strange it may seem to the sober, sedate and reflecting, that such a trifling, nay, foolish and ridiculous circumstance, should have so much effect upon a woman's mind, but nevertheless it is true. The dashing widow felt as if she had gained a great conquest, and Miss Spiker was so revengeful that she wished Mrs. Barlow had fallen out of the window in place of her churn. But the churn affair was not the only source of trouble and disquietude to Miss Tabitha Spiker, which seemed now to surround her. Little Jenny, the sealed package, the strange woman, and the continued absence of Mr. Tom Pips, all troubled her exceedingly. And the prophecy of Mrs. Watson, that Pips would never marry a lady unless she was young and handsome, haunted her like a ghost, and caused her many sleepless nights and troublesome days. The only redeeming quality of this prophecy was the hope it held out that Pips would never wed the dashing Mrs. Barlow; for she was not young, and Tabitha considered her far from being beautiful. To the maiden, there was some comfort in that consideration. She was but three or four years the senior of Mrs. Barlow, and she flattered herself that she was much the better looking not with standing her slender form and long limbs.</p> 
                  <p>Just as the widow Barlow returned from her ride, Major Lenox called to make her a visit. Previous to her husband's death she had but a very slight acquaintance with the major, but since that mournful event he had called upon her quite often, and endeavored to make himself a very agreeable companion. The major had never been married, yet he was a great lover of the ladies, and exceedingly fond of female society. He was a fine looking man, and considered a very brave one. He somewhat distinguished himself in the war of 1812, and was engaged in several skirmishes on the Canada lines. There were some ladies who considered the moral principles of the major rather loose; at least, so far as woman might be concerned. It is true he was too apt to deem a woman a kind of plaything for an hour, rather than a companion for life; and yet he so managed as to preserve a respectable standing among men. Possessing a handsome person, well educated, and having seen much of the world, he could make himself a very agreeable and interesting companion. Whether he had his eye on the widow Barlow for evil or for good, it is not now in our province to consider. That he was pleased with the dashing, lively, and sociable ways of the widow was very evident to all observers. She too received him with some favor, but with not so much as she did Mr. Pips, who was her favorite. The long absence of Pips gave the major a fine opportunity to pay his addresses to the widow which he did not fail to improve. He and Pips were very intimate friends, and he knew that his friend Pips had no serious intentions of wedding Mrs. Barlow, but she was setting her cap for him, and therefore he did not crowd himself upon her society so much as he might under other and more favorable circumstances. Pips being absent and much longer than he or his friends expected when he went away, the major was unusually attentive to the dashing widow; and it may be acknowledged, as well here as elsewhere, in these chronicles, that she began to think more and more favorably of his addresses. He was much older than she was and a few years the senior of Mr. Pips; but the major's manners were always fresh and apparently youthful. The truth is, he was a more jolly companion than Pips, but the widow had a sort of vague impression that Pips was not only the more true hearted man, but less hackneyed in the ways of the world. She fancied the major's heart had been love-stricken too many times, while she knew that Pips had never loved but once, and that when he was quite a young man. Now, although the widow was a sort of a dashing and apparently reckless character, yet in her notions about love she was quite fastidious, and did not highly esteem a man as a companion for her, who had been running after too many women The widow was right here, and her notions must be commended. She hardly knew what to think of his increasing attentions. Whether he really designed to marry her, if she would consent to such an arrangement, she had some serious doubts and misgivings; but our readers may be assured that such was the intention of this military officer. Being somewhat advanced in years and recently reduced in his pecuniary means, he thought it would be a very desirable thing to take the widow and settle down for the remainder of his life. She had a fine house, a good carriage, a handsome income, and a jolly fat person, all which entered deeply into his calculations, and made him look upon her as a very desirable companion, in his present circumstances. Besides, the major was a shrewd man, and thought he could do as many other husbands do in high life, occasionally stray away from his wife, and follow the bent of his inclinations keeping her in the dark. Such were some of the motives which governed the major, and induced him to press his suit with the widow Barlow.</p> 
                  <p>He called just before she was driven up by her coachman, and stood with his hand upon the bell-knob about to ring, as the carriage stopped at the door. She alighted from her carriage, assisted by her polite coachman, and invited the major in. Miss Spiker saw him at the door before the carriage drove up.</p> 
                  <p>"There, that Major Lenox has called again upon Mrs. Chubby," said Tabitha to Mary Campbell. "I don't think much of his character. Any woman who will receive his attentions cannot be very virtuous. I believe he's a very roguish man; and I have heard others express the same opinion too-ladies who know him better than I do, or ever wish to know him. Since Mr. Pips' absence he has called quite often at the widow's. I shall inform Mr. Pips, and advise him not to visit even in a friendly way, one who receives the attentions of such a man as Major Lenox. It is not reputable, and Mr. Pips will suffer in his reputation if he does so."</p> 
                  <p>"These military officers are no better than they should be," replied Mary. "The camp is na gude place to learn morals, I often heard my mither say."</p> 
                  <p>"Nobody can tell how many female hearts that major has broken!" said Tabitha, gazing across the street. "There, she has invited him in, of course!"</p> 
                  <p>And they engaged again in their work of mending the churn, while the major was ushered into a richly furnished parlor, and threw himself upon a sofa. The widow seated herself not far from him.</p> 
                  <p>"You took a fine day for riding," said the major. "The weather is very pleasant."</p> 
                  <p>"I think riding is beneficial to my health, major, she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt of that, madam," he answered, gazing upon her and even venturing to lay his hand upon her forehead. "You have a fine glow of health upon your face. Oh, Mrs. Barlow, health in man or woman is a great blessing. I have always enjoyed fine health, yet in my early life I was much exposed in the camp and field."</p> 
                  <p>He had never before made himself quite so familiar with her, and she hardly knew what to think of him. But she did not motion his hand from her forehead, but let it remain at his own pleasure. He smoothed back her hair and withdrew his hand very gracefully. She was silent and reserved.</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Barlow," he continued in a subdued tone of voice, as if he was about to divulge some great secret. "I don't know but I visit your house more than may be agreeable to you; but I have none other than the most honorable intentions."</p> 
                  <p>"Major Lenox!" she replied, "you very much surprise me!"</p> 
                  <p>"It may be so, but for a long time I have been wishing to relieve my heart of so great a burthen," he said, "and I must take this opportunity to do it. Mrs. Barlow, believe me, when I say that you have made such an impression upon my heart, as no other woman ever made!"</p> 
                  <p>"Major Lenox!" she answered, manifesting much surprise, "You have seen many ladies in the course of your eventful life, and it seems very strange to me that your heart has never been touched so before. It does not become me to dispute any gentleman's word, but you must pardon me when I say it seems very strange."</p> 
                  <p>"No stranger than true, he responded. "I would not make the declaration I now have, upon slight considerations. Depend upon it, I have maturely deliberated upon the affair, and I now offer you my hand and my heart, and I do so with the utmost sincerity and good faith."</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot imagine, Major Lenox, what there is about me that should thus arrest your attention and impress your heart," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"It is not for yourself but for me to make that discovery," he answered. "It is an old adage that love goes wherever it is sent. That I love you sincerely, deeply, I know, I feel, but why and wherefore, it is not for me to say. There are a thousand things sees by the eye of affection, which the tongue cannot express. But of one thing I am as sure as I am of my own existence."</p> 
                  <p>"And what is that?" she asked, while he took her hand and pressed it.</p> 
                  <p>"That if you were in any way different from what you are, I should not thus love you," he replied. "That is the best reason I can give for the affection I entertain for you, and you must acknowledge it is a comprehensive one."</p> 
                  <p>"Very indeed!" she replied. "Then, I suppose, if my eyes had been coal black instead of deep blue, your feelings would have been different."</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt of it," he answered. "You are in every particular just as I would have you. Not a hair of your head would I have changed. And surely I wouldn't have this hand exchanged for any other for the world."</p> 
                  <p>He still held her hand, which was small, flat, and beautifully shaped, and she knew it. He had succeeded in touching a right chord. The major was not a fool, for he had selected one of her most beautiful features, and bestowed his praise upon that. And, how could she now think otherwise than that he was a gentleman of refined and cultivated taste? He had selected that for his special praise, which she most prized herself; but she did not stop there, but put him to further tests.</p> 
                  <p>"Nor my house furniture, horses and carriage," she replied quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh my dear Mrs. Barlow, you wrong me there," he answered. Upon those things I have not bestowed a single passing thought."</p> 
                  <p>"If I were absolutely poor and struggling against the tide of adversity, think you Major Lenox, that my hand would appear to you quite so beautiful?" she asked, gently withdrawing it from his somewhat nervous grasp.</p> 
                  <p>"There are some things in this world, Mrs. Barlow, which the flinching hand of poverty cannot change, nor the winds of <choice>
                        <sic>adverity</sic>
                        <corr>adversity</corr>
                     </choice> destroy," he answered. "Were you poor as any beggar that walks our streets. I should even love you the more instead of less. No no, my dear Mrs. Barlow, you must not wrong me thus. I deserve a better fate at your hands."</p> 
                  <p>"A gentleman's tongue is a very convenient member," she said, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"And a lady's does not often come amiss," he replied, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"But to be serious, for so I consider your declarations," she said, assuming a more serious aspect. "You have taken me by surprise, and I must take time for consideration."</p> 
                  <p>"O, certainly, my dear Mrs. Barlow," he answered. "I hope I have too much good sense, if not politeness, to press my suit unreasonably. I have divulged the secret which has long been in my heart, and I now feel relieved. As my heart dictated, my lips have spoken."</p> 
                  <p>"I will not dispute your word, major." she said. "But what do you think has become of our mutual friend, Mr. Pips? He has been absent much longer than he expected."</p> 
                  <p>The above question poured cold water upon the officer's heart. She might have inquired for any other living man, and it would not have disturbed his feelings; but he controlled the emotions the inquiry had excited in his breast, and appeared unmoved, for so it was for his interest to appear.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed I cannot tell," he replied. "Pips is very fond of angling. If he's not careful he may be drowned in some of the lakes or streams one of these<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6823-00000029"/> days. Angling has become a passion with him, and like Aaron's rod swallows up all the rest."</p> 
                  <p>The major intended to have her believe that Pips loved trouting more then ever he could a woman or anything else in the world; but she did not, or would not, take his meaning.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips has a tender heart and is exceedingly kind," she said. "Such a man would love his wife most dearly."</p> 
                  <p>"He might, if it were not for his rifle and fishing-rod These absorb all his thoughts."</p> 
                  <p>"Not all, I trust," she answered. "Mr. Pips has a heart to love a good many things beside the sports of hunting and fishing."</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips is a fine man and far be it from me to say aught against him; but the woman who marries him must be content with his absence, through the summer months at least. I know his passion for the woods and the lakes. You would be astonished to see how patiently he will hold his fishing rod for hours and hours, without feeling a bite. Now, I have no such fund of patience I must confess. So long as Mr. Pips can place one foot before the other, he will hunt and fish in spite of everything else."</p> 
                  <p>The widow still continued to praise Pips, for she noticed that such praise did move the major in spite of all his self control. He made a longer visit than usual, and on the whole he considered it rather a favorable one. The widow had taken time for consideration, and he very well knew that she desired to see Pips, before she gave her final answer. That consideration somewhat disturbed his feelings, still he did not believe Pips ever thought seriously of making a wife of Mrs. Barlow.</p>

                  <head type="sub">INTERVIEW BETWEEN TABITHA SPIKER AND THE WIDOW BARLOW-THE STRANGE WOMAN AGAIN.</head> 
                  <p>Miss Tabitha Spiker could keep away from Mrs. Watson's no longer. A whole week had elapsed since she saw little Jenny, and heard how strangely she had been left with the old lady. There was so much mystery hanging over the affair that she was resolved to penetrate it if possible. Her convictions that Mr. Pips was the father of the child lost none of their force, but on the contrary, they became strengthened by time and her reflections. The sealed package! That was the very thing she wanted to pry into above all others She began to think seriously that it contained the will of Pips, and that he had gone away for good, or possibly, that he might be dead. A thousand conflicting thoughts troubled her mind and increased her curiosity. It Pips had made his will she flattered herself that she must form one of the subjects of it. Again she was anxious to know if Mrs. Watson had seen the strange woman since their last interview, the woman, who she firmly believed was the mother of the little girl. Full of such thoughts, feelings, emotions and suspicions. She hurried to the humble dwelling of the old lady. When she entered the room Jenny nodded her head and smiled. Tabitha could not <unclear>refrain</unclear> from kissing the child.</p> 
                  <p>"Any more news?" inquired Tabitha. "Has that woman been here?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have nothing from her or from any one else," replied the old lady. "And I begin to think that the mother of Jenny has murdered Mr. Pips and left the child with me."</p> 
                  <p>"O, dreadful thought!" exclaimed Tabitha, raising up her long arms and looking wildly about. "I shouldn't wonder a bit if such was the case. The base woman first led Mr. Pips astray, and then because he could not love her and would not marry her, she poisoned him, perhaps, or plunged a dagger into his good and tender heart! O, the thought oppresses me dreadfully!"</p> 
                  <p>These ladies were not very well calculated to comfort each other under the circumstances. Their minds had become greatly excited and their imaginations led them most shocking jaunts.</p> 
                  <p>"It may be so, for Mr. Pips could never love such a woman," replied Mrs. Watson. "Why, she's nearly thirty years old, and not very handsome."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha started at such a declaration, and replied: "it wasn't the woman's age but her character! No wonder he couldn't love such a vile woman! I wish I could see her! I would make her disclose some of her terrible secrets!"</p> 
                  <p>"O, it can't be done by any human power!" replied the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"I would try my power and skill one while," said Tabitha. "You've received no letter to open the package, I suppose. And I don't believe you ever will. I would see what it all means."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, my promise, my promise!" said the old lady. I must not break that!"</p> 
                  <p>"By doing so, you might perhaps, discover that a murder had been committed," said Tabitha. "It seems to me it is your duty to open it in spite of your promise to that vile woman!"</p> 
                  <p>The old lady was silent and thoughtful, and Tabitha began to hope that she had hit upon an argument that would convince Mrs. Watson that it was really her duty to open the package. Both were silent and remained so for a long time. The old lady was deeply thinking upon the question and the excited maiden was ardently hoping she might soon see the contents of the package. It was a solemn time with both. While they were thus wrapped in their own thoughts a knocking was heard at the door, and a strange woman entered. Tabitha was terribly excited, for at once she concluded that she could be no other than the mother of Jenny. The child recognized her, but did not fly towards her as one to a mother's arms. In fact, Jenny did not seem to have had but a slight acquaintance with the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"O, what an unnatural meeting between mother and child!" thought Tabitha, but she kept silent and fastened her eyes on the supposed mother in a fixed gaze.</p> 
                  <p>"Little Jenny seems to be quite contented with you madam," said the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"She is indeed," replied the old lady. "Did you have much acquaintance with her before you brought her here!"</p> 
                  <p>"I have always told you not to question me about Jenny," said the woman. "I really wish you would not. You may hear more about her some of these days, but I am under the same obligations to keep silent as you are not to open the pack age I left with you. I hope we shall both respect our obligations and hold them sacred."</p> 
                  <p>"There are some promises which ought not to be kept," said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"I agree with you, madam," answered the woman. "You name a case, and I'll name one."</p> 
                  <p>"If I promise to conceal a murder on condition that a person will confess the crime, I should not be holden by such an obligation to keep the secret," replied Tabitha. "It would be a duty I owed to society to divulge the secret and have the murderer arrested and punished."</p> 
                  <p>"That may be so," said the woman. "Now I will mention another case. Suppose you were courted by a gentleman whom you considered an honorable man, and he should afterwards turn out to be a villian, should you feel obliged to keep your promise?"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed I should not," replied Tabitha, with a good deal of earnestness. "The case you mention is a very strong one. The old lady, here, and myself are very anxious to find out the father of this little girl."</p> 
                  <p>"Have you ever been acquainted with a man whose name is Mr. Tom Pips?" asked Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"I think I have seen him," replied the woman. "He is very fond of angling, is he not?"</p> 
                  <p>"There, I knew the whole secret would come out!" exclaimed Tabitha. "Mr. Pips is a tender hearted man. He once loved this old lady's daughter, who died, and latterly he has paid marked attentions to me. He has long been absent. Do you know where he is now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, madam, I do not," answered the woman. "Why are you so anxious about him? What has he to do with the secret you are so anxious to find out?"</p> 
                  <p>"That is better known to you, madam," replied Tabitha. "That little girl's face resembles Mr. Pips', and permit me to say that I see some features in her which resemble you."</p> 
                  <p>"The inference then is, that Mr. Pips is the father and I am the mother of the child," said the woman, smiling "Well, I must confess, imagination does sometimes work wonders. You can see resemblances which no other mortal can trace."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you pretend to deny that you are the mother of this little girl?" demanded Tabitha, waxing quite warm, and feeling as if she had found out the mother beyond doubt or question.</p> 
                  <p>"When I am directly accused of the fact, then it will be time enough for me to demand the proof," replied the woman, gazing sternly upon Miss Spiker.</p> 
                  <p>"I directly accuse you of it," said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Then I demand the proof," answered the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"The proof is in the sealed package you left with Mrs. Watson," said Tabitha. "I have not a doubt but there it can be found."</p> 
                  <p>"What is in that package I am not at liberty to tell, but what is not there I can talk about," said the woman. "The proof you speak of is not there, neither can it be found in the world. I am not the mother of little Jenny."</p> 
                  <p>This last sentence was spoken with a force and directness which threw Tabitha from her balance and shook her faith. She made no answer, for she was for the moment <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hors du combat</foreign>.</p> 
                  <p>"I hope you will receive my words as true," continued the woman. "Little Jenny claims a better mother than I could make, younger, handsomer and more lovely."</p> 
                  <p>"There, there, I told you so," said the old lady, addressing Tabitha. "Mr. Pips always told me he couldn't love any one else, unless she was young, handsome and lovely as my daughter was."</p> 
                  <p>Miss Spiker was greatly agitated and walked about the room with much emotion. The woman did not understand all the secret springs of the movements she saw before her, but she guessed out some of them.</p> 
                  <p>"You seem agitated," continued the woman. "I hope my not being the mother of little Jenny does not disturb your nerves. Surely I do not wish to claim any honor that does not belong to me."</p> 
                  <p>"You don't understand it," said the old lady. "Another thing troubles her besides that."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha looked cross at Mrs. Watson, who spoke the truth in the honest simplicity of her heart, but the maiden did not desire such truth to be spoken.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish, Mrs. Watson, you would be quiet, and let me manage this case in my own way," said Tabitha, manifesting some ill feeling upon the occasion, and burning up with a desire to know the contents of the sealed package.</p> 
                  <p>"I always told you that the woman would give you no information," replied the querulous old lady. "She is as bright as you are, any day."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha snapped her fingers, walked three steps violently, then stopped, raised her arms, gazed upon the woman, and then walked again. The strange woman smiled, but that only increased Miss Spiker's agitation, and hastened her speed as she paraded about the room. At last she turned round, and facing the woman, said.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know your name, but I still believe you are the mother of the child, and that you have led astray from the path of virtue, the good, the tender-hearted Mr. Pips. You may deny it as much as you please, but you will never convince me to the contrary."</p> 
                  <p>"Suppose I should let you see the contents of the sealed package, which would give the lie to all you have said, would you then believe what I have said is the truth?" asked the woman.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I should," replied Tabitha, drawing in her horns, and beginning to feel quite full of hope that she would learn the secrets of the package.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I shall never let you see what the package contains," said the woman.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha's hopes were as suddenly crushed as they had been raised. She stood in the middle of the floor straight as a may-pole and motionless as a statue, while the woman gazed upon her with much delight and satisfaction. And although Mrs. Watson was very curious to know the secrets of the package, yet she couldn't help feeling gratified at the sore disappointment of Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"You're somewhat disappointed, I perceive," continued the woman, looking very calm and composed, and laughing in her sleeve at poor Tabitha Spiker.</p> 
                  <p>"I believe you're not a virtuous woman," said Miss Spiker, in a sharp, shrill voice.</p> 
                  <p>"You can't offend me by any thing you can say," replied the woman. "It is quite possible you may be a virtuous woman, for your peculiar form, sharp features and disagreeable manners cannot fail to shield you from temptation."</p> 
                  <p>The old lady laughed quite loud, in spite of her efforts to restrain herself, and Tabitha was in a rage that scarcely knew any bounds. The woman expected Tabitha would make an assault upon her, but she did not fear her, for her physical strength was sufficient to protect her from all harm. Tabitha walked round her, and the ends or her fingers trembled. She was upon the point of fastening her nails into the woman's checks, when a carriage drove up, and the widow Barlow alighted.</p> 
                  <p>"Farewell. Keep your promise, Mrs. Watson, and suffer not that package to be seen by any one," said the strange woman, leaving the house as the widow Barlow came bustling in.</p> 
                  <p>Here was a strange meeting and a very unpleasant one. Tabitha and Mrs. Barlow gazed upon each other in silence, and their feelings may be imagined but not very easily described. The dashing widow had no particular acquaintance with the old lady, and had hardly ever seen her, but she knew that Mr. Pips was a very particular friend of the old lady and came to inquire about him. As the reader will at once anticipate, Mrs. Barlow was anxious to see Mr. Pips before she gave her final answer to Major Lenox, and she expected Mrs. Watson could give her some information about him. There was a dead silence for some minutes after Mrs. Barlow entered the room. The old lady knew not who she was, bat the thought struck her at once that she must be the mother of little Jenny, who stood partially leaning upon her and gazing into the dashing widow's round, fat face. Mrs. Barlow's mind was so much absorbed in thinking of Tabitha, and her being there, that she could not think of any thing else, and hardly noticed the old lady and the child. Mrs. Barlow and Tabitha knew very well the motives of each other in coming to this humble dwelling. At last the former addressed the old lady and asked for a private interview when she might be <choice>
                        <sic>at at</sic>
                        <corr>at</corr>
                     </choice> leisure.</p> 
                  <p>"We can now go into another room," said the old lady. "I suppose you wish to know something about this dear little girl and how she gets along. Come, we'll go into another room."</p> 
                  <p>They did so, and left Miss Spiker alone, who was determined not to leave, however impolitely the old lady had treated her. Other suspicious now crowded the mind of Miss Spiker, and she began to think that the widow Barlow knew the history of little Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips has not returned, has he?" asked Mrs. Barlow in a voice scarcely above a whisper, lest Tabitha might place her ear at the door and overhear.</p> 
                  <p>"Then he's the father of this little girl" said the old lady, hugging and kissing Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, madam, you astound me!" replied Mrs. Barlow. "Mr. Pips the father of that little girl! Do, for heaven's sake, explain yourself. I don't understand all this!"</p> 
                  <p>"Nor I either," replied the old lady. "There's a great mystery about it!"</p> 
                  <p>"A great mystery! sure enough!" said Mrs. Barlow. "Do explain yourself, and keep me in suspense no longer."</p> 
                  <p>The old lady now very minutely gave a history of all the circumstances, how the child was brought to her, and the sealed package that was left at the same time. Mrs. Barlow listened with intense interest, and began to believe that Mr. Pips was really the father of Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"And do you think that the woman who left as I came in, is the mother?" asked Mrs. Barlow.</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot tell," replied the old lady. "She denies being the mother, but she will not tell who the child's parents are."</p> 
                  <p>"Mystery upon mystery," said Mrs. Barlow. "I fear the worst. The fact of the child being brought to you, the long absence of Mr. Pips, the hundred dollars, the strange conduct of the woman, her looks and intelligence, the scaled package-all point to Mr. Pips as the father of the child! He may not return for a long time!"</p> 
                  <p>"I have the same impressions!" said the old lady<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6823-00000030"/> "Miss Spiker advised me to open the package and see what it all means."</p> 
                  <p>"Miss Spiker!" repeated Mrs. Barlow, while her lip curled with scorn and the tones of her voice expressed the utmost contempt. "Don't heed the advice of that selfish woman. She would have you violate your most sacred promises, would she? O, the selfish, unprincipled, old maid! She pretends that Mr. Pips loves her! The thing is preposterous, absolutely ridiculous!"</p> 
                  <p>"I have always told her so," replied the old lady. "Mr. Pips will never marry a woman unless she is so young and handsome as my daughter was!"</p> 
                  <p>The dashing widow did not exactly like the old lady's remark, still she concealed her feelings and made the best of it. Besides, the fact that Pips was the father of an illegitimate child, or the probability that he was in that unpleasant situation, rendered him not only less desirable as a husband, but even destroyed her hopes and wishes. This dashing widow had high notions of honor and respectability, and Major Lenox began to brighten in her view, and his character to appear quite pure as compared with that of Mr. Pips. True, the major, she knew, had been a great gallant in his day, but then there was no crime fastened upon him, to her knowledge.</p> 
                  <p>"You may swear for it, he would never fall in love with such a thing as she is," said Mrs. Barlow. "I suppose she would have him, however, if he would offer himself, if he was the father of twenty illegitimate children!"</p> 
                  <p>"No doubt of it, replied the old lady. "But he'll never thus offer himself. I feel sorry for Mr. Pips if he has been led astray by the arts of any woman, but he has mourned the death of my daughter so much that he hardly knew what to do with himself."</p> 
                  <p>"But he never ought to have done such things," answered the widow Barlow. "It is a poor way to show his respect to the memory of a dead lover. O, men are strange creatures! It is really difficult to know their true characters. Now I always considered Mr. Pips one of the best hearted men and purest characters that ever lived."</p> 
                  <p>"He is a good-hearted man and he would have always remained virtuous if my daughter had lived, but she died, poor girl, and Mr. Pips has been bewildered ever since. O, madam, I pity him, and must take good care of this child for his sake."</p> 
                  <p>"That is right," said Mrs. Barlow. "You will lose nothing by it. But what purpose had that Miss Spiker in view in coming here?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, she has been here before, and is raving, distracted, to find out the contents of the sealed package," replied the old lady. "But she will never be able to accomplish it."</p> 
                  <p>"I trust not," answered Mrs. Barlow. "I would not suffer her to come to the house! I would bar the doors against her. If she could get the chance she would steal that package and bear it away, her curiosity is so great."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha had her ear to a crack in the door, and heard the last remark of the widow Barlow. Her anger was aroused, and she could not restrain herself. Suddenly opening the door, she rushed in with her long arms extended, and her small eyes snapping most furiously.</p> 
                  <p>"Accuse me of stealing, will you, Mrs. Chubby?" exclaimed Tabitha in a great rage, and cutting the air right and left with her hands and arms. "I have a good mind to tear your eyes out so that you can't wink at the <unclear>men</unclear> any more. O, Mrs. Chubby, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home and wait upon Major Lenox, that pink of virtue. He is probably at your house by this time. Go, Mrs. Chubby, and let him kiss you."</p> 
                  <p>"That's something I'm sure he would never do to you," replied Mrs. Barlow, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>The dashing widow could'nt have said a word that cut deeper into the sensitive heart of Miss Spiker. Short as the sentence was, it conveyed a volume of meaning to the maiden's mind. The old lady didn't know but they would come to blows, and little Jenny clung to her checked apron with a trembling grasp. Tabitha stalked across the room with very long strides as long as the width of her skirts would allow. Mrs. Barlow did not fear her, but she kept herself in an attitude of defence. She was short, and therefore not easily jostled from her balance by any blows which the excited maiden might be disposed to give, standing firm and facing her antagonist boldly.</p> 
                  <p>For some time no words passed between them, but they stood facing each other like two fighting cocks. Their eyes flashed fire and their bosoms heaved with violent emotions. The old lady was fearful they might yet come to blows, and she was not a woman to relish fighting in any form, and especially between two women.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, come," said she, "you must quit this. I can't have quareling in my house!"</p> 
                  <p>"You need not be alarmed good woman, for Miss Spiker dares not attack me," said Mrs. Barlow.</p> 
                  <p>Jimmy McCrate hearing high words and a stormy debate, entered the room as a peacemaker, or to defend his mistress if circumstances should render it necessary.</p> 
                  <p>"Not when your coachman is present to take your part," replied Miss Spiker, clenching her hands and grinding her teeth.</p> 
                  <p>"And indade, do you think a gintleman would interfere and do violence to any lady?" asked Jimmy. "Sure I learnt better manners before I came to this great country than to do sich a thing as that. Indade ladies never fight."</p> 
                  <p>"You speak well," said the old lady, being pleased with the coachman's polite bearing, and his gentle words. "No indeed, the ladies will not fight."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm sure I shall not unless I am compelled to defend myself against a withered up old maid," said Mrs Barlow.</p> 
                  <p>"Let your coachman go away, and I will scratch your wine-flushed checks," said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Now my good woman, be aisy, and if ye can't be aisy, be as aisy as you can," said the polite coachman. My mistress has beautiful cheeks, and it would be a pity indade to have them disfigured at all."</p> 
                  <p>"You flatter for your bread," replied Tabitha. "Beautiful cheeks! Good Lord! who but you would have ever thought of that."</p> 
                  <p>"Many other gintlemen to be sure," replied Jimmy, "Now I say agin, be aisy."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll not remain another minute in such company," said Tabitha, hurrying from the house, and seeking her own domicile.</p> 
                  <p>"Good riddance," exclaimed Mrs. Barlow, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha turned a searching, withering look upon her and passed out in very quick <unclear>time.</unclear> Her limbs went like drumsticks, until she reached home. When she did so, she fainted almost away, but the tact and skill of the Scotch girl soon relieved her, and restored her to consciousness again</p> 
                  <p>After some further conversation had passed between the old lady and the widow, the latter took her leave and went home, promising again to call and to assist Mrs. Watson at any time when she might need any and Every circumstance that happened tended to confirm and strengthen the convictions of the old lady that little Jenny was the child of Mr. Pips. Mrs. Barlow had the same convictions, and the whole matter seemed to be pretty well settled in the minds of all. The dashing widow would have been glad to have an interview with Mr. Pips, still she had now given up all hopes of becoming his wife. Mrs. Watson was placed in a strange position, but she believed the sealed package would clear up all mystery and gratify her most ardent wishes. If she never saw Mr. Pips again, she believed he had made ample provision for her and little Jenny. How impatiently did she wait for the letter which was to authorize her to break the seal and know the contents of the package! But she was faithful to her promise notwithstanding the great temptations that surrounded her.</p>

                  <head type="sub">FURTHER HINTS RESPECTING LITTLE JENNY-A GLANCE AT HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER.</head> 
                  <p>"Old Mrs. Watson will take excellent care of the child, I can assure you," said Elizabeth Murdock. "Twice have I been to see her since I carried Jenny there, and she appears to be quite happy. It was really fortunate that I happened to find such a good old lady as the widow Watson. She is poor, but kind and honest."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I am very glad to hear it," replied Jane Danforth, who had previously had the care of the little girl. "How queer it is that Jenny don't know her mother from any one else! The child has lived with so many that she appears to have formed no attachment to any one in particular."</p> 
                  <p>"She seems to like Mrs. Watson very much," replied Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"I can guess the reason of that," said Jane. "The girl lived with a kind old lady in the country, longer than she ever lived with any other person, and no doubt she thinks she has got back again with the same old lady."</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing more likely, but I didn't think of it before," said Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"The hundred dollars will do a good deal for the old lady," said Jane. "I suppose she never had so much before at one time in her whole life."</p> 
                  <p>"No, nor half as much," replied the other. "I really pity the little girl's mother, for she would love the child, if she could be permitted to have the care of her, but her proud mother will not suffer her to see Jenny at any time, I suppose."</p> 
                  <p>"You may well pity her," replied Jane. "A more proud, haughty and aristocratic woman never lived than her mother. She would go into fits if her daughter should ever name the child to her; but now Jenny has come from the country and has a good place, I intend so to contrive it, that the mother and child shall come together. What a meeting it would be for the mother."</p> 
                  <p>"Why, she would'nt know her child from any other little girl, would she?" asked Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course not, for she never was with the child more than a month after it was born, and has been separated from it ever since," replied Jane Danforth.</p> 
                  <p>"What a villain the father is, that he did not marry the mother of his own child," said Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"Not so great a villain as you may imagine," replied Jane. "I think he would have married, if her mother had not cleared out into the country with her, and forbid his ever seeing her again. Perhaps he might have followed them, had he known where they went, but he did not, until it was all over and they returned to the city again. Besides, his purse was getting low, and he had his eye upon an heiress of great wealth in the hope of mending his broken fortunes by marrying her, but the fine feathered bird was too cunning for him, and was caught and caged by a younger and a richer man."</p> 
                  <p>"All you have said don't excuse him at all in my judgment," said Elizabeth. "He has conducted himself highly improper, and ought to be severely reprimanded for it. O, I hate these fortune-hunters and women-destroyers! They are the curse of the country, and if I could have my way I would hang them all between the heavens and the earth."</p> 
                  <p>"I know very well you feel sensitive upon the subject, and I marvel not at it," said Jane.</p> 
                  <p>"By the way, where, did the money come from I gave the old lady!' asked Elizabeth, feeling disposed to change the subject, for she did not love to call to remembrance her own wrongs, which she had suffered at the hands of a villain some years previous.</p> 
                  <p>"It came from Jenny's father, but it was hard work or him to raise it," replied Jane. "I told him nothing short of that sum would answer, and so he let me have it."</p> 
                  <p>"But what does he expect to do for money now?" asked Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"O, he expects shortly to marry a rich woman!" replied Jane. "But if she should find out that he has an illegitimate daughter, she would turn him away at once and with scorn."</p> 
                  <p>"And serve him right too," replied Elizabeth. "I hope he will not succeed in his suit. Men influenced by such sordid, selfish motives ought not have success."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, you're right enough, but you will keep all you know to yourself," said Jane, "I have placed confidence in you, and I don't believe you will betray it."</p> 
                  <p>"Surely I shall not," answered the high spirited Elizabeth. "But why do you so much interest yourself in behalf of this father?"</p> 
                  <p>"The secret I will disclose to you, but you might suspect some worse motives," said Jane. "He is my uncle and has been very kind to me; I know he <unclear>has</unclear> done wrong in a good many instances, but I can't give him up yet. After he's married, I hope and trust all his wild oats will have been sown, and that he will con duct himself uprightly."</p> 
                  <p>"I should hate to become his wife and trust him," answered Elizabeth. "But I now understand why you are so friendly to him. It is all right that you should be, if you do not encourage him in his course of sin Have you any acquaintance with the mother of the child?"</p> 
                  <p>"None at all," replied Jane. "But uncle says she was rather pretty."</p> 
                  <p>"And rich, I suppose," said Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"Very wealthy," replied Jane. "Her father died, leaving a great estate, and she and her mother inherited it. The mother intended to keep her daughter's affair a secret from the world, but it some how or other got wind, and ever since, she has kept her at home, or traveled with her and visited the fashionable watering places of the country, in the hope of bargaining her off to some rich man's son of the South. I understood she once came very near accomplishing such a work, but something happened to prevent it. The girl's money will get her offers enough, but the mother looks to the very highest ranks. The daughter might be willing to descend lower for a husband, were it not for her mother's influence. I wish she was well married to a man who would love her."</p> 
                  <p>"No gentleman of refined taste will ever marry her, if he knows the history of some passages in her life," said Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"That may be true, but men will sometimes sacrifice their own feelings for the sake of money," said Jane. "Men are not so pure as the ladies sometimes imagine."</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, I believe that," replied Elizabeth; "I should hardly know what man to trust in this wicked generation."</p> 
                  <p>"It is possible you may place them lower than they ought to be," answered Jane. "Perhaps, in the remembrance of your own troubles, you may do the sex injustice."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, let that pass," said Elizabeth. "The man who marries me must first be put to a severe test, but the probability is, I shall never become the wife of any man, and I care but precious little about it any way. So long as I have my health I can take care of myself, and when I lose that, the world will owe me a living, for I have not been idle nor a drone in society. I have labored industriously."</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed you have since I became acquainted with you," answered Elizabeth. "I'm far from being rich myself, but I will not complain."</p> 
                  <p>"No, I suppose not, for you expect soon to marry a man of wealth," said Elizabeth.</p> 
                  <p>"Not a man of wealth, but he has a good trade, industrious habits, and an honest heart," replied Jane "Those are better than riches, for money may take wings and fly away, while these remain and form a solid foundation to rest upon."</p> 
                  <p>"I firmly believe every word you say," answered Elizabeth. "But, I thought Mr. Holden was very wealthy."</p> 
                  <p>"When a young man is industrious and lucky in business, and lays up a few thousand dollars, his wealth is almost always overrated," said Jane. "Mark it, when you will, such a man will be considered by the masses, more wealthy than he really is. True, he may be underrated by the wealthy and aristocratic, for such imagine a mechanic can never be rich, who is obliged to labor with his own hands for all he gets."</p> 
                  <p>"There is much good sense in your remarks," said Elizabeth. "But, Mr. Holden is coming, I perceive, and so I'll give place to him."</p> 
                  <p>Elizabeth Murdoch passed from the room, and Theodore Holden entered. The character of this young man is, in some degree already known to the reader from the above dialogue. He was a house carpenter by trade and understood his business. Industrious, prudent, and possessing an excellent judgment, he had acquired some considerable property and established a good reputation as a business and a honest man. But few men in his circumstances had ever succeeded better. Having been more than a year engaged to Jane Danforth, he was about ready to wed and commence a new condition of life, such a condition as God and<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6823-00000031"/> nature design for the human race. Elizabeth Murdoch was a seamstress, possessing great good sense, much logical power, and an indomitable spirit. A year or two previous to her introduction to the reader, she was courted by a young printer whose moral principles proved to be corrupt. To use a common phrase he was a smart fellow, and a very efficient foreman in one of the printing offices. Having a fine address, a handsome person, and possessing a ready command of language, he easily won the affections of Elizabeth Murdoch, who would have married him, if his moral principles had been equal to his physical and mental accomplishments. But a short time previous to the day appointed for the celebration of their nuptials, he was arrested at the suit of a girl for breach of promise, and seduction, and obliged to give bail which he readily procured. He endeavored to keep the affair a secret from Miss Murdoch, but a rival paper to that in the printing of which he was foreman, published the proceedings. The young and spirited seamstress heard of it, and immediately gave him his walking ticket. It was a sad and sore disappointment to her, but her moral feelings triumphed over her love for the printer and she dismissed him in a sharp and touching letter. He wrote an answer, and endeavored to palliate his conduct, but it was unavailing, for she answered him in a tone and spirit that could not be mistaken. Before his case came to trial, he left the city and his bail to compromise the matter the best way they could. Elizabeth never heard of him afterwards, but her heart did not break, nor did she pine away in grief as some fair maidens might have done. The effect of this disappointment upon her heart, the reader has already seen. It generated strong prejudices against men in her bosom, and made her misanthropical. Several young men offered themselves to her but she refused them all, feeling as if she would take a course never to be again disappointed.</p> 
                  <p>"That Elizabeth Murdoch is a high spirited, resolute young woman," said Theodore Holden.</p> 
                  <p>"She is, indeed, and as honest a girl as ever broke bread," <unclear>replied</unclear> Jane Danforth.</p> 
                  <p>"I think so," he said. "She ought to have a good husband. I have recommended her to my foreman, William Stanley, a very smart, active, industrious young man, who will be rich, if he lives to the common age of man."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know as she would dare to engage herself again to any one, she is so much prejudiced against the men," she said. "She's too bitter in her feelings, and too apt to think that all men are like her former lover. But she may overcome these prejudices in time. Elizabeth would make a very good wife, but her husband would have to steer a pretty direct course or there would be trouble in the domestic circle."</p> 
                  <p>"By the way, I understand that she has found a good woman to take care of your uncle's child," he said. "I'm very glad of it. Perhaps in time, the mother will know that the daughter is living, and contribute to her support."</p> 
                  <p>"That may be," she replied, "I know not whether the child is dead or alive"</p> 
                  <p>"Probably not," he answered. "But I'm strongly inclined to let them knew that the child is alive and that they ought to take her home, provide for, and educate her. Your uncle will not be able to do any more for his means are well nigh exhausted."</p> 
                  <p>"Very true," she replied. "And he does not intend to do any more. The mother and grandmother too, will know all about the affair, ere long. My uncle wishes to keep the matter a secret until after his marriage."</p> 
                  <p>"Then he has some prospect of being married, has he?" asked Holden, expressing some surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, and to a lady of large fortune," she replied, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"I hope it is not a young girl he expects to marry," he answered. "I don't like the idea of his marrying such an one unless she is made acquainted with all the circumstances. It is not right."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm aware of that, but the woman he is after is not young, but rich, proud, and aristocratic," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"A woman who has more money than heart, I suppose," he said. "Well, if that's the case, she can bear it, but he ought not to deceive a young, simple, and innocent girl. And before he should do that, I might feel it my duty to come in his way and advise the girl better."</p> 
                  <p>"And you would be doing perfectly right," said Jane. "But we need not trouble ourselves about the woman he's courting, for she has no heart to grieve and pine away. Her pride may be shocked, but she would not be likely to go into a consumption under hardly any circumstances."</p> 
                  <p>"I understand you," he said, laughing. "Let your uncle proceed then, for in such ranks of life, marriage is but a game they play at in which the heart has no part."</p> 
                  <p>A purse-bound aristocracy young Holden always despised. Of all the classes in the community, he most despised those who had nothing but wealth to recommend them. His prejudices were so strong against that class that he could not see their good qualities, if perchance they had any; therefore he was not inclined to move against Jane's uncle in his enterprise of marrying a purse-proud, aristocratic woman. But it the same uncle had been seeking a young, virtuous, and innocent heiress, Holden would have endeavored to put a stop to further proceedings. Such were some of the traits in the character of this enterprising mechanic.</p> 
                  <p>While he and his beloved Jane Danforth were thus conversing, Jimmy McCrate, the dashing widow Barlow's coachman was pressing his suit with Mary Campbell. It was rather unfortunate for him that Mary's mistress had had a quarrel with his mistress. Tabitha Spiker, since her meeting Mrs. Barlow at the widow Watson's, had become dead-set against the Irish coachman, believing no good thing could come out of Nazareth. She despised and hated every one who might be in employ of, or favor of Mrs. Barlow. And now she hated the coachman almost as much as she did his mistress. Jimmy had made a favorable beginning of his courtship, even contrary to the expectations of his beloved Scotch girl, who treated his first love epistle with ridicule, if not scorn and contempt. The idea of connecting her fortunes with an Irishman, was at first quite ridiculous; but Jimmy, by his polite address, musical voice, industrious habits, and perseverance, had fairly won her respect and esteem, so that she gave him audience, and listened to his declarations of love. In fact she began to feel quite amused and interested in his company. Mary was shrewd; and Jimmy was by no means destitute of the same quality. He was a good judge of human nature, and perfectly understood the characters of his mistress and of Tabitha Spiker. He could laugh in his sleeve at both, and at the same time appear to respect them. Mary had a small sprinkling of the same are in the elements of her composition. During the evening of the same day his mistress and Tabitha had their quarrel at Mrs. Watson's, he paid a visit to Mary. Not an hour before he crossed the street and entered the kitchen of Miss Spiker, where servants usually do their courting, she gave him a most shocking setting out to Mary, and told her to discard him immediately, calling him all manner of names, and running him to the lowest notch. Mary listened to the tirade very patiently, and made no reply, Jimmy entered slyly, hoping to escape the notice of Tabitha, and he did enter unobserved. Fortunately Mary was in the kitchen.</p> 
                  <p>"A blessed evening to ye, swate Mary," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Hush!" she replied. "Speak low or Tabitha may hear you!"</p> 
                  <p>"And if she did how would it be received by her ladyship?" he asked, lowering his voice to a whisper.</p> 
                  <p>"She wadna let ye stay a moment perhaps," she answered. "She came home in an awful rage."</p> 
                  <p>"And by the powers didn't she use that unruly member most fraly at the ould lady's?" said Jimmy. "It ran like a pepper-mill, and my mistress was'nt far behind, I can tell ye. And would ye believe it, my darlint, they came very near using blows! If they had, who think ye would have bate? The widow is short and strong, and Tabitha is tall and spry."</p> 
                  <p>"I canna tell which is the stronger," she replied smiling. "But did ye see the churn fa' from the chamber window, and smash up?"</p> 
                  <p>"And by St. Patrick, did'nt I see that same intirely," he replied, laughing. "It was a sight to behold."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"It took us some hours to glue it together again," said Mary, suppressing her laughter and casting her <unclear>cunning</unclear> eyes upon her lover, who was holding his sides with both hands.</p> 
                  <p>Their risibles were so much excited that neither said a word for some time.</p> 
                  <p>"And did ye finally make it stick together again?" he asked, in a voice choked by laughter.</p> 
                  <p>"O yes, and Tabitha says she means to have it out again, to represent Mrs. Chubby," replied Mary. "But she felt bad when it tumbled upon the side walk."</p> 
                  <p>"And my mistress jumped for joy when she saw it fall," said Jimmy. "But let the churn go. Did your mistress say any thing about the little girl at the widow Watson's?"</p> 
                  <p>"Hours and hours, she talked about the affair," she answered. "And do you think Mr. Pips is the father of the little girl?"</p> 
                  <p>"I can't say, but those bachelor gentlemen sometimes cut up quare shines," he answered. "She's a swate pretty girl, let who will be her father. There's some mystery about it."</p> 
                  <p>"I think so, from Tabitha's account of the affair," she said. "Oh, my mistress is in an awful state of mind. She thinks she shall never behold the face of Mr. Pips again!"</p> 
                  <p>"And if she did behold it, he would never marry her," said Jimmy. "Mr. Pips is a gentleman of taste."</p> 
                  <p>"And think ye, he will ever wed your mistress?" asked Mary. "Has he too much gude taste for that?"</p> 
                  <p>"My mistress would not have him, now she believes he is the father of that little girl," he replied. "The gallant Major Lenox stands the best chance now."</p> 
                  <p>"And most terribly will she be cheated if she takes him for her husband," said Mary. "I ken him weel. He spoke to me once in the street, but I scorned him and he turned upon his heel, and gazed awa. That major is not to be trusted."</p> 
                  <p>"Better chate a rich widow than a poor innocent girl," said Jimmy.</p> 
                  <p>"I like you for saying that," she replied. "The widow is old enough to look out for herself. And she must keep her eyes upon him."</p> 
                  <p>"Jist my mind entirely," said the coachman. "She must have her eyes wide open, for he's chock full of swate blarney."</p> 
                  <p>"And the widow has some of that same blarney," said Mary, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Ye may well say that," answered Jimmy. "Her tongue is as glib as an Irishman's, and as smooth as a Scotchman's."</p> 
                  <p>"Aweel, aweel, Jimmy, ye ha' driven twa nails with ane hammer," she answered, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"And what will mistress Spiker do, if Mr. Pips returns with a wife?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I canna say how she wad take it," she replied. "But she thinks she loves him deeply."</p> 
                  <p>"She's too small and narrow to love dapely," he said. "But hark, I hear footsteps!"</p> 
                  <p>"Then she's coming!" replied Mary, removing at a good moral distance from the coachman, and assuming a very grave aspect.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha soon entered and stood erect in the middle of the floor. All were silent, and Jimmy bent his eyes down, expecting every moment the storm would come. Mary was more bold.</p> 
                  <p>"Out of my house, you Irishman!" exclaimed Tabitha, stamping her right foot, and gazing upon Me Crate with wildness in her looks.</p> 
                  <p>"Jimmy's blood was stirred within him, and his Irish temper rose, but he controlled himself for the sake of Mary, and made no answer.</p> 
                  <p>"Out I say, and go to your own place," she continued in a cracked voice. "Go and brush the dust from Mrs. Chubby's silk skirts, and hold up her trail. Ye are just fit for such work."</p> 
                  <p>The coachman rose from his chair very moderately, and stood straight and genteel, first gazing on Miss Spiker and then on Mary, and seriously debating in his own mind, whether it was best to reply or go silently out. Mary would have been glad to put words into his mouth, for she was perfectly willing that he should answer Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Why stand ye there like-" continued Tabitha, finding no words to finish the comparison.</p> 
                  <p>"Like a may-pole," interrupted Jimmy, gazing upon her very archly.</p> 
                  <p>She took the hint and stormed worse than ever. Mary covered her face to hide her smiles, for she couldn't keep them from coming up from her heart.</p> 
                  <p>"Saucy Irishman, dirty Paddy, out of my house!" exclaimed Tabitha, in a voice pitched to its highest and most squeaking key. "Go, and darken not my door again!"</p> 
                  <p>"And by all the saints, dead and alive, I will go quickly," replied the coachman, standing on his tiptoes, and bowing very politely. "Too much love has made thee mad, and if ye have not a care, yer little heart may break."</p> 
                  <p>The coachman now took his leave and passed out Mary was glad Tabitha did not frighten him.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, do you suffer such a fellow to visit you?" asked Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Not many weeks since you told me he was a very prudent, industrious, genteel fellow," Mary replied "And sure he canna ha' changed muckle in sa short a time."</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't know him then as I do now," said Tabitha. "Go to bed, and never let the Irishman come to this house again."</p> 
                  <p>Both retired, but Mary never had so high an opinion of the coachman before, as she entertained that evening. The opposition of Miss Spiker only increased the Scotch girl's respect and esteem for the coachman, to say nothing of love which began to operate upon her heart. Jimmy went home with light steps and a hopeful heart, for he believed Mary was beginning to feel favorably disposed towards him. And herein the worthy coachman was not mistaken.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE AMBITIOUS MOTHER AND THE INFLUENCE OF RICHES-THE MEMOIRS OF A FIRST BORN.</head> 
                  <p>"Now Angelina, you must put on your most polite manners and behave yourself with the almost propriety," said Mrs. Proudit to her daughter, as they sat one evening in a magnificently furnished room, illumined with brilliant lamps. "It is time for Edwin Montville to arrive. You must mind daughter what you say, and how you say it, for much depends upon first impressions. Remember, he has visited you but once, and he's an only son, and his father owns a magnificent plantation and many negro slaves. And Georgia is a good climate to live in.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know as I can fancy him, mother," replied Angelina. He's a terrible dandy!"</p> 
                  <p>"Fiddlededee!" exclaimed the aristocratic mother. "Not fancy him! Then fancy the plantation and the negroes! He's immensely rich and well educated."</p> 
                  <p>"He may be rich, but I don't think much of his education," answered the daughter, who seemed to be in the possession of more good sense than her mother.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, child, he has been through college and studied law with one of the most eminent lawyers, of the whole south!" said Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"That all may be, but he seems to me to be rather shallow and silly," answered Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, you must engage yourself to him, for he came all the way from Georgia to see you," said the mother. "You know we saw his father and mother at the Springs, last season.</p> 
                  <p>"I know that," answered Angelina. "But what then?"</p> 
                  <p>"But what then!" repeated the proud mother. "Why didn't I make the bargain then, if you and he liked each other? You must like him. His father and mother are very fashionable people. There are none more so in the South. And I'm sure Edwin dresses with much taste and is very genteely formed. He'll make a kind husband"</p> 
                  <p>"But mother, would you have me marry him, if I can't love him?" asked Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"You can love him as well as you can love any body except the poor devil who almost destroyed you," replied her mother. "You must be married, and now is your chance."</p> 
                  <p>A tear started into Angelina's eye, and she trembled at her mother's remark. But she had become so much accustomed to hear her mother talk thus that she had become somewhat hardened.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish mother, you would never allude to that circumstance<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6823-00000032"/> cumstance again," said the girl. I have repented in dust and ashes, heaven knows. And if it would please you, I prefer to remain single. To be confined to a man whom I can't love, is the worst kind of imprisonment. Let me live with you and I shall be happy."</p> 
                  <p>"I wish Angelina you would drive such foolish thoughts from your head," replied the resolute and determined mother. "If there's any body in this world that I hate it is an old maid. And they are the most miserable looking creatures on the footstool. No, no, Angelina, you must be married, and to a rich man too. In that way you can become a respectable woman and keep up the fame and reputation of our family. Edwin Montville, I think, has quite a fancy for you already. He will soon love you, and take you to the South before the cold weather sets in. Strange, you should think of living and dying an old maid! I should rather die now than lead such a life, if I were you. Edward a dandy! Well, what if he does live in style, and dress politely?"</p> 
                  <p>"He behaves so politely that nature is entirely neglected," said Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"Nature entirely neglected!" repeated Mrs. Proudit. "Well, well, daughter, I will not chide you for the past, only be sure to conduct yourself in such a manner as to please Edwin Montville."</p> 
                  <p>"And how shall I behave to please a dandy, and nothing but a dandy?" asked Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you ask such a foolish question?" demanded the mother. "You know well enough how to please Edwin. Do so and become a fashionable woman and a leader in the higher circles. All this is within your power, and let not the opportunity pass by unimproved.</p> 
                  <p>"I will try to obey you mother, but I shall have no heart in the work," answered Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"That's a good girl," said the mother. Hearts have but little to do in the fashionable world in which you were born to move, but the heads are needed."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, mother, I don't think Edwin Montville's head will ever do much," said the daughter.</p> 
                  <p>"No matter, his money and negroes will make up for every other lack," replied the heartless mother "When you become his wife, you will at once be placed in a situation to command not only respect but admiration."</p> 
                  <p>The door bell now rang, and the young southerner was ushered into the brilliantly lighted apartment. Very formally was he conducted to the room by servants especially delegated for the purpose. Mrs Montville had oven hired two negroes for the occasion for she was determined to put the best foot forward and marry off her daughter to the rich planter's son Edwin was dressed in the very pink of fashion, and looked as if he had just come out of a band box.</p> 
                  <p>"By gong, how strong he smell ob de perfume," said the negro, who passed him into the room, to the other who answered the summons at the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Dat be fact, for I smell him soon as I open de door," replied the other, grinning and showing a set of pearly white teeth. "I guess he spend much money for sich tings. And how he strut too!"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, he did," said the first speaker. "He seemed to be afeard ob busting open his trousers, he walked so stiff and nice. But I don't like him, for he be 'um slabe holder."</p> 
                  <p>"A slabe-holder!" replied the other. "Gorry! me lub to lick him!"</p> 
                  <p>Thus these darkeys talked, while Mrs. Proudit was all attention to the young dandy and her daughter felt more like hating than loving him.</p> 
                  <p>"Take a seat on the sofa, Mr. Montville," said the mother. Make yourself quite at home."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes maam," he replied, walking to the sofa with measured steps, and gazing at Angelina through a splendid eyeglass. "Your daughter I believe. My vision is not so good in the evening as at other times. While I was in college I studied very hard."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, that is my daughter," replied the mother. You ought to take good care of your eyes and not study so hard, Mr. Montville."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, ma'am," he answered. "Good evening Miss Angelina. I am glad to see you looking so well."</p> 
                  <p>"My health is quite good sir," she answered, while she shrank from his quizzing glass, which was quite <unclear>near</unclear>. "You are very near sighted, I perceive."</p> 
                  <p>"Quite so, my dear," he replied. "We students are not careful enough with our eyes."</p> 
                  <p>"No indeed, you are not," said the mother looking at her daughter and fearing she might say something offensive because she appeared uneasy.</p> 
                  <p>"How many slaves have you, ma'am?" he asked, turning his glass towards the mother, and greatly relieving the daughter. I found your two house servants very polite."</p> 
                  <p>"The law don't allow us to keep slaves, Mr. Montville," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"Not keep slaves," he said. "That is very strange! You ought to have quite a number in such a house as this."</p> 
                  <p>"O, sir, we keep a good deal of help, but we are compelled to hire our servants," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"I keep two slaves to wait on my person," he said. I came near bringing my Billy with me He's a very clever obedient negro about thirty years of age. He'll do anything for me, ma'am.</p> 
                  <p>"My servants will wait and tend upon you, Mr. Montville she said. "They are just as obedient as though they were slaves."</p> 
                  <p>"I thank you, marm," he said. Then turning to wards Angelina, he continued, "My dear, you ought to have two slaves to wait upon you."</p> 
                  <p>"O, sir, I could get along with one very well," replied Angelina, suppressing a smile.</p> 
                  <p>"Angelina has an excellent chamber maid," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>"A colored maid, I suppose," he said, "and you have to pay her wages! That seems strange to me!"</p> 
                  <p>"It does, I have no doubt," said Mrs. Proudit, concealing the fact that Angelina's servant was an Irish girl, and not a negress.</p> 
                  <p>The proud mother was determined to keep up a fair outside appearance and have everything shaped in accordance with the views and prejudices of the dandy southerner, so far at least as she could de so without being detected in absolute falsehood. Having a game to play and not receiving that aid from her daughter she so much desired, she taxed her ingenuity and called upon all the powers within her to play that game skillfully and to make the most favorable impressions upon Edwin Montville.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't like these hired servants," he said. "They sometimes feel too independent; I have noticed their insolence sometimes, but your servants are very well behaved. I wish you would call them in, for I wish to give them something to remember me by."</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Proudit now rang a bell and one of the servants entered with a broad grin upon his face. Edward stepped towards him and said: "Call the other servant, I have something for both."</p> 
                  <p>Soon both negroes stood before him. He took from his pocket a long silk purse covered with bright beads and ornamented with tassels and gave the negroes a small silver coin each. They received the money, bowed very low and retired.</p> 
                  <p>"A York shilling, by gorry," said one of the servants after reaching the hall. "He bust himself dis time."</p> 
                  <p>"Anodder York <choice>
                        <sic>shiliing</sic>
                        <corr>shilling</corr>
                     </choice>," said the other grinning, and holding the shining silver in the palm of his right band. His heart is open and we'd better stick 'em wedge into it. Does he tink he can buy dis child wid a York shilling? No, no, dis nigger know too much for dat."</p> 
                  <p>"And so does dis one," replied the other. "He small potatur."</p> 
                  <p>"And few in de hill," said the first negro. And they laughed at the dandy and at each other's wit.</p> 
                  <p>"I always give my servants money," continued Montville. "It makes them love me."</p> 
                  <p>"It is excellent policy," replied Mrs. Proudit. "I knew you were generous hearted."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes ma'am," he replied, bowing very politely and gazing upon Angelina through his glass.</p> 
                  <p>Angelina was as uneasy as if she sat upon thorns. The more she saw of this dandy the more she disliked him. He now took a chair and sat down close beside her. Her flesh crawled all over, and she wished he was back to the South among his slaves The mother was highly pleased to see him apparently so much interested in her daughter. His superb glass was at his eye.</p> 
                  <p>"You have very fine hair, dear Angelina," he said. "I like just such a color. I dislike very black hair, it always makes me think of the savages."</p> 
                  <p>"I think Angelina's hair is of a very pretty color," said the mother. "I dislike very black hair myself."</p> 
                  <p>"And therein you show very good taste madam," he replied, still gazing at the daughter's hair, very much to her annoyance, but she kept quiet as she could and let him and the mother do the talking.</p> 
                  <p>"My mother's hair is quite light, more so than mine is," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"I think your's is a very pretty color," said the mother. "And it curls very naturally."</p> 
                  <p>His hair was of a very light color, and unfrequently the few straggling hairs upon his upper lip which he intended for mustaches did not show themselves very distinctly, and his thin whiskers would be hardly noticed across a room. His eyes were of a light blue, and his features quite delicate. Angelina did not think much of his manly beauty nor of his brains.</p> 
                  <p>"I have often heard the ladies remark the same thing," he replied, feeling much self-complacency. Then turning to Angelina, he continued. "How do you like my hair, my dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, sir, your hair is very well," she replied, wishing it was farther from her.</p> 
                  <p>"I knew Angelina would like it," said the widow. "My daughter has a very cultivated taste."</p> 
                  <p>"Does she sing ma'am?" he asked. "I see you have a piano-forte here."</p> 
                  <p>"Angelina must answer that question herself," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you play and sing, my dear?" he anxiously inquired.</p> 
                  <p>"For my own <choice>
                        <sic>amusemement</sic>
                        <corr>amusement</corr>
                     </choice> sometimes," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"O, then you must sing and play for my amusement," he said. "I'm passionately fond of music, especially of the piano forte and a female voice accompanying it."</p> 
                  <p>"Angelina will sing you a song," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>Angelina turned her eyes upon her mother and looked quite vexed, for she felt as if she would as soon sing to a monkey as to him.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't feel like singing, this evening, sir," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"O, but you must sing one song for me!" he said. 'I love music dearly."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, yes, Angelina, you must give Mr. Montville some music," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>Angelina wheeled up to the instrument, opened it and then looked at the dandy, saying, "have you any particular song you wish to hear?"</p> 
                  <p>"The Last Rose of Summer is a great favorite with me," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>Angelina was an excellent player, and during the last three years she had practiced a great deal, for she sad not been much in society except when she traveled with her mother. The poor girl gave up visiting entirely in the city, and kept herself much secluded from society. Even when her mother received company, she seldom made her appearance. She now touched the keys of her piano and run over the celebrated old song with some variations. Now her plaintive voice was heard, sweetly mingling with the tones of the instrument. She loved this song herself, and her voice was well calculated to give it expression. She sung it with much feeling, but her thoughts were far away from the dandy or from any feelings which might have moved his heart. Even the tears almost started from her own eyes as she spoke the words and gave out the beautiful tones which so perfectly corresponded with the sentiments. Montville sat with his glass to his eye watching the motions of her fingers, and listening with intense feeling to the sweet tones of her voice.</p> 
                  <p>"That song will complete the work," mentally said the anxious mother. "She sings it beautifully!"</p> 
                  <p>"I'm perfectly delighted, charmed!" he exclaimed, after she had finished the song. "I never heard it sang so well before. Do please me by singing the last verse again."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, she will sing it," said Mrs. Proudit, feeling quite overjoyed at the success of Angelina. She again sang the last verse, and ended by some very fine touches on the piano, more to please her mother than to delight him.</p> 
                  <p>"Delightful! charming!" he exclaimed. "O, what a sweet tune! Don't you think so my dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is a very good tune," replied Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"You have an excellent taste for music, Mr. Montville," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you ma'am," he replied, feeling much flattered and puffed up by her praise. "I have heard many ladies make the same remark."</p> 
                  <p>Angelina was sick at heart in seeing how greedily he swallowed the most fulsome praise from her mother, who was a great flatterer when she was inclined to be so.</p> 
                  <p>"I wonder not at their making such remarks," replied the flattering woman. "A gentleman of good musical taste always has a whole soul."</p> 
                  <p>"And a lady the same," he replied, feeling more and more swelled up with pride.</p> 
                  <p>"There's a compliment for you, Angelina," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>Angelina was so much disgusted, with him that she did not even make any reply to her mother. She longed for his absence while the mother did all the courting.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, your daughter needs no compliment, for she's all music," he replied; while a silly smile played over his vacant face. "I always liked the Last Rose of Summer, but now I shall never forget it. It is a sweeter composition than I ever supposed it was."</p> 
                  <p>"Much depends upon how a song is sung," said Mrs. Proudit. "A poor song well sung affords more pleasure than even a good song badly sung. My daughter has quite a natural gift for music, and that gift she has very much cultivated. Don't you think her voice is very sweet?"</p> 
                  <p>"I never heard one more so," he replied, raising his glass to his eye and gazing upon Angelina with feelings as near akin to love as any emotion he was capable of.</p> 
                  <p>He then turned to the daughter and continued, "My dear, if you have no objections, I should be pleased to take an airing to-morrow in a coach, and have your company. I have ridden but little since I came to the city. I ride a good deal at home."</p> 
                  <p>Angelina remained silent, but her mother answered and said, "My daughter will be extremely happy to accompany you on such an excursion. We'll take our carriage and all go.</p> 
                  <p>"O, that would be delightful!" he exclaimed "What time shall we go, morning or afternoon? Perhaps Angelina may have a choice. Would the morning or afternoon suit you best?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is immaterial with me," replied Angelina. "Mother may fix the time to suit herself."</p> 
                  <p>"Then we'll go in the morning," said Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"The air is more refreshing then."</p> 
                  <p>The morning was agreed upon, and then Angelina hoped he would take his leave for the evening at least, but she was destined to be disappointed. He lingered more than an hour longer, and said many more silly things. At last he left, and the daughter breathed freer.</p> 
                  <p>O, mother, he seems ten times more silly than he did the first time he came here!" said Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"You talk strangely, my daughter; he's an excellent hearted young man. You'll like him better the more you see of him."</p> 
                  <p>"The very reverse of that is the truth," said the girl. "I'm absolutely disgusted with him. And you would be too, were his father a poor man. Strange how much difference money makes!"</p> 
                  <p>"True, it does make a great difference," replied the mother. "Without money you could make no figure in the world. By marrying Edwin, you will become one of the leading ladies of the South. And strange you hav'nt more ambition. If I were a girl I should jump at such a chance. There is'nt a lady in the city who would refuse his offer. Why, Angelina, you must wake up and make a noise in the world. You have lived long enough in the shade. You must come out now into the bright sunshine. The young man is highly pleased with you. I can see it all. What a prospect lies before you!"</p> 
                  <p>"A dark prospect to me, mother," she replied. "I can never love him, no, nor respect him, he is so silly, and his manners so disagreeable."</p> 
                  <p>"Manners disagreeable!" repeated the mother. "I find you are very hard to please, more so than you<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6823-00000033"/> were once. Angelina, remember your situation! You can't marry a man here of rank, wealth and responsibility. Your follies have out you off from all such hopes and prospects, and now what will you do?"</p> 
                  <p>"Remain with you, mother," she replied, in a voice whose accents told how deeply she felt.</p> 
                  <p>"Nonsense, child!" said the mother. "Be not so foolish! I want you to rise in the world, and become a lady of fashion. You have accomplishments enough to adorn the high rank to which Mr. Montville will elevate you, and to become a leader of the ton in the South. But if you remain here, you'll pine away and die an old maid, despised, laughed at, and no one to mourn your death."</p> 
                  <p>"My child might mourn if it be living," said Angelina, gazing through her tears upon her proud and ambitious mother. "O, God, I wish I knew whether it was dead or alive!"</p> 
                  <p>"Foolish girl!" said the cruel mother, "No doubt the brat is dead. And even you ought to wish so."</p> 
                  <p>"O, mother, you talk most strangely! How can I wish my own child dead! It is unnatural, wicked, monstrous!"</p> 
                  <p>"Because when it is dead there's an end of it," replied the unfeeling mother. "If it should grow up, it would only do so to feel the world's scorn. Children born out of wedlock are always despised."</p> 
                  <p>"Not by their parents, I trust," replied Angelina, weeping as if her heart would break. "Children have no agency in their births and are not responsible, but their parents are. O, mother, I have tried to forget the past and bury all in oblivion! I can forget all but my child!"</p> 
                  <p>"I fear you still love its father," said the mother. "He's a poor rake of a man, and you ought to despise him!"</p> 
                  <p>"I can forget him, forget all, but there is something within me which makes me think of my child by day, and dream of it by night. Nothing but death can shut out that child from my memory. If it is dead I want to know it, and then I would how in submission to the will of heaven, but if it still lives, I ought to take care of it."</p> 
                  <p>"O, heavens, don't let me hear you talk so!" exclaimed the excited mother. "I suppose you would take the brat into our house here, would you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Here or elsewhere, so that I might be with it, and exercise a mother's care of it," replied Angelina. "Yes, mother, I had rather live in an humble cottage with my child, than in a southern palace without it. Yes, give me back my child, and southern plantations, slaves to wait upon me, and a husband to doat upon me, may all go as things of little value."</p> 
                  <p>"O, Angelina, you grow more and more foolish every day!" said her mother. "I did hope you had forgotten the past, now such bright prospects open before you. After your marriage into the Montville family, you will forget your present silly notions."</p> 
                  <p>"Silly notions!" repeated the daughter, gazing upon her mother with great surprise. "Is it a silly notion for a mother to remember and love her child? Can she forget her first born in the pleasures and dissipations of fashionable life! Think, O, mother, think, what your feelings were towards me when I was born! Did you not love me? Could you have easily forgotten me, had I been torn from your arms and removed from your sight?"</p> 
                  <p>"You were a legitimate child, and that makes all the difference in the world," said this strange, fashionable and ambitious mother.</p> 
                  <p>"No such circumstance can change the relation between mother and child," said Angelina. "Besides, there is another consideration, mother. Would you have me deceive this man? Would you have me marry him, and keep him in ignorance of my peculiar situation? Would such a thing be right in the sight of heaven?"</p> 
                  <p>"Southern gentlemen don't regard such things with so much scrupulousness as you may imagine," answered the mother. "Don't you remember we heard one of the actors in the play say, that a man that's robbed, not knowing it, is not robbed at all, or words to that effect. Discard all such notions from your head; Mr. Montville loves you. That song turned the scale, and, as he said, he can never forget it. You are placed here in the world, and you must make the best of your situation. If you have any ambition, you can yet shine as a bright star in the world of fashion, and thereby gratify your mother's pride, or you can sink down, die and be forgotten."</p> 
                  <p>Long did this proud, ambitious mother thus talk to her heart-stricken daughter, fully resolved, so far as she had the power, to make her forget the past, and marry the rich planter's only son. Angelina loved her mother, and wished to obey her in all things, but she could not forget her child, nor some of the moral impressions which a three year's repentance had stamped upon her soul. Even a mother's influence was not sufficient to drive away these memories. To marry even such a heartless simpleton as Edwin Montville under such circumstances, and to deceive him, was more than this girl dared to do; and yet she did not know but she might be compelled to marry him, or be driven from her mother's house. That night was a sleepless one, and the next morning brought no relief to the sickened heart.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE DIALOGUE AT PAULO'S GRAVE-THE EMOTIONS THERE EXCITED-THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST.</head> 
                  <p>The reader thinks it is high time to hear something from Mr. Pips, whose exploits in angling and love formed a conspicuous part in the commencement of our story, and whose memory has been kept bright by the relation of other circumstances and the opening of other scenes. We left him in the wilderness in doubt whether he had formed a second attachment or not. One thing was made quite certain to the reader, and Pips himself could not have much doubt of it, and that is, that the beautiful wild fishing girl, had made a very strong impression upon his sensitive and kind heart, but whether that impression amounted to a second love or not, may be more questionable. It has already been seen that Mr. Pips had absented himself longer from the city than he anticipated, and much longer than his friends and acquaintances had reason to expect. In consequence of this overstaying the time appointed for his return from his angling expedition, many rumors were pat afloat and several hearts made to vibrate with strange emotions, but of all this he was in happy and unconcerned ignorance. How to leave that beautiful daughter of the forest who had not only somewhat smitten his heart but also beaten him in his two favorite sports, or under what circumstances or upon what conditions to part with her, if he must part at all, were questions which severely taxed all his powers, and called up all his philosophy. If he could have been assured that he did not absolutely love her, or if some invisible and superhuman power could have spoken and told him he never could love her, his troubles would have been comparatively light and trifling, but as it was, he hardly knew what to do</p> 
                  <p>After we ceased to chronicle his doings in these pages, he continued to remain with the fair damsel and her mother for several days, angling, hunting, and dreaming of love, and especially the glories of second love, which at times he almost believed he saw. Sabattus, the young Indian, also remained, for he was fully resolved to tarry as long as Pips did, although he did not press his suit to Sarah Searsmont. Jake Borland also remained under good pay, a situation he was willing to fill until the snows of winter buried the forest in their white mantel. Sabattus was a sensible Indian, and watched Pips very narrowly, and the conduct of the maiden did not escape his notice. His great object was to satisfy himself whether she reciprocated his affection or was disposed to favor Pips. Whatever his fate might be, his philosophy would bear him up under it. He and Jake Borland grew more and more distant towards each other, and Sabattus kept his keen eyes fixed upon him lest he might be disposed to do him some violence. Jake hated the whole Indian race, and Sabattus had strong prejudices against the pale faces. Jake had several times taken the measure of the Indian, or in other words, surveyed him to see if he could handle him in case they should come to blows, but the more he surveyed him and examined his well knit frame, the more unwilling was he to engage in a close contest. Jake was none too good to kill an Indian at any time, when he could do so without being noticed, or found out. He knew Sabattus battus had a valuable lot of furs, and the thought more than once came into his mind that he should like to possess himself of them, but he saw no opportunity to execute such purposes. Stealing the furs of the Indians has been too much practised by our people who have not hesitated to stain their hands with blood in order to obtain them.</p> 
                  <p>As has already been intimated, in previous chapters a change came over the spirit of Mrs. Searsmont's dream since Mr. Pips had visited her lodge and apparently had become so much smitten with her charms. Her daughter having grown up and old enough to be married, the mother began to feel some of those dreams of ambition which haunted her in earlier life. If her daughter became the wife of Mr. Pips, who she believed had wealth enough to live respectably, she herself would be willing to leave her lodge in the wilderness and return to a more civilized life. She felt as if she had paid the penalties of all her crimes, and her age would shield her against the reproaches of the world or the sneers of her relatives and friends, if any were living.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pips had catechised her upon the history of her life, but as yet he had found out but little, for she was not disposed to reveal those secrets which he was so anxious to find out. He had, however, ascertained that she once lived in his own native city, and had not forgotten its many streets and localities; but who her parents were, whether she was married or not, or who was the father of her daughter, were matters he had not pried into. Finding her rather unwilling to be free on such subjects, he had very properly refrained from pressing them. Still, his curiosity was very great to know more of her life and learn more definitely the cause that drove her into such strange solitude. He had his suspicions, but yet he did not let them be known to her or to any one else. Had the good old Paulo lived, she might not have changed her notions of life, but now he was dead she felt like once more emerging from the forest and going back to the scenes of her girlhood. It is not strange that she should have such aspirations. Being very impulsive, and feeling much wronged by the rougher sex, she suddenly started for the forest, not caring much whether she lived or died. It was a desperate movement on her part, but she was goaded to make it by the keenest anguish. Providentially, a friendly, kind hearted son of the forest, found her in distress and provided for her. The Indian would not forsake her, but watched over and protected herself and infant daughter. After that fit of partial insanity passed off, and reason assumed its throne, shame forbade her going back into the world, and seeking her relations and friends. She lived on week after week, month after mouth, and year after year, until forest life became pleasant to her. Her daughter grew more interesting every day, and the good Indian Paulo, still kept near and provided for them. Age crept upon her, and with it, sober, second thoughts, until she began to think again of living in the civilized world where her daughter would have other society than that of the Indians. Some two or three year before Paulo's death, she began to entertain such thoughts, and after he was dead, they assumed a more serious and determined character. The arrival of Tom Pips, and especially his apparent partiality for her daughter, made her wish to exchange her life for a different one, but she did not let him know all her feelings, for every thing must be voluntary on his part. If he really loved her as he appeared to do, and desired to remove them both from their forest life, she finally concluded to consent to such an engagement.</p> 
                  <p>It may seem somewhat strange that Mr. Pips could not tell whether he loved this forest maid or not, but he possessed a very peculiar temperament and organization, and what is more, he had long indulged in a favorite theory, and had given it so much thought, that it almost became part and parcel of his very nature Ever since the death of his beloved Catherine Watson, he believed, and greatly cultivated that belief, that he could never love another woman. Miss Tabitha Spiker endeavored to shake this belief, but she never did more than excite his sympathy. Believing that she deeply loved him, he could not but feel a strong sympathy for her, for well he knew how to feel for those who could not obtain the object of their love. Pips loved the tender sex generally, but then only one woman ever kindled the fire of true love in his heart. Since the death of Miss Watson, he had become acquainted with thousands of beautiful and interesting ladies, but not one of them could he love. The first time he saw this forest girl she excited strange emotions in his heart, but he could not all at once give up his favorite theory which he had studied so long, and believe he loved a second time. There was a severe struggle in his mind between his favorite theory and the emotions which the singular beauty of Sarah Searsmont had excited within him. Days and even weeks were spent in dreaming over this subject. Several times had he concluded that he would leave the lodge and return to the city, but at such moments would the charms of this daughter of the forest appear ten times more fascinating to him, and he would abandon his resolution to go and remain in the company of his enchantress. Thus he continued for more than three weeks, every hour he remained weakening his resolution to go without the girl, whose peculiar charms had wrought such a revolution in his feelings. During all this time the mother closely observed him and watched for his movements. Sarah too, became more and more pleased with him, and that circumstance added not a little strength to the cord that bound him. One beautiful morning, about three weeks after his arrival as a guest of this singular mother, he invited her to accompany him to Paulo's grave. She readily consented, for she expected some developement of his plans and calculations. His mind was made up, fully made up. He had a most singular and <choice>
                        <sic>intrresting</sic>
                        <corr>interesting</corr>
                     </choice> dream the previous night, and as a feather will turn the nicely balanced scales, so may a dream change the mind and direct it to a certain end. They reached the grave in silence. Not a word was spoken by either while traveling up the beaten path that led to it from the lodge.</p> 
                  <p>"There lies sleeping in the dust one who was your best earthly friend," said Pips pointing to the mound of earth that covered the dead Paulo, and gazing intently upon the woman's face.</p> 
                  <p>"Never did mortal lips utter truer words," she replied, while a tear stood trembling in her eye, and a sigh escaped from her overburthened heart.</p> 
                  <p>"You have a daughter, a most lovely and interesting daughter," he continued. "And although she was brought up in the solitude of the forest, far from civilized society, yet a mother's instruction and kind nature have made her deeply interesting to me. I am constrained to say, after much reflection, after anxious days and almost sleepless nights, passed within the charmed circle, that I love her. Before I came to this forest and became your guest, I never expected to say so much of any living woman, but the emotions her singular beauty and unaffected innocence have excited within my breast, tell me in language I cannot now misinterpret that I love her more than all earthly objects besides. I speak what I feel, and heaven knows I have it not in my heart to practice deception. My designs towards your daughter are pure as any the human heart is capable of indulging. There is some thing about her which has won my affections, that something I cannot explain, but it is a charm which no other woman possesses over me. A few weeks age I was not a believer in second love, but my favorite theory has been shaken, and I now feel that I must give it up, and frankly confess that your daughter has awakened in my heart that passion."</p> 
                  <p>During the time he was delivering the above remarks she stood with her eyes fastened upon the grave of Paulo. A thousand strange thoughts passed through her mind. She remembered but too well the time she first met Paulo in the wood with the child in her arms! The trackless wilderness was before her and scenes behind, which she wished to avoid and never see again. The civilized world had lost its charms and she wandered forth she cared not where. She was silent sometime after Pips ceased to speak. He narrowly watched the expressions of her intelligent but wrinkled face. Upon the words which he expected she would soon utter, hung his hopes of worldly bliss. Never were so many thoughts crowded into his mind within so short a space of time. At last she spoke and he trembled when he first saw her lips in motion.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips, I have heard your remarks, and well<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6823-00000034"/> considered them," she replied. "Something of the kind. I have been expecting to hear from you; therefore I am not so much surprised as I might have been under other circumstances, neither do I require so much time to answer you. I am aware that you know not the father of the daughter whom you say you love, but her mother you do know. It may appear strange to you that I have lived so long in this forest. It seems strange to me, but I believe I had sufficient cause for seeking this solitude where I could hide my shame from the world. My daughter is an illegitimate child, but she had no agency in her own birth and cannot be holden responsible for it. The blame, however much it may be falls upon her mother and upon him whom I hope never to see again. He deceived and induced me to follow him in the fortunes of war upon a most sacred promise of marriage. I did follow him, for I loved, sincerely, deeply loved him. My child was born, and then he began to treat me with coldness, a coldness that fell like ice upon my fond heart. I reminded him of his most solemn promise, but his heart could not be moved. I saw him with another woman! It was enough! I could endure no more. A heavy cloud hung over me. My mind whirled round and my heart was sick. In a fit of desperation I seized my child in my arms and sallied out! The drums were beating and the voices of the officers of the American army fell upon my ears, and among them I recognized the voice of him who had so cruelly deceived me. That voice that only increased my desperation! I hurried on and entered the dark forest, expecting to die with my child upon my bosom, and still struggling through the tangled wood, I could not control the frenzy that had seized upon my soul. "Away! away!" I said within my own heart, from all human habitations! And I hastened my steps and thought of nothing but to hide myself in the depths of the forest from the sight of civilized beings. Some time I traveled, and the beating of the drums grow fainter and fainter upon my ears. I thanked God that the martial sounds did grow fainter and I burst into a song of wild joy when I could no longer hear that officer's voice marshalling the troops who had come there to fight the British forces. I sang a wild song while I sat upon a fallen tree which echoed through the wood and down the valley of a small stream that trickled along near my feet. Such music I never sang before, and my child nestled closer to my bosom as if it instinctively felt that its mother's mind was disordered! I heard the dry twigs crack and saw through the bushes a human form, but it did not at first approach me. When it did approach I thanked heaven it was not a white man. Paulo stood before me, but I trembled not at the sight of an Indian, neither could fear come upon me if a beast of prey had leaped towards me. My feelings had carried me beyond anything like fear. I gazed upon the son of the forest, and God gave me power to read his face, every lineament of which seemed to me to betoken kindness and benevolence. And I read it aright. His presence <choice>
                        <sic>somewhas</sic>
                        <corr>somewhat</corr>
                     </choice> calmed me. In broken English he offered to show me the way back, supposing I had strayed away and become lost in the woods, but I suddenly rose and pointed the other way. I told him the wrongs I had suffered and that I never wished to see a pale face again. He understood, and listened attentively. O, how deeply does an Indian feel such wrongs. After I had briefly finished my story, he remained silent and thoughtful. At last he said in a voice which could not be mistaken, and I seem to hear its guttural tones now, "<emph>me kill him for you!</emph>" Nay, let him go, I remarked. Stain not thy hand with human blood on my account. I'll plunge further into the forest and there die. I then started off, but he followed close behind me. God had put it into his heart not to let me and my child suffer and die. I turned round and faced him. Kindness beamed from his dark eyes as he pointed to the clear sky above our heads.</p> 
                  <p>"The Great Spirit tell me you no die!" he said. "Me take care of you and the pale face papoose." Oh, Mr. Pips, how can I forget those words?"</p> 
                  <p>"You can't forget them," replied Pips, in broken accents, while the tears streamed down his cheeks and his heart was full to bursting.</p> 
                  <p>"And I never have forgotten, nor can I forgot him who uttered them," she continued. "Surely, the Great Spirit spoke truth to him. He did not let me die, nor my child suffer. How long he continued to provide for and protect me, you have already heard."</p> 
                  <p>"Who was that cruel officer who thus abused you?" asked Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Ask me not for his name, for I hate to have it upon my lips," she replied. "Now, Mr. Pips, you have heard my story, can you love my daughter?"</p> 
                  <p>"More than ever!" he replied, with a voice full of sympathy.</p> 
                  <p>"Take her then, for I believe she reciprocates your affection," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"I will, and you must accompany us to the city," he replied. "I will provide for you both, and if your daughter gives her consent, I will make her my lawful wife."</p> 
                  <p>"You have my most cheerful consent," she said "I believe you are honest and sincere."</p> 
                  <p>"Heaven knows I am," he answered with much fervency. "All I can do shall be done to render you and your daughter happy."</p> 
                  <p>"O, Mr. Pips, this is a new era in my life!" she exclaimed. "I am now somewhat advanced in years, and believe I have paid the penalty of my crime. God knows how much and how severely I have repented. I will now go back to the scenes of my girlhood, I left a fond mother and a proud but loving sister, to follow the fortunes of an American officer; but, whether they are living or not, is more than I know. Well do I remember their remonstrations, but my love for the officer was stronger than any earthly power; I broke away from all restraints and blindly followed the devices of my heart; I believed, too fondly believed, he loved me, and would keep his most sacred promises, but he did not! If he lives, he is still in the power of a just Providence, and if he is dead, he will have the punishment due to his crime! Vengeance does not belong to me, and almost a score of years, passed in the solitude of this forest, have taught me that lesson I have long ago ceased to love him, and I have tried not to hate him, for no one can have hate in the heart and be tranquil and happy."</p> 
                  <p>"Never were truer words spoken, and yet how natural it is to hate a man under such circumstances," said Pips. "You have taught me a good lesson, but one hard to practice."</p> 
                  <p>"I know it well," she answered. "But I have been where I could learn and practice such lessons. I have been away, far removed from the temptations of the world, where I had nothing to do but to discipline my own heart and instruct my daughter. The conversational rules of society, its restraints, its fashions and corruptions had no influence, situated as I have been; I had in early life learned enough of them to know how much they cramp the mind and blind the heart. Often have I imagined a state of society, which, seemed <unclear>to</unclear> me to be far more beautiful and heavenly than an now on the earth, I have dreamed of a place where all were as true hearted, as kind and virtuous as the good Paulo, whose earthly remains lie before us. Ah, Mr. Pips, his soul was as pure as the spirit that made it Although he knew nothing of the forms of christianity, yet its spirit had deeply imbued his heart. He had not been taught to read the bible and knew not that such a book was in the world, yet God had written his law upon his heart and inscribed it upon the tablet of his memory, so that he neither misapprehended it nor forgot it. It was always there and ruled his thoughts and actions."</p> 
                  <p>"No wonder, my dear madam, you entertain such an opinion of that good Indian," said Pips. "And surely I shall have reason to remember him, for he has protected her whom I now love. Yes, and taught her many wild and innocent sports, which, in my estimation are more interesting, and I may say valuable, than many things now taught in our boarding schools. But these things we can talk over at other times. I have been gone so much longer than I contemplated that I am anxious to be on my journey back to the city. We must make our <choice>

                  <p>"But Sarah has nothing suitable to wear into the city," she said. "I have clothes which I have saved for many years. The material is good, but I suppose they will be quite out of fashion. However, I care not for that, my age will protect me against the rude treatment of the world."</p> 
                  <p>"That same beautiful birch bark hat and calico dress, in which I first saw her, your daughter must wear," he replied. "I could not consent to change them for any article of the most costly wardrobe. I long to see her in the city thus dressed."</p> 
                  <p>"If you desire it, I shall make no objections," she answered, smiling for the first time since they stood over Paulo's grave.</p> 
                  <p>"Her birch canoe and every thing the good Paulo has made for her must be conveyed to the city," he said; "not an article must be left behind. Even to me, they are precious relies, and to you and her they must be doubly so. But what will Sabbattus say? How will he feel? I think a good deal of him, for he loves Sarah."</p> 
                  <p>"He's a true hearted son of the forest," she replied. "Sarah's will is his law. If she prefers you, he will bow in submission to her will, and neither bate you nor her as some more refined persons in fashionable life might do. Like the good Paulo he will exercise a sound philosophy and say in his heart it is all right. Ah. Mr. Pips the pale faces have never yet learned the Indian's true character. Their sense of wrong and injustice is very keen. True, they have made war upon the whites and have murdered them, but we must remember that the whites first made war upon them and drove them from their hunting grounds. They felt as if the Great Spirit gave them these forests, and to be driven from them they say is robbery, and such robbery as will send a white man to prison if he commits it on another white man. Paulo has talked to me long and eloquently upon this subject, and I have thought that his arguments could not be refuted by all the learning and wisdom of the civilized world."</p> 
                  <p>Pips fully agreed to all she said, and they went to the lodge. Just before they reached there, they saw Sabbattus leap like a tiger upon Jake Borland and crush him to the earth. Soon the Indian held up in his hand Borland's large knife, Pips was alarmed and so was his boatman. Pips had no courage to boast of, and did not move towards the scene of strife In a moment the beautiful form of Sarah was seen gliding towards the combatants, she exclaimed in Indian, 'you must not kill him!'"</p> 
                  <p>"Me no kill him, only take his knife away, so he no kill me," replied Sabbattus stepping aside and letting Borland get up.</p> 
                  <p>Jake got up, and looked ashamed enough, Having had some high words, and Jake becoming saucy and full of blackguardism, drew his knife and threatened to take the life of Sabbattus, who instantly leaped upon him. He was so quick that Jake was flat on his back upon the ground, before be was hardly conscious what thus prostrated him. Sabbattus was a powerful Indian, quick as a wild-cat and muscular as a bear. Borland had long been blackguarding him and Sabattus could bear it no longer; besides, he thought Jake intended to plunge his knife into him. Now the truth is, Borland did not intend to stab the Indian or take his life, but only to frighten him. Jake, however, got the worst end of the bargain, even so far as frighting was concerned, for he was terribly stricken with fear, when he saw the shining blade of his own knife flourished over his head.</p> 
                  <p>After Borland rose, he remained silent, and seemed to be afraid of again provoking the Indian, if he said any thing. Mr. Pips gazed upon the scene with astonishment, and Sarah could not refrain from smiling, after she saw that no blood would be spilt.</p> 
                  <p>Sabbattus now learned from the mother that she and the others were going to leave the lodge she had occupied for so many years and visit the great city. A cloud of sorrow passed over his manly brow, but soon he recovered his self possession and appeared reconciled. He concluded to accompany them, for he was bound to some village on the western shore of the lake to dispose of his furs. The noise of preparation was now heard in that humble lodge, and all were busy in making arrangements for the journey. The morning came, and the weather was fine. Before they started, however, Sarah, her mother and Pips, visited Paulo's grave, and there poured out their grateful hearts. Pips was apparently as much affected as either of the others. Having heard such an extraordinary character given of the dead Paulo, and knowing that he had for many years protected the girl he loved, he could not avoid weeping, as he stood over the Indian's grave for the last time. All three mingled their sympathies, and their tears watered the grave of the good Indian. Slowly and solemnly they turned away from that mound of earth which was so dear to them and passed down to the lodge. Every thing worth carrying away or which might serve as a memento of past scenes was car fully packed up. The lodge and some articles <unclear>left behind</unclear> were given to Sabbattus, for which he seemed quite grateful. Soon they were on the lake. Pips was <unclear>full of</unclear> joy in the presence of Sarah, and anticipated much pleasure in surprising his friends in the city with the unsurpassing beauty of the forest girl.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE WAY A MILITARY OFFICER COURTS A DASHING WIDOW-HIS TACTICS AND HER SKILL-A LITTLE MORE OF THE CHILD.</head> 
                  <p>The widow Watson and little Jenny get along finely together. Since she believed that Jenny was really the daughter of Mr. Pips, she loved her more than ever. The <unclear>sealed</unclear> package remained untouched, but the widow was exceedingly anxious to know its contents. Her strongest impression was, that it contained Mr. Pips' will and directions to her, how to bring up the child. Although her anxiety to see the contents of the package was so great, yet she kept her promise most religiously. Perhaps had she not believed that the document was from Mr. Pips himself, she might have had less strength of resolution to keep her promise. It must be confessed that her temptation was very great. Every day now seemed a month to her, and she began to fear that Mr. Pips would never again be seen in the city. This fear was strengthened by Tabitha and the dashing widow Barlow, both of whom occasionally visited the old lady. Mrs. Barlow had nearly given up all hopes of Mr. Pips and received the addresses of Major Lenox. The major was all for expedition in this enterprise, but the widow was for postponement from week to week. It did not become the <unclear>military</unclear> gentleman to press his suit too violently, or hurry the nuptials contrary to the declared wishes of his intended bride. He had now become a frequent visitor at the house, and anticipated the day with great pleasure when he should become lord of the splendid in mansion. Never did the major ply his arts more industriously, nor exert himself to please more strenuously. His conversation was full of anecdote, wit and humor, and upon his tongue were the honied words of love. He was a very different man from her first husband, and we are bound to say she drew much pleasure from the contrast. Her husband had always been a strict and enterprising business man, and hence the large estate which our military hero hoped to appropriate to his own use. The major was a better looking man than Mr. Barlow ever was, and his manners more engaging. The widow saw all this and was gratified; still she had some lingering doubts in relation to the moral parity of the major's character. She could bring nothing directly against him, nor embody enough of his past follies to constitute a crime. But he had been talked about, and some ladies looked very wise when his name was mentioned. Mrs. Barlow knew that, but then she hoped, and was inclined to believe, that a great portion of the gossip had no foundation in truth. It was generally conceded that he had been a brave and gallant officer, in our last war with England, and the widow thought much of bravery in a man. And she might have thought more of such an element in a man's character, because her husband was so cautious and prudent in all his movements. She loved the dashing character, and listened with intense interest to many of the major's stories, in which he was always sure to figure as the hero. He often spoke of the battles in which he had been engaged, the feats he performed, the dangers he providentially escaped, and the great prowess he exhibited on certain occasions. Now the major spoke of some skirmishes and great feats, which never found a page in our military history, but he was seldom at fault; for he could draw on his imagination for his facts, if he did not on his memory for his wit. He had now a great victory to gain; one that would give him ease and comfort for the remainder of<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6823-00000035"/> his life, if it did not add to his military fame; and, therefore, he exerted all his power and plied most skillfully all his arts. Anything which he thought would please the widow, he did not hesitate to do, even if the doing of it demanded a small sacrifice of moral principle. The next day after she had visited Mrs. Watson, to enquire about Mr. Pips, he called upon her in a new military suit, which had just been brought from the tailor's. It was an admirable fit for his manly and symmetrical form, and made him look some few years younger. He said within himself, "in this suit I must storm the citadel of the widow's heart, and teach her how to love a brave and gallant officer."</p> 
                  <p>During this visit the conversation naturally turned upon Mr. Pips, for the widow had learned some things about the celebrated angler, which she thought too good to keep even from the major.</p> 
                  <p>"O, major," she said, after he had been relating some of his military anecdotes. "I have recently heard some strange stories about our friend Pips!"</p> 
                  <p>"Have you, indeed," he replied. "What shines has the good bachelor been cutting up?"</p> 
                  <p>The widow blushed a very little, but made no reply. He had his eye upon her.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, my dear Mrs. Barlow, don't spoil a good story," he continued. "What have you heard about the angler? Has he promised to marry Miss Tabitha Spiker, opposite here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Good heavens, no!" she replied, looking quite sour, as she always did when she heard that name mentioned. "He never would consent to such an arrangement as that, I'm quite sure. The man who would wed that Spike must be a singular mortal. If I were a man, I should much rather wed a hop-pole."</p> 
                  <p>The major laughed quite heartily, as though he relished her wit, and pleased her much.</p> 
                  <p>"Hop-pole! he! he! he! Capital!" he said. "Good! hop-pole. A man might sleep with that soundly, for the hops are a good narcotic. Capital! first rate! But what about Tom Pips?"</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Watson has a very beautiful little girl with her-left there under very peculiar circumstances," she replied. "There's some mystery about this child!"</p> 
                  <p>"You don't say so!" he answered, apparently much surprised. "He! he! he! Capital! A pretty child! Well, what more?"</p> 
                  <p>"You understand, major," she said, smiling, and covering up one side of her face.</p> 
                  <p>"I think I do," he answered, laughing. "They say Tom Pips is the father! Well done, friend Tom. Thou hast done wonders truly! Have I guessed right, my dear Mrs. Barlow?"</p> 
                  <p>"You need'nt guess again!" she replied, smiling very archly.</p> 
                  <p>"I thought so," he said. "What does old Mrs. Watson say?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, she says a great many things," she answered. "She don't know for a certainty that Mr. Pips is the father, but then she has'nt much doubt of it from all she can learn."</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose not," he replied. "Then it seems Tom Pips don't devote his whole time to angling, after all."</p> 
                  <p>"Why, major, how you talk!" she said, smiling with one eye and looking sober with the other.</p> 
                  <p>"I should like to see Tom now," he said. "I wonder how he will feel when he hears the little girl call him father? He! he! he! That's capital! A good joke. Have you heard from him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not a word," she answered. "Mrs. Watson fears he never will return, he has been gone so much longer than he expected when he went away. And there is a scaled package left with her which she thinks contains the will of Mr. Pips."</p> 
                  <p>"Why don't she open it and see?" he asked. "A woman is not destitute of curiosity, understand."</p> 
                  <p>"There, major, take that for slandering our sex," she replied, gently boxing his right ear.</p> 
                  <p>He seized her fat, chubby form in his arms and kissed her. There was quite a squabble for a few moments, in which she entirely forgot her first husband. Thrice he kissed her ere she broke away from his grasp. No damage was done, nor offence given. The sun shone brighter for the passing cloud. Both laughed, and one of her cheeks looked more red than usual, and one of her curls had strayed from the place she had assigned it.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, to be serious, major," she said. "There's some mystery about that child and package. Why only think, the girl is nearly three years old! How could he conceal the affair so long?"</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps the business was all done up in the country," he replied, archly smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps so, and now he has taken the child to city and means to provide for it," she said. "Well, that's right; men ought to provide for their own children. It looks well in Mr. Pips."</p> 
                  <p>"O, Tom is good hearted, but some fair damsel led him astray," he answered.</p> 
                  <p>"But he is in duty bound to marry the woman," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"I perfectly agree with you, my dear Mrs. Borland," he answered. "Perhaps he may, if she is yet living."</p> 
                  <p>"But he ought to have done it three years ago," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"It may be she wouldn't have him," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, major, you needn't talk to me thus," she answered. "You know better than you talk. I'm fearful Mr. Pips has done very wrong. Men sometimes are not so good as they appear to be. Their hearts may be dark when they look well upon the outside."</p> 
                  <p>The major felt the full force of her remark, and winced a little, but he soon recovered his self-possession.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, my dear, you're rather hard upon our sex," he replied. "I'm not disposed, however, to dispute what you say, for I presume you do not intend to include all men in such a category. There are, I trust, many honorable exceptions."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope so, but we ladies hardly know how to make the distinction, there is so much counterfeiting of virtue in the world."</p> 
                  <p>"I think, my dear Mrs. Barlow, your experience, observation, and natural sagacity, will guard and protect you from all hypocrites and deceivers," he replied. "If I were such a character as we have been talking about, you should be the last lady I should undertake to deceive."</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Major," she replied; "you-"</p> 
                  <p>"There, there, call it flattery or what you will, I mean just what I said," interrupted the Major. "I say it again, you're the last lady I should hope to deceive, if I were disposed to practice any such art, or had the heart to do it. I will stick to that in spite of all you can say."</p> 
                  <p>He was so pleasant and yet resolute in forcing the compliment upon her, that she finally swallowed it without making up a wry face. He was a bold tactician, and perseverance was one of his peculiar characteristics. He believed in marching directly onwards and crushing the foe with overpowering strength, if it could be done; but, if strength was lacking, then he would make it up by striking terror into the opposing ranks, especially if there was not a good chance to retreat. When the Major bestowed a compliment upon a lady, he made her receive it whether she was apparently willing or not. Such was his theory and such his practice, and he always said he never found much difficulty in accomplishing his object.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, Major, you military gentlemen have always been used to commanding, and I suppose I must obey," she said, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"When we have truth and honor upon our side we always go ahead," he answered. "Well do I remember an incident that took place in our last war with the British lion."</p> 
                  <p>"And what was that?" she anxiously inquired, gazing intently into his fair face.</p> 
                  <p>"I then had the command of a company near the Canada line," he replied. "We had left the main army at some distance behind, and were reconnoitering the enemy to see how much force he had, and how it was disposed, in order to make arrangements for a general battle. It was night when I started on this expedition at the head of fifty chosen men, who, I knew would pass through fire and water if I led the way. And, my dear Mrs. Barlow, permit me here to say, that, I always pushed on in advance of my men, and bid them follow. I never fell in the rear when danger threatened and bid them go ahead."</p> 
                  <p>"Strange one can have courage to rush into battle so," she said, in trembling tones as if she already heard the drums beating and the cannons booming.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"O, we get used to it, and have no fears of death," he said. Well, as I was saying, I pushed ahead with my men at my heels. We crossed a ravine and ascended upon the other side. The moon shone feebly, for the heavens were cloudy, and the woods were dark and dreary. Having ascended the hill, we entered a thick grove of trees of various kinds and stood upon a plain; but, the trees were so thick and the rays of the moon so much obscured by the clouds which every moment threatened rain, that we could not see six rods ahead. The wind began to sweep through the trees and the big drops of rain commenced to fall. A vivid flash of lightning followed by a loud roar of thunder disclosed to my view a large force of the enemy within musket shot of us. "Fear not," I said to my brave followers. "Wait until another flash of lightning shows you the enemy. Let every man's gun be at his shoulder, and fire as the electric fluid gives you sight." Instantly every gun was elevated, waiting for the signal from the clouds. A flash came, and ere the thunder followed it, the blaze of fifty muskets illumined the forest, and fifty bullets sped on their errand of death!"</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the widow, nervously grasping his arm as if she needed protection in that fearful battle which imagination painted before her, "how dared you do so?"</p> 
                  <p>"Many of our shots proved fatal," he continued. "We distinctly heard the groans of the dying, and orders from the commanding officer to retreat. They did retreat with great haste and confusion, leaving the field and their dead and dying to us. The shower soon passed over, and we encamped on the ground that night. In the morning early we counted sixteen of the enemy dead, and several so much wounded that they could not escape. We buried the dead in one common grave, and ministered to the wants of the wounded. Much to our surprise, we ascertained that our enemy was an entire regiment numbering nearly one thousand rank and file. Here fifty Americans put nearly a thousand Britons to flight. In the morning my soldiers enjoyed a hearty laugh at the cowardice of our foes. We returned to our main army with the laurels of victory on our brows. The British were ashamed enough when they learned the number of my men. When peace was proclaimed it so happened that I had an interview with the British colonel who commanded the regiment we so much frightened, and joked him on the occasion. He remarked from our firing and its fatality among his men in a dark night, that he supposed we had two, if not three regiments on the ground. Never did men fire truer in the light of the electric fluid than mine did on that memorable occasion. It was a great feat and several of my soldiers were promoted in consequence of it."</p> 
                  <p>"O, I don't see how men can face the deadly guns with such courage," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"When our country is wronged, we ought to show true courage," he replied. "Should my country be insulted by any foreign power I should be ready at a moment's warning to take command of an army, and face the cannon's mouth."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope we never shall have war again," said Mrs. Barlow.</p> 
                  <p>"I presume we shall not in our day," he replied, feeling pleased to hear her after such a sentiment, because he thought he discovered in it a love for him, and fear that war might separate him from her. Some time was spent in the discussion of war and its incidents, and he told the story of his killing six Indians with his own sword. That was a most remarkable feat, and made the widow's blood creep coldly about her heart. At last Pips and his little girl became the topic of conversation again. The widow's curiosity was great, and she was curious to penetrate the mystery that hung over that singular affair.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose I saw the mother of the little girl," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, indeed!" he replied. "Was she very beautiful? I conclude she must be, for Mr. Pips has a fine taste."</p> 
                  <p>"She is not beautiful but very smart looking," she replied. "She is not young either."</p> 
                  <p>"Are you sure that woman was the mother?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I am not, but then it would seem so. True, she declared she was not, but she would <unclear>not</unclear> tell who was. There's mystery upon mystery, and I intend to find out more about it. The child is the most beautiful little girl you ever saw."</p> 
                  <p>"I dare say she had a handsome mother," he replied. "But if I were you I would not go near the old lady. Perhaps, after all, Mr. Pips may not be the father, and the mother may be a vile woman. There's no knowing about these things.</p> 
                  <p>"Why Major, the little girl is so perfectly beautiful, that I have thought of trying to get her from old Mrs. Watson," said the widow. "I wish you could see her, for I know you would be charmed with the little creature."</p> 
                  <p>"I think I shall let Pips, or whoever else may be the girl's father, take care of their children without my interference," he replied. "The girl may be handsome, but we don't know yet who her parents are. The best policy is to let her alone for the present."</p> 
                  <p>"I intend to go and see the widow again, and hear what the news may be," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"I understood you to say that Mrs. Watson would not break the seal of the package, until she was authorised to do so. And do you think she will keep her promise?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have no doubt of her honesty and integrity on that score," she replied. "Mrs. Watson appears to be a fine old lady. Perhaps she has received authority to open the package by this time Really, I should like to know what it contains."</p> 
                  <p>"Now I havn't the least curiosity to know," he said. My opinion is that Pips has no concern in the affair, still he may have, for truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. The reason he has not returned before now, is because he finds good hunting and fishing and we all know his passion for such sports."</p> 
                  <p>"You may be right Major, but some how or other, it seems to me that Mr. Pips is the father, and that woman I saw at Mrs. Watson's is the mother."</p> 
                  <p>"You can do as you please, but I shall not trouble myself about the affair," he said.</p> 
                  <p>He was anxious to introduce another subject, which was near his heart, but how to do so was the next question. He flattered himself that he had made great progress in gaining her affections, and he was somewhat in a hurry to have the knot tied. Being fully aware that there's many a slip between the cup and the lip, he was anxious to hasten the day that should make them one in the sight of the law. A fine prospect was before this military character, and he could not well endure the thought of losing sight of it. Mrs. Barlow had a few lingering hopes of seeing Mr. Pips ere she became Mrs. Lenox. And if he was not the father of the strange child, she might even secure him for a husband. Although the major had flattered and pleased her, told some very remarkable stories and declared his most ardent and sincere love for her, yet there were some points in the character of Pips for which she had a great fancy. Besides, if she could marry Pips, it would strike just such a blow on the heart of Tabitha Spiker, as would please her much. She hated Tabitha, and to be thus revenged upon her, would be sweet indeed. Such considerations had some influence in putting off the Major, much to his chagrin and disappointment. He felt as if he must introduce the subject, and hear what she had to say about it.</p> 
                  <p>"My dear Mrs. Barlow, we have conversed upon a variety of subjects, but there is one dearer to my heart than all others, which we have thus far pleased in silence," he said, after a long pause.</p> 
                  <p>"And Major, what is that?" she inquired, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Now my dear, you know what I mean, but the ladies have a wonderful tact in avoiding some things. O, the great trouble of the gentlemen," he said, assuming a very sweet smile.</p> 
                  <p>There again, you're too hard upon the tender sex," she replied. "I'm sure the ladies have no tact at all, but the gentlemen are full of it. We are all simplicity and innocence, while you tack and turn a thousand ways. And again, there are certain matters to which we are obliged to be listeners. Fond of using our tongues as we are accused of being, still our modesty compels us to be silent on some subjects."</p> 
                  <p>"Very well, and therefore I will do all the talking," he replied. "You know my dear Mrs. Barlow that my earthly happiness is quite imperfect without your society."</p> 
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6823-00000036"/> 
                  <p>"And surely, are you not often with me," she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, but not so often as I could wish," he replied, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you must come still more often, if that will add to your pleasure," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"There is a time and season for all things, and my heart tells me in language which I cannot misunderstand, that the period has arrived when we ought to be married," he replied. "True, my courting seasons are happy ones, but the day of our marriage will greatly increase my happiness."</p> 
                  <p>"I should hope so if we are ever married," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Then why cannot we fix upon some day not far distant, when our marriage may be consummated?" he answered. "The sooner that day arrives, the happier for me. I can see no good resulting from a long postponement."</p> 
                  <p>"Widows have been accused of hurrying their second marriages, and I wish to show to the world that such charges are false.</p> 
                  <p>The Major, with all his tact, didn't know exactly how to answer her objection, it came in such a shape that it embarrassed him, and put him to his trumps. She noticed that he was rather pressed into a close corner, and smiled.</p> 
                  <p>There were reasons for postponing the marriage that he didn't dream of; at least, a few such operated upon her mind. Soon the other hand there were very urgent reasons for hastening the nuptials operating on his mind, of which she had not the most distant idea Thus it will be seen there was not a full and hearty understanding between them. There were secrets possessed by each. Had the widow known all that was passing in the Major's mind and heart she would have instantly discarded him forever, and with words at parting which he would never forget, for she had a voluble tongue and a ready sarcasm whenever occasion might call for their use. At last he plucked up courage to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"Whatever may have been said of other widows, my dear Mrs. Barlow, I think you will entirely escape the sneers and jeers of the world," he said. "Persons of our rank are placed above the scandal of the low and vulgar. We are too high game for such to fire at."</p> 
                  <p>"That may be, but I have not thus far in life found my elevated position a perfect shield against the darts of envy and malice," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Point me out the man who has dared to breathe slander upon you, and I will challenge him to mortal combat," said the Major, assuming an air of importance, and swelling with military pride.</p> 
                  <p>"It is the ladies, Major, who have showed me their spite, and surely you would not fight duels with them," she answered!</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, my dear Mrs. Barlow. I could not unsheath my sword in a contest with them, but I would read them a moral lecture that might teach them better manners," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well Major, we will postpone the subject of our marriage to some further interview. I am not now prepared to appoint a day for its celebration"</p> 
                  <p>Although he was anxious to have the day fixed upon, yet he was too polite to press the matter further at that time. He soon after took his leave-promising to call again soon. He went away full of doubts and misgivings, for there were secret pages of history which he was afraid might come before her eyes, and if they did, he knew his cake would go back to dough again.</p>

                  <p>"Mary, you must not receive any more visits from that Irish coachman," said Tabitha Spiker. "He's a very saucy man, and I trust you will dismiss him forever"</p> 
                  <p>"A few weeks ago, and ye praised him muckle," replied the undaunted Scotch maiden." "He was then prudent and polite, and had laid up a gude many pounds. Ye ken I'm a puir body, and work for a living."</p> 
                  <p>"True, Mary, I then thought he was a nice young man, but I hadn't learn't so much of his character as I know now," replied Tabitha. "That saucy Mrs. Chubby has changed him. She's enough to spoil any man."</p> 
                  <p>"Except Major Lenox, ye wad say," replied Mary, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I will except him, for he has been spoiled for years," said Tabitha. "He's a heartless man, and a pet companion of Mrs. Chubby. Good Lord! I hope she'll marry him! If he don't make her money fly, then no rake can do such a work"</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps she will not wed him after all," replied Mary. "Jimmy McCrate-"</p> 
                  <p>"There, Mary, for heaven's sake don't take that fellow's name upon your lips again! The very mention of it makes my heart sick. He's a proud, saucy Irishman, and that's enough."</p> 
                  <p>"But I was about to tell ye what he said about Mr. Pips and the widow Barlow," replied Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I'll hear that," said Tabitha, feeling anxious to know anything relating to the long absent Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Aweel, I'll tell ye what Jemmy did say," continued Mary." "And Jimmy willna' speak falsehood. He said the widow Barlow fancies Mr. Pips a muckle sight more than she does Major Lenox."</p> 
                  <p>Gracious heavens!" exclaimed Tabitha, holding up her long arms and letting them drop down by her side. "Mr. Pips fancy Mrs. Chubby. It is'nt true, although the foolish widow may think so. She's just the person he would dislike above all others. I have often heard Mr. Pips say that he disliked such short, fat, chubby forms, for there can be no gracefulness in their movements. No, no, Mary. I know what Mr. Pips likes. His fancy is for a tall, slender, genteel form."</p> 
                  <p>"Just the like o' yours," replied Mary, laughing. "But ye think Mr. Pips has a little bairn. And if he has, ye wadna wed the man, wad ye? Muckle gude may sic a man do ye, but I wadna wed him if his whole body were shining gold."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Mary, you know nothing of love's power yet, especially second love," said Tabitha, placing her hand upon her side and sighing." "I feel sorry for Mr. Pips! Some evil and wicked woman has led him away in his hour of greatest temptation!"</p> 
                  <p>"I wadna gie muckle for a man who couldna stand up against a wicked woman's temptation," said Mary, "Sic a man is na man for Mary Campbell. The power o' second love! Na power o' that ilk couldna gar me love sic a man."</p> 
                  <p>"<unclear>Wait</unclear> until you feel it before you speak thus of it," said Tabitha. "You are but a <unclear>child</unclear> in these great works of the human soul."</p> 
                  <p>"Bairn or na bairn, I cannot nae sic feelings," said Mary. "I'll na be mither to a bairn I didna gie suck to."</p> 
                  <p>"It's no use for you and I to talk, for we never could agree in matters of love," said Tabitha. "When you have my experience then you'll be qualified to converse upon such a fruitful subject. Mr. Pips may never return-he may die. Alas! he may now be dead! It he is, I dare say his last thoughts were upon me. He loved me, and I knew it, but he was reluctant to confess it, for he feared to do the least violence to the memory of his first love."</p> 
                  <p>"Ye say if he be dead his last thoughts were upon you. More like they were on his bairn," said Mary. "Gie me a man's first loo, and any body may hae the second that likes."</p> 
                  <p>"You talk like a silly girl," replied Tabitha "You will be wiser one of these days. O, I should like to know what has become of Mr. Pips! Everything relating to him seems to be involved in mystery. I wonder if the widow Watson has heard anything from him? I haven't been there for three days. Perhaps she has been authorized to open a the sealed package. And she may have opened it and I was not there to see! I'll go there this very hour!"</p> 
                  <p>"And what if ye meet the widow Barlow there?" asked Mary, smiling. "Ye wad need <unclear>Jemmy</unclear> to keep you frae fighting a duel."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope in much mercy she's not there," replied Tabitha. "I don't see why she should so much interest herself about Mr. Pips or any of his concerns."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"She may become mither-in-law to the wee bairn," replied Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish you would stop your nonsense!" exclaimed the excited maid. "I'll hear no more of it." And out of the room she went, put on her bonnet and shawl, and hurried to Mrs. Watson's. The old lady had just returned from a short walk with little Jenny, who was full of life and spirit. The excitement of the walk, and the many objects she saw on the way, flushed her beautiful cheeks and made her look particularly lovely and interesting. Tabitha thought she looked ten times more beautiful than she ever did before. And what still more thrilled her heart with strange emotions, she fancied the little girl showed in her countenance a more marked resemblance to Mr. Pips than she had previously noticed. That circumstance gave her some very peculiar sensations. Strange as Mr. Pips had conducted himself, still she could not endure the thought of giving him up. As she gazed upon Jenny, and fancied she saw in her lovely features so many expressions similar to those she had oftentimes seen in the face of Mr. Pips, she felt as if she must kiss the child. And she did cover her face with warm kisses, but Jenny did not seem to fancy quite so much of the salutation, and struggled away from her and ran to the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you heard anything of Mr. Pips?" asked Tabitha, in breathless anxiety. "Have you opened the package? And is Mr. Pips the father of this dear little girl? Do you think that woman is the mother, or is the mother younger and more beautiful? Do tell me, Mrs. Watson, if that terrible woman, Mrs. Barlow, has been here recently? I don't see why she should trouble herself about the affairs of Mr. Pips! He never cared a single straw about her. But she would try to make people believe that he had fallen in love with her. But I can tell them Mr. Pips dislikes her very much. He don't fancy neither her face nor her form. Do answer me, Mrs. Watson, for you can't imagine how exceedingly anxious I feel. But the package! Have you been authorized to open that? Do answer me, Mrs. Watson, and keep me no longer in suspense."</p> 
                  <p>There was now a small breathing place in which the old lady might put in a word.</p> 
                  <p>"Answer you!" repeated Mrs Watson. "How can I do that when your tongue runs like a spinning wheel. Bless me! I can't remember half of your questions' I'm absolutely bewildered, and can't remember a single one for the life of me."</p> 
                  <p>"The package, Mrs. Watson, the package!" exclaimed Tabitha, manifesting much excitement.</p> 
                  <p>"That's in my bureau drawer," replied the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"And not been opened?" asked Tabitha, looking quite wild.</p> 
                  <p>"To be sure it has not, for I have received no word to open it," replied Mrs. Watson.</p> 
                  <p>"Not received any word yet," responded Tabitha. "It is very strange indeed! Then you have heard nothing from Mr. Pips?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not a word," replied the old lady. "It is very strange, as you say. I can't imagine where the man can be!"</p> 
                  <p>"Dead!" exclaimed the overburthened Tabitha, bursting out into a flood of tears, and sobbing like a child.</p> 
                  <p>"Dead!" repeated the old lady, throwing back her spectacles, and looking greatly surprised. "Dead! And has the good Mr. Pips gone down to the grave at last?"</p> 
                  <p>Tears stood in the widow's eyes, and little Jenny, seeing them both crying, cried too from actual sympathy. During a few moments the scene was really a melancholy one, and the silence was only disturbed by sobbing. Jenny clung to the old lady's skirts and trembled as if she really knew her father was dead.</p> 
                  <p>"Dead!" again sobbed the old lady. "When did he die, and where?"</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Tabitha, "I know not, but it seems to he must be dead, or we should have heard some thing from him before this time. When he left me he said he shouldn't be absent more than three weeks. And O, Mrs. Watson, if you could have seen the tender expressions in his beautiful eyes. There, Jenny's eyes reminded me of his, for he almost cried, and would have she tears before me if he had not hurried away. O dear Mrs. Watson, it was a very tender parting!"</p> 
                  <p>"Then you don't know he's dead for a certainty, do you?" asked the old lady opening her eyes wide, and beginning to feel some relief.</p> 
                  <p>"O, no, but then I think he must be!" replied Tabitha. "Only think how long he has been gone!"</p> 
                  <p>"Why did you frighten me so?" demanded the widow in a scolding voice. "I thought you knew he was dead. You said so!"</p> 
                  <p>"I know I did, and I think he may be drowned in the fish ponds," replied Tabitha. "He would not have staid away so long, unless some terrible accident had happened to him. I fear he will never write you a letter to open the package!"</p> 
                  <p>They were now silent for some minutes, and their tears were dried up. The old lady was in deep thought and meditation. Some how or other, Tabitha's speculations had a good deal of influence over her. Her mind was so much bewildered and there was so much mystery still hanging over the child, that she was greatly inclined to be more credulous than usual. It was Tabitha who had put all these crotchets into her head, and she now began to think seriously that Mr. Tom Pips had breathed his last, and that she might never be authorised to open the seal of the package. Her perplexities were really great, and Miss Spiker was not at all calculated to lessen them.</p> 
                  <p>"Drowned in the fish ponds?" repeated the old lady after a long pause. "That may be, I declare."</p> 
                  <p>"And then he wouldn't have time to write you not me!" said the sorrowing maid.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed he wouldn't poor man!" responded the old lady, feeling as if Pips had really been drowned, and become food for the fish he loved to kill so well.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, I fear we shall never hear of him more!" said Tabitha. "What a dreadful thing it is to die and have no funeral! His handsome form may now be at the bottom of some fish pond far away in the wilderness.</p> 
                  <p>"It may!" replied the widow, wiping a tear from her eye, and sighing.</p> 
                  <p>"The thought is terrible!" responded Tabitha. "How lively and cheerful he used to be! It seems to me I can now see him smile and hear his musical voice Don't you think Mrs. Watson he had a sweet smile and a pleasant voice?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do," answered the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"And then he was so kind and tender hearted!" said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"He was," answered the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"And such a manly form and beautiful face!" said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"He had!" responded the old lady, again bursting into tears.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha again cried, and little Jenny sobbed. Not a word was spoken. They seemed like chief mourners at a funeral, who had lost their dearest earthly friend. Jenny's tears ran as freely as theirs, which Tabitha saw.</p> 
                  <p>"No wonder the dear child sobs!" said Tabitha. "I have lost a fond lover and she a good father."</p> 
                  <p>"And I the best friend I had upon earth," said the old lady, dropping her hand upon the crown of Jenny's head as it lay in her lap.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed you have," said Tabitha. "O, he was a wonderful man. His place in the world will never be filled! And there's a void in my heart too, which no other man can fill. I believe a woman can love twice, but never the third time. It is too much to ask of woman's heart."</p> 
                  <p>"I never could love but once, said the old lady. "I loved my husband, the father of my own good Catherine, but I could never love another man as I loved him!"</p> 
                  <p>"You could, Mrs. Watson, if the right man came along," replied the maid. Once I thought and felt just as you do, but the sight of the handsome, the good Mr. Pips taught me a different lesson."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't wonder at your loving him," said the widow. "If I had been a young woman and he had not loved my daughter, perhaps I might have loved him. But dear me, I hope we may see him again in this world."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope so too, but circumstances hardly warrant<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6823-00000037"/> in entertaining such a hope," said Tabitha. "I believe he is dead, and heaven only knows where his dear body lies! That package must have been written and sealed by him. And it seems to me now that we consider Mr. Pips dead, it ought to be opened. Certainly there can be no harm in doing so, and there may be much good resulting from it. You may keep the package for years and never receive any written authority to open it."</p> 
                  <p>The old lady was very thoughtful and silent which made Tabitha hope the package would be now opened It was a very exciting moment with her. The blood coursed freely through her veins, and her heart beat violently. The idea of being remembered by the dying Mr. Pips, and perhaps of having money or other precious things, left her in his last will and testament, was very thrilling. At last she broke the silence which was becoming oppressive.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't you think I'm right?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I dare not, I must not, I will not unseal that package until I am authorised so to do," replied the old lady, in a very <choice>
                        <sic>empatic</sic>
                        <corr>emphatic</corr>
                     </choice> manner.</p> 
                  <p>A cold wave fell upon Miss Spiker and chilled her to the heart. Her expectations and hopes had been raised to the highest point and now they sank instantly below zero. She was either so full or so vacant that she could not speak.</p> 
                  <p>"You must never again urge me to break my most sacred promise," continued the widow. "My curiosity to fathom these mysteries may be as great as yours, but remember, you have made no such promise and are under no such obligation as I am. But urge me no more. If Mr. Pips is dead and the writer of the package, he may have authorised some person to give me liberty to open it."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha could make no answer to that, but she went away fully resolved to contrive some means to have the document opened. Now this maiden lady was not naturally a dishonest person, and under ordinary circumstances, and in the absence of extraordinary temptations she would not violate moral obligations. She repaired to her own house, took to her chamber and reasoned with herself in the following manner. "Mr. Pips loved me more than he did any other living woman. There can be no doubt of that. Mrs. Chubby or any one else may say what they please. I have reasons for believing that when he went away, second love was beginning to exercise its power upon his heart. Now, on that account, I am more interested in his affairs than any other woman. That he is the father of little Jenny, the expression of her eyes and almost every lineament of her beautiful face, almost certainly proves. Besides many other circumstances would seem to warrant such a belief. Now he has been absent more than twice as long as he contemplated, when he went away, and that clearly proves that something terrible must have happened to him. When he took his leave of me, he said, holding and pressing my hand, 'My dear Tabitha, be cheerful and happy during my absence, which will not exceed three weeks, or four weeks at the most.' Never can I forget those sweet words! True, he didn't kiss me, but I expected he would. Mr. Pips was always a very modest and discreet man. Now he has been gone more than six weeks, and I really believe he is dead." Here she wiped the tears from her eyes, and then proceeded with her soliloquy. "If he is dead he can never authorize Mrs Watson to open that package, and it may he for months, and even years with the seal unbroken, if the old lady should live so long! No doubt the package contains something in reference to me. And a thought strikes me! Perhaps he has given written orders for Mrs. Watson to place the child under my care and protection after a short time. She is old and may not live long enough to bring up little Jenny. This, Mr. Pips must have thought of, and so let her have the child awhile to please her, and the little girl is to be given up to me to be cared for and educated as she ought to be. This all seems perfectly natural. Now it is really important that I should know the last will and testament of the good Mr. Pips. I would not do anything wrong, and Mr. Pips would say so if he were living. I cannot see why it is wrong for me to know the contents of that sealed letter. Mrs. Watson is to open it when she receives a letter though the Post office authorising her to do so. Now under all the peculiar and pressing circumstances of the case, how can it be wrong to write Mrs. Watson a letter? Mr. Pips himself would say so if he could speak from the grave! But alas! his dear lips are sealed in death. I have a good mind to consult Mary Campbell upon the subject. "No, no, on reflection that will never do, for she has always been disposed to make fun of my connection with Mr. Pips, and now she's linked with that Irish coachman, she is ten times worse than she was before. No, I'll not consult her, that's certain. If I should, it might get to Mrs. Chubby's ears through her coachman. That's well thought of. Mary shall know nothing about it. I have been too familiar with her already. In the future I must observe more prudence and caution. If that girl gets anything more from me, she'll be more lucky than I think she will. There can be no harm in my writing the letter, but everybody knows I hav'nt any disposition to wrong a single person on the foot-stool. All the harm I wish to happen to any one is, that Mrs. Chuby may take that old libertine, Major Lenox, for a husband. If she don't rue it, then I'm no judge of men, that's all. But the letter I must write, and endeavor to be there at the time Mrs. Watson receives it. O, how Mrs. Chabby will feel when she finds I have the care of little Jenny! Now I'll write the letter and drop it into the Post office myself, and then no mortal will know it."</p> 
                  <p>Thus did a tolerably honest woman give way to her curiosity, and consent to perpetrate a very bad act. Like thousands of others in the world, she would have remained honest if temptation had not assailed her. Her curiosity was so great that it baffled every obstacle before it, and made her reason altogether upon false and deceptive principles. She was just in that state of mind that she could make herself believe almost anything, however absurd it might be. And she was so earnest that she exercised a good deal of power over Mrs. Watson; but she could not induce the old lady to break her promise, however great and tempting her curiosity might be. Tabitha's mind was made up. The letter must be written, and she must know the contents of the mysterious.

This quality of the mind is not necessarily connected with any moral turpitude unless it be indulged to an unwarrantable extent as it was in the case of Miss Spiker.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha collected her writing materials, and sat down at her little oval work-table that always stood in one particular place in her chamber. If it had at any time been removed one inch from the position she assigned, she would at once have noticed it, and placed its four legs upon the identical spots they had occupied so many years. Now she had never been much in the habit of writing, except to keep accounts of her income and daily expenses. These she always carefully noted down in a book kept for that purpose. Any other occurrence she desired to remember she wrote down in her almanac, which at the end of the year was quite full of facts and figures. How to word the letter taxed her mental powers quite severely. Her idea was to write just enough, and not a word more, but in what form to shape it was the great question. She finally commenced and wrote four or five lines, but they did not suit her, for she was very hyper-critical upon her own composition. She tore up the paper and wrote again. She went through this process three times, but the fourth letter she saved as being the best one she could produce. In fact it suited her pretty well, still she felt some slight twinges of conscience in regard to dropping it into the post office. A little more false reasoning, however, soon satisfied her conscientious scruples, and she sealed the letter and thrust it into her bosom. More than two hours were occupied in this work, before she had completed it to her satisfaction. Just before night fall she repaired to the post office and deposited the letter which was to be the key to unlock a very strange secret. Knowing Mrs. Watson would not receive it that night, she returned home. Mary Campbell noticed that something more than usual had happened to her mistress, but she concluded not to make any inquiries, in the hope that Tabitha would let it all out herself. Mary's hope was a false one this time, for Miss Spiker kept a close mouth. That circumstance more than any other excited the Scotch girl's curiosity, but she remained quiet and did not catechise her mistress. Mary began to think that she and Tabitha could not much longer remain together, but that consideration did not occasion her much regret, for she had concluded in her own mind to accept the offer of the Irish coachman, and become mistress herself. That night was a restless one for Miss Spiker. A thousand ideas ran through her head, both sleeping and waking. Being quite sure that the penny-postman would deliver Mrs. Watson the letter sometime in the forenoon of the next day, she made her calculations to be at the house of the old lady in season. It was an exciting occasion, and she could not avoid showing her feelings in her countenance, although she strove hard to conceal them from the sharp eyes of Mary Campbell.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE PACKAGE OPENED-PIPS ARRIVES WITH HIS FOREST-BRED LADY-LOVE-MISS TABITHA SPIKER SWOONS.</head> 
                  <p>Morning came, and Tabitha hurried to Mrs. Watson's, lest the penny-post might get there before her. Mrs. Watson and little Jenny had not finished their morning meal, still we will do justice to Miss Spiker, and say it was past the usual breakfast hour of the working classes. But the old lady was somewhat feeble and did not rise so early as she was wont in her earlier days.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Tabitha. "You have not done breakfast yet! My morning call is too early to be fashionable, I acknowledge, but among neighbors such as circumstances have recently made us, it may be excusable. I did not come to urge you to open that package, but to say to you I have been wrong in asking you to break your promise. On mature reflection I clearly see I was wrong and come to ask your pardon."</p> 
                  <p>"You have my pardon," replied the old lady, staring at Tabitha, and sipping a strong cup of tea. You have breakfasted I suppose."</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, sometime ago," answered Tabitha. "You have heard nothing since yesterday have you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing," replied the widow; "and I begin to fear I shall not very soon, but I must remain true to my promise."</p> 
                  <p>"Surely you must, for the present at least, until we can hear something from Mr. Pips," said Tabitha. "If the good man is actually dead as I fear he is, we may have some news ere long of the circumstances of his death. It is possible he has gone south, and does not intend to return here again for a long time."</p> 
                  <p>"I can't tell what to think," said the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"You know Mr. Pips was a very tender hearted and sensitive man," said Tabitha. "And it is possible that some of his enemies, or those who love to make mischief, might have found out that he had an illegitimate child, and fearing they would make the affair public, he thought he would leave the city and keep clear of slanderous tongues. Such a thing seems quite natural to me. Does it not to you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I declare it does seem so!" replied the old lady. "Mr. Pips was very tender of his reputation, and I shouldn't wonder if you were right after all, and Mr. Pips may not be dead."</p> 
                  <p>"If my conjectures are right, then you will soon have some authority to open the package," said the ingenuous maiden.</p> 
                  <p>"I hope so," replied Mrs. Watson, drinking her last cup of tea and rising from the table. "If he has only left the city for a time to keep clear of slanderers and busy bodies, we may see him again at some future time."</p> 
                  <p>"O, how delightful such an interview would be!" exclaimed Tabitha, helping the old lady clear away the breakfast table and appearing remarkably kind and attentive.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha remained, expecting every moment that the penny post man would arrive and bring the letter upon which she had expended so much mental labor, and exhausted so much moral principle. The old lady thought she never saw Miss Spiker so friendly before. It seemed to her a real change for the better had come over the maid. The forenoon was fast wearing away and the letter did not come. Tabitha's patience was well nigh exhausted, still she lingered, for it would not do for her to leave under existing circumstances. The hour of dinner was fast approaching, and she was fearful if she went home to dinner that the letter might come before she could come back again. It seemed to her that she ought to invent some excuse for tarrying so long, lest the old lady might be suspicious, but what to say was the question. She didn't wish to make matters worse at any rate. After much reflection she finally concluded that she must say something about her staying so long.</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Watson, you may think it strange that I remain with you so long to-day, but my feelings were so much excited yesterday, and you seemed to sympathize so much with me that I really feel unhappy when I am away from you," said Tabitha, playing with Jenny's bright curls, and casting an anxious and fond look upon the old widow.</p> 
                  <p>"O, I don't think strange of it at all," replied Mrs. Watson. "I know you must feel very strangely as well as I do. I should be glad to have you stay and dine with me."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know but my feelings will prompt me to accept your invitation," said the cunning maid. "If I do, I intend to make you a present. In fact, I shall make you one whether I tarry or not."</p> 
                  <p>"You're very kind," replied the old lady. "People have always been kind to me in my poverty."</p> 
                  <p>"Especially the good Mr. Pips," answered Tabitha. "O, what a good man he is."</p> 
                  <p>A knocking was now heard at the door, and Tabitha's heart almost leaped into her mouth. The door was opened, and the penny post said, "a letter for Mrs. Watson." Tabitha's time had come, and she could hardly keep her balance. The widow seized the letter with trembling hands and a beating heart.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Tabitha, examining the superscription while the old lady held it in her hand, almost dreading to open it. "The letter contains something about the package perhaps, do open it Mrs. Watson, and see. The handwriting looks like Mr. Pips'."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me get the package and compare the handwriting," said the widow, going to her bureau and taking out the document instead of reading the letter She had thought so much of the subject and worked it into so many forms that she actually dreaded to have the great secret of the affair divulged too suddenly. Her anxiety was extremely violent. Placing her spectacles carefully over her eyes, and holding both letters at a proper distance to get the right focus so that she might see very distinctly, she closely examined the handwriting of each. Now she was not a good judge of such matters and very far from being an expert.</p> 
                  <p>"I declare it seems to me the strokes of the pen look alike!" said the old lady. "What do you think?"</p> 
                  <p>"I really think they are!" replied Tabitha. "See, that T. on the letter is crossed just like the one on the package!"</p> 
                  <p>"I believe it is!" answered the widow. "I will now put back the package into its place and then we will open the letter."</p> 
                  <p>She carefully deposited the package in her drawer and locked it up, for she meant to proceed very methodically in the matter and do nothing wrong or hastily. A person must be placed in her peculiar situation before her singular conduct can be duly appreciated. She was old, nervous, and had reflected so much upon the package that she felt that now in this crisis she must proceed very formally. A wonderful discovery was about to be made. She was anxious to know all, and she feared the developement. Again she examined the outside of the letter, felt of it between her thumb and finger as if she could partially read its contents by such a process. Like a person going out of a dark place into one brilliantly illuminated, she, as it were, put her hand before her eyes to prevent the light from being too powerful on her vision. At length she summoned courage to break the seal of the letter and opened it with trembling hands. The following were the contents:</p> 
                  <p>DEAR MADAM:-I have placed great confidence in you,<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6823-00000038"/> my child is dear to me, but I know you will take good care of it. You may now open the package which was left with you at the same time the child was placed under your care. It will tell you all you need to know at present. Follow its directions and you shall be rewarded. My name I withhold at present.</p> 
                  <p>After reading the letter she dropped it upon the floor, and sank into a chair.</p> 
                  <p>"It does authorize me to open the package!" said the old lady, in a voice of trembling. "O how strangely it makes me feel."</p> 
                  <p>"So it does me!" replied Tabitha, picking up the letter. "May I read it?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, read it out loud and let me see if I properly understood it!" replied the widow.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha now read it in a sharp, but trembling voice, for a few twinges of her conscience somewhat stung her soul.</p> 
                  <p>"O, it reads just like the writing of Mr. Pips!" exclaimed Tabitha, giving the letter to the old lady. "Now you will know all! I'm fortunate in being here. It seems as if good Providence induced me to stay. How much of mystery there is in the world! I'm glad that proud, haughty Mrs. Barlow is not here! Now, Mrs. Watson get the package and open it and we shall know all."</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Watson rose to go to her bureau, but at that moment a carriage drove up and stopped at the door.</p> 
                  <p>"O, heavens! I fear that ugly woman has come!" said the excited maiden, running to the window and looking out. "No, no, they are not her horses, heaven be praised!"</p> 
                  <p>"Who can they be?" asked the widow, looking eagerly.</p> 
                  <p>"O, Lord, I shall faint!" exclaimed Tabitha. "See, Mr. Pips has just come out of the carriage, if my eyes don't deceive me. Heavens! now he waits upon a strange looking girl! What can all that mean? What a singular hat!"</p> 
                  <p>"I see her face," replied the old lady. "O, how young and beautiful she looks!"</p> 
                  <p>"Don't say that!" exclaimed Tabitha, in a voice choked by violent emotions.</p> 
                  <p>Miss Tabitha Spiker actually swooned, and her slender form fell upon the floor, while the agitated old lady ran to the door with little Jenny hanging upon her skirts, and following after her. There she met Mr. Pips, the lovely girl of the forest and her mother. The good Mr. Pips embraced the old lady and kissed her, and then introduced his companions to her. We will not undertake to describe the feelings and emotions of Mrs. Watson on that occasion. She entirely forgot poor Tabitha while she stood gazing upon Mr. Pips, the beautiful Sarah and her mother.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, my dear woman, whose beautiful little girl is this?" he asked, putting Jenny on her head and gazing in her, beautiful face.</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Watson was so overcome by her own feelings, that she could not answer his question. And if she had not thus been overcome, she couldn't have told him to whom the child belonged.</p> 
                  <p>"She's a sweet little girl," said Sarah, kissing her. "Mother, ain't she a beauty?"</p> 
                  <p>"She is indeed," replied the mother.</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Watson was thunderstruck, and all her dreams about Pips being the father of Jenny vanished into the air. As yet she couldn't recover her self-control sufficiently to speak, but she leaned against the door, and would have fallen but for that support.</p> 
                  <p>"I fear you're not well," said Mr. Pips approaching Mrs. Watson and taking her hand.</p> 
                  <p>"I shall be better soon," she replied, in a faint voice "I was so glad to see you."</p> 
                  <p>"I know I have been gone much longer than I anticipated," he said, chucking Sarah under the chin and smiling. "But here's a pretty good reason for it."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha had so far recovered from her swoon, that she had partly risen up, and heard the well-known voice of Pips. It sank so deeply into her heart, that she had a relapse. Now, the reader may laugh at Tabitha's swooning if he or she please; but, we can positively assert that there is such a thing in this world as a woman's swooning. A vast number of ladies have swooned before Mrs. Spiker's day, and many more will have these spasms on certain occasions. If any maiden ever had cause for swooning, Miss Spiker had on that occasion. Mr. Pips was not aware of Tabitha's presence, for Mrs. Watson had entirely forgotten her. Having got through the ceremonies of meeting, they entered the house, and there poor Tabitha lay prostrate upon the floor almost in a state of insensibility, for her second swooning like her second love, was more violent than the first.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Watson, as she led the way into the house. "I have forgotten Tabitha!"</p> 
                  <p>"Good gracious!" said Pips. "What! Tabitha Spiker, and upon the floor! What does all this mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"She has swooned, I fear, since I went out to meet you!" replied the old lady.</p> 
                  <p>"We must raise her up and minister to her wants," he said, stooping down and raising up her slender form as he would his fishing-rod.</p> 
                  <p>Miss Spiker began to recover, but whether it was owing to the galvanic power of the touch of Mr. Pips, or to other causes, we are unable to say. She opened her eyes upon him a moment, then <unclear>suddenly</unclear> closed them again as if she feared the sight of his manly countenance was too much for her to bear.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak, Miss Spiker," he continued, letting her head rest upon his shoulder, a pillow it never had had before. "Are you ill? Don't you feel better now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Some water?" said the mother of Sarah, placing her hand upon Tabitha's forehead. "She may faint again!"</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Watson handed her some water, and she sprinkled it upon Tabitha's face in quantities larger than some other ladies might have done. Miss Spiker's false curls were much injured by the process, but she revived under the operation and fixed her eyes upon the lovely Sarah, whose neat birch bark hat was still upon her head, and her fine, dark curly hair hung in rich clusters over her finely modelled neck and shoulders. O, what pen can describe the feelings of Miss Tabitha Spiker's heart at that moment when her eyes fell on the surpassing beautiful face of Sarah Searsmont.</p> 
                  <p>"Who is she?" asked Tabitha, in a wild manner and voice, first gazing intently on Sarah, and then on her mother.</p> 
                  <p>"She's my daughter," replied the mother, suppressing a smile.</p> 
                  <p>"Your daughter!" repeated Tabitha, standing back from Mr. Pips, and erecting her form like a maypole on some village green. "Your daughter!"</p> 
                  <p>And she sank into a chair in great agitation.</p> 
                  <p>"Pass me the cup, Sarah," said her mother. "I fear she will faint again."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha had been so thoroughly sprinkled a few minutes before that she was seized with a kind of hydrophobia and instantly rose up</p> 
                  <p>"No more water!" she exclaimed, feeling her wet curls dangle down her cheeks, and running to a small mirror that hung up over the bureau, she exclaimed, "dear me! how my hair looks!"</p> 
                  <p>"Never mind that!" said Mr. Pips. "The water did you good."</p> 
                  <p>She gazed upon him and then upon Sarah, but made no reply. Sarah now took off her hat and placed it upon the table, showing her beautiful head and flowing hair. Again Miss Spiker fixed her eyes upon the lovely girl, and a sickness came over her soul; but she strove to control her feelings as well as she could. Mrs. Watson now asked Sarah's mother to take off her bonnet and be seated.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, you and your daughter must make this your home for the present," said Pips</p> 
                  <p>"Home and worse," thought Tabitha, now fastening her eyes on little Jenny, who hung round Sarah as if she had found a very good friend. The spell was somewhat broken, for Tabitha could not trace so many striking resemblances to Mr. Pips, in the little girl's face as she was wont to see previous to his arrival, under such peculiar, and to Tabitha, embarrassing circumstances.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you enjoyed good health during my absence?" asked Pips, addressing Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr Pips," said Tabitha, disregarding his inquiry after her health, and pointing her long, trembling, finger at little Jenny. "Is that your child? For heaven's sake, speak and tell me!"</p> 
                  <p>"My child!" he repeated, in much astonishment. "My child! Why do you ask such a question!"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I hardly know, but I thought she might be your child," replied Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, I must confess that is very strange!" he answered. "I never saw nor heard of the little girl before, but she is a little beauty as Sarah says. Mrs. Watson, where in the world did she come from?"</p> 
                  <p>"A woman brought her here and wished me to take care of her," answered Mrs. Watson. "She also left a hundred dollars and a package, which I have never opened because I never was authorised to open it until just as you came."</p> 
                  <p>"It is very singular and strange!" he said. "The little girl looks as if she sprang from no mean parentage."</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed she did not," said Sarah, sitting down and holding Jenny in her lap.</p> 
                  <p>"Here's the letter I have just received, authorising me to open the package," said Mrs. Watson.</p> 
                  <p>Pips read it carefully over, while Tabitha stood and trembled, lest he might possibly discern that the letter was in her hand writing.</p> 
                  <p>"A clear case," he said. "You have now the right to unlock the mystery!"</p> 
                  <p>"I will take it from my drawer, and let you open it," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I'll do it if you wish," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>The old lady took a bunch of keys from her pocket, unlocked the drawer and handed the package to Mr. Pips. Tabitha stood all eyes and ears. A thousand thoughts ran through her mind, and a thousand emotions swelled her heart, but anxiety to learn the contents of the package, seemed to predominate at that moment. Mr. Pips broke the seal and found a handsomely folded letter within the envelope, superscribed "Miss Angelina Proudit."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, a wheel within a wheel," he said. "A letter to Miss Angelina Proudit! But let me read what's written upon the envelope."</p> 
                  <p>He read as follows:-</p> 
                  <p>"Will the person with whom this package and the little girl are left, see that Miss Proudit has the enclosed letter. Let it be conveyed to her by safe and trusty hands. But before that is done, the person having the care of the girl will put his or her name and place of residence upon the outside of the letter so that. Miss Proudit may know where little Jenny is. It is very desirable that little Jenny should not be placed in other hands, but remain with the person who is authorised to open this package. A father may sometimes be poor, when the mother is rich. Miss Proudit would rejoice to see little Jenny although she has not seen her since she was an infant. Convey the letter to Miss Proudit and not let her proud mother know it. Let the business be done carefully and according to these directions. The child's father had become poor, but he hopes he is now in better circumstances. Whoever has now the care of Jenny, will be generously rewarded. The mother is rich and may one day take her child. It is not necessary for me to sign my name to these instructions, for I have the sole authority to give them. And more, permit me to say, obey what is here written, and the reward will come in due season."</p> 
                  <p>"There, the mystery is almost as great as it was before," said Mr. Pips. "One thing, however, is made certain. Miss Proudit is the mother of this beautiful little girl, but who can her father be? I remember of hearing two or three years ago, that an accident had happened in high life. It was rumored among some, that Mrs Proudit's daughter was sent into the country under circumstances to alarm the pride of her haughty mother."</p> 
                  <p>"Now since you have named it, I too remember something of the kind," said Mrs. Watson. "Well, I declare, who would have thought that I should have the care of a child belonging to such a high family!"</p> 
                  <p>"Strange things happen in this world," he said.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha had found out what she had been asking to know so long, but the half only had been told. The mother of Jenny was known, hat still who the father was they could not even imagine. The maid now found time to hate and envy the young lady Pips brought with him from the forest. She was now as anxious to find out who she was and where she came from, as she was to ascertain the contents of the package. It seemed to her that she could never be free from trouble and anxiety. She began to feel that misfortunes seldom came alone. Could Mr. Pips be in love with this girl, was a terrible question in her mind. She gazed upon Sarah, saw her surpassing beauty and loveliness, and hate and envy took possession of her soul. She tarried but a few minutes after the package was opened. Before she took her leave, however, she asked Pips to call and see her. He told her he would. There was some consolation in that, still the poor maiden was deep in trouble.</p> 
                  <p>"That's a very singular person," said Sarah's mother, after Tabitha went out.</p> 
                  <p>"She is truly," replied Pips, smiling. "She don't wish to die an old maid, I suppose."</p> 
                  <p>"She wishes to change her name from Spiker to Pips," said the widow Watson, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Mrs. Watson, don't talk so," said Pips. "If she does she will have to wait until I am some forty years older than I am now. But let that pass, Miss Spiker is naturally good hearted enough, but she's rather singular in some respects. Now about this letter to Angelina Proudit."</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes, that must be done ere long," replied the old lady. "And I shall get you to do the business."</p> 
                  <p>"I will undertake the task," he replied." I have no acquaintance with the family but I think I can get the letter to the daughter without the proud mother knowing of it. At all events I will endeavor to do my best."</p> 
                  <p>"And then it will be well done," said the old lady. "But you must try and find out who the father is."</p> 
                  <p>"That I will do," he replied. "The secret is but half disclosed yet."</p> 
                  <p>Sarah and little Jenny had already formed quite an intimacy. The little girl seemed to fancy Sarah very much, and to keep close to her. Sarah too, admired the little beauty as she called her. Jenny became quite lively and full of fun, laughing, talking and playing with Sarah in great glee. Having never before had the company of children, Sarah was highly delighted with Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"O, if I could have had this little beauty in the woods!" exclaimed Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"You would never have been willing to come away I fear," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Not unless you happened to come along," she replied, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"A kiss for that compliment," he said, kissing Sarah and then Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Which flower's the sweetest?" asked Mrs. Watson.</p> 
                  <p>"The one that grew and matured in the wild wood," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, I see how it is now," said the old lady. "I always said you would never love any one unless she was young and handsome as my daughter was. I told Tabitha so, and she was mad as a hornet."</p> 
                  <p>They had quite a <unclear>lang round</unclear> in which little Jenny joined. The day was passed under that humble roof must delightfully. Pips was thoroughly rejuvenated, and began to live his life over again, and add to new joys the remembrance of the old ones.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE CONDITION UPON WHICH THE DAUGHTER WOULD WED-THE RIDE AND THE STRANGE MEETING.</head> 
                  <p>"We must fix the day of your marriage," said Mrs. Proudit to her daughter Angelina. "Mr. Montville loves you as he does his own life. And you may thank me for it, for all the work has been on my shoulders."</p> 
                  <p>"I would thank you mother, it I loved or could love him," replied Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"If you could love him!" repeated the heartless mother. "How silly you talk, my child. What matters it whether you ardently love Edwin or not, so long as you have plantations, horses, carriages, and negroes? Talk about love! Let those talk about love and live upon it who have nothing else to please them. The world is before you, and a pretty good slice of it you will have when you become the wife of Edwin Montville. It is no small affair to be thus connected with the Montville family. Edwin's father is spoken of now as a candidate for President of the States. Think of that, Angelina! Suppose he should be elected President, don't you know what a high position<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6823-00000039"/> tion you would occupy? Edwin told me day before yesterday that he really thought his father would be nominated. O, how every unmarried lady in this city or country would jump at such a chance!"</p> 
                  <p>Angelina made no reply, but appeared serious and thoughtful. Her mother fondly believed that she had touched the right chord, and that her daughter's ambition was predominant over all other feelings, but she was sadly mistaken. Angelina was not thinking of the high place of which her mother was dreaming, but of passages in her past life, of her little daughter, if perchance it might be living, of her peculiar situation, and of the moral turpitude of marrying a man and keeping him in ignorance of her having become a mother of a living child. In spite of the evil influence of a proud, haughty and heartless mother, Angelina still had a conscience whose faithful admonitions she listened to and heeded. Misfortune and disappointment did not destroy the moral sense of this young lady. The school of adversity made her better, and notwithstanding the dazzling splendors of a court life which her mother held up so temptingly before her, still she desired to do right and live in comparative obscurity, rather than do wrong and live in fashionable splendor. Besides all these considerations which had great influence over her, she disliked the young man whom her mother had selected for her companion through life. He was just such a person as she could not fancy. True, he was a dandy of the first water, and his father had wealth enough to keep him on such a track, yet Angelina felt as if she desired a husband of some soul, some intellect, some qualities of heart and mind which would make him an interesting companion; one with whom she could hold social intercourse and feel at home with. She had very different views of human life from those entertained by her mother. What notions of life she might have entertained under her mother's training, if she had not once fallen from that virtue which is so highly prized by the good of both sexes, we cannot say. She and her mother sat some time in silence.</p> 
                  <p>"Now you begin to see, I trust, the bright prospect that is before you," said her mother.</p> 
                  <p>Angelina gazed upon mother with a tear glistening in her eye, but answered not.</p> 
                  <p>"I can't bear to see you look so sorrowful!" continued her mother. "Come, Angelina, wake up and be a woman of the world. You have lived in obscurity long enough. The time has now come when you can make a figure in the world."</p> 
                  <p>"My child!" was the only answer she gave her proud mother.</p> 
                  <p>"Your child!" repeated the mother. "Heaven only knows where it is! It may be dead, and it is a mercy if it is dead. Illegitimates have but a sorry chance in this world. The iniquities of their parents are often visited upon them and they lead miserable lives. Think no more of your child, Angelina, and rise above all such desponding thoughts. Be a woman now and please your mother, whose pride has suffered so much on your account."</p> 
                  <p>"I would be a woman, Heaven knows!" sobbed Angelina. "And can a true hearted woman forget her child! It is such a woman I would be; and, mother, before Heaven and you, I declare I am such a woman!"</p> 
                  <p>"In your old strain again!" said the mother, manifesting much impatience. "It seems to me you will never rid yourself of such silly notions!"</p> 
                  <p>"Silly notions!" repeated Angelina, in a voice of sorrow and despondency. "They are such notions as Heaven has planted in my soul, and all earthly training cannot eradicate them. I would obey you, please you. The child is bound to obey its parents"-</p> 
                  <p>"I know it, and then why don't you do it?" asked the mother quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"You did not wait to hear me finish the sentence," replied Angelina. "I was about to say there are higher obligations than a parent's authority, feelings of the soul over which parents have no control! Yes, mother, you cannot make me forget my child! There's but one power can make me forget that I am a mother, and that is the grave! What lies beyond that has not been revealed to me. But I believe in that state the memory will not be blotted out!"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I must confess, you take some very bold flights," said her mother. "Harbor such foolish thoughts, and you will remain a poor, sorrowing, good for-nothing old maid until you die, and the world will hardly know that you ever lived. Come, come, Angelina, you must wake up and shake off such dreamy notions. You are young, handsome and accomplished, and have the power of shining in and making an impression on the world!"</p> 
                  <p>"You are mistaken, mother about making a very deep impression on the world by such a course of life as you contemplate," replied Angelina. "The gay, the fashionable, the rich and the proud are soon forgotten when the grave covers their earthly remains. It is only those who do good and virtuous deeds who are remembered-those who benefit their race, and not those who flutter about like butterflies with <unclear>gaudily</unclear> painted wings, with all their frailties but withers their innocence."</p> 
                  <p>"It is a pity you had not been a man and then you could have occupied some pulpit," answered the mother.</p> 
                  <p>If I had, I might have been better and <unclear>more</unclear> useful than I am now," replied the daughter. <unclear>Mrs.</unclear> Proudit began to feel her proud spirit rise, walking about the room in her flowing silks and feeling her <unclear>maternal</unclear> authority. Angelina watched her motions and expected a storm. The good girl trembled and covered her face with her handkerchief, stopping the tears as they sprung from her eyes and hearing her own heart beat. She was fearful she might have said too much in opposition to her mother, and yet her conscience did not reprove her. Mrs. Proudit continued to parade about the room, now looking out of the windows and then casting over glances at her daughter. At last she stopped before Angelina and placed her feet firmly upon the carpet as if she was determined to be mistress of her own household.</p> 
                  <p>"Angelina, listen!" she said, "I have had a great deal of trouble in this world, but my spirit is not broken. You know I have lost two husbands whom I loved. My first husband I lived with only about six months, my second husband, your father, died a few years since. My parents died before you were born, leaving me with one sister who followed a heartless man far away, against my remonstrances and to her own disgrace. His name I never knew, for she would never repeat it to me. That she kept a secret, but she said she loved him and that he solemnly promised to marry her. I have never heard from her since. No doubt she died in poverty and disgrace. All these troubles have fallen upon me, and now my own daughter refuses to yield me obedience. If ever a daughter was bound to obey her mother, you are that daughter, Angelina. Have I not had much trouble on your account? Have you not brought disgrace upon my house? and have I not borne it all with a mother's kindness and resolution? Would you now add to all these troubles? Is it not your duty to atone for some of these misfortunes? You have the power, and will you, can you, refuse to exercise it?</p> 
                  <p>"Hold mother!" exclaimed Angelina. "Say no more now!"</p> 
                  <p>"Then you repent, do you? asked the resolute mother.</p> 
                  <p>"I have repented long ago and sought the pardon of heaven for my offences!" replied Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you consent to wed Edwin Montville who doats upon you?" demanded the mother."</p> 
                  <p>Angelina was silent, and her sighs and tears told how deeply she felt. The mother gazed upon her and was determined to have an answer to her question. The heart of the daughter was subjected to a severe struggle. No human eye saw that struggle, but angels might have witnessed it for aught we can know or tell. If they did, they approved it, for the maiden strove to know her whole duty and resolved to do it.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, Angelina," continued the mother in a somewhat softened tone of voice, "you have heard me recount my troubles in life thus far, and how I have been compelled to struggle in order to rise above them. The question I have asked you is a simple one, but its answer involves much of your happiness and mine. Although I have buried my parents, followed to the grave two husbands, seen an only and beloved sister run away with a libertine and disgrace herself and supported and sustained you in the hour of shame and affliction, yet I still live and hope to see you rise in the world and become worthy of such a mother as I have been to you. What say you? Edwin will be here before long to ride out with us.</p> 
                  <p>"I am willing to make any sacrifice to please you, but the sacrifice of moral principles," replied Angelina. "I will wed Edwin Montville-"</p> 
                  <p>"A noble resolution!" interrupted the mother, embracing Angelina and feeling much gratified.</p> 
                  <p>"But, dear mother, hear me through!" said Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"What?" exclaimed the agitated mother. "Did you not say you would wed Edwin?"</p> 
                  <p>"I did, but you did not hear the condition upon which that promise was made. Had you not interrupted me I should have said, I will wed Edwin Montville on condition that he first knows that I have given birth to a child!"</p> 
                  <p>"Good heavens!" was the exclamation of Mrs. Proudit. "Let him know that and disgrace ourselves in his eyes!"</p> 
                  <p>"Better disgrace ourselves in his eyes than do wrong in the eyes of heaven!" replied Angelina, feeling an unseen power helping and supporting her in that trying emergency.</p> 
                  <p>"You talk strangely!" said her mother.</p> 
                  <p>"I am willing to sacrifice my own happiness by marrying a man I cannot love, to please you, but I dare not offend my heavenly parent for the sake of obeying an earthly one," answered the daughter. "To wed Montville, and keep him in ignorance of my past life, would be a direct violation of my honor and my duty. Could I expect, or have any reason to hope for the favor of heaven if I should be guilty of such an act? There is a Providence that watches over us. No mountains are high enough, nor oceans deep enough to hide our crimes from the All Seeing Eye!"</p> 
                  <p>"The old strain again!" said the mother, manifesting great impatience. "You magnify things too much. Mole hills become mountains in your eyes. No, no, Angelina. Edwin loves you, and that is enough. He will make a very kind husband."</p> 
                  <p>"He may do so if it please him, after he shall have read that secret page of my history," replied Angelina, assuming a more calm but not less determined tone and manner.</p> 
                  <p>She had passed through a severe struggle, and now saw her duty as clearly as if it had been written with a sunbeam upon the pure skies. Her resolution was fixed beyond any earthly power to shake it, but her mother still indulged a faint hope that Angelina would yet yield farther to her authority. She was glad to hear her daughter say she would marry Montville on any condition, because she flattered herself that the little matter of moral principle, or what she considered a small matter, would be given up and not insisted upon by Angelina. But Mrs. Proudit had not seen the struggle in her daughter's heart. And having felt nothing like it in her own proud, ambitious heart, she was but ill qualified to judge of its true character and the extent of its moral power.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, daughter, let that pass now," said her mother after a short pause, "it is time for you to prepare for the ride. Edwin will soon arrive and you know we have promised to ride with him to-day."</p> 
                  <p>Angelina retired to her chamber to prepare for the ride. What her feelings were on that occasion the reader can judge. She did not dress herself with that enthusiasm and with that anticipation of pleasure which usually falls to the lot of young ladies on such occasions. An hour passed and the dandy arrived in much pomposity. He was dressed in the very pink of the mode, and entered the parlor with measured steps, carrying in one hand a very small whip-stick for a cane and dangling with the other an eyeglass. Mrs. Proudit welcomed him very politely, and Angelina shrunk back as he gently touched her hand which he intended for a shake.</p> 
                  <p>"I believe I'm in season," he said, pulling out his watch and looking at it.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, yes!" replied the anxious and polite mother. "You're indeed very punctual."</p> 
                  <p>"I always endeavor to be punctual," he replied. "I think a great deal of punctuality."</p> 
                  <p>"So do I," she replied. "You've been well, I trust, since we saw you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Extremely well, considering the climate," he answered. "The climate here is not a Southern one. I think a Southern climate would suit Angelina's constitution. Don't you think it would, Angelina, my dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"This climate goes with me very well," replied Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"O, but the air isn't so balmy as it is in the South," he said. "And then the winters here are terrible! I don't think I could stand your winters. I think the cold must injure your constitution, Angelina, my dear."</p> 
                  <p>"It never has, I believe," she replied, feeling perfectly disgusted with him, more if possible than she ever was before.</p> 
                  <p>"Angelina has always been blessed with excellent health," said Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"Good health is an excellent thing," he replied. "A lady can't be beautiful without it. I was quite sure Angelina must enjoy good health, for she looks like it."</p> 
                  <p>Her mother looked at her sharply as if she wished her to acknowledge the compliment, but Angelina heeded not the anxious look of her mother, and was silent.</p> 
                  <p>"You were speaking at our last interview of your father's being nominated as candidate for President," said Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"O, yes," he replied, casting a fond look upon Angelina. "I think he will be nominated. If he is, he will be chosen President by the people."</p> 
                  <p>"I hope he will be, for I believe he is a good man for his country," said the mother.</p> 
                  <p>"Father is a very eloquent speaker," he said, "I have heard him when the people applauded him most enthusiastically."</p> 
                  <p>"I should admire to hear him," said Mrs. Proudit."</p> 
                  <p>"When he is elected we should remove to Washington," he said. "I have been there two winters. It is a very fashionable society there. Angelina would admire to live in such society, would'nt you, Angelina my dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is quite impossible for me to say," she replied, turning her eyes from him.</p> 
                  <p>"O, she could'nt help admiring it," said her mother.</p> 
                  <p>The carriage was now driven up and they took their seats. Angelina and her mother occupied the back seat and the dandy sat directly opposite and facing Angelina. It was a position very unpleasant to her, but any seat in a carriage or room would be where Edwin Montville was. They were driven to the upper part of the city quite beyond the houses as the city then was. Montville was excessively polite and exceedingly loquacious, and so was Mrs. Proudit, but Angelina was more sedate than usual. The dandy uttered so many silly things that Angelina began to think that to marry him was a greater sacrifice than any daughter ought to make to please her mother. But she had promised to become his wife upon one condition, and that promise she was resolved to keep, however great the sacrifice might be on her part; for she felt under very peculiar obligations to her mother, more so than daughters under ordinary circumstances might reasonably feel.</p> 
                  <p>On their return home, after having <choice>
                        <sic>riden</sic>
                        <corr>ridden</corr>
                     </choice> several miles, the attention of Angelina was arrested by the sight of Sarah Searsmont and little Jenny who were walking along very leisurely and gazing upon the various objects that met their view. Jenny had hold of Sarah's hand, but she would frequently break away, run on ahead then wait for her companion to come up. Sarah wore the same beautiful birch-bark hat that she wore in the forest, but she had a new light blue dress which fitted her symmetrical form and made her the "observed of all observers." Her dark hair hung in glossy curls over her neck and shoulders. She had made Jenny too, a hat of the same material from which her own was manufactured. These hats attracted a good deal of attention.</p> 
                  <p>"See that lady and little girl, mother," said Angelina, pointing to Sarah and Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"What singular hats, but they are pretty," said Mrs. Proudit, ordering the coachman to rein in the horses that they might have a longer view.</p> 
                  <p>"And those that wear them are pretty too, said Angelina. "What splendid forms and elegant hair! I wonder who they can be?"</p> 
                  <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6823-00000040"/> 
                  <p>"Upon my word and honor I should think they were Indians by their hats," said Edwin gazing at them through his eye-glass. "They have splendid hair!"</p> 
                  <p>"But their complexions and fans dont resemble the Indians at all," replied Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"No they don't," responded the dandy, still holding the glass to his eye.</p> 
                  <p>"What a sweet pretty creature the little girl is!" said Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>She had not the most distant idea that she beheld and was thus praising her own daughter, but the apparent age of Jenny made her think of her child. The thought struck her that her own child, if it were living, would be about the age of Jenny. A shade of sorrow passed over her countenance for a moment, and she was silent.</p> 
                  <p>The horses walked along as fast as Sarah and Jenny did, so that those in the carriage saw them some time. Once Jenny broke the hold of Sarah and run towards the horses, making a motion at them with her hands and laughing. Sarah soon brought her back upon the sidewalk.</p> 
                  <p>"She's a little witch of a thing," said Mrs Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"She is, that's a fact by George," replied Montville, smiling and feeling his scattered moustaches. Then turning to Angelina, he continued, "Why are you so sober, Angelina my dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'm not particularly sober, am I?" she asked, rousing up from her revery and endeavoring to shake off her feelings which the thought of her child had occasioned.</p> 
                  <p>"I think you were very serious," he replied. "See, the little witch as your mother calls her very appropriately, now runs ahead. She's in very high glee."</p> 
                  <p>"That's a very smart child," said Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"I will speak to them," said Montville, raising his voice. "Come here little girl and tell me your name."</p> 
                  <p>"Sarah and the little girl halted and looked at the speaker. The carriage was quite near them. Montville again asked for the little girl's name.</p> 
                  <p>"Can't you tell the gentleman your name?" said Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"Little Jenny, who'd you think it was?" answered the little girl, striking at the nose of one of the horses and laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Where did you get your hat?" asked Montville.</p> 
                  <p>"She made it for me," answered Jenny, taking hold of Sarah's hand and shaking it.</p> 
                  <p>"It's a very pretty hat," said Mrs. Proudit.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, you little witch, take that," said Montville, throwing a half dollar on the sidewalk.</p> 
                  <p>Jenny ran and picked up the money, apparently much pleased</p> 
                  <p>"Can't you thank the gentleman," said Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Jenny, jumping up three or four times and stamping her little feet upon the sidewalk. She then pulled Sarah's skirts and tried to hurry her along, for she was anxious to get home and show her money to Mrs. Watson.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you live here, my dear?" asked Montville, addressing Sarah, and gazing into her lovely face through his quizzing glass.</p> 
                  <p>"I do now, sir," replied Sarah, smiling most sweetly, and passing along at the earnest solicitation of her young companion.</p> 
                  <p>"That girl has a most splendid face and form," said Montville. "If she had not hurried off I would have asked her name and where she came from."</p> 
                  <p>"I wish you had," replied Mrs. Proudit. "I should like to learn her history. I presume they are sisters."</p> 
                  <p>"Very probable," he replied. "Don't you think so, Angelina, my dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"Their hats are alike and they are very beautiful," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>They now reached home and Angelina rejoiced in the prospect of sitting elsewhere than facing that dandy. She never was so sick of him before. He remained with them that afternoon and the evening until a late hour. Soon as he departed Angelina retired to her chamber and sought that rest she so much needed. She was restless during the night and dreamed of her child. O, who can describe the feelings of that young mother? She awoke from her dream and the sears ran down her cheeks because it was all a dream! Her mother fully resolved upon the match, and Angelina was equally resolved that it should never take place except upon that one condition.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE MEETING OF BACHELOR AND MAID-THE DANGER OF ONE IDEA-A SPECIES OF INSANITY.</head> 
                  <p>Miss Tabitha Spiker was in great trouble and anxiety. Ever since the arrival of Mr. Pips, she had been most anxious to have an interview with him Three days had passed since his return, and he had not called to see her. She had told Mary Campbell of his return, and the opening of the sealed package, all of which the Scotch girl heard without feeling that deep interest which agitated the heart of poor Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"It is very strange that Mr. Pips don't call," thought Tabitha, as she sat in her snug, neat parlor among her flower pots one afternoon, the third day after Mr. Pips' arrival. I wonder who that young girl he brought with him can be? Is it possible he loves her? No, I will not believe it until I hear it from his own lips. What a singular but she wore! But I must confess she's very beautiful. The thing is'nt old enough to be married, and yet I suppose she thinks she is! These young girls feel mighty smart! I can tell Mr. Pips he will act a very foolish part if he marries a girl so much younger than he is himself"</p> 
                  <p>Mary Campbell now entered to make enquiry about some domestic affairs. She noticed that her mistress was in a very serious, thoughtful mood. The household affairs being disposed of, Many was about to retire, but Tabitha felt like conversing with some one about those matters which laid so near her heart.</p> 
                  <p>"Mary, what do you think is the reason Mr. Pips has not called upon me?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I canna tell ye," replied Mary, half smiling. "These auld bachelors are fond o' chickens. The young o' anything is muckle muir beautiful than the auld. Didna ye kin that afore?"</p> 
                  <p>"Old bachelors are sometimes fools!" replied Tabitha, striking the fan she held in hand upon her lap several times in quick succession, and looking quite angry.</p> 
                  <p>"Then the laddies must na gang after them," said Mary. "I wadna rin after sie a mon at all."</p> 
                  <p>"But you would run after an Irish coachman," said Tabitha, still keeping her fan going.</p> 
                  <p>"Na, na, he <unclear>ganged</unclear> after me," replied Mary, smiling. "I should na rin after him, or any ither man wha ever breathed in this world."</p> 
                  <p>"You can talk, Mary, but if that Irish Jemmy should leave you it would break your heart," said Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"Weel now, that's a gude one for ye to say," answered Mary, laughing quite loud. "Let the coachman try it and see how many strings in my heart wad break. Na, na, Mistress Spiker, na mon canna break my heart."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm glad you feel so secure," said Tabitha. "See, as I live, Mr. Pips is coming! You must leave us alone."</p> 
                  <p>"To be sure I wad na stay for the world," said Mary, smiling and leaving the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Tabitha was all in a flutter, running to the Mirror, to see if every curl was in its proper place, and then setting a large rocking chair for Mr. Pips in a particular spot. It was the same old armed chair he had always occupied whenever he came to visit the maid. He entered, and she received him very cordially. As he sat in the chair aforesaid, she couldn't keep her eyes from his fair round person. She thought he had really gained a few pounds of flesh during his absence.</p> 
                  <p>True, his skin was rather browned up by exposure to the sun and a few blotches still remained about his neck, where the flies had been at work, but on the whole she thought he was as handsome as ever.</p> 
                  <p>"O, Mr. Pips, you can't think how glad I am to see you again in that chair!" she said.</p> 
                  <p>"It is a more comfortable seat than some I have found, during my absence," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"How often I gazed upon it and wished to see you occupy it while you were gone," she said. "Why didn't you call on me as soon as you returned?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because I saw you at Mrs. Watson's," he replied. "Besides, I had company to provide for"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Who in the world are those who came with you?" she asked, gazing fondly upon his face.</p> 
                  <p>He now told her the whole story which she heard with great astonishment. She was very anxious to know his opinion of the beautiful Sarah. That troubled her the most.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you brought them out of the woods from mere sympathy," she said. "Oh, Mr. Pips, I always knew you possessed great benevolence and kindness for the poor and distressed."</p> 
                  <p>"The mother is a very clever woman and once resided in this city, but she followed a man who deceived her and then she sought the wilderness to avoid all civilized society."</p> 
                  <p>"Then she was never married," she said, looking not only surprised but very wise.</p> 
                  <p>"Never," he replied, expecting to hear her moralize on the subject.</p> 
                  <p>"And that girl her daughter?" she asked, expressing great astonishment in her countenance.</p> 
                  <p>"It is true," he replied. "Don't you think she's handsome for one brought up in the woods?"</p> 
                  <p>"I hardly know what to make of her," she replied. "She's a kind of wild young thing."</p> 
                  <p>"O Miss Spiker, she can shoot a rifle and kill trout with wonderful skill. A good old Indian taught her these wild sports."</p> 
                  <p>"Good Lord!" she exclaimed, holding up her long arms. "A girl shoot and fish, it is terrible Mr. Pips, who ever heard of such things?"</p> 
                  <p>"The ladies in the old country often practice such sports," he replied. "The young lady can swim like an otter!"</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the maid fanning herself quite furiously. "Swim! A woman swim in the water. How very vulgar! I'm astonished, Mr. Pips."</p> 
                  <p>"You wouldn't say it was vulgar if you could see her swim and skim over the water like a wild duck," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha covered her face with her fan, and appeared much affected. Pips was quite sure she manifested a good deal of false delicacy, but he did not assure her of it, for he was too much of a gentleman for that There was a short pause in the conversation.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips, do tell me if you approve of such things?" she asked in a trembling voice.</p> 
                  <p>"You know I am passionately fond of hunting and angling," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"I know it, Mr. Pips, I know it," she said. "It is well enough for a man. But for a woman to shoot and fish, and swim too! O, the thought is terrible!"</p> 
                  <p>"But the most fashionable ladies in the old country do it," he said, smiling at her agitation."</p> 
                  <p>"They may, Mr. Pips, but it is highly improper for ladies of our country to practice such sports," she replied. "I know your taste is too nice to approve of such practices. Is it not, Mr. Pips?"</p> 
                  <p>I must confess, I was highly gratified in witnessing that lovely girl shoot down a deer and play the large trout."</p> 
                  <p>"Lovely girl!" she repeated, staring wildly at him. "Shoot down the deer! Swim naked in the water! Dear me! did ever anybody hear of such transactions before? Mr. Pips, why do you call such a girl lovely? You must have changed in your views and feelings! No, Mr. Pips, you do not like such things in a woman, I know you don't, do you Mr. Pips?"</p> 
                  <p>"I must say, Miss Spiker, I do," he replied. "You know I always speak the truth!"</p> 
                  <p>She fanned herself seriously for a few minutes in silence, having her head over her right shoulder, and partially closing her eyes. The fan dropped from her hand upon the floor, and the long arms hung motionless by her side. All was still! Pips sat and gazed upon her. He saw that she breathed quite regularly, although her respiration was quicker than usual and somewhat more violent. He kept his eyes upon her. Soon she began to tremble and slide from her chair.</p> 
                  <p>"A regular case of swooning!' he said within himself, rising and going to her assistance.</p> 
                  <p>He was just in time to save her from falling upon the floor. Taking her in his arms, he bore her slender form to a sofa that stood near at hand and gently laid her down. He put his hand upon her forehead and rubbed her temples. Her eyes were not fully closed, yet the lids seemed to be motionless. We are sorry to be obliged to make a record of the fact that the good Mr. Pips had some doubts and misgivings whether she feigned the fit or not. If she did counterfeit it, he thought she noted the part very cleverly. Being somewhat in doubt, and not knowing but she might need more assistance than he was capable of rendering her, he took up a small bell that was on the table for the purpose of summoning her maid.</p> 
                  <p>"You needn't ring, Mr. Pips," she faintly said. "I begin to feel better. Your rubbing my forehead and temples has done me a great deal of good."</p> 
                  <p>That, he thought, was a gentle hint for him to continue his rubbing, which he did in a very kind and feeling manner. His remedy bad opened her eyes, which were now fastened upon him in a fixed gaze. The power of second love, according to her theory, was doing its work. It will be remembered by the reader that Pips had become a convert to that doctrine; but not however, through the charms or pleadings of Tabitha Spiker, who had long been engaged to convince him of its truth.</p> 
                  <p>"I am very glad you feel better," he said, while he continued his rubbing process. "In a few minutes you'll be quite well, I trust."</p> 
                  <p>"O, Mr. Pips, you do rub my forehead and temples beautifully," she said. "But for that I should have fainted entirely away! You're very kind indeed! O, Mr. Pips, I must say that no other man's hand could have restored me to consciousness so soon!"</p> 
                  <p>That was a very direct and palpable compliment which could not be mistaken, but how to answer it so as not to give her either offence or encouragement, was the question that puzzled him. Thinking he might make a slight blunder either one way or the other, he remained <unclear>silent</unclear> and gradually terminated his rubbing.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips, have you delivered the mysterious package to Miss Proudit?" she asked, fearing she had been too harsh, if not too coarse, in such a compliment to him, and therefore wishing to change the subject for a few moments.</p> 
                  <p>"I have not, but I must do so soon," he replied. "I wish to obey the instructions of the letter in full, for Mrs. Watson, and therefore must deliver the package to the daughter and not let the mother know it. No such opportunity has yet occurred. Mrs. Proudit keeps a close watch over her daughter; besides, I understand a young gentleman from the south is making love to her."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think Miss Proudit is the mother of that child?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I have no doubt of it," he replied. "But who the father is I cannot divine. One thing I am sure of, however, and that is, that I am not its either."</p> 
                  <p>Pips laughed, but no smile appeared upon Tabitha's thin face, for she had too much to think of to spare time to laugh! She had now risen and sat upright upon the sofa, having entirely recovered from her fainting fit.</p> 
                  <p>"It was strange that you and Mrs. Watson should have thought so'" he continued.</p> 
                  <p>"You were gone so long, and the child was brought to Mrs. Watson, and it was so handsome," she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"And so from such circumstances you concluded I must be the father!" he answered, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear me, Mr. Pips, we hardly knew what to think, everything appeared so strange!" she replied.</p> 
                  <p>"It was a very singular affair, I must acknowledge, and the mystery ain't half revealed yet," he answered. "There's something about it which I cannot comprehend."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm sure I can't understand it," she replied. "Don't you think that girl you brought with you looks something like the little one?"</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Watson suggested that very thing yesterday," he answered. "She thinks they do, and I must confess there appears to me to be some resemblance between them. One thing is very certain, both are very beautiful."</p> 
                  <p>"They have a certain kind of beauty," said Tabitha, wishing to gratify him, but how to do so she hardly knew. "I suppose the girl and her mother will go back again into the woods?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, no," he replied, "They will remain in the city."</p> 
                  <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6823-00000041"/> 
                  <p>"But have they anything to live upon in the city?" she asked. "It costs a great deal more to live in the city than where they come from."</p> 
                  <p>"I have means enough to support them," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, Mr. Pips, you don't intend to spend your money in their support, do you!" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Surely I do," he replied! "I brought them to the city for that express purpose."</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Pips, do tell me if you care much about that shooting, fishing, swimming girl," she anxiously inquired.</p> 
                  <p>"Miss Spiker, I must be frank with you," he replied. "That lovely maid of the forest has taught me the power of second love. Miss Spiker, I love her with my whole heart!"</p> 
                  <p>"Lovely maid of the forest!" she repeated, in a loud, broken, screaming voice, help or I shall faint!"</p> 
                  <p>She shrieked and fell back upon the sofa, kicking her feet and flourishing her arms. Mr. Pips rang the bell loudly, and Mary Campbell entered and ran to her assistance. Tabitha appeared to be decidedly deranged, her eyes rolling wildly in their sockets, and her breathing very hard and violent. Pips was somewhat alarmed, and so was her maid, for she had never seen Tabitha's countenance look so before, although she had witnessed several of her fainting fits.</p> 
                  <p>"What is the matter?" asked Mary, holding her hands and endeavoring to quiet her.</p> 
                  <p>"He loves a wild girl of the forest!" exclaimed Tabitha, wrenching her arms from Mary's grasp and sitting bolt upright upon the sofa.</p> 
                  <p>"Aweel, aweel!" replied Mary. "The gentleman has a gude right to loo any laddie he pleases."</p> 
                  <p>"He ought to have loved me for I taught him the power of second love!" screamed Tabitha, springing from the sofa and standing upon the floor straight as a bean pole.</p> 
                  <p>"It was nae your charms that gared him learn sic a lesson," replied the Scotch maiden.</p> 
                  <p>"Be calm and quiet," said Pips. "You have always told me that love will go where it is sent."</p> 
                  <p>"The same thing she has often told me," said Mary.</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha strided across the floor several times and looked wild, but made no reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Ye'll feel better soon," said Mary, laughing in her sleeve.</p> 
                  <p>"Never!" exclaimed Tabitha. "My heart is broken. O, cruel man to serve me so!"</p> 
                  <p>"I never told you I loved you, but, on the contrary, I always declared my belief that I could never love a second time," he answered.</p> 
                  <p>"But you do love a second time!" shrieked Tabitha loud enough to be heard in the street.</p> 
                  <p>"If a young lassie gar a mon loo her the first time, an auld lassie ganna do it the second time," said Mary. "Nature nae her ain laws and na mon can change 'em."</p> 
                  <p>"You talk like a fool as you are!" exclaimed Tabitha. "Love an Irish coachman, will you?"</p> 
                  <p>"There ye gang agin," said Mary, smiling. "Many a time hae ye tauld me that."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't hear what you say," replied Tabitha. "Nor do I wish to. Leave the room."</p> 
                  <p>Mary now retired, much to the regret of Pips, who had no particular fancy to be left alone with such a wild, screaming maid. However, he did not apprehend that she would attempt to do him any bodily injury, violent and spasmodic as she was.</p> 
                  <p>"I believe my soul you're the father of both those girls!" said Tabitha, pointing her trembling finger directly towards his right eye, as if she would pluck it out. "O, Mr. Pips, how could you act so when everybody thought you were so kind and virtuous?"</p> 
                  <p>"Miss Spiker, if you talk thus I shall soon begin to think that you are bereft of your senses," he replied. "You know I never uttered a falsehood in your hearing. I am not the father of either of those girls, but I am the sincere lover of the elder one!"</p> 
                  <p>"And expect to wed the young thing?" asked Tabitha.</p> 
                  <p>"I do," he replied. Love will go where it is sent. I saw that girl in the wild wood and loved her. And can you blame me for that, Miss Spiker? You have always said that we have no power over our own matters of love, and now I fully believe your doctrine."</p> 
                  <p>Tabitha walked to and fro very violently. Her countenance was wildly expressive, and her eyes had a strange look. Pips had never seen her appear so before, and he began to fear that she might become permanently deranged.</p> 
                  <p>"But why do you love such a young thing?" she asked, stopping and confronting him.</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot answer that question," he replied. "I saw and loved her, and can give no reason."</p> 
                  <p>"O, dear, the world now looks dark and gloomy." she said, in a tone of voice somewhat subdued. "Is has now no charms for me. Would to heaven I had died in infancy!"</p> 
                  <p>She now sank upon the <unclear>sofa</unclear>, and her violent spasms seemed to subside, still her countenance looked wild.</p> 
                  <p>Pips thought it best to remain in quiet and say nothing, but he wished he was far from that room. She sat upon the sofa some time, her eyes fixed on the ceiling over head, and her lips moving, but no sound escaped from them. But for her peculiar attitude and fixed gaze upon the ceiling, he would have believed she was becoming reconciled to <unclear>her fate</unclear>. He had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself. True, he had occasionally visited for in past months and years, but never with a design of forming any closer connection with her than that which already existed. Although she had very foolishly declared her love for him, and descanted upon the power of a second attachment, yet he had invariably told her that he believed he could never so far forget Catharine Watson as to really love another woman. She endeavored to argue him out of such a motion, and talked so much upon the nature and philosophy of a first and second love, that she had become a kind of monomaniac in love affairs. Nothing but this species of derangement could have driven her so <unclear>far</unclear> from the line of moral rectitude as <choice>
                        <sic>to to</sic>
                        <corr>to</corr>
                     </choice> write that letter, authorizing Mrs. Watson to break the seal of the package. But she had done the deed, and yet her curiosity was not satisfied. The contents of the package were very different from what she expected. The coming of Mr. Pips too, at that juncture, and bringing with him such a surpassingly beautiful girl-her forging that letter-the mystery that still hung over the parentage of little Jenny-the strange woman who brought her to Mrs. Watson-her extreme enmity against Mrs. Barlow-the sarcastic wit of Mary Campbell, all pressed heavily on her mind, and struck a severe blow at her reason. Miss Tabitha Spiker was really in a bad way, as Mr. Pips expressed her peculiar condition.</p> 
                  <p>During five minutes at least, she sat in silence upon the sofa, gazing upon the ceiling and moving her lips. Terrible thoughts were burning in her brain, and among them was the memory of her having written that false letter. Her conscience had awakened her to a sense of the wrong she had committed, the consequences of which she could not foresee. The guilt of that crime grew more and more frightful in her awakened conscience, which now slung and drove her almost to madness. By nature she was not more depraved than thousands of others who were never left to forge a letter or commit other crimes of greater magnitude, but her monomania in love affairs had driven her along until she had reached a fearful crisis in her life. O, how she now wished she had not written that letter! It seemed to her she could bear all her other misfortunes better than that. It is the last feather that breaks the camel's back, and but for her writing that letter she might have borne her other troubles without sinking under them.</p> 
                  <p>"It is done, and I'm ruined!" she exclaimed, suddenly rising and standing like a statue upon the floor. Then placing her hand upon her forehead, she continued. "My brain's on fire! I have done it!"</p> 
                  <p>"Done what?" asked Pips, fearing that her reason had received a terrible shock, which might prove serious and permanent.</p> 
                  <p>A vacant stare and a hollow laugh were the only answer. His worst fears were now confirmed. She stood gazing upon him, and occasionally a wild, unnatural laugh escaped from her. It was evident to him that her reason was tottering upon its throne, and he called Mary Campbell. Mary came in, and as soon as she saw the countenance of Tabitha, and heard one of her laughs, she had the same impressions that Pips had.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Too muckle thinking on an idea," whispered Mary to Mr. Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Irish coachman! Mrs. Chubby!" exclaimed Tabitha, springing from the floor and coming down again in her same tracks.</p> 
                  <p>"Will ye lie doon and be quiet?" asked Mary.</p> 
                  <p>"Am I sick that I should go to bed before the bright sun does?" demanded the unfortunate Tabitha, rushing to the window and pointing to the heavens.</p> 
                  <p>"Should you retire you might be more calm," said Pips, in a kind, imploring voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Go! leave me!" exclaimed Tabitha, suddenly turning round and confronting him. "The girl! the child! take care of your children!"</p> 
                  <p>And a loud, unearthly laugh burst from her lips, and she flourished her long arms in fearful gyrations. She was strongly impressed with the conviction that Pips was the father of Sarah and little Jenny. She now walked about the room in slow and measured steps, as if she were keeping time to the music of a military band. Pips remained some time longer, and then, at the request of Mary, went for Tabitha's physician. The doctor came and prevailed upon his patient to retire to her chamber, where he prescribed some remedies. But he had no medicine for the sickness of the soul. She became quite raving in the night, and before morning a brain fever was fastened upon her.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE GROWTH OF FRIENDSHIP-THE WAY TO CATECHISE, AND THE TACT TO AVOID IT.</head> 
                  <p>Mrs. Watson and Sarah's mother became fast and intimate friends. Hours and even days had been passed by them in hearing the stories of each other's lives. Mrs. Watson told her friend the most remarkable incidents in her life. How beautiful and accomplished her daughter Catharine was-how ardently Mr. Pips loved her, and how much he mourned her death. Sarah's mother related to the old lady the birth of her daughter-many of the strange circumstances attending the event-the character of the Indian, Paulo-her long life in the woods, and many other matters which deeply interested the good old widow. Both felt as if they were the mothers-in-law to Mr. Pips. Sarah and little Jenny were constantly together during the day, and slept in the same bed at night. Jenny had found a companion whom she loved better than she ever did any one else. And Sarah loved her young friend with a pure affection. The mother and Mrs. Watson really thought the girls resembled each other in face, form and motion, and Mr. Pips was forced to believe that he saw resemblances between them. The widow Watson had now a happy groupe under her roof. She had always been opposed to Mr. Pips' marrying, but Sarah was so young, so beautiful so kind and interesting; that the old lady was perfectly reconciled to the contemplated match. The parentage of little Jenny, especially on the father's side, was still the subject of much doubt and great curiosity, and afforded the old ladies a fruitful topic of conversation. Pips had not yet conveyed the letter to Miss Proudit, who, they now had no doubt, was the mother of Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>Elizabeth Murdoch had not yet visited Mrs. Watson since the letter was received, authorizing the opening of the package. And Mrs. Watson came to the conclusion that she would not again visit her. Mr. Pips had passed Mrs. Proudit's house several times with the letter in his pocket, but no such opportunity to present it had occurred as he desired. He hoped that the mother might ride out some day and leave her daughter at home; but they generally rode together, accompanied by the dandy Montville, who was now pressing his suit with great perseverence. The fellow really believed he was over head and ears in love with Angelina, and the proud mother believed so too, and the daughter was afraid it was so. Whenever she was left alone with him, she treated him with more cold indifference, if possible, than when her mother was present. He had made such progression in his enterprise, as he imagined, that he began to fix upon the day of their marriage, and to consult with the mother upon the subject with great earnestness, urging her to appoint an early day for the celebration of their nuptials, but never speaking of it to his intended bride. For this neglect on his part Angelina was very grateful. His visits had now become very frequent, and not an evening passed that he was not there. Sometimes Angelina's heart would almost sink within her, and then again she would summon her resolution and endeavor to appear quite cheerful on her mother's account. But if she married him, she was fully resolved that he should first know the darkest page in her history. Her mother, for some time, had purposely avoided any illusion to that subject, hoping that Angelina would either forget, or not insist upon the condition. But such a hope on her part implied but a little knowledge of her daughter's true character.</p> 
                  <p>Major Lenox was driving his suit with all his skill and tact. To marry the dashing widow Barlow would give him a splendid home, and render the <choice>

                     </choice> of his days comfortable, easy and happy. In this enterprise he had much at stake. He nor the widow Barlow had seen Mr. Pips or heard of his arrival. Pips had so many irons in the fire that he had not time to call upon all his friends. However, the next day after his interview with Miss Spiker, he called on the widow, not, however, before he had made inquiries after Tabitha's health. Just as he was ringing the door bell, a carriage was driven up, and Mrs. Barlow came to the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Bless my soul!" she exclaimed. "I was just on the point of going to Mrs. Watson's to inquire if you had returned! when did you arrive?"</p> 
                  <p>"A few days ago, but I have been so busy that really I have not had time to call," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you have visited Miss Spiker across the street, have you not?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I have just called at her house to enquire about her health," he replied. "Miss Spiker, I'm sorry to say, is very dangerously sick with a brain fever!"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed!" she said. "I didn't hear of it, but then I havn't any communication with her at all. She might die, and I not know it, unless I happened to see the funeral train from my window. She's a fit subject for a brain fever. But let her pass. I hope she'll get up again."</p> 
                  <p>"The physician considers her case very doubtful," he answered. "She seems quite deranged."</p> 
                  <p>"She always seemed so to me," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"But what luck in angling did you have?"</p> 
                  <p>"I hooked the most beautiful fish angler ever set eyes on!" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"But did you hold it fast, or did it break away?" she inquired. "I have often remarked that the largest and most beautiful fishes are those which the anglers hook and then lose."</p> 
                  <p>"There may be some truth in your remark," he replied. "But I can assure you I brought the one I alluded to safely to the city."</p> 
                  <p>"In salt or ice, Mr. Pips?" she asked, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"In neither," he replied. "But in a nice calico dress and a beautiful birch bark hat."</p> 
                  <p>"You're joking!" she said. "Calico dress and birch hat! O, I now understand! "You brought a beautiful Indian girl home with you."</p> 
                  <p>"Not a drop of Indian blood in her veins," he replied. "But she was brought up in the wilderness, far away from the influence of bad men, and from the corruptions of gay and fashionable society."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, Mr. Pips, you go fishing so much, and spend so much of your time on lakes and the banks of trout streams, that you have almost become weaned from the world," she replied. "But what strange fish is this, to be serious?"</p> 
                  <p>"The most perfect model of a woman ever found out of the company of angels!" he replied.</p> 
                  <p>He now related very minutely the history of Sarah, described how she looked and where she was the first time his eyes fell upon her-spoke of Paulo, and invited Mrs. Barlow to call and see her. This subject being quite exhausted, there was another in which the widow felt a strong curiosity. But how to introduce it she did not know. Supposing Pips to be the father of Jenny, she had some delicacy about speaking of her, but while she was revolving in her mind how to introduce the subject, Pips saved her any farther trouble on that score by introducing it himself.</p> 
                  <p>"I understood Mrs. Watson to say that you had seen little Jenny?" he said.</p> 
                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6823-00000042"/> 
                  <p>"I have indeed, and a most beautiful child she is," replied the widow, archly smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you, like the rest, think she resembled me?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Mr. Pips, why do you ask such a question!" she said, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Why? because I believe every body concluded she was my own child," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"And that conclusion was not correct, was it?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Correct!" he repeated, <choice>
                        <sic>manfesting</sic>
                        <corr>manifesting</corr>
                     </choice> much astonishment. "I hav'nt got quite so far along as that, I trust. No, Mrs. Barlow, I never saw nor heard of the child until I came home and found her at Mrs. Watson's. It is a curious affair isn't it.</p> 
                  <p>"It is indeed!" she replied, looking at him with surprise. "But who are the parents of the girl?"</p> 
                  <p>"I presume, from a letter which was found in the package, Mrs. Watson was empowered to unseal, and directed to Miss Angelina Proudit that she is the mother!" he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Heavens and earth!" she exclaimed, "Mrs. Proudit's daughter! I have some acquaintance with her and her mother! There was a rumor two or three years ago that some accident had befallen the family, but that was before I had any acquaintance with them. I knew it was said by some that Mrs. Proudit had carried her daughter into the country for the benefit of her health, but others intimated that she was carried there for other purposes. I know her daughter has not been much in society and she appears quite sober and sedate; at least she did the last time I called upon them. But Mr. Pips, who is the father? I believe that even Rumor, with her ten thousand tongues, never disclosed that secret."</p> 
                  <p>"And I'm sure my tongue cannot disclose it," he replied. "I presume there is no one but Miss Proudit and her mother and the father himself that knows."</p> 
                  <p>"The letter to Miss Proudit I now have," he said. "I am to deliver it as soon as I can do so without the knowledge of her proud, suspicious mother."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, I must confess, you have completely astounded me with the news!" she said. "Angelina Proudit the mother of that beautiful little girl! I wonder what will next turn up?" The father of Jenny, I hope," he replied, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>The conversation now changed to another subject. The widow began to feel as if she desired to know something farther in relation to the wild girl of the forest, as Pips sometimes called his beloved Sarah. This dashing young widow was not sure that Pips intended to make a wife of this wild girl, but rather supposed that he might be joking when he told her a short time previous that he did intend to marry her. And she supposed too that he brought her to the city as a sort of natural curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>"You were saying awhile ago, Mr. Pips, that you intended to make a wife of the girl you brought from the wilderness," she said. "I suppose, however, you were joking."</p> 
                  <p>"No joking I can assure you." That girl will become my wife just as sure as we both live. I loved her the first time I saw her, when she sat in her light elegant canoe angling for the glorious trout in the lake, but I did'nt know that the feeling her wild beauty and skill in angling stirred in my heart was real genuine love at that time. I have found since, however, that the passion was again in my soul. Yes, Mrs. Barlow, strange as it may seem to you I do sincerely, deeply love that girl."</p> 
                  <p>"You're a strange genius, Mr. Pips," she said. "If you had'nt been thus taken in the wilderness and charmed by the beauty and fragrance of a wild flower, I don't know but that I should have offered my hand and heart."</p> 
                  <p>This she said partly in joke and partly in earnest to see what effect it would have upon him. It is known to the reader that she preferred him to the military gentleman who was addressing her with so much perseverance and apparent enthusiasm.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, Mrs. Barlow, you can find a better man to offer those precious gifts to," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Just as a woman thinketh so she is," was her reply." I have my own peculiar fancies, and as you have yours, it seems. I must confess you are quite romantic for one of your years, but that comes perhaps of your angling propensities.</p> 
                  <p>"I can't say what it comes from, but so it is," he answered. "By the way, where is Major Lenox? I hav'nt crossed his track since I returned."</p> 
                  <p>The widow's cheeks assumed a redder hue than usual, and a faint smile played about her lips. Those tell-tale blushes were the only answer she gave.</p> 
                  <p>"Then it has come to a head at last," he continued, laughing. "I very well knew, when I went away, that he was angling in those waters, but what his success might be I could net say. Well the Major thinks it is time that all his wild oats were sown, and so he concludes to settle down into marriage life."</p> 
                  <p>"Think you, Mr. Pips, his wild oats are all sown?" she inquired, assuming a very significant look.</p> 
                  <p>"It is time they were at any rate," he replied. "He has lived a bachelor longer than I have."</p> 
                  <p>"And think you his life has been as pure?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"The world is full of anglers," he replied. "Some angle for money, some for honors, some for women and some for trout."</p> 
                  <p>"You belong to the last class we all know, Mr Pips, but to which think you he belongs?"</p> 
                  <p>"He is not very fond of killing trout at any rate," he replied. "I suppose, considering the profession he chose, we may reckon him an angler for honors. And surely he will be honored if he angles successfully for you, Mrs Barlow."</p> 
                  <p>"I thank you for your compliment," she replied, curtesying very low and smiling. "Is it possible, Mr. Pips, for a gentleman to angle for honors when he is young and for money when he is advanced in years?"</p> 
                  <p>"I understand you perfectly, Mrs. Barlow," he replied. "I never consider it my duty to meddle with the affairs of others. I have not thus far in life, and it would not become me to begin now."</p> 
                  <p>"Very true, but then it may be proper sometimes for a gentleman to give his opinion to a lady when she asks it in matters that deeply concern her," she said, beginning to feel quite anxious to know his opinion of Major Lenox, and what he thought of him as a husband for her.</p> 
                  <p>"That may be so, if the matters are not too delicate," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, Mr. Pips, you know my frankness," she said. "I was always frank with you. I will ask you a plain, simple question. How do you think it will do for me to become the wife of Major Lenox?"</p> 
                  <p>"That is a very direct question," he replied. "But really, Mrs. Barlow, I cannot answer it directly. In giving an opinion upon such a subject there are many things having a bearing upon it, which I should be obliged to guess at. In the first place I hold it very essential in marriage that love, pure, sincere love should be the controling motive. Now you and the Major are better judges of that so far as you are both concerned than I can possibly be."</p> 
                  <p>"He professes to have a very strong affection for me," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"And do you have as strong a one for him as he professes to have for you?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't think my love equals his professions by a good deal," she replied, smiling. "If it did J should not hesitate as I do now."</p> 
                  <p>"Then he talks loudly of his love, does he?" asked Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, but, to be serious, I fear he has been somewhat in the habit of talking eloquently upon that subject to other ladies, he is so very expert in talking to me."</p> 
                  <p>"You think the old maxim is true that practice makes perfect," he answered. "I have never known of his ever having loved any lady in particular."</p> 
                  <p>"But the trouble with me is that he may have loved a good many in general," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"That would be rather a black spot on his character if it were true," he replied. "The Major has always been very gallant and polite to the ladies, but a man may be thus gallant, and yet not stain the moral purity of his character."</p> 
                  <p>"I know you have always been fond of female society, but I believe you have never soiled your character," she said</p> 
                   
                  <p>"And perhaps the Major has not," he said; "far be it from me to judge him harshly. I must judge others as I wish others to judge <unclear>me</unclear>. Rumors, false rumors, are sometimes circulated and believed in relation to our characters as well as in relation to the characters of the ladies. Why, until I came to pay you this neighborly visit, you had rather an ugly impression about me."</p> 
                  <p>"That, I did," she replied. "And I was not alone in that opinion. I verily believed that lovely little girl was your daughter. But the bell rings. I shouldn't wonder if it was the very man we have been talking about."</p> 
                  <p>True enough, Major Lennox entered, and seizing the hand of Pips, greeted him very cordially. The Major was in high glee and full of anecdote and fun.</p> 
                  <p>"I am glad to see you, upon my soul I am," said the Major. "You were gone so long upon your angling excursion, I didn't know but some big fish had drawn you into his native element, and drowned you! Well, well, you have returned, looking in fine health."</p> 
                  <p>"My health was never better," replied Pips. "The air of the wilderness agrees with my constitution. I can assure you Major, I had fine sport in killing the big trout."</p> 
                  <p>"He brought a beautiful one home with him," said Mrs. Barlow, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed!" replied the Major. "I should like to dine upon it."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, Major, I couldn't consent to that under any circumstances."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, Major Lennox, you can't come in for a share there," said the widow. "That beautiful fish he keeps all to himself."</p> 
                  <p>"But what mean you, my dear Mrs. Barlow, replied the Major. "The expression of your countenance seems to denote more than your lips express! What about this magnificent fish? Does it wear scales or silks?"</p> 
                  <p>"Neither, but calico and birch bark," she replied, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens, Pips, you have brought a beautiful Indian girl with you," said the Major. "In the course of my life I have seen some very beautiful half-breeds in the region of the Canadas."</p> 
                  <p>"Not so, Major," answered the widow. "No Indian, but a beautiful girl."</p> 
                  <p>"French, English, or American?" asked the Major, addressing Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"A true American on the mother's side," answered Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"And what upon the father's?" enquired Lennox.</p> 
                  <p>"There Major, you are too hard upon me," replied the Angler. "It is a wise child that knows its father. To be plain with you, however, she belongs to that class of children who have no fathers, but that circumstance don't trouble me. She's a most beautiful, lovely, innocent, virtuous girl, and I love her."</p> 
                  <p>"That's enough," said the Major, casting a glance at the widow. "If you love her, then marry her, and ask no questions. I would have married years ago, it I had seen any woman I could love. But I did not, and hence have remained a bachelor.</p> 
                  <p>"Your time has come now, I presume," said Pips looking slyly at both of them.</p> 
                  <p>"That may be and may not be," replied the lady. "But hope keeps the heart whole."</p> 
                  <p>"Come, come, gentlemen, change the subject," said the widow. 'I'll tell you what I have been thinking about. I should like to see your lady love and her mother at my house to dine to-morrow. Major Lennox will come too, I trust."</p> 
                  <p>"A capital idea!" said the Major. "Nothing would give me more pleasure than to meet them on such an occasion. You can't refuse, I know, Mr. Pips, let us have a real social time."</p> 
                  <p>"I accept your invitation, Mrs. Barlow," said Pips, feeling proud to show his lovely girl.</p> 
                  <p>"You must let your lady love wear the same dress she wore when she captivated you, said the widow. "I want to see how she looked when she was hauling in the big trout."</p> 
                  <p>"Better and better!" exclaimed the Major. "If you have plucked a wild flower, Pips, let us see it in its original beauty without the trappings and decorations dressmakers and milliners supply."</p> 
                  <p>"All shall be done as you request," replied Pips. "Nothing would suit me better. I fear not to show you my taste in these matters. I assure you, Major, she's the most lovely and beautiful girl you ever beheld in all your travels."</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose you think so," answered the Major, laughing. "Love makes a wonderful difference in our vision. But we shall see what kind of a stick you have picked in your travels through the wood. I have heard of persons selecting crooked ones under such circumstances."</p> 
                  <p>"She's straight as an arrow, quick motioned as a deer, and smooth as a trout," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Pips, you have made some strange comparisons," said the widow laughing. "But I suppose you have recently seen so many Indian arrows, deer, and trout, that you can't think of anything else to compare her with."</p> 
                  <p>"Very well said! Capital! my dear Mrs. Barlow," said the Major. "You have hit our friend just right. I dare say his head is full of such gear, especially since he has just arrived from the wood, the stream and the lake."</p> 
                  <p>"Go on, Major, don't stop on my account, said Mr. Pips. "I'll show you as beautiful a flower as ever the sun shone upon."</p> 
                  <p>"And as fragrant too, I dare say," said the Major, feeling quite jocose and merry.</p> 
                  <p>"Go on," said Pips, laughing. "You can't say too much, Major. The half has not been told you, yet."</p> 
                  <p>"Go on Mr. Pips, and let us have the rest, said the Major.</p> 
                  <p>"Come gentlemen, you are getting quite extravagant," said the widow. Your tongues are quite as voluble as those of the ladies."</p> 
                  <p>"Very good, my dear Mrs. Barlow, said the Major. "Very good, indeed!"</p> 
                  <p>The Major was careful to let no opportunity pass unimproved when he could possibly pay the widow a compliment and bespatter her with fulsome praise. Having ascertained that she liked such kind of food, he was sure to provide it in large quantities. The conversation continued some time longer, and Mr. Pips took his leave, but the Major tarried and pressed his suit with renewed energy. The widow was not yet prepared to appoint the day of their marriage, but she gave him good reasons to hope that it should not be delayed very long. The Major departed full of hope and anticipated the dinner party the next day, with much pleasure.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE DEATH OF THE BOATMAN-THE DINNER PARTY-THE STRANGE MEETING-THE MAJOR BEATEN.</head> 
                  <p>Sabattus the young Indian, and lover of Sarah Searsmont, came to the city in company with Mr. Pips and the others Having sold his furs and received some valuable presents from Mr. Pips, he returned back intending to occupy the lodge near Paulo's grave during the remainder of the summer. Like a true hearted Indian he bore his disappointment with great philosophy and composure. Jake Borland did not accompany Mr Pips to the city, but his services ended when they reached the western shore of Lake Champlain. Spending a short time in one of the villages near the lake-and drinking up a good portion of his wages, he struck into the woods armed and equipped for deer hunting. He encamped the first night some fifteen miles from the lake, and on the line which Sabbattus happened to take on his way to the lodge which had been given to him. It was quite early in the morning when Sabattus came along, and Borland had just arisen from his temporary couch, and stood with his gun in his hand gazing round and debating in his own mind which way was best for him to travel. As he thus stood, he heard the rustling of the bushes and thought a deer might be approaching. His gun was instantly at his shoulder, and at the same moment he discovered Sabattus through the trees. The Indian also discovered Borland and prepared for the worst. Quick as thought, Borland blazed away and wounded Sabattus in the arm, but not severely. Like the tiger upon his prey the Indian leaped forward a few steps, and fired at his blood thirsty enemy. The bullet was fatal and brought Sabattus to the ground The pale<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6823-00000043"/> face cried for mercy as Sabattus came up and stood over the writhing body of his foe, but there was no mercy for Jack Borland, only that which prompted the Indian to sink his tomahawk into Borland's forehead, and shorten his memory and end his dying agonies. Jake Borland was the aggressor and dearly did he pay for his murderous intentions towards the Indian who would not have perpetrated the bloody deed if the defence of his own life had not rendered it necessary. Sabattus stood some minutes gazing upon the dead body of his foe. At last he said within himself, "I will not leave his body to be devoured by the wolves, although he would have left mine so had his shot proved fatal."</p> 
                  <p>A short distance from the spot was a sand hill on the margin of a stream, in which Sabattus buried the earthly remains of Borland. His gun and other hunting apparatus he buried with him, for he would not steal a single article from his dead enemy. Thus were ended the days of Jake Borland, whose enmity to the red man of the forest had procured his own destruction. Sabattus hurried on towards the lodge which he reached the next day, but the death of Borland made him uneasy and he pushed through the wilderness to the St. Lawrence river, where he remained until towards fall and then struck out for the hunting grounds of the north. We shall leave him there in pursuit of game and return to the scenes in the city. Sarah and her mother were well pleased with the idea of visiting Mrs. Barlow, for Pips had told them how splendidly she lived, and what lively company she was. The night passed, and morning came. Mr. Pips desired Sarah's mother to wear the silk dress which she had previous to the birth of her daughter. It had been made nearly twenty years and the fashion was very different from what it was at this time. The dress had been well preserved, and the gloss upon the silk was but little injured. Sarah wore her calico frock and birch hat. Pips was always prompt in keeping his appointments. He and his companions were at the widow Barlow's five minutes before the time, and Major Lenox had not arrived, but there was no doubt but he would be present if sickness or death did not prevent.</p> 
                  <p>Sarah and her mother were formally introduced to the widow, who could hardly keep her countenance when she examined the costumes of her female guests, they were so entirely different from any she had seen either on or off the stage for the last twenty years. Sarah's beauty of face and form came up to all Mr. Pips had said of them, extravagant as his praises had appeared to her the day before. The more Mrs. Barlow gazed upon this daughter of the forest, the less was her surprise that Pips had fallen in love with her. Conversation began to flow quite briskly, and Sarah admired the rich carpet, costly furniture, and splendid mirrors that ornamented the parlor. She had never witnessed such a scene before and could not well help contrasting it with the humble lodge where she had been brought up from infancy. But she did not stare or exhibit any awkwardness, such as she might reasonably have been supposed to manifest on such an occasion, considering the peculiar life she had lived. Her mother had not lost her accomplishments and appeared singularly easy and graceful amidst the pleasures of fashionable life. True, her somewhat antique dress made her appear like a lady of the old school, yet she was a lady in her manners and conversation.</p> 
                  <p>"The Major has not made his appearance yet," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"No fear but he will soon be along," replied Mrs. Barlow, winking at Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"If he's not dead, he'll not fail of being here," said Pips, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"There seems to be something more than you have expressed," said Sarah's mother.</p> 
                  <p>"The Major has really renewed his age," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"And you are not far behind him in that respect," replied Mrs. Barlow, casting a glance at Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>"And do you wonder at it?" asked the bachelor, looking in the same direction her eyes were turned.</p> 
                  <p>"I must confess Mr. Pips, I do not," she replied. After so many years your time has come."</p> 
                  <p>"There is a good Providence watching over us all," responded Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"The same idea in different language, which I have heard the lamented <unclear>Paulo</unclear> advance a thousand times," said Sarah's mother. "I never can forget him though so far moved from his grave."</p> 
                  <p>"Nor I mother," said Sarah. All the great cities of the world and their wonders cannot make me forget that good Indian. O, if he could be alive and be here with us!"</p> 
                  <p>"I wish he was," said Pips. "His care of you and your mother has endeared him to my memory also."</p> 
                  <p>The door bell now sent out its peal, and Major Lenox was ushered into the room. He entered, bowing very politely. Gazing hurriedly round the room, his eyes fell upon Sarah in a fixed look. He had an eye for beauty, and Sarah's almost charmed him.</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Searsmont, Major Lenox." said Pips, introducing Sarah to the Major.</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Searsmont!" repeated the Major, looking wildly into her face.</p> 
                  <p>"Major Lenox!" repeated the mother in great astonishment. "O, my God, it is he!"</p> 
                  <p>And she started back from, and gazed upon his well known face. Mr. Pips was greatly astonished, and so were Sarah and Mrs. Barlow. The Major and Mrs. Searmont still stood with their eyes fastened upon each other.</p> 
                  <p>"He's a vile man, and the father of my Sarah!" exclaimed the mother, sinking into a chair and burying her face in her trembling hands.</p> 
                  <p>Sarah ran to her mother's assistance, while the Major stood like a statue on the floor, thinking whether it was better to deny all, or confess and own his daughter. But alas! there was too much at stake for him to take that magnanimous course. The dashing rich widow was to be won, and if he confessed the truth she would instantly turn him from her doors, and his game would be up. Preserving his self-possession, which for a moment he had lost, he stepped one foot forward and planted his left foot firmly on the carpet. It was a great crisis in his affairs, and great courage and audacity were required to meet it. He had been on the battle field where the missiles of death were flying thick and fast, and he believed he could confront a single woman; at least he was resolved to try, knowing he had nothing to lose, and everything to gain.</p> 
                  <p>"What mean you, madam, by such a declaration?" demanded the brave officer.</p> 
                  <p>Nerved with uncommon energy and feeling how deeply he had wronged her, she rose from her chair and pointed her trembling finger at him, while scorn and contempt were upon her somewhat wrinkled face.</p> 
                  <p>"I mean that thou art a vile seducer!" she replied in a firm, decided tone of voice while Sarah clung nervously to the skirts of her dress and looked frightened.</p> 
                  <p>"Madam, I hate to contradict a woman to her face, but you must permit me so say that I deserve no such character as you have put upon me," he replied. "I never saw you before in my life."</p> 
                  <p>"It is false and you know it!" she replied, shaking her finger at him as if she felt all the energies of youth. "You enticed me away under a solemn promise of marriage. I traveled with you far from friends and home, followed you through woods, across rivers and lakes and over mountains, suffered great fatigue of body and trouble of mind, was spell-bound and enchanted with your honied words and loved you more than woman ought to love. You promised marriage still, and this girl was born! Then you began to grow cold and indifferent and my eyes were opened to my shame and misery, but I bore it all and still believed you would atone for your past sins and neglects, until I saw you with another woman who I knew was an abandoned character! O, what terrible emotions then agitated my soul! A sickness came over me and I sunk down with my child, and your child, in my arms! An unseen power whispered me to rise and leave you forever! I arose and hurried away from all civilized society, hugging my infant to my agitated bosom and caring for nothing but to get beyond the sound of the drum and far from the haunts of men. Soon I reached the wood, sat down and rejoiced that none could see me. I had not thought of what I should eat. Again the sound of the drum fell upon my ear. I arose and hurried farther into the depths of the forest quite beyond the pale of civilisation tion. The blue sky was over my head, the trees surrounded me and all was silent save the singing of the birds in the branches. I kissed my babe and gave it the nourishment nature had provided. It smiled and was happy. I looked up and at that moment an Indian appeared whom a good Providence sent to provide for me and my child. I followed him. He proved a friend indeed, but you have proved my greatest enemy. I loved you once too well, but I hate you now?"</p> 
                  <p>While she was thus speaking, Sarah was holding upon the skirts of her dress. Pips was gazing upon her with intense interest. Mrs. Barlow was trembling from head to foot and the Major was struck dumb. His resolution failed him and he could not reply. A weakness seized him which he never experienced before on any occasion. There was silence, a deathlike silence, for some time, painful alike to all.</p> 
                  <p>"It is true, every word of it!" exclaimed the widow Barlow, fixing a searching gaze upon the trembling military officer and curling her lip in scorn. It is an ill wind that blows no one any good." Then turning to the mother, she continued. "You have suffered much, but you have saved me from becoming the wife of an old libertine. I now invite you to make my house your home as long as you please, and you, Lenox, vile, wicked man, can leave my house immediately. I will not harbor those who have so basely injured my sex!"</p> 
                  <p>"You have acted the part of a true woman," said the mother. "And may Heaven prosper you. Money was the object of that wicked man's suit, and I rejoice that he has been thus foiled in his attempts to live in idleness and luxury upon your means."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pips remained silent and the agitated Major knew not what to do. Sarah heard all her mother said, but she could not embrace such a father, who was summoning courage and resolution to deny everything that the mother had uttered. Again there was silence and a painful silence to the military gentleman. Sarah's cheeks <choice>
                        <sic>were were</sic>
                        <corr>were</corr>
                     </choice> flushed and her dark eyes sparkled with great brilliancy. She was much excited. There stood her father before her-a father scorned, hated and spurned by her mother, justly so. At last the Major mustered courage to open his lips.</p> 
                  <p>"Madam," he said in a choked, tremulous voice, "I am an abused-"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold?" exclaimed the mother, before he could finish his sentence. "Don't add more lies to the black deeds you have already committed! Before Heaven, I swear that every word I have uttered is true. I might say much more and set other crimes before you of which you have been guilty, but I will let your own conscience do that!</p> 
                  <p>"Conscience!" repeated Mrs. Barlow. "The conscience of such a man! Don't mention it! He lost his conscience when he entered the army. Conscience forsooth! It is an article he don't deal in. Give him a more severe lecture. He has stood before the canon's mouth, now see if he can stand before an injured woman's tongue, that speaks the burning truth. Give it to him! He begins to tremble now! O, I am glad you met him here! I was about to share my fortunes with him. A lucky escape indeed! But I'm taking your privilege from you. Give it to him until he staggers under it!"</p> 
                  <p>"Let him deny my accusations if he dares," said the mother. "I have his letters now in my possession which will prove his guilt. I have kept them a score of years. See! His countenance shows his guilt! Lucky for him that the good Paulo did not cross his track, for he would have taken his life as soon as he would that of a wolf. That noble Indian knew the story of my life and longed to revenge my wrongs!"</p> 
                  <p>The Major could not command his usual tact and cunning, and his courage seemed to ooze out at the very ends of his fingers. Seizing his hat he hurried from the room and passed down the street in quick time.</p> 
                  <p>"He has gone thank heaven!" said Mrs. Barlow. "I'm quite sure he will never darken my doors again."</p> 
                  <p>"I should think he has got as much as he can carry," said Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"And is that wicked man my father?" asked Sarah in a trembling voice.</p> 
                  <p>"He is, my dear," replied her mother. "But he is not worthy to be called so"</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed he is not," said the widow Barlow "He's a poor broken down officer, and I am glad you did not fly to his arms and embrace him as your father. He has forfeited all right to claim you as a daughter. The good Paulo acted more like a father to you than he has."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, and I revere his memory," answered Sarah.</p> 
                  <p>Dinner was now announced and the party sat down at the table, but Major Lenox had no part to act in that scene. The dinner was admirable and the table was laden with all the luxuries of the season. Mrs Barlow was very animated and endeavored to make her guests easy and happy. Sarah never sat at such a table before. She and Pips sat together and her mother took a seat beside the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"Mrs. Barlow, you have every thing upon your table which our market affords, but I wish I could have brought some of the trout this daughter of the forest drew from the bright waters of the lake," said Pips. "O, they would be delicious! Take a trout from the water and cook him soon after, and we have a meal kings might wish for."</p> 
                  <p>"I should admire to go into the forest and enjoy the wild scenes," said the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish you could see the lodge mother and I occupied so many years," said Sarah. "It is a beautiful spot, is'nt it, Mr. Pips?"</p> 
                  <p>"Of course I think so," he replied, smiling, and slyly looking at the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course you do," said the widow. "Your reasons for thinking so are very good."</p> 
                  <p>"I intend to visit those lakes another season," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"And I will go with you," said Sarah. "And Mrs. Barlow, I should like to have you go."</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing would please me better," replied the widow.</p> 
                  <p>We must leave this party for the present in the enjoyment of their dinner and social conversation and turn to other actors and actresses in this drama of human life. The dandy, Edwin Montville, became an almost constant inmate of Mrs. Proudit's house. The mother did all the courting, while Angelina dreaded to have him speak to her. Yet out of respect to her mother, she treated him with ordinary politeness. For several days not a word had been said about the condition upon which marriage must take place, if it ever was consummated at all. The proud mother avoided any mention of it in the vain hope her daughter would either forget it or not insist upon it. Mrs. Proudit had just been conversing on the subject of the contemplated marriage with Montville. He was very anxious to have the time appointed, and so was she. Having obtained her promise that the day should be soon appointed, he walked out and strutted along Broadway, and Mrs. Proudit sought her daughter who was in her chamber, where she usually remained as long as she could, without violating too much the rules of politeness.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Angelina, Edwin is really anxious to have the day appointed for your marriage and take you to the South," said Mrs. Proudit. "He has written a letter to his parents informing them that they may ere long expect him and his wife. Now it would be well to appoint the day and make preparations for your marriage. I saw a splendid wedding dress yesterday at one of the stores which would become you much, I should like to have you see it."</p> 
                  <p>"Mother, I have no desire whatever to see such a garment!" replied Angelina, while the tears stood in her eyes. "Last night I dreamed of seeing my child, and a most beautiful little girl she appeared."</p> 
                  <p>"Nonsense!" said the mother. "What are dreams but dreams? Let your dreams by night pass for what they are worth, but your day dreams ought to be of the fine chance you have to make a grand figure in fashionable life. There is'nt a girl in the city but would have such dreams, if they were placed in your situation."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, dear mother, if they were placed in my situation they would have just such dreams as I have!" replied the daughter. "Mother, listen to me! For several days I have had a strong presentiment that my child is living and that I shall see her!"</p> 
                  <p>"What a foolish girl to think of such a thing!" said the mother. "A presentiment! a fiddlestick! Do,<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6823-00000044"/> Angelina, banish such foolish thoughts from your mind."</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot do it," replied Angelina. "It is quite impossible I might as well attempt to get rid of a part of myself as do it. No, no, mother, I feel as if God would so order the events of his providence that I shall once more fold my child to my heart!"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, that has nothing to do with your marriage!" said her mother, impatiently.</p> 
                  <p>"We must appoint some day for your nuptials with Edwin Montville. The matter has gone too far now to think of giving it up."</p> 
                  <p>"But suppose we should be married and Heaven should give me back my child, how would my husband feel when he saw me embrace her?" asked Angelina.</p> 
                  <p>"It never will, never can happen!" said her mother. "A way with such idle dreams!"</p> 
                  <p>"It can happen, and it may happen!" replied the daughter "And suppose it should, what kind of a wife should I appear in my husband's estimation?"</p> 
                  <p>"O, Mr. Montville would'nt care, he loves you so clearly, so deeply!" answered the mother, gazing upon her daughter's tears and feeling, in spite of her proud, ambitious spirit, some misgivings.</p> 
                  <p>"Then he's not the man I wish to spend my life with," said Angelina. "A man of no more sense of propriety than you represent him to possess can never make me happy. He is a mere apology for a husband and I should bitterly curse the day that ever united my fortunes with his! Mother, I know how much I have wronged, bay, disgraced you and myself, but I can never consent to do wrong again! If you insist upon me marrying Edwin Montville, I must insist upon his knowing the history of my character. I have prayed-on my knees have I prayed to Heaven that you would give up all thoughts of my marrying any one at present, but it seems my prayers have not been answered. My duty is plain before me. God has written it upon my heart, and I must perform it in spite of a mother's remonstrance or any earthly power!"</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean to talk thus to your mother?" asked the proud woman.</p> 
                  <p>"There is spirit within, that commands me thus to talk!" answered this good daughter. "That spirit I cannot, I dare not disobey. You have heard me, dear mother, and I shall not take back, nor repent of what I have said."</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Proudit walked about the room in great agitation and soon left her daughter. She was now satisfied that Angelina could not be persuaded nor compeled to marry the young man except upon the compliance with that condition, therefore she began to reflect how she should break the matter to her intended son-in-law.</p> 
                  <p>Some days had passed since the events recorded in the proceeding chapter occurred, but Mrs. Proudit could not prevail on her daughter to change her resolution. She had used every argument, exhausted her maternal authority, and threatened in every conceiveable form, but all to no purpose. Angelina remained firm and fixed in her resolution. No earthly power could move her. One afternoon she was quite unwell, when a ride had been contemplated, but it was not prudent for her to go, at least, she excused herself on that account. Her mother and young Montville, however, took the ride, leaving her at home. Mr. Pips happened to be passing the house as they came out and got into the carriage. Waiting a few moments until they were out of sight, he ascended the doorsteps and rang the bell. A maid servant answered the summons. Pips inquired for the daughter and requested to see her a moment. Angelina came down from her chamber and Pips handed her the letter, telling her it contained matter deeply interesting to her, and that she must keep it a profound secret from her mother, for such were the orders.</p> 
                  <p>Pips withdrew, and, trembling and agitated, the young mother sought her chamber. Some time elapsed ere she could summon strength and resolution enough to break the seal. At has she did so and read as follows:</p>

                              <p>"Miss Proudit;-I suppose you know not that your child still lives, but she does live and has become a beautiful girl. The writer of this is her father, whom you once knew too well. Your child has remained in the country ever since its birth until within a few months. The girl is now in the city, and may be found at the humble dwelling of Mrs. Watson. (Here the street and number were named.) The old lady takes good care of her, but the money I sent with the child will ere long be expended, and your proud mother must now provide for and take care of the child. The little girl was brought to this city a few months ago, and thrust upon me for support. My means have been very small, and a female friend and relative of mine has sent the child to Mrs. Watson, and placed her under the old lady's care. I furnished all the means I could raise, and now you must take care of her. You and your mother are rich, and I have been poor. True, I have recently married a widow of wealth and rank, but I desire not her money to be expended in the support of your child. Besides, I would not have my wife know, for worlds, that I am the father of any children. I have been in this city for a long time, but neither you nor your mother have known it. Should you see my marriage in any of the public prints, you will say nothing about it. I might have married you, if your mother had not acted such a haughty, imprudent part. Her foolish pride must have a fall. I hope you will show her this letter, for I desire to wound her feelings. She ought to suffer for the part she acted in this affair. Had I been a rich man she might have taken a different course. But it has never troubled me much. I have always said the world owed me a living I partly confess if you had been a poor girl, I should never have made to you such professions of attachment. Tell your proud mother I am married to a woman more wealthy than she is, and that I ask no favors of her. Tell her to open her miserly heart and take care of her grand daughter. I should have more feeling for the child if she had not some of your mother's blood running in her veins. That circumstance nearly, if not quite, destroys all natural affection. I hate your mother worse than poison. I despise her mean, proud, haughty soul. The little girl is called very handsome, and why should'nt she be, when she has such a handsome father? By calling on Mrs. Watson, you can see your daughter at any time.</p>

                  <p>The letter fell from her hand twice before she could finish the reading, and after she had finished it, she threw herself upon the bed and wept bitterly. Soon she arose and read it through a second time, but she could not discover in a single line, a particle of a father's love for his own offspring, nor any fond remembrance of her. Up to that moment, she had always believed that the father of her child did really and sincerely love her, but now she was convinced that he was a heartless villain. A change came suddenly over her, and she despised the man who could write such an unfeeling letter, but the love of her child and her desire to see it increased. Most seriously did she debate in her own mind, whether it was best to show her mother the letter or not. Her final resolve was first to see her little daughter, but she dared not go that afternoon, even if her health were good, for she feared her mother might return ere she could. It is in vain to attempt to describe that young mother's emotions on that occasion. It was fortunate that her mother took a long ride, and did not return before she had had some time to calm her mind and prepare to meet her and Montville. At last they returned and she remained in her chamber. Her mother came up and requested her to go down and entertain her lover, but she declined, saying she did not feel so well as she did in the early part of the afternoon. And she told the truth, but her mother knew not the cause.</p> 
                  <p>"If you do not grant a kind mother's wishes, and marry Mr. Montville without insisting upon that silly condition, I shall be compelled to tell him all ere long." said Mrs. Proudit. "And can you, Angelina, compel me to humble my pride so much as to make such a confession? Do you wish me to bring such disgrace and shame upon myself? You must be an unfeeling daughter, thus to torment your mother."</p> 
                  <p>O, mother, how often have I told you that no earthly power can change my determination! If it were God's will I had rather the than marry him under any circumstances."</p> 
                  <p>"I understand you," exclaimed her mother, in angry tones. "You believe he will not consent to wed you, if the whole truth is told him!"</p> 
                  <p>"I hope he will not," replied Angelina. "But I have promised, and that promise I will keep. Would to Heaven I could take that promise back, for I fear the simple hearted man is willing to become my husband in any case. And strange that he can be thus willing, when I have shown by words and actions that I do not love him. It is you, mother, who have brought me to this crisis."</p> 
                  <p>"I leave you to your own foolish thoughts, but ere another week passes, I will tell him your peculiar situation, and no doubt he will still desire to make you his wife," said her mother, leaving the room and going to the parlor where he was anxiously waiting to see his beloved Angelina. She told him that her daughter was quite unwell and not in a situation to see company that day. He expressed great regret, but still remained awhile longer, and then took his leave.</p> 
                  <p>We must now look after Major Lenox, who left the dinner party at Mrs. Barlow's under such discouraging circumstances. He found his way to his boarding house which was not of the first class, and sought his very limited apartment, upon the ordinary furniture of which he gazed with feelings better imagined than described. He contrasted his own narrow room and its mean appointments, with the splendid parlor and costly furniture he had a short time since hoped to possess and enjoy.</p> 
                  <p>"What a cursed unfortunate meeting I have had to-day!" he said, as he sat down in his wooden seated chair, and placed his feet upon the wall as high as his head, a position which he often assumed when reflecting on the past, or casting his thoughts forward into the future. "How in God's name happened that woman and her daughter to come out of the wilderness and meet me just at this time? It seems as if the devil was in my luck! What an ass Tom Pips is to go cruising about rivers and lakes and hunting up illegitimate daughters and loving them too! Would to God he had tarried on his <choice>

                     </choice> grounds a few weeks longer until I could have called the widow Barlow and her estate my own! I'm a ruined man! My pockets are empty and my credit and reputation are gone! There is but one of two things for me now. Pips will marry my daughter, and I can seem to be penitent and offer to marry her mother if she consents. Tom will furnish me with funds, for he has enough for all of us. Although she did not act much like a lover a short time since, yet I may succeed in re-kindling the old flame which once burned so brightly in her fond heart. Forgiveness and pardon ought to follow repentance, and I can appear like a true penitent easy enough. By heavens I'll try that herb, and if it does not effect a cure I can kill myself! Why should I new wish to live longer under my present circumstances? I can't work, and I am ashamed to beg. Poverty is staring me in the face, and I feel its cold, pinching hand upon me. Curse the world! Something must be done, for I cannot live longer in this way!"</p> 
                  <p>After thus soliloquizing, he threw himself upon his narrow bed and slept from mere exhaustion of his powers. The major was a miserable man indeed. A few days passed ever he could summon resolution enough to carry his plans into execution. Finally, one evening after sunset he repaired to Mrs. Watson's, where he found Pips, Sarah, her mother, little Jenny and the old lady. It was an exceedingly happy group. They were conversing about little Jenny's mother, and wondering why she had not been to see her child, but Mr. Pips told them she was obliged to take some opportunity when her proud mother was absent from home. They were greatly surprised to see Major Lenox enter, but he came in a very humble and penitent manner. Mr. Pips bid him welcome, but not one of the others uttered a word.</p> 
                  <p>"It may, and no doubt does, surprise you to see me here" said Lenox, in a subdued tone of voice and humble manner. "But I come to make humble confession of all my sins. I have done wrong, very wrong!" Here <unclear>his voice</unclear> faltered, and the tears were forced into his eyes. Pointing to Sarah, he continued. "That lovely, innocent girl I desire to own as my daughter. I can no longer repress a father's feelings and a father's love. There is a power within that bids me own and love my daughter Before heaven, and in presence of you all, I now do so! And to her good mother I feel such emotions as no tongue can express! I did love you with my whole heart once, but the corruptions of the army and the temptations of the world led me astray from the path of virtue and of honor. A few short weeks after you left me and went I knew not where, that love returned upon me, and I wept bitterly on account of your absence. I made many inquires, but could not hear a word from you. I feared you and the child were dead, and O, what days of sorrow and nights I passed! I could not keep you out of my mind for years afterwards. Even long after the war was ended, my heart was sad and sorrowful. Time, the great easer of many human ills, gradually reconciled me to my fate, yet occasionally your image and that of my daughter would appear before me. I tried to drive you from my mind but I could not. Since I met you at Mrs. Barlow's, the love I once bore you has been re-kindled in my heart, and Heaven knows how much I desire to atone for my past transgressions! I now offer you my hand and my heart, the only atonement in my power to make. I would say more, but I am so overcome by my own emotions, that I cannot speak at present. Do pardon and forgive me, and let me die in peace!"</p> 
                  <p>He sank into a chair, and burying his face in his hands, sobbed like a child. He acted his part well, and Sarah's dark eyes were filled with tears. But her mother could not be so easily wrought upon. She had doubts, serious doubts, of his sincerity. Mr. Pips hardly knew what to think. His heart was naturally tender, and his sympathies were easily excited. He saw the tears in his own beloved Sarah's eyes, and his own became watery. There was a profound silence for some minutes. At last Sarah's mother broke it.</p> 
                  <p>"I am always ready to pardon and forgive every one who sincerely repents of the wrongs they have done," she said. "But I have no confidence in your sincerity. Listen, and hide your face deeper in your hands. Did you not persist in denying all knowledge of me at Mrs. Barlow's when you knew you were basely lying?"</p> 
                  <p>"I acknowledge all, but I was so much surprised I hardly knew what I did say," he replied. "At first I thought it was best for me to deny all, but O, God, how deeply have I repented of that! Forsaking you in early life, or rather treating you so shamefully that you forsook me, and denying I knew you at Mrs. Barlow's, are the two great sins of my life. I may safely say, my only sins!"</p> 
                  <p>"There may be other women now living who could bear swift witness against you," she said. "Major Lenox you are a vile, wicked man, and my heart despises you."</p> 
                  <p>"O, mother, do forgive him and let him go!" exclaimed Sarah, in a trembling voice.</p> 
                  <p>The door bell now rang, and Angelina <unclear>Proudit</unclear> entered in great agitation. She did not seem to notice any one in the room but little Jenny. Exclaiming, "My child! my child!" she rushed towards the little girl and folded her to her bosom. "Here's my little girl, is she not?" she continued, covering Jenny's face with kisses.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose she is," answered Mr. Pips. "She is the girl who was left here."</p> 
                  <p>"I know she is, for she has appeared to me in my dreams!" cried the young mother, whose eyes now fell on Major Lenox. "Gracious God!" she continued, "Dost thou sit there wretched man? Didst thou come to carry away my child? O, don't let him, for Heaven's sake!"</p> 
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed Sarah's mother. "Has he any right to take her away?"</p> 
                  <p>"He is her father!" exclaimed the young mother, pressing the little girl still closer to her bosom. "Don't let him carry her away!"</p> 
                  <p>"One more sin to be added to the other two, vile man!" said Sarah's mother.</p> 
                  <p>The Major trembled like leaves shaken by the rough winds of autumn. Several times he attempted to speak, but the words stuck in his throat, and the sweat stood in big drops upon his brow. Never before had he experienced such agony. His last hope had fled, and the night of despair settled upon his soul.</p> 
                  <p>"How came this woman to know her child was here?" asked Lenox, in a voice of agony, addressing<pb n="88-89 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6823-00000045"/> Mrs. Watson. "Why didst thou not keep thy promise and not break the seal of the package until you were duly authorized?"</p> 
                  <p>"I did receive a letter through the post office, authorizing me to break the seal," replied Mrs. Watson, running to her bureau and bringing him the letter.</p> 
                  <p>"The letter is a forgery!" he exclaimed. "My own friends have betrayed me!"</p> 
                  <p>At that moment Elizabeth Murdock entered the room. She was thunderstruck.</p> 
                  <p>"Wretch!" exclaimed the major, addressing Miss Murdock. "You and Jane Danforth have deceived me. You have written this letter!"</p> 
                  <p>"'Tis false!" replied Miss Murdock. "We knew not that such a letter was written. I only called at the request of Jane to know how Jenny was getting along!"</p> 
                  <p>"Then you, sir, have done it!" said the Major, addressing Pips.</p> 
                  <p>"That is false, too," replied Pips. "The penny postman brought the letter here from the Post-office, and by the request of Mrs. Watson, I delivered the endorsed package to the girl, who is now here to accuse you of the wrongs you have committed. Your character is perfectly well established now, and I fear you are too old and hardened to reform."</p> 
                  <p>"You have all conspired against me!" exclaimed Lenox. "The world has conspired against me, and I'll leave it soon."</p> 
                  <p>"You have conspired against the world!" replied Pips. "Years have I suspected you, but not having proof of your guilt, I have not accused you, and I'm now sorry to say that I have kept your acquaintance."</p> 
                  <p>Again the door bell rang, and Angelina's mother entered in great haste in search of her daughter. When Angelina left the house, her mother had gone to an evening party, but just as she arrived at the house, the lady giving the party, was taken suddenly ill and the guests retired. Unfortunately, in her hurry and agitation to see her child, Angelina had left her letter on the table in her room, and neglected to look it up. Her mother found she was gone, and at the same moment happened to see the letter which she eagerly read, and immediately started for Mrs. Watson's.</p> 
                  <p>"And Satan come also," growled the Major, clenching his hands and grinding his teeth, as Mrs. Proudit entered the room.</p> 
                  <p>"A way monster!" exclaimed Mrs. Proudit, rushing by the Major towards her daughter, who was still embracing her child. "Why Angelina, you must go home immediately, why are you here!"</p> 
                  <p>"My child, my own dear child!" exclaimed Angelina, kissing Jenny, and gazing wildly upon her mother.</p> 
                  <p>"They have deceived you Angelina!" replied the mother. "That girl is not your child."</p> 
                  <p>"It is her child, proud, haughty, heartless woman!" said Lenox, breathing hard, and feeling the dark and damming spirit of the murderer agitating his soul. "It is her child, I am its father, and thou art its grandmother, old bag! Thy pride has met a fall, and I rejoice at it."</p> 
                  <p>"Away monster!" exclaimed Mrs. Proudit. "Turn out the vile monster, whose very touch is poison. Come, Angelina, you must come home immediately. You must not stay here, the child is not yours!"</p> 
                  <p>"I swear it is, before heaven and earth!" shouted the Major in a voice as if he were giving the word of command to a regiment of soldiers.</p> 
                  <p>"Thou liest, base deceiver!" replied Mrs. Proudit, pulling her daughter by the shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"That voice!" exclaimed Sarah's mother. "Its sounds are familiar! Gracious God! No! I am mistaken! I thought it was the voice of -" Here the sentence broke off.</p> 
                  <p>"The voice of your proud, haughty sister!" said the Major. "Woman! thy first impression was right. It is the voice of your own sister. I know her but too well!"</p> 
                  <p>"It is my sister!" exclaimed Sarah's mother, rushing towards the proud woman.</p> 
                  <p>"It is, but she is too haughty to acknowledge here!" said the Major suddenly advancing towards Mrs. Proudit, and plunging a dagger into her heart.</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Proudit fell dead upon the floor, and the murderer rushed from the room and made his escape, while the others were shrieking and fainting, at the horrible tragedy.</p> 
                  <p>Soon some watchmen entered, and again returned to the street, in pursuit of him who had perpetrated the foul deed, but he was nowhere to be found. The tragical scene, and the emotions it excited, we will not attempt to describe. Major Lenox had uttered some truths previous to destroying the life of the woman he hated so much. Mrs. Proudit was the sister of Miss Searsmont, Sarah's mother, and Sarah and little Jenny were half sisters, both being the daughters of the unfortunate Major Lenox, and the mother of the former being the aunt of the latter, and the mother of the latter the niece of the former. It must be confessed that the Angler had a very interesting family upon his hands, and that he had caught such fish as he little dreamed of.</p> 
                  <p>Edward Montville received his walking papers from Angelina Proudit, and returned to the South, a single and sorely afflicted man. Miss Proudit came into possession of a large estate, took little Jenny under her care and protected and educated her in the best manner possible. She had many offers of marriage, from fortune hunters and from more worthy and respectable classes, but she rejected them all and lived an unmarried woman, beloved and esteemed by all who knew her. Little Jenny became the belle of the city, and the "observed of all observers," but she refused all offers of marriage while her mother lived. In due time Mr. Pips became the husband of the beautiful and lovely daughter of the forest. He supported Mrs. Watson during her life, and Angelina Proudit most cheerfully received into her house, Sarah's mother, and supported her in elegant style. Poor Tabitha Spiker never recovered from her brain fever, but went down to the grave, a victim to her own false theories. Mrs. Barlow would not marry, but lived a dashing fashionable widow, proving to the world that there was one widow who could not be made the victim of second love. Jemmy McCrate still continued to fill his office as coachman of Mrs Barlow. He also filled another and more agreeable office, that of husband of the shrewd and intelligent Scotch girl, Mary Campbell. Theodore Holden and Jane Danforth sustained the endearing relation of husband and wife, but the proud, unforgiving, intellectual Elizabeth Murdock, utterly refused to become the life-partner of any living man. She gave up her profession and became an authoress of some celebrity, but she never entertained a very high respect for printers. Miss Proudit made her a very valuable present for the part she had acted in relation to little Jenny, but Jane Danforth utterly refused to accept any thing from the same source, for she desired no gift which might serve as a <choice>

                        <corr>memento</corr>
                     </choice> of her deeds. Two days after Major Lenox took the life of Mrs. Proudit, his dead body was found washed upon the bank of the North River, into which he had plunged and destroyed his own existence, an end of a wicked life, which may serve as a warning to all libertines. Three years after the marriage of the Angler with the Forest Girl, Sabattus and his young and beautiful Indian wife called upon him. He was at the moment dandling upon his knee, a lovely daughter, two years of age. Mr. Pips gave Sabattus one hundred dollars in silver and Mrs. Pips presented the young Indian's wife with many valuable articles. The interview was a happy and an interesting one to all, but it did not end in the city. Pips and his wife accompanied the Indians to Paulo's grave, carrying with them a marble slab to mark the spot where the body of the good old Indian rested. Upon this gravestone were inscribed the following words:-"Paulo the Good, who obeyed the Law the Great Spirit wrote upon his heart and died a pure christian."</p>

                  <item>ADAM GRAEME, OF MOSSGRAY. 12mo. Cloth, Price $1.00. The characters are painted in bold relief, and seem to live, move, and speak before you. Not one is overdrawn, and yet each comes up to the popular standard, in point of interest, individualization, and spirit. The tale is, indeed, "sad, high, and working; full of state and woe;" but it is pleasant enough for all that, and the sober, truthful earnestness with which it is related, will at once communicate itself to the mind of the most fastidious and hypercritical peruser of modern volumes.</item> 
                  <item>MAGDALEN HEPBURN; A STORY OF THE SCOTTISH REFORMATION. By Mrs. Oliphant, Author of "Zaidee," etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.00. This charming Novel, by the author of "Zaidee," will be welcomed by all who have had the pleasure of reading the former production. The quaint originality, the healthy and cheerful religious tone, and charming simplicity and good sense of this volume, will render it a general and permanent favorite,-a work which will be read as long as any volume of our time. We know of no fiction, in fact, that we would sooner recommend; for, while it will fascinate all who merely read for amusement, it will delight as well as improve those who seek for something even in a novel. It is fascinating from beginning to ending, and no reader will lay it down, after perusal, without wishing the author had extended its pages.</item>

The object of "Tit for Tat" is eminently humane, patriotic, and just. It is not anti-north, or anti-south. It is simply a reply to the exaggerated pictures of slavery in "Uncle Tom," and "Dred." It proves that worse slavery exists in Europe than any to be found in the United States. But the manner of our author is different. Her pen was not dipped in gall; it was not corroded with the acid of spleen or prejudice. Every line breathes candor; every chapter teaches a lesson. There is no vulgar abuse; but a series of plain facts, verified by authentic documents, or which is woven a romance of stirring power and dramatic interest.</item> 
                  <item>THE ARTIST'S BRIDE; OR, THE PAWNBROKER'S HEIR. A Novel, by Emerson Bennett. 12mo. Cloth. 420 pages. Price $1.00. Emerson Bennett had never written his many delightful and thrilling stories of border life of prairie scenes, and Indian warfare, this new story of "The Artist's Bride," would have placed his name on the record as one of the best of American novelists. "The Artist's Bride' is one of the most thrilling native productions we have ever read, and yet the incidents are so true to nature, so life-like, that the reader can scarcely realize the fast that he is reading fiction. The sketches of the "Brilliant Heiress," and of the interview between the Lawyer and his Student, possess the most absorbing interest. The persons introduced in this narrative are striking and never to-be-forgotten types of individuals we meet with daily. The amusement to be gathered from these pages, is as great as is the moral information bestowed Altogether, Emerson Bennett has done himself infinite merit by this production.</item> 
                  <item>THE PILGRIMS OF WALSINGHAM. A Romance of the Middle Ages, from the accomplished pen of Agnes Strickland. Large 12mo. 460 pages. $1.00. Truly a charming book!

                  <item>THE PIRATE CHIEF; OR, THE CUTTER OF THE OCEAN. By the author of "Josephine," "The Dancing Feather," "Pirate of the Shoals." Price 25 cents. This book may be dignified by the title of History of the Seas, rather than what we know to be the usual run of pirate stories. It possesses the nautical eloquence of Fenimore Cooper, and, in our opinion, it is not inferior in point of graphic effect to the best efforts of that master hand. Marryatt would have to look sharply to his laurels had the writer of "The Pirate Chief" loomed in the horizon during the lifetime of the versatile Post-Captain.</item>

His plots never outrage probability, the characters are nobly drawn, and his familiarity with the "times that tried men's souls" enables him to introduce in his works many episodes of the adventures and thrilling danger which so often beset our forefathers in that perilous period.

               <p>12MO., CLOTH, WITH GILT SIDE STAMP; PRICE 50 CENTS.</p> 
               <p>Within a year or two the Aquarium has risen into such popularity that a parlor or conservatory, or family sitting room seems imperfect, that is not supplied with one of these curiosities. The object of this volume is to enable every family to supply itself in the most satisfactory yet economical manner. The work is written in the plainest and most intelligible, as well as graceful English, and withal in a sprightly spirit, that commends itself to every taste, and robs it, even in its more didatic part, of all dullness. With its aid, a family, whether living far from the seaboard, or in a maritime city, may construct an Aquarium for itself, fit it up to suit its own ideas of beauty, stock it with living plants and animals from the nearest stream, (having here the amplest instructions on the subject,) and preserve it for many years in the most admirable condition. This book, it is well for us to observe, is not a mere reprint of the English works on the subject, which, of course, are only suited to Great Britain, and apply only to fish and marine plants abundant in that meridian. On the contrary, <hi rend="i"/>it is a completely original production, from the pen of a practical man. Mr. H. D. BUTLER, one of the proprietors of Barnum's Museum, and the gentleman whose exclusive attention has been for a long time devoted to the inimitable and superb Aquaria at that establishment. It is thoroughly local, therefore, in all its characteristics. It describes all the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">materiel</foreign> of the Aquarium with a familiarity that none but an expert could venture upon, and it refers to the places in this country where the living population of the tank may be secured with a minuteness of detail that is eminently useful.</p>

By these recipes the French Liquor Dealers have been enabled to supply the great and increasing demand for Brandy, and to give an article in every respect as whole some and as pure as the original Brandy itself, and so perfect are these Bordeaux imitations that their detection is utterly impossible by any test chemical or otherwise. With this book in his hand, any dealer can manufacture his own liquors, at a saving of from 500 to 600 <unclear/> cent., with little trouble, and in such a way that he would not hesitate to drink them himself.</p>
