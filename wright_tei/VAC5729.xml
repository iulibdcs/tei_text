            <head>PUBLISHER'S NOTE.</head>
            <p>The orthographical eccentricities exhibited in the following letters, including the
               variety of ways in which the same words are spelled in different parts of the
               correspondence, show that the writer was guided by no fixed rules of his own in his
               extraordinary (and it may be added unconscious) departures from the dicta of the
               dictionaries.</p>
            <p>The world has been laughing for years at the queer spelling and quaint phraseology of
               the DISBANDED VOLUNTEER; but, underlying all this, shrewd, homely philosophy, and
               biting sarcasm, constitute the chief merit of his letters. Some of them seem almost
               prescient when read by the light of events that have occurred since they first
               appeared in print.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>The friends that hes overperswaded me to hev the ensooin littery perduckshins bound
               up in buck form for the bennyfit of our common kentry, insists on my ritin a Preeface
               to them; and the publisher, who is naturally ankshus that the wurk should be
               proffertable to hisself, as well as to sosity, hes reckwested me to interdose it with
               a serious of prelimendary remarks, in my best vain. Heving allus ben uste to rite
               onpremeditated, on the subjestin of the moment, Ime rayther afeard that in attemptin
               to spred myself, I shall run sum risk of a kullaps. I hev knowd setch misfortens
               happen to men of the most brilyant genus, when they tried to sore beyant the lenth of
               nater's tether.</p>
            <p>Howsever, I shell do my best. Webster's Dickshinary—a vollum witch I hev sairtched
               and studded more keerfully than enny uther publicashin goin, eggsept the
               skripters—ses the objeck of a Preeface is to state the mane desine of the wurk. Ef I
               am not mistaken in the vews of my publisher, the mane desine of this wurk is to make
               munny. Leastways, that's <emph>his</emph> desine.</p>
            <p>But the orther, I am proud to say, is indooced to cast the follerin lines afore the
               wurld by a hyer porpus. My life, as the kentry is awar, hes ben full of wunderful
               vississytoods, from the time I was Disbanded, arter the Mexican war, to the present
               crysis. First I made my pile in the airly days of Californy, shuvellin up gold amung
               the Digger Injens; then I pardizzypated in the revolushinary moovements in Payris;
               arterwards I figgered around a wile in London; next I visited Constantinopul, and
               took sarvis with the late Grand Senior, Addle-Mushed, onder whose banner I fit in the
               Crymean war; subsekwently I emmygrated to Australy, and made considabul addishins to
               my pile from its oderiferous deposits; later I tuck up my abode in New York, and
               familiarised myself with the manners and customs of its eggstrodinary popalashin;
               still later I went on an<pb n="6-7 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC5729-00000004"/>
               eggscursion to Springfield, Illanoy, and finally I brort up at Washington, whar I
               hang out at present.</p>
            <p>The happyest event in my life occurd at Springfield, Illanoy. Thar I found a frend of
               the tallest kind. Need I say that frend was ABRAHAM LINCOLN. That poplar Idle hed
               jest ben chosen President by the vice of the peeple. From that hour we hev ben wun
               and insuperable. He hes ben my Valentine and I hev ben his Arson. Demon and Pithyass
               was not more affeckshinately united. I accumpaned him to the Capitol and hev ben his
               confidenshal adviser ever senst he assoomed the rains of pour and began to shower the
               blessins of good guverment upon this faverd land. I never flatterd him, and he nose
               it. Jelus Constitooshinal Advisers hev endevored to make breeches atwixt us, but it
               warnt in thar boots to do it. We hev hed our tiffs, and I hev sumtimes spoken my mind
               about him in my curryspondence, with a straitforrardness that would hev subjeckted
               ennyboddy else to a <emph>letter de catch it</emph>, and a melankoly emprisonment in
               Fort Laugheryet. "But no," sed his Eggsellency, "he means well, and I won't hev him
               mislested."</p>
            <p>I hev called this vollum "The War Letters of a Disbanded Volunteer", bekase the most
               of the epistols hes ben written senst the war commenst, tho it will be seen that they
               begin inmediently arter the eleckshin of my illustrus frend. The reader will notis
               thars a brake in the curryspondence. It stops at April 4, 1861, and runs on agen from
               July 4 of the same year. Doorin the hihaters I was engaged in activ pershoots, and
               hed no time for letteratoor. But the moment it was possabul I returnt to Abraham, who
               tuck me back with rapter to his bizness and buzzum. In conclushin, I would say that
               my idee in publershin the letters in a collected form is, to place the karrickter and
               services of that Destingwished Statesman in thar troo light afore my kentrymen, with
               a vew to biass and inflewence thar feelins and judgments, when they go to the poles,
               in November next.</p>

                     accompany the President-elect to the District of Columbia. The P. E. will find
                     the D. V. a safe man, and the more frequently he consults him after arriving in
                     the D. C., the better for the U. S. As the D. V. will probably correspond with
                     the S. T. from Washington, and as the former is probably hand-in-glove with A.

                  shine, and things he woodent open his hed about to Thirlo Weed is freely disgust
                  atween us. Ses he to me, the other day, "D. V."—that's his koncise way of

               <p>"Abe," I respondid, "you tork like a statesman, and wot's better, like a United
                  Statesman. The friends of Union look up to you. Thar cry is cumprommis."</p>
               <p>"Yas," ses he; "it's all very well to say cumprommis, but wot am I to promis?
                  That's whar the wedge binds. Here's all the ultree-black republicans threttenin me
                  with a gorilla warfare ef I suckum to the South, and the South threttenin to jerk
                  the presidenshil cheer from onder me onless I put it on thar platform."</p>
               <p>"Lincoln," ses I, "the oney chanst for you is a middle curse—the <foreign>just

                  on Caribadibs, but put your helium amidships, and drop a little goos-greece on the

                  naterally hard phizmahogany, the old feller exclaimed, "Youre rite, D. V. I feel
                  youre rite—I feel it here," continued he, smitin his westcut; "but ef I foller
                  your advice and my own inklingashins, I shall be stickmatised as a doeface by all
                  deer frends as wants me to take the bull by the horns."</p>
               <p>"Not a bit of it," ses I—"thar bound to sale in your bote ennyhow, bein as

               <p>He studdies the Constitooshin aciduously, but hesent yet made up his mind what

                     Star of the West, who is so soon to illuminate the national horizon. Mr.
                     Lincoln cannot do better than cultivate the acquaintance of that eccentric man,

                     reliable than his orthography, and who can read human nature like a book,
                     although he makes wild work with the grammar and dictionary. It gives us
                     pleasure to learn that the President-elect keeps a stiff upper lip, in spite of
                     the portentous fog that lowers around him, but which we sincerely hope he will
                     see through. There is nothing like a cheerful frame of mind in the midst of

               <p>I spose youve heern that the incummin presidenshil incumberant puts out from this
                  place on Monday next, to take the eggsecative cheer at the sete of guvment. Not
                  apprehendin ennything serious in Merryland, he refuses a milentary escort from his
                  sucker and hoosyour frends. He will travil as ushil by rail, and with no other
                  defensiv weeping but a maul and a wood ax. It is understood that sartain paytryots
                  as desines to sarve their kentry under his patternage, and tharfor naterally takes
                  an interest in the sekurity of thar princypal, hes sent him a shirt of male; but
                  bein a man of irun nerves and full of grit, he declines the addishin to his
                  wardrub, and will ware cotton next his skin, in complyment to the leadin staypull
                  of the South. Ankshus to identify hisself with the intrests of that rejin, he hes
                  put hisself on a strict regiment of South Caroliny rice and Louseanna lasses, and
                  is larnin to combust the Weed, in order to smoak the pipe of peace with Old
                  Virginny.</p>
               <p>The post offices here doos a lively bizness on old Abe's ackount. Rite in the
                  center of the eddifiz stands what is none as the Lincoln Letter Bin. It is about
                  twiste the bigness of an ornary hog troft, and six sorten fellers is continally
                  pitchin inter it nite and day. Mebbe it mought be discurridging to sum of the
                  orthurs of the missifs to no wot becums of thar stashinary—but I forbare. Suffisit
                  to remark that the lines doosent allus fall in plesent places. Being as frendly
                  with the President eleck as Demon and Pythiass, in the play, he sends me about
                  hafe a bushil of letters every mornin, and I larf tell I cry as I run my eyes over
                  em. If, as Douglas remarkt to his mother arter the peepul squelched him, "the post
                  of honor is the private's stashing," Abe's flatterers and parricides doosent see
                  it, for they all go in for being public ossifurs. Frinstince, all the littery
                  fellers as got out Lincoln Lives—and thars more of em than ever a cat had—wants to
                  be remunnyrated for thar talons outer the nayshunal puss. Over a hundred eddyturs
                  claims to hev ben the fust to hyst the Lincoln banner, and to hev waived it throo
                  the canvass and sported it at the poles with unflaggin zeal. Uppards of a thousand
                  Wide Awakes in New York and Philadelphy rekwires a fittin recompence for thar
                  onsleepin vigelense, and ninety Lincoln Minnit Men in Boston hes petishined to be
                  made night watches. Evry male delivery brings scores of solicitashins for
                  first-class births, and ef hafe the demands for guvment pap was complide with, the
                  treshury woodent be long in a solvent state. You'd be rayther tuck aback to see
                  sum of the dockaments from the big bugs of the party, full of the contemptablest
                  kinder inderogatories, and meener by chorks than enny beggin letter as was ever
                  handed to you by a travelin mendacant. Sum fokes as is cunsidered high-minded
                  statesmen by the No-Nothins, would be cut down suddently, and nuthin shorter, ef
                  the nature of thar aspirashins was genally none. I name no names, but its lucky
                  for sartin parties that Old Abe turned the manyscrips over to an onabull man.</p>
               <p>The incummin eggseckativ, altho aperiently firm, is of a comic nater and fond of a
                  joak. Sum considder him stiff and lofty, but he hes no objeckshin to unbend when
                  he sits down for a soshil evenin with a frend. Oridgenal cannondrums is his fort.
                  Ses he to me the other night, as we was takin our old rye together—he drinks rye
                  coffy and me rye whisky—"D. V.," ses he, "why is the hed <emph>of</emph> the
                  nashin like no uther hed in the nashin?" I tride to wurk it, but it was nogo, so I
                  gin it up. "Why, you donkey," ses he, "bekase he goes in for four 'ears." Purty
                  smart that, Warn't it now? I told him so, and by way of keepin up the fire, axed
                  him why he was like Robin Hood's coat. He caved in on that, and I explaned that he
                  was like Robin Hood's coat bekase he was Lincoln green. He sed he couldent see
                  that or enny other man. Arter mewsing awhile, he inkwired if I could inform him
                  how he made his way to distinkshin. I replide, "Prehaps by chanst." "No," ses he,
                  with a smild that shode his opin countenance to grate advantidge; "I axed it." And
                  then he larfed till I thort he'd split. Rekiverin hisself, he told me he'd got a
                  fust chop riddle in his hed for Bucannon, and<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000009"/> he ment to let him hev it on the steps of the
                  Capitol, jest before he swore in. "Spit it out," ses I. "Here goes," ses he, and
                  deconed it out as rollers: "Why is Abraham Lincoln likely to be a silent
                  president?"</p>
               <p>"Do you think Old Buck'll give that up?" ses he.</p>
               <p>"Ef he gesses it," I ansered, "his organ of farseeshusness is bigger'n mine."</p>
               <p>"Wall," he broke in, "I'll tell you why Abraham Linkin is likely to be a silent
                  president: it's bekase he intends to avide openin his mouth onnessarily, for feer
                  he should put his foot in it."</p>
               <p>Whool say the old rail-splitter is a fool arter that?</p>
               <p>I bleeve I menshend in my last that the venabull flat boteman hed invited me to

                  to spend a soshil hour with him aloan. I seen humor in his eye when I entered his

               <p>He kinder winshed at that, but immediently responded: "Bekase its a bore;" and I
                  dessay he gin utterance to the feelings of his hart, for he's orfully eggsersized

               <p>When I rit last, little did I andizzypate that the grate timber splitter would nex

                  but bein ahed of time could prevent his bein launshed inter etarnity. Mind, I dont
                  say as his magnannymouse sperrit was decomposed by the prospeck of his own

                  the cunspurracy was a fish story, and that he fled from a shadder. The 'mount of
                  it is, that sartain dimmycrats in Bawltomore—partickler friends of old Buck—wanted
                  to run a saw on the railocrats, so they coined this bit of bogus jest to put

                  couldent hardly speak for gulpin and sobbin, and the hull burdin of thar cries
                  was—"Oh!-Oh!-Oh!-he'll be ass-ass-ass-ass sass-inated!"Never heerd setch an

               <p>"D. V." ses he, in a horse whisper—for his vice was husky with emoshin—"D. V., why

                     and poling broadhorns may be considered light and pleasant recreations in
                     comparison with the mental anxiety and the wear and tear of temper which he is
                     fated to experience. Our correspondent's views of the inaugural are not those

               <p>Altho the inaugurole was slitely mudified arter I saw it, to sweeten the ultrees,
                  it is, upon the hull, jest as I said, a consillytory commoonycashin. The koncludin
                  sentence about "mystic cords stretchin all over this broad land," is univarsally
                  regarded as a good wind up. The young ladees, I larn, is delited with the passidge
                  whar Old Abe ses he hes "an oath registered in Heven." It puts em in mind, they
                  say, of a similar remark in "Manfriday, or the Wun-handed Munk," "The Mistress of
                  Udolpho," "The Castel Specter," and uther rumantic tradijees and
                  mellow-drammers.</p>
               <p>Sartinly thars nuthin more alarmin in the illustrus wedgedriver's inaugurole than
                  thar is in what he swore to arter he red that rigmayroll. He hed to take his Bible
                  oath to sport the laws, and that's purty mutch the hull nub of his anticedent
                  speetch. He couldent hardly be eggspected to say he intended to perjur hisself
                  with the sakrid vollum he was agoin to kiss starin him rite in the face.</p>
               <p>What'll be the end of it all the Lord abuv nose, and ime blamed sure neither the
                  fire-eaters nor the fannytix is in his confidence. Bennett may purfess to see the

                  moment. "Take your time, Miss Loocy," is the order of the day, and wot matter is

                  thousand men in Washington continally engaged in runnin him down and worryin of

                  should see the strings of fellers at the department, waitin thar turns, like

                  follered an outlyin trapper in hope to pick his bones.</p>
               <p>Old Abe is salubrus, and thars no let up to his jocular vain. The man that
                  advertises in the papers to releev persons trubbled with humors, would find him a
                  concurable case. I called on him last night at the White Hous, arter bizness
                  hours, and hevin ben in a tite place all day atween sartain Sewerdites and sartain
                  Greelyhies, he was determined to let hisself out. Enny wun can see at a glanst
                  when the old man eliqluent is chock fall of fun. On this ockashin, farseeshusness
                  was visathull in his onrestless eyes and in the quivering rinkles that played
                  about the corners of his expressiv and expansiv mouth, Shakin hisself up, and
                  flappin his elbose in the western fashin, he crode aloud as sun as I entered his
                  sanktum, and immedlently arterwtards asked me, "Why Major Anderson was like a
                  beest of burdin of the olden time?"</p>
               <p>Being taken unawars, I at wunst caved in.</p>
               <p>"Bekase, D. V.," ses, the funny old funkshinary—"Bekase he's a Sumter hoss."</p>
               <p>He expected the ushil larf, but I was in a kinder fog, and rekwested the lone of a
                  dickshunary. Thar was wun lyin on the tabel that he had used for the inaugurole,
                  and on openin it and findin the word "Sumpter," I rored rite out as in duty
                  bound.</p>
               <p>Arter a moment's brown studdy he perpoundeed the follerin:</p>
               <p>"Why am I like a fisherman?"</p>
               <p>"Mebbe," says I, "the solution is that your agoin to retake the suthern forts—with
                  a hook."</p>
               <p>"Dern the suthern forts," he exclaimed, rollin his eyes. "No," he continned, in
                  milder axents, "Ime like a fisherman bekase Ive got Bates in my cabbynet."</p>
               <p>I gin a slite catchynashin, and remarkt that he was also like a fisherman bekase
                  he was fond of a Salmon Chase.</p>
               <p>Deklining even to smile at my addishin to his joakt he perpounded thus:</p>
               <p>"Wots the difference atween me and that uther grate loomenatry, the sun?"</p>
               <p>"Well," ses I, "the sun's all light, and you look considabul like a shadder. Is
                  that it?"</p>
               <p>"Try agen," he replide, "your duller'n a stubbed broad axe."</p>
               <p>"Possably," I subjested, "this is the distinkshun—the hull kentry is benefitted by
                  the sun and it wont be by you."</p>
               <p>"Your a gopher," ses he, "and if I warnat the best naterd feller as ever made a
                  chip fly, I should be up a tree at your inyourenders. Cant you see that the
                  difference attween the sun and me is, that the sun raises in the Yeast and sets in
                  the West, and that I was raised in the West and am now a settin in the Yeast."</p>
               <p>Injenus, warn't it? But I dident see whar the larf cum in.</p>
               <p>Thinken he was rather runnin the cannondrum bizness inter the ground, I chopped
                  round and axed him wot he thort of Twiggs.</p>
               <p>"Twiggs," ses he, "if we could oney twig Twiggs, we'd make root and branch work of
                  Twiggs. But 'as the Twigg's bent so is the tree inklined,' and I spose this Twigg
                  being bent rong when green caused him to committ such tree-mend-us treeson."</p>
               <p>At this pint he stopt for breth and new idees; and thinkin it a favorabul
                  oppertoonity to git out of the woods, I made a bough, and sed with his permishin I
                  would slope. But I hed to take anuther shot, afore the grate gun of the nashin
                  would let me off.</p>
               <p>Ses he, as he shuck me by the hand, "Why am I like a man as hez dickered hisself
                  off to Abadun?" He sed this with deep feelin, the teers mountin to his eyes, and
                  immediently added, "Bekrase, D. V., I can't hardly say my soul's my own."</p>
               <p>Feelin suthin kinder risin in my throte, for I knowd how the old feller hed ben
                  badjered by the contendin factshuns, I suddently tore myself away. Old Abe's a

               <p>A negarness to save the kentry, without a president in the annuals of our
                  guverment, continnees to prevale. The presshure on the postmaster-ginral is
                  anormous. Thar's sumthin less than thirty thousand post-offisis in the United
                  States, and the number of applycants is over a hundred and fifty thousand—about
                  the sum totil of the British army to hum and abroad. Ef the guverment wanted
                  sojers, Ime dubrous wether thar'd be setch a thunderin rush of volonteers; tho I
                  persoom eenamost evry candidit for civil servus onderstands rifle practis, and
                  mite be relied on for a charge.</p>
               <p>The noosepaper fellers seem to be in good oder with the noo dienasty—I mean, in
                  coarse, that porslin as claims to be Abeites died in the wool. The eddytur of the
                  Currier and Inkwirer was delited with his prospecks, and guv a shampain supper to
                  his frends immediently arter bein confirmed for the Sublime Port. Ef Seward was
                  rayther hard on him wen Tom Marshall shot him in the leg, thar's a good
                  onderstandin atwixt em now and the old wound no longer rankles. I dar say Ginral
                  Webb would make a fust rate plenipenitentiary, bein now as grave as a Turk, and
                  past the age for harem-scarem adventers. He would find the Grand Senior,
                  Addle-Mushead, quite an agreable hethin when he's sober, witch isn't more'n hafe
                  the time, unless he follers the teetotal rule of Mayhumit closter than he did wen
                  I was in Constandinopul in 1854.</p>
               <p>I spose, by the time this letter is in prent, Major Anderson and his men will be
                  ordered outer Fort Sumter, whar, in case of a nite attack, they would hev to go it
                  blind, thar ile, camfeend, steerin candils, and lucyfurs hevin all gin out. The

                  glass, and keep wun sentinel smokin all nite for the ackomydashin of the
                  offsirs.</p>
               <p>I notis as Twigs, the traytor, deklines a post in the suthern army on ackount of

                  nater, prefers reposin on his lorils.</p>
               <p>It greaves me to an ounce that the venabul Abe hes lost sevral pounds of flesh
                  senst he becum President. He doosent cunsidder it a fat offis, by no means.
                  Mercynary pollytishins is constantly arter him with a sharp stick, bullyraggin him
                  to that degree that Ime purty shure he wishes he was back to Springfield, with his
                  markit baskit on his arm, doin the famaly chores as ushil. His face, as lucked so
                  plesent a few weeks ago, gits longer and longer evry day, like a baloon from witch
                  the gas is gradally escapin. And it is escapin. He tries to joak as formally, but
                  he finds it heavy mowin, and his sallies is frekwently interruptid with a sithe.
                  The fact is, his cabbynet is not unanymuss. It warn't never likely that Seward and
                  Chase would hitch hosses together, and I onderstand they're as much posed to wun
                  anuther, on sartain pints, as the two Ann Tipodees. They say as Chase is for

                  wile Seward goes for givin em time, in hops they'll see theyre error, and
                  acknollidge the corn.</p>
               <p>Atween the two, the venabul bed of the nashin is purty nye distracted, and ef it
                  warn't for dodging the pollytishins now and then to spend a soshil hour with a

               <p>Wakin up arter a wile, he axed me why "he was like the Ohio River in a drouth?" I
                  sed, "Mebbe bekase he was runnin emptyins." He dident take a fence at the remark,
                  but goodnaterdly told me to stop my raillery and try agin.</p>
               <p>I axed him "Was it bekase he was shallow?" At witch he smiled moanfully, and sed
                  the solushin was that he was "down in the mouth."</p>
               <p>Then we got torking about the prospecks ahed, and I inkwired ef he thort it
                  possabul to ockupy and possess, and cetery, the forts and uther guverment real

                     It is evident, from the concluding portion of the veteran's letter, that there

                     foolmen</foreign> of the <foreign>Tryboon</foreign>." Sixty thousand men hes
                  put out for Richmond. Old Blackguard Bowerygard sed our war cry was buty and
                  booty, and I rayther gess he'll be butifully booted by our gallant sojers, who air
                  all anxshus to toe the mark as sun as possabul.</p>
               <p>I hev it from a vorashus source that when alls reddy for attacting Richmound, Old
                  Chepultepeck will take the command and put the rebils throo in person. His idee is
                  to catch em in a net and give em a seckind edition of the Hauls of the

                  the seat of guverment without no seats to their pantyloons. The dinners of the
                  volunteers ginally is very ornary, and ef wun third of the army purvayors was hung
                  they would git no more'n than thar desserts. It eenamost makes my blud bile to see

               <p>Talking of female secesshinists, thar infarnal tretchery is a eawshin to Deliely.
                  They air continally goin South with Nuthern arms onderneath thar pettycoats, and
                  criminal curryspondence in thar buzzums. We oughter hev a femmynine perlece on

               <p>In coarse Napollyun hed to spit out sumthin in the way of a rejineder, so ses,

               <p>But noboddy sed Ha! Ha! in reply.</p>
               <p>All suckemstances, considered its difficult to say whether the Prence's illushin
                  to Richmound was intended as a complement or a back handed slap at the late
                  forrard movement.</p>
               <p>Ginral Scott, who sot opposit the Prence onderstood it in the latter senst, and by
                  way of givin himt wun in return, got off the follerin:</p>
               <p>"Why was your illustrus sire like Jefferson Davis?"</p>
               <p>His hynless srugged his sholders and gin it up.</p>
               <p>"Ile tell you," ses the Ginral, "why your illustrus sire was like Jefferson Davis.
                  He seceeded from the American union."</p>
               <p>The Prence fanned hisself with the dinner keard and made a horrabul grim ace, for
                  he couldent help but see as the old vetran allooded to the Patterson marridge.
                  Howsever, he sun rekivered, and evrything past off pleasantly.</p>

                  his fingers and perching it on the eend of its nose, at the samne time spittin
                  sarkasstically. Toombs immediently threw up the portfool, of his department, and
                  left the presents grumblin, Jeff raisin the toon of "Hark from the Toombs a

                  the blow shoor, it is important to keep the fo from gitting wind of it. All I ken

                  <p>Three week senst, wen all the foo-foo letter-riters allowd as Washington was in
                     immedient dannger of a salt, I pernounst it gammon. Peeple as bleves in the
                     predickshins of the speshil curryspondents here, must be at a loss for profits.
                     Thar bizness is to manfactor sensashins, and they make up thar artickles outer
                     hull cloth—breeches of truth not bein considerd of the slitest konsekens by
                     these false tail-barers. Wal, the sete of guvermnent hes not ben attracted jest
                     as I sed it wouldent. The storm hes not cum, but quiet rains. No wun can say
                     wots in the wind, but thars no simtums of hard blows at present. In the
                     meantime everyboddy is on the <foreign>key veeve</foreign> for slorter evry
                     mornin, and goes to bed, cussin thar blasted eggspecktashins at night. Ef it
                     warnt for pickit shootin and keards, the city would spile for want of
                     reckcreashin. But the milentary offsirs plays youcur and brag, wile the privit
                     sojers makes up little parties amung tharselves, to go picket huntin by
                     moonlite, and as the rebels plunges inter the latter amewsment with all the
                     ardor of thar Southern naters, sumtimes as menny as five and six centries is
                     wiped out in a single night. Both sides keeps tally of thar game, and up to the
                     present time the insirgents is five privits, three corporeals, and two sirgents
                     ahead.</p>
                  <p>The gamblin housen here is to be shet up, to prevent em from spilin the morril
                     principals of the army paymasters. Wun of these innercent but ventursum
                     critters hes ben onfortunit enuff to be bled to the toon of a hundred thousand
                     dollars, gurverment munny, at cut throat, witch Uncle Sam will rekiver about
                     the time that Faro's treshurs is fisht from the bottom of the Red Sea. The
                     misabul man axes a suspenshin of publick opinion, but I think publick opinion,
                     espeshally in the army, is rayther in favor of a suspenshin of him.</p>
                  <p>Considerin the expense, it is thort by sum hasty sperrits that the war is
                     etarnal slo, but I onderstand that arter the Nayshinal Fast, Ginral Scott
                     intends to walk inter the sassy rebels allmity rapid. In the meantime the
                     guverment is dispersin over a million a day without givin enny aperient check
                     to the moovments of the enemee. Wun thing is sartain, namely, if we dont sail
                     in purty recently, Boweryguard and Johnstun will raze a muss in Merryland. I
                     hev it froms a relieable gentleman—not the ungodly retch as tells setch
                     sickrenin sockdologers in the daylies, but a honabul highminded spy as I keep
                     for my own privit use—that the mane body of thar hoss, and the bone and sinner
                     of thar foot is on the upper Potomnac, and as sun's they ken git boats the hull
                     raft will be over. My spy, who has the onlimited confidence of all the rebel
                     leaders, ses that wile they are makin faints in frunt of our lines they

                     hoot at us, I notis. He's a feerce bird on a small skale, but his talents isent
                     sharp enuff to hurt ennyboddy, and senst he shode the white fether in turnin

                     thousand fresh troops to Canady entirelie to his letters, and intermates that

                  <p>The remark that puttin trust in prences is like leanin on a brokin reed doosent
                     seem to hold good as regards the Empror of all the Rushes. His majesty hesent

                     for sport in all our tryalls.</p>
                  <p>The Seckatry of War sod that for his part he agreed with Tolerant, the
                     sourcaustic French minister, that Hevin was on the side of them as had the most
                     cannon. It was on that ackount that Ginral Wool hed added Le Grand Cannon of
                     Runslayer county to his staff.</p>
                  <p>Ginral Scott—who was present by invitashin—srugged his sholders when the name
                     of Ginral Wool's new a decamp was menshint, and remarkt that bdin a feller of

                     to the navy.</p>
                  <p>Secktary Smith sed that the people in the Inteerior dident crave enny more
                     seventy-fours in that kwarter, but considered that Twenty-eights and
                     Thirty-twos would be much more sarvisable to the kentry. Lively craft was wot
                     was wanted for the present naval blockhed.</p>

                  <p>The conclushun cum too by the Cabbynet Counsel was that the war should be

               <p>When I subjested to the grate Wood-Cutter of the West the idea of gettin off a few

                  hedent shode the white fether wen he rooled the roost at Washington. You kin send
                  my complements with the paper—for I used to know the old critter in his better
                  daze—and say I hope he will chuckle over the joaks of his distingwished
                  suckcessor. I think the tutching illushin to his buzzum frend Floyd, kin skarsly
                  fail to gratify him. Greeley, I persoom, will coppy the pome inter the Tryboon. It

                  lies promist his shiverally to pitch inter us hot and hevvy afore the weaks out.
                  Darnstown is a villidge in Munggummery County, Merryland, about twenty-five milds
                  up the Potomac, whar they sell the meenest whiskey on God's airth and drink too
                  big horns of it to tell a strait story, so I dont place mutch reliance in enny
                  darned yarns from that kwarter, and as to Boweryguard he's too cunning a coon to
                  giv publick notis of a fite two or three days aforehand. I reckin him and Jonstun
                  is oney faintin, and doosent intend to make a serous a salt on our lines at
                  present. Howsever, ef they want to buck thar heds inter a bumblebees nest, let em
                  cum on. Evrything is fixt here to giv em a stinger as'll make em hop. I was'at

                  and they both asshoord me as Washington would be impregnabul by this time. The

               <p>So arter faintin in frunt of Washington for weeks Boweryguard has fallen back!
                  Noboddy onderstands wot this noo feter in his tracktricks means, but it looks on
                  the face of it as ef all idee of attacktin the Capital had ben gin up. My privit

                  hafe an hour, of witch I made minits for the <title>SUNDAY MERKARY</title>. I give
                  the dialog percisely as I logged it dowm.</p>
               <p>"D. V., my good frend," ses he, straitenen hisself up arter stoopen to shake hands
                  with me, "wot is your opinyun of the asspeck of affairs?"</p>
               <p>"That," I remarkt, "is rayther a ginral questin." "Yes," ses he, "it's a ginral
                  questin, but you onderstand the kernil of it; I want your vews on the war as it
                  stands."</p>
               <p>"Wal then, to speke onlest," I replide, "I think it <emph>stands</emph> too long.
                  The peeple want it pusht along to a conclushin. We air spendin sum two millyuns a
                  day, or tharabouts, and my centiments is, thars thunderin little to sho for it."
                  "My frend," says the venabul chefe, pullin a gray hare out of wun of his little
                  bushes of whisker, "the 'games afoot,' as the poick ses, but the time to 'cry
                  havoc and let loose the dogs of war' hesent cum yet. We must wait."</p>
               <p>"Very good," I responded, "but why warnt the Fort Hotterass victory follered up?
                  We was told as two more eggspedishings was to start immediently to shell sum uther
                  pints on the Suthern cost. Whar air they? Thars allus vessels of war a layin off
                  at Fortress Munro and other places whar they aint no more use then they would be

                  second edishin of the bumbardment of Fort Hotterass?"</p>
               <p>"Welles isent reddy," ses he, "besides thats not the programmy. A grand blo is to
                  be struck simontaneously by sea and land. By the way, wot do you think of
                  Welles?"</p>
               <p>"Raythec a delicut kwestin, Mr. Lincoln," I anserd, "but, howsever, the Disbanded

                  tip-top. He never cuzzined noboddy, allus paid his dets, sed his prairs nights and

                  to rend the nashin in twane, I konsider 'em nix".</p>
               <p>"You're mistaken," ses my venabul frend. "Welles is a man of amense intelleck. I
                  hed my doubts about it at fust, but Ime satisfide now that oney give him time, and
                  he'll astonish the kentry. Then thars Camerun, wot do you think of Simnon?"</p>
               <p>"Wall," ses I, "I wunst seen a play in witch thar was two carrickters they called
                  Simon Pures, and wun was a decent man, and tuther seldom wanted for ennything that
                  warnt out of his reach. Witch of the critters the

               <p>"D. V.," eggsclamed the Venabul Abe, kwite sharply, "you're remarks is

               <p>"If thats the case," ses I, for I sor he was gettin riled, and I dident want to

               <p>My confidenshil spy, a reglar Metamory of a feller, perfeckly vorashus and never
                  known to eat his own words, returnt last night from a long reckonnonsense. He was
                  kwite onsuspected and obtained no eend of noose. He peers to hev maid mennyrandoms
                  of every essensual pint as cum within the pail of his observashin. He ses the

                  ennything he ever seen in the way of peacemeal wardrubs. The suppleturn offsirs
                  was in strips and onwillin to wheel round on parade for fear of exposin the rips
                  in thar uniforms. As to the common sojers, sum of em hed muttonied and refused to

                  grain of use, they bust out immediently. Thar foot gear was ekwilly delopidated.
                  Hevin a taste for staytistrickrs he counted nineteen thousand big toes peeping
                  like terrorpis heds throo the shells of milentary boots and shoos at the Gap, and
                  about the same number at the Junkshin. In fact, the hull rebel army on the Potomac
                  is on a mity bad footin, and all efforts to remedy the evil air likely to proove
                  bootless. The oney critters among em as makes a decent sho is the field
                  offsirs—all the rest, includin even thar crack riflemen, bein as ragged as city
                  poppers.</p>
               <p>I larn also from the same sorce that the rebel army is gettin all-thunderin wurmy
                  about thar grub. The hog an homany hes purty mutch gin out; in Ann Arundel and

                  movement will cum off is not yet detarmined. Ef they dont take the back trail
                  south afore the first of November, an appeal will be made to thar feelins with
                  balls and bagnets, that will be puffectly onresistabul.</p>
               <p>Thars nuthin new in the way of gossip in these diggins. The "relicabul gentmen" as

                  The sojers went to the poles with freezin indifferents, the bands playin Hail
                  Columby as they marched to the ballad bxes, and the hull affair passed off as

                  day before yestday, was a grande specktickle. My tall and venabul frend, the
                  President, druv me to the ground with Mrs. Lincoln and yung Seward, in his new
                  bayrush, and as he stud in his carridge he was in coarse the sinecure of all eyes.
                  The manovering was elzwill to ennything I ever seen the Crymeah. Nine battrees was
                  posted on each wing of the battalion of dragons, and as the skripter ses "the
                  thunder of the captins and the shouting" was puffeckly stunnin. Ginral Maclellin
                  was delited, and Mrs. Lincoln aloud the site of so menny shinin blades made her

                  enformt was the votrees of Bellowner as flurished several sentries back. Finaly
                  the entire force formed in collume and saluted the President, arter witch the
                  artellery and cavalry was divided inter two divishins and each hafe was dismissed
                  seperitly to its kwarters. Ef the men behave as well on the battle plane as they

                     more slorterous affaree than it oughter ben. The idee of throwin oney seventeen

                     with thar rifels cockt and thar fingers on the triggers! It was the act of
                     moonymaniacs. An then to think of the offsirs takin partickler pains to march
                     thar men rite inter the middle of a six acher lot, sirounded on three sides
                     with hevvy timber swarmin with possum-playin seceshers, and a mild of rushin
                     water in the rare. Why a blind rat wouldnt hev ben cort in sech a trap. Our
                     brave fellers performt progenies of valor, but bein cumpleaty hemmed in, they
                     got, in coarse, an allmity belting I spose its no use cryin over spilt milk,

                     fifty men apeace, was sent to the resky, but they cumneer sinkin, and its a
                     mericle that the hull on em warnt plugged afore assistants reached em. At lenth
                     arter a nobul stand up fite of an hour or more our galliant boys hed to back
                     down. They broke for the river, and bein pursood by an overwelming force,
                     intosticated with victry, menny was druv inter the drink. Doorin the skrimmedge
                     more'n two hunderd of our men was hit, and a still larger number was missed
                     when the rolls was called at brekfest-time necks mornin. However the loss was
                     not all on the Union side; the Mussysippians cort it hot and hevvy, and numbers
                     of the South Carolinians fell to rice no more. Finerly Banks with five thousand
                     men and plenty of cannon crost the Rubygun the pint was gained. To-day it is

                  ses in his Revelashins as he seen Lucyfur, the Father of Lize, put in iruns for a

                  to be "loosed for a little seesin," and hev full swing at "deceeving the nashins."
                  Now Ime not supperdishus, but last Saturday night, as I laid perfoundly slumberin
                  on the sofy arter my ushil repast of fride iceters and Borebung whisky, I had a
                  very supperisin dreem. Methort the old critter's term was up and he was out on
                  firlo, disguysed as a relieabul gentleman; and was issooing instruckshins to the
                  curryspondents of the dalie press. Wotever he sed <emph>rite</emph> they

               <p>Methort the evil sperrit, with a sinstir smild on his bloo lips and a malishus
                  skwint in his wether eye, tutched the <title>Herald's</title> "Speshil" on the
                  sholder and told him to indite a full ackount of the sailin of the grate Union
                  Armady from Hamton Roads. Ses Bellsabub to the Speshil: "The informashin, my
                  frend, will be three or four days in advance of the trooth—but the
                     <title>Herald</title> is my favorite sheet, and Ime bound by a solem oath
                  registered (here he skwinted downards) in a place onmenshinabul to ears perlite,
                  to keep it in advance of everything. The curryspondent winked a cent to the order,
                  and at wunst began to skribble like a moneymaniac. Immediently arterwards I notist
                  old Meffystufferlies in conversashin with the <title>Eggspresses</title>
                  "speshil," tellin him to notify his prenciples to hum, that Ginral Scott,

                  in fack as Hale Columby; also that he wurked fourteen hours a day and was a killin
                  off all his clerks and amenuensenses to the chune of "Old Virginny never tire."
                  The curryspondent lucked kinder doubtful, but the Tempter sed with a grin, "Its

               <p>The conversashin then turned on the New York eleckshin, and he remarked that Now

               <p>"How so?" ses I, rayther riled at the insinnerashin.</p>

               <p>It was even so, Eddyturs, and I could oney hang my head in shame.</p>
               <p>We then tutched on the embargo, and I axed him wot would be the consekense ef the
                  British merchints was to send out armed ships to brake it.</p>

                  replide, with a solemn wink, that he hoped for the best, but Port Royal was a
                  place whar it wouldent be surprisen to heer of Rex. Seein he was non-cummittal in
                  regard to the Armady, I axed him what he thort of the steamer The Adorer runnin

                  like a hull jungle-full of royal Bengals on a bender. Ile do it in pen-and-ink,

                  rise boddily outer my boots like a Fenicks from its ashes. All the Unionites here
                  is as happy as coons in a cornfield; while the rebel simperthisers are so blamed
                  down in the month that the smilds they take at the bar to drownd thar sorrors
                  doosent put a mite of life inter em, and every fresh rummer as cums in cawses em
                  to groan laudably.</p>
               <p>Last night I couldent git no peace for warlike dreams. Queen Mab was with me, as
                  the play ses, and a crowd of red legs, bagnets, quarterdecks, munkey-jackets,
                  smoke-pipes, dead rebels, and cetery, illoominated with crimson fire, floted afore
                  my sleepin eyes in one bluddy phantasmagory! Drums was in my ears, and the
                  atmosfear was flagrant with sulphur. I stood on the combings of a hatchway and
                  seen the secesh vermin flyin outer Hilton's Head, as the fleet crackt away at em.
                  Then I was at "the eminent deadly breech", as the More of Venus ses, firing inter
                  thar rare. Anon I was haulin down the baby-bunting of Treason, and hysting the
                  full-grown standard of the Union in its place. Finerly, I headed a brilyant
                  cavalry charge from the forecassel of the Warbosh, throo Cumberland Gap inter
                  Kainturky, arrivin jest in time to help the galliant Nelson put the rebels throo
                  at Piketown. The yells I gin doorin this explite broke the nightmare, and I woke
                  up not a little horse, I ken asshure you.</p>
               <p>Hevent the owdashus skunks got an all-crucified belting? Didn't Dupoint make em

                  steed can overtake em in a starn chase. He ses the way they put out from the forts
                  was ekwil to Jackson the "American Deer", ef not ekwiller. He tride to fowler em
                  with his tellascope, but the pace was too all-rushin fast to keep em even for a
                  moment within the scoop of his field of vishin. Sevral of the poor devils was
                  found ded in the woods without a skratch. I axed Captain Steedman yesterday mornin
                  wot he thort they died on, and he sed galloping consumpshin.</p>

               <p>The seeser of the two rebel plenipenitentaries continnees to be the universal

                  channils, and then you'll see the grand army showin its teeth in airnest.</p>
               <p>Honest Old Abe is in closte confabulashin with Glulral Maclellin every day, and as
                  I hev the confidense of both, they sometimes permit me (arter hevin repeated the
                  oath to sport and sustain the Constitooshin and give no sucker to the enemee) to
                  take peart in thar counsultiashins.</p>
               <p>A few mornins senst I went with our poplar cheef madgistreet to call on the Ginral
                  at his head-kwarters, and a very plesent, and in fack jolly palavver we hed

                  domino, that the Evil Wun hes no right to hev all the funny games to hisself. When
                  me and the President arrove at the Ginral's house, he warn't up, hevin ben out on
                  a cruse among the rebel posts the evenin afore, besides consumin the midnight ile

                  letters. We sent up our keards by an orderly, and he brung us wurd that as sun as
                  the Ginral hed shaved, and tuck a shower bath, and hed his coffee, and red mornin
                  prayers with his milentary famaly, our case wouldc be attended to. I thort it
                  rather curus that he should keep the representative of Uncle Sam watin hafe an
                  hour in the aunty-rum, as ef he'd ben a kentry cussin, but the Presidient oney
                  larfed and sed it was Mac's way—he was a simple-minded republican, and didn't
                  stand on ceremunny with him or enny uther man.</p>
               <p>Presently the Ginral made his apperiance in his dressin gownd and slippers, and a
                  cigar in his mouth, and shuck hands with us as corjally as ef we'd both ben his
                  brothers in arms. We then sot down, and the conversashin at wunst took a gay and
                  spritely turn.</p>
               <p>"Mac," ses the President, "do you know that Seckatry Welles is a gay old boy,
                  notwithstandin his gray hairs and his grown-up famaly?"</p>
               <p>"Howd' you make that out?" replide the ginral, in his short, sharp way; "I've
                  allus onderstud he was considlerd a moddel Christian in the land of steddy
                  habits."</p>
               <p>"For all that he's a <emph>Giddy-un</emph>," rejined the wittyest of
                  wooodchoppers, smilding vialently.</p>
               <p>"Wal," ses I, wishin to let the seckatry up eesy, for he's a frend of mine, "you
                  mought jest as well hang a dorg as giv him a bad name." I sed that by way of
                  defending the absent, but I thort the President considerd the remark rayther
                     <foreign>otray</foreign>, as they say in France, altho he dident say so.</p>
               <p>We then begun to tork of the Port Rile affare, and I axed Mr. Lincoln why
                  Guverment wouldent allow Senitor Simmons, of Rhode Island, to turn a nonest penny
                  by sendin a cargo of noshins to Bufort. Quick as a wink he anserd, "that altho the
                  troops was in want of many things, it warn deemed advisabul that they should hev
                  enny <emph>per-Simmons</emph>." I judged from the reply, that mebbe the
                  spiritalist Senitor hed benl overly ankshus to repe the frutes of rebellyun. But
                  arter all, why not giv him a chanst? Ef he doosent skin the onfortnit sogers, some
                  sutlerman will.</p>
               <p>The subjeck of Bucannon's defense of hisself by Ex-Aturney Ginral Black arterwards
                  came up, and Maclellin, who is kwite a skollard, remarkt that considerin who it
                  was ritten <emph>by</emph> anc who it was ritten <emph>of</emph>, the motto
                  oughter be—from Horace—<hi rend="i"/>"nigger est." I pose its to be found

                  they was runnin a saw on old Buck, and that wast enuff for me.</p>
               <p>At this pint of the conversashin the Venabul Abe, who would rayther get off a good
                  joke than eat, enny time, inkwired of Ginral Maclellin ef he was awar that Ginral
                  Rosecrans was the gratest blackleg in the kentry. Maclellin turnt verry red, and
                  sed twarnt so, sumboddy hed ben slanderin that gallient offsir.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir," replide the President, mildly, with a sly wink of this wether eye
                  at me, "so you considder Floyd, the connon thief, a gallus scoundril?"</p>
               <p>"I do!" said the Ginral emfatically.</p>
               <p>"Wal," rejined Mr. Lincoln, "and warn't he more'n a match for Floyd on the
                     <emph>Cheat</emph>?"</p>
               <p>I thort Maclellin would hev caterpillerd. He rored tell he was black in the face,
                  and the President had to pat him on the back to bring him too.</p>
               <p>In this kinder dimond-cut-dimond small tork we wild away mebbe an hour or so. Ef
                  it warn't a "feest of resin and a flo of sole," thar never was wum. I wisht I

                  in the North, and what you say in your report about armin the niggers and settin
                  em on to mall thar masters, would oney act as a wedge to widen the fisher. You air

               <p>SIMON.—Mister President, I owe it to myself to say it kant be dun. I wont take
                  back a sillybull. Ive sent the report to the papers with orders for it to go in,
                  and tharfore it must cum out. <emph>War to the nife and the nife to the

                  tharfore IMne ankshus to hev the objeckshunabul claws struck out. It is onwurthy

                  Simon Pure regard for that high old morrill precept: "The eend sankshins the

               <p>ABE (<hi rend="i"/>in his usual sly way).—No, but bekase I shall throw you
                  overboard whenever setch a sackrifice is nessesary to asswage the storm. You would

               <p>Ime afeard the omnipleasant nigger is gone to make trubble here this winter. Thars

                  makin a milerntary cumraid and bruther of him. A sartain New England Sennytur hes
                  redooced the propersishin to black and white, and intends to interduce a
                  woolley-head Bill in the Sennit, embracin his idees. Wun thing is beyond
                  contraversy—natmely that publick opinyun here is very <foreign>vicey
                     versy</foreign>. Ef Congress passes the meshur, the President will probly cum
                  down on it with his offishal niggertive. Mutch as I admire our Afrikin friend I
                  don't think we could afford to swop the best white sojer in the Union for him, and
                  as Ginlral Maclelin would onquestenably resine ef Sambo was put in uniform, I
                  predicate we hed better let our ebony faller creturs shell corn, and our white
                  brethren with har on their heads shell the rebels. The <title>Sunday
                     Merkary</title> I bleve is slitely inklined to carry Afrikry inter the war, and
                  so far as sholderin "de shovel and de ho" to dig ditches and raze airthwurks is
                  consarned, I go in for it too; but when it cums to sholderin the musket, thars no
                  culler or resin for it, when we've got six hunderd thousand white fokes in the
                  feeld. Prehaps the best thing we ken do with our Ethiopian cussin is to wurk him
                  and pay him doorin the war, and send him whar he ken keep himself too himself
                  afterwards. Sum years ago we was goin to buy the Sandwitch Ilands. Why wouldn't
                  that be a fust rate locashin for "persons held to serve us," as the Constitooshin
                  hes it? Arter bein treated all their lives as Sons of Ham, they would in Coarse be
                  glad to be colonized among the Sandwitches.</p>
               <p>Good tidins is looked for frum the Mussysippy purty recently. The gunboat squadron
                  is now reddy, and ef the flowtiller doosent git inter a tight place, or run agen a
                  snag, the Father of Waters will sun be ourn from St. Louis to whar it debauches
                  inter the sea. The advantidge of this moovment must be a parent to all, fbr at
                  present we oney hold the river to Cairo, heving so far found it onpossabul to get

                  for a brush with the disunionists in that rejin. He's a fine man is Ginral
                  Sickles, and ef he's as mutch beloved by his sojers now as he was when on Staten
                  Iland, thar isent wun of em as wouldent cherfully fowler him to his deth.</p>
               <p>Abe and his lady is both in salubrus helth, and feel confident that the North and
                  South, will shortly lay down together as the lion and the lamb did in Pairodice,
                  afore the lamb was awar that the lion had a hanklerirn arter mutton. The venabul
                  Head of the Nashin hes been a good deal intersted in the Bible kwotashins lately
                  published in the noosepapers. He was naterally indignant to find em bogus, and
                  that he had sairtched the skripters in vain. But it warnt altogether in vain
                  nuther, for he informt me he hed drived great consolashin from the Book of Sams,
                  and speshily from Sam Forty, verse seven. On turnin to the passidge I found these
                  sole refreshin words "MANASSES IS MINE," witch I hope<pb n="94-95"

                  kommence firing texts at the Sutherners they mought giv us as good as we sent ef
                  not more so. Frinstance ses I, run your eyes over Isayer, and in wun of the
                  chapters youll diskiver the follerin sentence "<hi rend="i"/>I will say to the
                  North giv up." He peered to be rather tuck aback by the langwedge of the profit;
                  so I told him by way of a flyer that accordin to Doctor Cheever, it meant as the
                  North should giv up to the abelishinists.</p>

                  realize the hopes of thar galliant uncle the Dook of A Maul. The Prince of Sam

               <p>So the British lion's tail's a waggin, and the wun horned fablus animal as doos

                  buttin attitood and the munkey of the hull Rile menadjery is considabully up. The

                  on a streek of litenin, and looks the blazin sun right in the eye, is also
                  eggsighted—sum. But Ile bet a gold peace to a Bellona sossidge, thar wont be no

               <p>Evrybody sposed that snakin the rebel plenipenitentiaries from onder the British
                  flag would caws an angry crow from evry cockney Chapman. When the Trent reached
                  the Thames in coarse thar was an orful moovin of the waters. But tho John Bull's
                  choler was up, his best stock went down, witch shows that altho a stiff-necked

                  be an allmity big tork, but no shindy. Weve no time to tend to outside bizness
                  till the Cotton States is faxed out, and John, arter considerin the barings of the

                  the taller, and be in no hurry to pitch inter his best customer without resin. I

                  will all eend in asshoorances of the most distingwished considerashin.</p>
               <p>The thing hes got to be argufied, ennyhow. I like Wilkses grit, but ef that son of
                  Neptin went further than he'daughter, the missdeed must be disclamed and Brittania
                  mollyfied. Loose Napollyon proposes, they say, to act as abittraitor, and as he
                  wunst was a London perleeceman he aughter know how to keep the peace. Sum thinks
                  he'd be glad to jine England, ef she's inklined for a crewsaid agen us, to give
                  emplyment to his sirplush navy and divert the publick mind from hum affairs.

                  cumpany, is hung.</p>

                  oney to speak ef he wants more of the yaller stuff outer their corrupshin fund.
                  They're not without gratitood—these rebels. I hope no harm will ever happen to

               <p>I hed a long confab with Honest Old Abe yestday arter he receved the dispatches by

               <p>Then he worked away on his onfinished messidge for a wile; but held up suddently,

               <p>Sartainly we Americans air Jobs, every man of us. Sum few may chafe and feel sore
                  at the idee of never cumming to the scratch with the enemee, while the kentry is
                  goin to the devil, but the Nayshin in ginrral bares it all with a payshint smild.
                  A millyun of dollars is payed out daily, and wots to show for it? Wunst a week or
                  so, thars a skrimmidge sumwhbars, and mebbe twenty or thirty rebels killed and
                  wownded and mebbee not. Evry secesher we rub out costs the North about a hunderd
                  thousand dollars, and prisners of war, at the lowest figger, fifty thousanld
                  dolors a peace. Ef you no of enny mathermatishin as ken callkilate the cost of
                  flaxin the South, accordin to that skatle of prices, I wisht you to hev it dun,
                  bekase I think a skwint at the sum totil mought wake up the American peeple, and
                  show em the pressopeace tords witch thar drivin.</p>
               <p>An aiveridge dividend of not more'n thirty ded rebels a week, on a weekly
                  dispersement of millyuns of dolors, peers at the first glanst rayther a slim
                  return. But I hope noboddy wurries about it, bekase purty sun the tacks-getherers
                  will be along and then we shall pay all our dets down on the nall, andl ef we
                  chuse to give the hyest price for milentary lucksirees, whose bizness is it?
                  Hevenzt we all ben makin our piles for the last kwarter of a sentry, and aint we
                  eenamost tired of seein em grow and mountin gard over em? Isent thar gold enuff in
                  Califoray and Oregon, and cetery to remunnyrate the brave defenders of our kentry
                  and satisfy the multitood of all-fired theeves that naterally belongs to a grate

                  shuvelling peach-blows outer a tater-patch? So ef we want to play at war on the
                  protracted meetin prencepul, wots to hender us?</p>
               <p>The last parrygraft is intended sourcastically. Sourcasm, they say, is a powerful
                  weepin, and ef I ken use it so as to gode my kentrymen outer thar leathargy, and
                  indooce them to lift up thar vices and make tharselves heerd by the
                  slow-comotives, and doo-nuthins at Washington, I shant waste my stashinery in
                  vain. Cheatin and robbery of a nater as would dror tears of indignashin from the
                  eyes of State Prison convicks, flurishes in evry department of the public sarvis,
                  from sutlers up to seckatries, and thar's no chanst of the conflicts bein brort to
                  a close while it continnees.</p>
               <p>As long as the War Goose lays goldin eggs in the nest of corrupshin, thar'll be
                  plenty of cacklin, but no concloosiv fightin. Upon the honor of an old sojer, as
                  never tuck the vally of a chaw of tobacker over and abuv his jest doo, I bleve
                  that ef sum twenty of the mercynary hangers on of the guvermenmt could be strung
                  up without mercy on Capitol Hill to-morrer mornin, it would do more to shorten the
                  war than a big victry over the insirgents. And mark wot I say!—it will cum to
                  sumthin of that kind in the eend. Ef the guverment doosent make a vertoo, of
                  necessty, the peeple will. When the skrews is put to evry man's individual pocket
                  by the federal collectors, let the all-plunderin vagabones of contractors luck to
                  thar necks. The hemps growd and twisted that'll strangel sum of em yet. Isacur is
                  ant ass that stoops atween two burdins. He ken stagger allong cherfully wonder
                  stagnashin in trade and the fare cost of a war, but ef on top o' that you keep a
                  pilin the devil's own extrees till his back bone begins to crack, up goes his
                  blessed old heels at last, and then bewar of the exassprated animal.</p>
               <p>I reckin that outer the three hundred and odd millyuns of dolors eggspended senst
                  last starch, a good seventy-five millyuns, hes gon in cheatins, shavins, and
                  theevins. The itumns will never be known tell the grate day when all ackounts is
                  balanced, and the sheep hes the satisfackshin of seein the bily-goats as butted
                  them on airth sent whar they belong.</p>

               <p>I persoom the swindlel on hosses alone amounts to considabul over a millyun, and
                  as to the shoddy shave, ef you put it down at the moderat aivridge of five dollars
                  a man for the hull army, thrar's three millyuns more. Evrything else hes ben

                  treshury, but I larn on the contrary from a frend in Congress that it is spoken of
                  as a remarkabul speciment of American genus by sum of the guverment offishalls,
                  and that ef the inventor was to apply at the paytent offis he could git the right
                  skewerd to him for all the Nuthern States without the slytest trouble.</p>
               <p>Honest Old Abe's hands is clean, but wot ken he do? He pilots the ship of state as
                  well as he nose how, but; the pirits is too strong for him. While he stands at the
                  hellum theyre all the while brakin cargo, and onless he hed as many eyes as he hes
                  hars on his skalp, he couldent watch the theeves on the kwarter deck, to say

                  lets down over the starn and bulwarkrs, and throo, the cabbin winders. Congoess,
                  howsever, ken do sumthin, and onless it takes meshers to save the owdashis
                  skroundrils from popular fury, by providin for thar saift-keepin in jails, why
                  then, as I sed afore, thar'll be a hangin match wun of these days that'll astonish
                  all corrupshin. Ef the peeple wunst takes the job in hand, I dont seema to think
                  as high conneckshins at Washington will save sum of the cheef plundermungers from
                  makin an improvin eend wonder the awespecies of a vigilants committee. Ive seen

               <p>The affair at Mill Crick, Kaintucky, hes elevated our sperrits. The tedeum, of

                  hunderd mules tuck, arter an obstnit resistance! What will Manasses say to that?
                  Ken the rebels continny the war for menny long 'ears, at that rate? I predicate
                  not. And the flyin fo couldent wait for the waggins. We've got em all it seems. As

                  she tried to blow the candle out. Wal, it deserves a puff at the eend,
                  ennyhow.</p>

                  Brigade), was not bleved by a single sole, but evry shadder of dout was soon
                  dizzypated by dispatches from hed-kwarters. The fact that our Ginral Fry hes
                  settled Zollycuffer's hash, creates more feline amnung the aristocratick rebel
                  symperthisers here than the suckumstance of three hunderd of the rank and file
                  bein made mincemneat of. Seecesshin hes hed a lofty fall, and no mistake. A few
                  more setch Somersets, and its back-bone'll snap.</p>
               <p>I onderstand that Mrs. Greenhow and Mrs. Baxley, the two captive dullsinners as

               <p>Peers to me ef this war continnees long enuff, Floyd and Toucey may loose thar
                  repitashin as A number 1 theeves and skoundrils. Thars fellers here as is hard
                  onto the heels of them hullsall depredators, and onless sum of em is brort up with
                  the hangman's lasso purty sun, I dont no but theyll be chorks a head afore the

                  and wilful murder, as wouldn't be past over in silence by Nayshins in ginral.
                  Mebbe its the folt of my Californy edicashin; but it doos seem to me that whar

                  When I was prospectin at the mines, I used to think that Lynch Law was oncivilized
                  and perumptory, but senst Ive mingled in sosity at Washington Ive cum to vew it in
                  a milder light.</p>
               <p>The buty of the raskality that prevales onder our enlitened guverment is that the
                  sponsability rests nowhars. The swindlin in the War Department hes ben of a natur
                  and extent to make a saint blastfeem, but the Seckatry cums outer the sink of
                  inickity with outer a stain on his offishall garments. He hed nuthin to do with
                  the contracks. It was the heads of the burrows. And the heads of the burrows puts
                  it onto the guverment agents, and they put it onto the devil, I spose. Then the
                  Navy Department begins to smell fishy, but the late Postmaster and small
                  politishin of Hartford, as navigates the consarn, doosent ketch the flavor of it
                  even when Congress stirs up the corrupshin onder his nose.</p>
               <p>As to Congress, it seems to be takin a cumfortable snooze rite on the edge of a
                  fienanshil volcany. Guverment credit is goin to Tofit both to hum and abrod, and
                  the tax bill witch is the oney pennysea for the evil, hangs by the ilids in a
                  doo-nuthin committy. O! its enuff to make enny troo American swar in church, to
                  think how this great and glorus kentry is bully-ragged and molltreated and
                  kwack-doctered, in her hour of differkulty. It doos seem as ef the breed of our
                  great men and troo patryits had gin out with the Clays and Websters, and that oney
                  rubbish remaned behind. The idee of puttin a stomp dooty on noosepapers shows what
                  sort of critters hes been sent to Congress from sartain deestricks. Howsever I
                  dont bleve the House hes arrove at setch a pitch of loonacy as to pitch hed
                  foremost inter the press. Ef it should I reckin the Sennit would hev the gumpshin
                  to put a stopper on the meshur, and failin that surely Old Abe would stomp his
                  foot down on setch an act of wus than furrin desputism.</p>
               <p>But I ken tell you, Eddyturs, thars a gang of onscroopalus raskils here, as is
                  wurkin day and nite to git a claws inter the ginral tax bill that'll kill the
                  kentry press. The heads of the moovement is the emiseries of a sartain New York
                  press whoos artickles recommendin the confisticashion of English property hes
                  ruined our credit in England and indooced the holders of our skewrities thar to
                  sell out as fast as they ken. This consarn eggspects to make $200,000 a year by a
                  stomp dooty ef it ken be put throo, and more'n a duzzin agints is lobbyin like
                  devils ingarnet to effeck that objeck. The President is in a cherful frame of
                  mind, but Ime sorry to say hees gettin to be rayther obstnit. The old man and the
                  Sennit doosent goinside in thar vews. Frinstance they censhur his partickler frend
                  and former pardner Mr. Layman, the marshil of the Deestrick, and the Eggsegative
                  by way of hittin back, makes him master of the serimonies at the White House, when
                  the Sennyturs call to pay thar respecks. Sum ses this is acten with dignifide
                  firmness, but uthers as hev no axes to grind, give it a diffrent name witch my
                  intimit relashins with the President up to the present time, forbids me to put in
                  black and white. Possably he may giv me the cold sholder for main these
                  remarks—but publick interests afore privit frendship.</p>
               <p>I notis by the late noose from Dixie that the buty and fashion of seeceshy is
                  invited to contriboot the old woolins of thar wardrubs, to make cattridges to
                  shoot the northin mudsills. Flannel pettycotes and Balmorall skearts thankfully
                  receved at the rebel war offiz, witch bein in a pawper condishin cant afford to
                  buy the stuff to rap its ammynishin in. This fack takin in conneckshin with the
                  sad intelligence that the childrin of the F. F. V.'s is runnin about the streets
                  of Richmound bar-foot, and that the toes of the highest sirkels is, as a ginral
                  thing, throo thar boots and gayters, must be very gallin to the natral aristocrazy
                  of the land. Ime afeard ef the war lasts a year longer, thar'll skarse be duds
                  enuff for decency among the shiverally and thar wives and darters. When it comes
                  to takin the wimmins pettycotes for gun waddin, thars no sayin what shifts the

               <p>In the present condishin of the "sakrid sile" it would be onpossabul for the grand
                  army of the Potomac (altho composed of patryits as would stick at nuthin in thar
                  kentry's caws) to take the field at enny pint without bein immediently stuck. It
                  would be eesier, in fack, for a collume of young mush-rats to make railroad time
                  throo sugar-house merlasses, than for our troops to accomplash a forrard movement
                  in the eggsistin state of these mushy diggins. Doorin the past week Ive ben acrost
                  the river takin soundins in the butiful shampain kentry around Alexandry, and I
                  ken oney say, that ef the peeple was hafe as yieldin as the sile the contest
                  atween Sam and Secesh would be a saft match and sun eended. Merryland, now, bein
                  of a sandy nater, issent near as deep in the mud as the Old Dominyun is in the

                  while in Ann Arundel, on the opposite side of the river, I could barly reach it
                  with a four foot pole. It seems therefore, as a Clay State, like Virginny, offers
                  more obstruckshins to an attact on the rebels than rejins with more grit and less
                  tenassty. Its my blefe that ef that slushy miry commonwelth was sot up eendways in

                  be more'n ankel deep in May. Ef thats the case and thars enuff left alive of
                  Camerun's teams and chargers to snake the guns along and mount a few dragons, I

                  faverably with the Newgate calender. When the Recordin Angil transkribes the

               <p>The furrin dispatches to the Guverment by the last 'rival was all right I larn. A
                  report was currant yestday that Lord Pamerstun hed rit to Mr. Seward that he
                  should be mutch pleased ef we wouldent leave wun 'stun upon anuther in Charlestun.
                  It seems, howsever, that on luckin at the dispatch a seckind time it was notist as
                  the wurd <hi rend="i"/>"harbor" follered the wurd <hi rend="i"/>"Charlestun,"
                  witch makes a slite diffrence in the meanin. Setch mistakes is onvoidable. They
                  occur evry day in the hurry of bizness.</p>
               <p>Ginral Lane's "separit command" still hangs by the ilids. Opinyuns differs as to
                  the nater of the powers conferd enter him, but it is unannymously agreed that
                  Ginral Hunter hes made an everlastin Jewdy of hisself. Ef he is raaly ankshus to
                  sarve his kentry (and I spose he is), he hed better resine his commishin. The
                  actil reason why Qinral Lane is forbidden to go it alone, peers to be an idee that
                  he mought hurt the rebels.</p>
               <p>Yestday was a Bright day in the Sennit. Evry honest Union man in the land will

                  offal funk. Stephens, the rebel vice, feels very bad. Wise, it is sed, hes becum a
                  nidiot, and fancies the goste of John Brown is continally glidin arter him with a
                  slip-not in its skellinton hands. Twiggs is ankshus to put out. Gustarvus Smith
                  would be willin to sweep the streets of New York gratis to escape the besom of
                  destruckshin. Letcher weeps over his red-eye. Benjamin thinks he hes made a mess

               <p>In compliance with your rekwest, onder date of February 18, I sent an accomplisht
                  and relieabul spy to Richmound to make keerful manyrandoms of Jeff Davises
                  inaugurashin. He hes jest returnt, and represents the speckticle as moanful in the
                  extreem. Menny sobbed aloud. The President tuck the oath as ef it led ben a doste
                  of ruebub or salts and sinner. The hull affair, the spy ses, reminded him of an
                  eegsecushin he wunst seen on Gibbet Iland in New York Bay, of a pirit by the name
                  of Hix. The platform, he allows, was percisely like the scaffold used on that
                  occashin, and nuthin was wantin but the ropes and the waits to komplete the
                  allushin.</p>
               <p>Jeff Davis was preseeded and follered by sevrall gentlemen in black, that bed evry
                  aperience of a sheriff's percesshin, and when the two as sported him on each side
                  let go thar holt, he cum forrard jest as Hix dun to make his dyin speetch, oney
                  luckin mutch more brokin down and desperated. The resemblants was so perfeck, that
                  the spy ses he started in sirprize when he seen Jeff s arms warn't pinioned, and
                  when the speetch was dun, he couldent help luckin around for the feller with the
                  white nightcap to dror over the culprit's visedge. It seems that jest as the
                  onfortnit critter bed got off his last sentence, a messendger rusht throo the
                  crowd and sunk allmost faintin on the platform. My informent declars he was so
                  full of the idee of an eggsecushin, that he couldent help hollerin "he's saved!
                  he's saved" " a repreve! a repreve!" But it warn't a reprieve. Contrarywise, it
                  was the noose of the ockipashin of Gnashville by the fedral forces, in the teeth
                  of all oppersishin. When Jeff heerd it, he kullapsed with a grone inter the cheer
                  behint him, and the surroundin multitood gin a despairin yell. The crowd of
                  moaners then disbursed in sairtch of steamalus, and the leadin funkshinaries stole
                  off like a theef in the night or a morording bed bug when he smells daylight.</p>
               <p>The maskline traitors here hes concluded to play the hypocrit senst the rebellyun
                  was skwelched in Tennessee, but the femmenines, as I menshund in my last, is as
                  savedge as ever. They oney regret that the flower of the South hev to bolt from a
                  passel of Northern mekanicks. A lady from Georgy told me tuther day she onderstood
                  that jurneymen blacksmiths and setch formed the princepull porshin of the Northern
                  files. I told her yes, and them was the kinder files we spiked the Suthern guns
                  with, witch rayther shet her up. Anuther she Seeesh remarkt to Seward that she was
                  sorry the gentlemen of the South had to contend with shoemakers and taylors; to
                  witch the galliant seckatry replide, in his onpretendin way, that it must be very

                  britches, at witch she gin her hoop a venamus sling and mizzeld.</p>
               <p>I spose the censureship of the tellagraft will be oney tempory; but in case it
                  shouldent, I am organizin a flock of carryer pidgins. I keep em in a coop in my

                  to your reflectin readers. It is bruted abroad to-day that Memphiz has ben gin to

                  that artickle is purty sure to be sublied with setch substitoots as air gin abuv.
                  As long as the Censers hes thar swing over the press, the publick is sartain to be
                  led off on false scents. Sum may smell a rat and refuse to fowler em, but the

                  reddy to swaller the most horrebul catstrophies invented by the dredful axident

                  manspate that brethren of the cullerd perswashin? Peers to me that when an evil's
                  jest as shoor to die a nateral deth, as Floyd is to git his goose cooked tuther

                  yoke's eennamost broken now. Ef the South hed hollered, and sued for peace, why
                  then indeed it mought be all right to make setch a tender, but onder present
                  suckemstances its rayther tuff. Ime opposed for wun, to enny consillytory meshers,
                  ontil she caves in and cries copavi. Why should we offer to pay her to free her
                  slaves, when they air bound to free tharselves gratis for nuthin ef the war
                  continnees two years longer. Let the South back squar down, and then it will be
                  time enuff to be magnannymus; but as the case stands at present, millyuns for
                  war—not a cent for triboot, is my motto. Badly as the North's ben treted, Ime not
                  agen dooin the hansum thing if the offender repents, and eats humble pie—but as to
                  tryin to <emph>bribe armed traitors</emph>, it seems to me about okwiverlent to

                  great Dook of Guys. In my opinyon he is a seckind Father of his Kentry and I dont
                  spose the son of Austerlitz, as the French is allas a crackin up, could hev held a
                  candle to him. Stanton is sum, and I like his summery way, but arter all the
                  President is a head and sholders abuv him in the esteamashin of peeple as
                  onderstands his meshurs.</p>
               <p>But a trooce to these desultry remarks into witch my warm friendship for the
                  President has betraid me. Wot I wanted to git at was this—that you mustn't relie
                  on me for enny informashin likely to proov prejewdishall to the plans of our
                  milentary Solomons.</p>
               <p>"Ef you was to let the cat outer the bag," ses little Mac to me yestday, in his
                  playful manner, "it mought, prevent us givin Jeff Davis rats." And that warnt all;
                  for he added In an ondertone, so as the uther staff fellers shouldent hear:
                     "<foreign>Enter noose</foreign> old boy, ef you <emph>do</emph> tell tales
                  outer skrool, Ile suspend you!"; and from a neckspressive moshin he made and his
                  emfasis on the word <emph>suspend</emph>, I considerd he ment more'n met the ear.
                  Ses I in response "Ginral my oath is sakrid;" at the same time tippin him the wink
                  to sho I new the ropes.</p>
               <p>On Toosday I made a tower of the enemees wurks at Manasses, by order of Ginral
                  Maclellin. My report—on forty pages foolscap—will I hope, prove acceptabul to the
                  Head of the army. I found the airthworkss at the Gap in pretty good condishin on
                  the hole, but the railroad was all tore to peaces at the Junkshin. Sines of hasty
                  evackuashin was visabul evrywhars. The rebels must have fled in great alarm. Wot a

                  <p>[Although in the field, and holding a staff-appointment, and, therefore, of
                     course, conversant with the important plans about to be consummated in
                     Virginia, our correspondent is restrained by a sense of honor, sharpened by
                     Secretary Stanton's order, from sharing his knowledge with our readers. A great
                     battle, however, will unseal his lips (unless it should seal them forever); and
                     we hope soon to hear of him "on the line of the Rappahannock", with a
                     considerable wreath of laurel on his brow. In the meantime, by way of a sop to

               <p>I spose youve hed wild rejisens in the North over the razin of the sege of
                  Washington. Arter bein infested by land and blockheaded by water for months by the
                  fo, we hev at lenth cut our way out, and the grand army and the fedral city may be
                  considerd, for the present, comparatively saift. Our march so far hes ben wun
                  unintrupted serious of cheerin tryumps; the enemee hevin plenty of locomotives to
                  carry em off and no motives wotever for stayin. The noose of our approach seems to
                  hev hed setch an effeck on thar sperits, that they immediently started by the
                  thousand at a time oen a train. Our Ginrals eggspected to find the rebel army well
                  disposed, and detarmined to defend thar<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5729-00000063"/>
                  posishins, as Price's forces did theirn at Shugar Creek, to the bitter eend. But,
                  notwithstandin all thar blowins, they no sunner got wind of our sally than they
                  fled without a blow. In follerin em, howsever, it will be reckwizit to pei-ceed
                  with eggstream cawshin, for fear of runnin blindly inter that "last ditch" whar,
                  as the man in the play ses, they air resolved to "die nobly —die like demagogs."
                  The late galliant seckind in cummand at Fort Donalson, who onderstands all about
                  ditches, is bleved to hev gon South to dig it for em—arter witch he will
                  ondoubtedly dig out for sum saifter place of refudge. It may be considered sartin
                  that when the rebels sinks to rest on glory's bed they wont find a Pillow thar. In
                  fact, its more'n probabul that all the heads of the Rebellyun will turn up missin
                  at its tail eend.</p>
               <p>You will be glad to larn that I hev ben in a slight skrimmidge senst my last, and
                  cum out right side up as ushil. By permishin of the Ginral-in-cheef, me and the
                  County Paris, and the Dook de Chatters, went out on a skout with Ginral Stunman
                  tuther day, und a lively time we hed, killin menny and skarin more. Our force
                  consisted of about five hundred cavalry, and we met, or rayther we overtuck the
                  enemee, two thousand strong, near the Orange Railroad. "Go in lemons!" shouted the
                  Dook de Chatters, who is fast ackwirin a nolledge of the American tung onder the
                  tooterin of a New York Fire Zouwave. And at em we went, as fast as our
                  Camerun-contract coarsers would carry us. Thar hosses was fleet, but those of our
                  squadrun was fleeter. We pored down onto em like lava-indeed, I mought say, like
                  Balaklava. We should hev ben glad to charge em in front, but as they wouldent turn
                  round, to take em in the rare became a starn necessity. I was in advance of the
                  line, and went in, as I allus do, on my own hook. Rememberin my youthful explites
                  as a wild cattle-hunter in Texas, I put my reins in my mouth, and rushin my steed
                  inter thar flyin ranks, ketched two rebel bosses by the caudle eggstrematies, and
                  throwin the well-bred and doughseal animal I rode on his hanches, slung em both.
                  To dismount and present a brace of Colts at the heads of the fallen seeceshers was
                  the work of a seckind. They acknolledged thar discomforture when they seen the
                  perswaders, and signifide a desire to take the Oath of Fiedelity. Bindin em over
                  to keep the peace with thar own saddle-girts, I remounted my Cameronian charger,
                  and agin follerin the horsteal fo, repeted the slingin operashin. This I continued
                  for over an hour, when I returnt and pickt up my prisners—jest a duzzin—and druv
                  em inter camp. I hed eenamost forgot to state that I plugged a bushwhacker as was
                  drorin a bead onto my yung frend the Dook, and parrid a fatal cut aimed at my
                  brother-in-arms, the County Paris.</p>
               <p>Ginral Stunman would hev complimented me on my bravery in a speshil order of the
                  day, but as I prefered the <title>SUNDAY MERKARY</title> as a mejum of
                  commoonicashin with the public, he gracefully yielded the pint; bein the fust time
                  that brave man ever yeelded to ennything human. Of all dragon offsirs I ever seen
                  he's the trump. The Dook de Chatters was kind enuff to present me with a cupple of
                  Legin of Honors he happend to hev about him, and the County Paris gin me as a
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">quid pro quo</foreign> for my sarvices a portrit of his
                  grandfather Loose Fillip—witch he sed was the very spit of him—butifully sot in
                  Californy dimonds of the finest water.</p>
               <p>Most of the time senst the buv-menshent brilyant feet, I hev ben, as the play ses,
                  "a looker-on in Vienna," or at least stayin in that naybrood with a detachment of
                  cavalry. Bivowhackin in the field is plesent, when thar isent too much bushwhackin
                  around. Offsirs that cotton to wun anuther sit by the campfires of an evenin, for
                  hours together, spinnin yarns. Thars wun curus story that's like Old Virginny—it
                  never tires. I have heerd menny a man tell a graffic tale, that hed no more trooth
                  inter it than a tellegraffic messidge; but this story is as true as hisstory:</p>
               <p>It seems that for sum munts past a misterus critter hes ben playin hob with the
                  rebel centries and pickets in the woods below Leesburg. Sumtimes they hev ben
                  found on thar posts shot in the neck and onable to make any response to the
                  inkwiry, "How cum you so?" More'n twenty, I onderstand, hev at diffrent times been
                  diskivered mortally wounded—and all too far gone in speechless aggerny to tell wot
                  hurt em. At least an ekwill number hes ben killed outright, and the rongdoor cant
                  be detected. Pinned to each victims brest is found a rood drorin of a bull on the
                  rampage, from witch our men infur that the assassin hed sum deer frend or relashin
                  slain at the Bull Run stampede, and takes this kwict method of accommodatin his
                  felines of revenge. A tall, spare figger, about the bild of our venabul President,
                  is ockashinally seen flittin throo the brush in the visinity of the seen of blud,
                  but all attemps to chase down the long-legged aparishin hes, so far, proved
                  bootless. The soopersdishus rebels spose the "Speckter Scout" (as the mistery is
                  called by our sojers), to be the goste of John Brown on the warpath, and they
                  allow that he will never rest in his grave tell he<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000064"/> hes wiped out Guvner Wise. This idee seems to gain
                  confirmashin from the fact that the airly victims all belonged to the Wise Legin,
                  witch is sed to hev fallen back in order to git outer harms way.</p>
               <p>While the curryspondents of the New Yorkr papers is furbid to say a word about the
                  advance as is goin forrard, rebel spies huvers about our camps pickrin up
                  informashin from varuss kwarters—headkwnarters inclooded. Wun hafe of the peddlers
                  is nuthin better'n rebel jayhawkers in desguys, and the display of thar wars is
                  oney a peace of subterfudge, a reglar sell. Statshinary venders hev repeatedly
                  betrayed our moovements, and wunst, in consekens of a diskivery made by a
                  pretendted cookey-marchant, the Cummander-in-chief found his cake all dough.
                  Shockin to relate, tellers blastfeemusly passin tharselves off as parents of Bible
                  Sosities and setch, hes sumtimes gon throo the army distribitting the Sakrid
                  Vollum with a libral hand, for no uther purpus than to entrap Ithe onwary inter
                  revelashins. The defeet of several important plans has also ben traist to
                  coalporters as perfest to emmanate from the Youngs Men's Christian Assoshiashin.
                  Relidgin bein the weak side of most of our offsirs, menny hes ben suckt in by
                  these wulves in sheep's peltry. Amung the vile pack of spies, thar is likewise not
                  a few as deals in keards ; and as our sojers are as hot for poker as they air for

               <p>Ginral Maclellin is aciduously preparin to giv the rebellyun a fatal punch,
                  wotever the spoony agitators of the <title>Triboon</title> may say to the
                  contrary. Purty sun the hull kentry will sing <foreign>Tedium</foreign>, as the

                  victry ekwilly gloryus. The Anny Condy is around! The deth skweedge is approachin!
                  In the meantime the Ginral, knowin that a negernness to carry the war inter
                  Afrikey hes ben frettin my gizzard ever senst the sege of Washington commenst,
                  kindly 'lows me to take a hand in the prelimindary skrimmedges. Consekently, in
                  the late pluckiy affares at Winchester and Strasburg I was fortnit enuff to pluck
                  a few lorils. The engagement on Sunday was wun of the hottest shindies that hes
                  tuck place doorin the war. No dout suin of your Sam-singin Sabbatarians will
                  consider we tuck an ongodly libty in fitin for the Union on the Lord's day. But
                  you kant ajurn a battle on ackount of Sunday, enny more'n you ken ajurn a soler
                  ecleps or the Vernil Equanlnocks. War doosent know enny setcth thing as a <hi

                  Revrend Doctor Hawks deklines to ax a blessin on our arms, we was "makin mob
                  howl," as the prophet I Sayer ses. I'm not an infiddle by no means, and though I
                  don't harp as mutch on relidjus subjecks as sum folks, I bleve in keepin the
                  Sabbath wholly; but an army, when attacted, must take its own part. Ef secesh will
                  consent to stack arms and go to meetin wun day in seven, so will Yankee Doodle;
                  but as the inspired Jerry Myer remarks (chapter 6, varse 14), wots the use of
                  "sayin Peace! Peace! when thar <emph>is</emph> no Peace." When thars no chice

               <p>But a trooce to digreshins. As youre awar, nuthin of moment occurd on the 22d

                  sarvice the follerin day. The hull army regretted the axdent, but, as the Scripter
                  ses, we relied on Providence as our "buckler and shoor defence," and went in on
                  Sunday mornin feline as confident of suckcess as Saint Gorge did when a saltin the
                  Fiery Dragon. The rebel ranks hed ben<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5729-00000065"/>
                  sweld doorin the night by a new corpse five thousand strong, this fresh body bein
                  led by Ginral Garnet, consider by the secesh a milentary jewill of the fust water.
                  They thort the nolledge of Garnet's arrival would hev gint us a preshus stun, but
                  we hed heard aforehand that his men was a passel of misabul topers, and besides
                  our blud was up, and like Heenan, or Sayers, or the New York Common Counsell, we
                  was reddy for ennything in the ring. The rebels was headded by Ginral Jackson, who
                  doosent claim enny relashinship to the late Hero of New Orleens, tho Ime of
                  opinyun that his right to a descent from Old Hickry in a direct line—with a loop
                  at the eend out—kennot be disputed.</p>
               <p>The cumbat opend with a lively artillery dooill. Our round shot smashed thar
                  squaurs, and plowed throo thar collumes with harrowin effeck. Thar fire warnt
                  noways slack nuther, and as we hed both got our ranges, we raked wun nuther like
                  blazes. Purty sun thar right wing fainted, at the same time thar flyin artillery,
                  follerd by a large body of foot, pitched in over on the left. Then our bands
                  struck up and our playtoons advanced. It was a tremlenjus struggle. But at last we
                  druv em. Nex they tride to brake our center by an <foreign>eshellon</foreign>
                  moovement, but they got a shellin as soon convinced em it was a bad egg, and they
                  fell back at a Flora Temple trot. Then follerd a suckseshin oil attacts and
                  repulses till, about 4 P. M., when the eggsauasted fo findin wot a clock it was
                  with em began to giv way. Doorin this interval, sum of our offsirs and men
                  performed setch progenies of valor as is the nateral offspring of stout harts and
                  a wholly caws. Wun Suppleturn, of the Eighty-forth Pennsylvanly, acktilly jumped
                  up behint a Virginny major as he wheeled his hoss to retreat, aud ketchin the
                  rains with his left hand while he choked the rider with his right, brort him in,
                  black in the face, as a prisoner of war. I never seen a prettyer feet of arms. The
                  major blastfeemed orfully when he rekivered his breth, and sed it was a
                  sircuss-rider's trick and nuthin better. I hed several pursenal runcounters
                  myself, for whenever an extree charge was orderd, I tuck keer to be counted in. On

                  sendin it dowh the trumpeter's throte. Ime not fond of blowin, but I wisht you'd a

                  dasht on with the raskilly carcuss upright in the saddle, jest as ef nether hoss
                  nor man was conshus of the cutastrophy, ontil the curus speckticle disappeared in

               <p>About hafe past 4 in the arternoon the pursute began, and of all actyve pursutes
                  that I was ever engaged in, that was the liveliest and most excitin. We druv em
                  inter Strasburg, and outer Strasburg, and ten miles beyant Strasburg, like straws

               <p>That porshin of the milentary reptyle onder the keer of Ginral Banks, snakes along
                  purty lively. Ef tthe tail and the rest of the boddy doos as well as the head, the
                  rebels now flyin like sheep every witch way, will be lammed at all pints and
                  finerly skwelched in its contracted folds. Toosday bein the fust of April, Kernil
                  Ashby, with his cavalry and sum infantry, sposed to be pairt of the Wise lejin,
                  hed the foolhardeeness to despute our march, but in coarse we was more'n a match
                  for em, drivin em eendways twelve milds and inter Woodstuck as ef Lucyfur<pb
                     n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5729-00000066"/> was arter em. On Wensday, hevin shelled
                  the Kernil outer Woodstuck, and inter Edenburg sevin milds beyant, we stopt to
                  mend the bridges, burnt by this arch rebel and his incinderary follerers, and
                  to-morrer or nex day, so we hop, we shall be arter him agen on the rode to
                  Staunton. Ginral Jackson's mane boddy is probly saift for the present in the
                  hills, but his rare is in the bottom land, and we expect to cut it off. The gait
                  at witch these high minded, onsensabul-to-fear-fellers travels is a caushin to
                  Jack-the-Joint killer's sevin-legged boots. "Old Virginny never tire," the song
                  ses, and no more it doosent. Ef the secesh kant fight for the commonweal, they ken
                  run for it faster'n enny common wheel you ever seen, and air eenamost ekwill to
                  thar own locomotives. I've heern tell of the wunderful feets of Jackson, the
                  American Deer, but I'll bet horns round for a ridgement, he couldn't hev beat
                  Jackson, the American traitor, when he was on the full lope for Strasburg with
                  Kernil Tyler and the Third Brigade at his hanches. They tork like Spurtycuss in
                  the Gladiater, these Suthern leaders, but they aint wuth a darn at closte
                  kwarters. I onderstand that W. H. Russell, Hell, Hell, D.—as the cocknees calls
                  him—speaks, in his last letter to his owners in London, of the "onyieldin South."
                  Ef the Father of Fibs should ever go inter the travellin sircuss line, he oughter
                  to engage that farseeshus gentelman as clown to the infarnal ring; his grimaces in
                  black and white takes the shine out of all the odd tricks I ever seen played with
                  the papers, and I've ben a speshil curryspondent of the press for over twelve
                  years. "Onyieldin Sout!" But mebbe he means the cotton and terbacker fields, witch
                  sartinly is likely to be rather onyieldin for a seesin or two.</p>
               <p>The noose from Port Rile is plesent, isent it? The "onyieldin" rebels hes scudded

               <p>It seems thars no feesabul way for the rebels to vamose from Fort Makin, eggsept
                  by way of Rogues Sound, and Ginral Burnside sposin they would instinktively take
                  that rout, hes headed em off at Morehead City, witch is jest oppersit. To use a
                  favorit Suthern frays theyre "dun gon in." Captin Smith who commands the
                  fortyficashin, is about as badly off as the coon that surrendered to his namesake,
                  and he'd better cum down afore the shootin begins ef he wants to save his peltry.
                  I scarsly think thar'll be mutch fushin of blud at Fort Makin, for Smith, as you
                  will gess from his name, belongs to wun of the numerus fust famalies in the South,
                  and probly wouldn't like to be wiped out by common Northern mudsills.</p>
               <p>Charlestoun it seems is an orful funk, and the civil funkshinaries at last
                  acknounts, was talkin of settin fire to the city, and runnin away by the light of
                  it—a favorit dodge in the "Onyieldin South." The wimmen and children was leavin,
                  and the men, notwithstandin thar wish to welkim the "Cowardly Yanks" "with bluddy
                  hands to horspitable graves," felt as ef it was their dooty to foller on and look
                  arter their famalies. The rebel giginral Evans recently marched from that
                  visinnity in sairtch of the invaders, and on finding em, immediently "retreated in
                  a masterly manner." The Onyielders is not introosive. Ef thars ennything for witch
                  they <emph>air</emph> remarkabul it is their retirin dispersshins, and thar
                  bashfulness in the presence of a Union crowd. Floyd, Pillow, Wise, Jackson,
                  Johnston, evryboddy in fack, as is ennyboddy, in Dixie, retires in a masterly
                  manner. Advancin backards is thar fort.</p>
               <p>Mebbe afore this gits inter prent thar'll be a grate fight in Virginny, and mebbe
                  thar wont. The moovments of the big army wurm as is to enwollop the rebels in its

                  monster as visits Nayhaunt every summer and is conneckted with so menny tales.
                  Uthers calls it a chunk-hed and allows thars nuthin inter it, but my opinyun is
                  that the critter's of the Great Bore speshis, and will as sartainly swaller the

               <p>In compliants with orders from head kwarters I cut my stick from Ginral Bankses
                  divishin at Stunny Crick on Friday last, for the porpus of jining Ginral
                  Maclellin's staff. My feller <foreign>a decamps</foreign> of the Fift Army Corpse,
                  showed the most lively emoshin at partin, and I mutt say I was considabully mooved
                  myself as I gallupped off. Ginral Banks was kind enuff to remark that he was sorry
                  to looze the sarvices of setch a distingwished old sojer, and presented me with a
                  pocket-pistil as a shootable tokin of a steam. Wun of my bruther offsirs gin me a
                  flask as a cumpaniun to the pistil, and I now ware em about my purson as a
                  mementor of the glorious sperits I left behind me in the Fift Divishin. Ginral
                  Maclellin receved me with mutch swervity and perliteness, returnin my respeckful
                  bow with the kwiet curtsy peculiar to that wunderful struttygist. I am afeard you
                  will regaird me as little better'n a bag of wind in makin wot may seem to be vane
                  pursenal illushins to myself, but I asshoor you I am not puft up in the leest by
                  the oner dun me, but continny jest as condesendin to my ekwils as ef I warn't made
                  mutch of. Atwixt ourselves, Eddyturs, I hev my douts whether I should be treted
                  with setch a grate attenshin, but for bein the curryspondenat of an influenshil
                  noosepaper. When a kernil gives me an oncommon hard squeedge of the hand, I put
                  down two-thirds of the presshur to the fack that I am a member of the press, and I
                  kant kelp thinkin as the little presents of segars and shampain sent so frekwently
                  to my kwarters lies more inter em than meets the eye. As a means of obtainin
                  promoshin, the pen, as you are awar, is sumtimes mityer'n the swoord. I could add
                  more on this interistin tropic, but it shall never be sed that D. V. violated the
                  confidence even of the confidence kernils as reposed thar ambishus hops in his
                  onabul buzzum. I would saty, howsever, throo your abel jernil—witch is kept on
                  file by milentary men of evry rank—that my sole spurns corrupshin, and that no
                  amount of hideseek and regelees will indoose me to reckymend fether-headed
                  boasters as proper persons to be made Bragadears. Incompetent offsirs as eggspecks
                  me to write em up, leans on a brokin read.</p>
               <p>But I am stragglin off from the matter in hand, witch is the proposed seeser of
                  Yorktown. The path of Glory lays open afore us, but the road is bad. Ever senst
                  the army left Cockletown the hevvy mud hes ben a severe trial to the mussels of
                  the men. On Toosday it rained pitchforks and blowed great guns, witch, in addishin
                  to the shells throne at us by the enemee, made the rout ennything but plesent. It
                  is difficult to wheel a collume whar the ruts is deep enuff for graves, and
                  eenamost onpossabul to wheel a gun-carridge, and in coarse with setch tremenjus
                  engines of war we frekwently broke a shaft. Ornary humans would hev considerd an
                  advance outer the kwestin, but this army consists prencepully of sooperhumans.
                  They dasht at dubble krwick throo onpentrable woods, and fairly danced acrost
                  bottomless moreasses. Ef a battery opened onter us we immediently shet it up.
                  Skrimidgin was frekwent on the march, but I hev herd of nuthin to the enemee's
                  advantidge. The press, as ushil, distinguished itself. I larn that on Sunday the
                  curryspondent of the New York World brort in three prisners, wun onder each arm
                  and wun on his back. Wot a corntrast to Russell's Bull Run from Centerveal.</p>
               <p>Hevin overcum all prelimlindary obstickles we air now encampt within two milds of
                  Yorktown, getting reddy to go in. But the works of the rebels is voloomninus. They
                  eggstend clear acrost the tung of land atwixt the mouths of York and James, and
                  sho setch a formadouble row of teeth that to attact em seems like rushin inter the
                  jaws of destruckshin. I menshin this fack that the publick may appreshiate the
                  eggsplite, when these impregnable fortyficashins is carried with the bagnet. The
                  rebel resarves behind the wurks is varusly estimated at from 15 thousand to 51
                  thousand vetruns. I dont know witch number is right, but Ile hev em counted ef
                  possbul when the place is tuck, and let you know.</p>
               <p>Balloon reckonnuisances is made frekwently. I went up<pb n="134-135"

                  paytent refractory tellescope, I brort Ginral Magruder so near that I could
                  eenamost hear him swar and could distinctly see him drink. He peered to be takin a
                  horn about the size of the wun as bloo down the walls of Jerryco. The offsirs
                  ginrally seemed to be engaged in similder ginastick eggsersizes. It was a butiful

               <p>Among the spiles taken this week was a curus dockyment found in the desarted
                  shanty of a rebel engineer offsir. It was a kompleat plan of Ginral Maclellin's
                  forrard moovement, and the date shode as Magruder hed all the particklers from A
                  to Izzerd, long afore the Nuthern press was awar that the grand army was going to
                  moove at all. I merely elude to this little incident <foreign>en possum</foreign>,

                  tenders, is all reddy for anuther tug o. war, and I spose by the time this letter
                  reaches you the fight will hev ben fit and the victry wun. I trust the Monitor

               <p>To use a eunick and novil frays, much patternized by the tellagraft, evrything is
                  progressin favorbly. Sevral thousand conterbands is engaged to-day in draggin
                  artillry mules outer the moreasses; and ef the wether continnees fine, the hevvy
                  howitstirs as disapered in the kwogmires doorin our march will be razed by the
                  last of April. Hevin takin the precawshin to plant boys over the places whar the
                  guns went down, the men will no whar to dig for em, and tho even thar breeches has
                  gone under, I hev no dout they will all be brort to the sirfiz. Here in camp, the
                  mud is mostly half leg deep for light infantry, and sum of the German ridgements
                  is up to the seckind jint in the saft and plastic sile. The ground about Ginral
                  Maclellin's hed-kwarters presents the aperience of a cow-yard arter a three weeks'
                  steddy rain, and the waity members of his millentary fammaly now and then sticks
                  fast in the slow. Bein light and spry hisself, he manages to skip the bad places,
                  and so avides bein stuck. As a ginral thing, the upper-crust will support a small

                  onpossabul to run as fast as on <foreign>terror firmer</foreign>.</p>
               <p>Howsever, thars no danger of a panick. Not a man in this invinsabul army nose what
                  fear is well enuff to diskribe it without a dickshinary. We air all as jolly as ef
                  war was a plesent game at keards—tho we no not how sun the strongest harts amung
                  us may be played out and kivered with thar cumraids spades. As to the shufflin and
                  cuttin—we leave that to the "nateral heroes" of the Land of the Last Ditch. Wun of

               <p>Balloon investigashins takes place daily, and a correck and relieable map of the
                  hull airy of the enemee's wurks hes ben tuck by wun of our errornots. The seecesh,
                  howsever, hes sot up a noppersishin, and sports neerly as big a bag of wind as we
                  do. They call it the Giddyun Pillow, arter the inflated bein of that name as
                  kullapsed at Fort Donelson. Yestday both consarns was up at wunst, and cum so
                  closte together that riful shots was eggschanged atween the civil engineers in the
                  baskets. It is thort that a bullet fired by wun of our topografical fellers
                  perpetrated the bottom of the rebel gas bag, but it retired in good order to the
                  frendly kiver of a nayborin cloud to hev the hole darned. The results of our
                  atmostfearical scoutin, so far, is rayther startlin. The fo is reported at wun
                  hunderd and fifty thousand strong, with six hunderd guns; but sum thinks the
                  trunks of the trees they air haulin from the woods to bild brestwurks was mistakin
                  for artillry. As the balloon estimit of the rebel force at Manasses was two
                  hunderd thousand men, with fortificashins ekwill to the Mollycoff and the Mammylon
                  at Seblastypull, and the actil number turnt out to be oney forty thousand, behint
                  sum misabul airthwurks, it is sposed by reflectin minds that errorstatic
                  observashins is allmity onsartin. Purfessor La Mounting ses that the
                  refractoriness of the upper atmostfear is amazin, and that when the obsarver is
                  elevated above a givin pint he is apt to see dubble. This skyentific vew of the
                  case hes ben adopted, I bleve, by Ginral Maclellin.</p>
               <p>Senst my last, I hev spent two plesent days with the advance, as a volunteer
                  sharp-shooter. I never tride the tellascupic sites afore, and I consider em a
                  grate conveenyance. At a kwarter of a mild they bring wun of the "nateral lords of
                  the sile" so neer that the ornaryest backwoodsman kant miss him. I laid in ambush
                  behint a chinkapin bush and plugged seventeen, takin keer, howsever, not to hit em
                  in the hed, or the stummick, or enny vital part; bekase as it takes four well men
                  to carry off a cripple, evry wownded man counts five outer the ranks, while a ded
                  feller, rekwirin no assistants, is left whar he draps, and oney counts one. The
                  most important strutegic manover in war is to knock a man over without killin him.
                  Frinstance, when thars twenty-five thousand of the enemee, ef you kin wownd five
                  thousand, it takes the uther twenty thousand to tote em away, by witch the feeld
                  is left vakint and they air totally defeeted. (See the Hull Art of War by the

                  was chaste three furlongs acrost an open by a reckoshettin ball, and saved his
                  life by fallin inter a gully jest as it hopt over. The world would hev regretted
                  his loss, ef the missill hed put him throo. The artists for the pictoryals is also
                  cool and cam in the midst of the most eminent dangers, and wun of em cum very neer
                  bein rubbed out yestday while making a sketch of sum skedaddlin rebels. A shell

                  others, it hed no fews.</p>
               <p>The plans of Ginral Maclellin for usin up the shiverally at Yorktown air the most
                  masterly that hes ever ben corntrived senst Siezir crost the Rubigun. Setch, I

               <p>Senst I rit last things hes gon on in the ushil rootin stile; but as the rains hes
                  ceast and the sakirid sile is no longer an infernal dam, its not onprobabul that
                  the stormin will sun commense. Our boys, as you may conjecter is egur to take the
                  shine outer the blasted Seecesh, and ef they cut up ruff they'll git polisht off
                  in short order.</p>
               <p>Sum thinks, howsever, that as the uther collumes of our army drors to a foecus on
                  thar flank and rare, the cornfedrits seein no outlet from the intrickit maize,
                  will acknollidge the corn as Cornwallis did, without waitin to be shelled out.
                  Cobb, I onderstand, is in a desput way at the prospect, and a kernil as was tuck
                  prisner this mornin ses he would give his ears to be outer the scrape. He hes no
                  confidence in the resent raw re-enforcements standin fire.</p>
               <p>But my own idee is, that a bluddy struggel is brewin. The rebellyun is a hopless
                  case, but they'll fight it out to the bitter eend. Ef our gunboats could git up
                  the James, we'd put em throo thar jimnastics purty kwick. They'd find it ratyther
                  a hard row to hoe to hold thar present persishin onder a rakin fire from that
                  kwarter. But the Merrymac is coder of the walk, and bein aloud to crowt it over
                  everything we hev in the Roads, thars no chanst for our turkles to run up inter
                  the inteeryur and help us carry Yorkrtown by a <foreign>coo de main</foreign>. Our
                  fleet hed the monster fowl tuther day, with its big gun busted and its beak in the
                  mud, but the orders was not to attact, so the Monitor and the Nogotuck, and the
                  Vanderbelt and cetery, hed to look on till the critter was got off, arter which it
                  made a tact acrost the harbor and retired with drums beatin and cullers flyin as a
                  triboot of respect to the asstoot head of our Navy Department. Isent it a shame
                  setch a funkshinary should be the <hi rend="i"/>alpher and <hi rend="i"/>onager of
                  our nobul mareen? Why doosent the ventabul old Rip Van Winkles retire from the
                  Naval burrow to Sleepy Hollow, whar he naterally blongs? We want a feller thar as
                  nose beens, and not an auntydiloovian as nose nuthen but <emph>has</emph> beens,
                  and barly that. Noah wouldent hev shipt setch an old fogy as a forrard hand to
                  holystone his blessed decks.</p>
               <p>The enemee in frunt continnees bizzy spadin up new airthwurks, but the punches
                  they git from our artillery ratyther damps thar ardent sperrits, often indoocin em
                  to thro down the shuvvel and the ho, and dig for saifter diggrins. Evry day thar
                  wurkrin parties fall back hafe a duzzen times for want of proper support, while
                  setch is the eggsellent provishin made for kiverin our trenchers that they air
                  allus full of pluck. The firing of Burden's sharpshooters inficks hevy losses on
                  the rebels. No sunner doos a gunner show than he's a goner. Thirteen was rubbed
                  out yestday while. spunging thar pieces, and still another who was sightin a
                  Parrott loaded with grape, reseved a bullet in the ball of each eye at the same
                  moment. The latter bein onable to see whar he was goin, walked strait inter the
                  Fedral lines, and altho kwite blind, is thort to hev a good look to rekiver.</p>
               <p>Our advance is now oney seven hunderd yards from thar outwurks, and when the wind
                  is right we ken hear em blastfeem. Ef profanity was fatill at that distance, we
                  should all hev ben to the devil longs ago, for the retches swar at us like
                  troopers. Misabul sinners—onackwainted with the provub that cusses is like
                  chickens, and goes hum for the same porpus—they little thinkin what hell-roosts
                  they air makin of thar onfortnit soles. Mebbe ef they hed hed as menny pius tracks
                  to guide em as we hev, they would never hev wanderd from the strait and narrer
                  path inter the broad way that leads to destruckshin.</p>
               <p>We ort to make allowances for the fact that they air destitoot of mishinaries, and
                  hev no coalporters to giv em informashin about the fire that is never kwenched.
                  Indeed they must be pitably ignorant about setch matters, otherways Bowerygard
                  would never hev egggspected to find water for his hoss whar it kant be obtained
                  for no price. But how kin you hop to find enny relidjus sentiment amung peeple as
                  hev no Sunday papers, and attends theayters on the Sabbath day, and persecutes
                  meek and lowly ministers of the gospel like Parson Brownlow?</p>
               <p>These remarks, howsever, is less shootable to a camp than a camp meetin. To return
                  to secklar matters: Purfessor Low has jest desended from the skies in his big
                  balloon "Agasis," and reports that Jeff Davis has arrived at Yorktown with suckers
                  to the amount of nine thousand men. He ses he counted the sojers, and he knew Jeff
                  by his long neck; but then the purfessor is sumwot given to stretchin. I remember
                  a few years ago, I gin fifty cents to see Low start from New York by the air line
                  for London, but arter raisin the wind, lo and behold, as tho Devil would hev it,
                  he oney went as far as the Elysium Feelds. My own bleef is, that most all the big
                  stories we hear about<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5729-00000071"/> seecesh
                  re-enforcements and setch, amounts to nix; and, like the late rummer of a Union
                  defeat at Elizabeth, purceeds from the Father of Lize.</p>
               <p>Thar was a butiful shindy in the rebel lines yestday arternoon.</p>
               <p>Two ridgements hed a pursenal differculty, and we could see em firin into wun
                  another for hafe hour or so in a lively style, killin menny on both sides. It was
                  a puzzle to all of us why they should riddle wun anuther in a plug-muss, wen they
                  no well enuff that our men is spilin for a fight and reddy to put em throo at the
                  shortest notis. Howsever, its not onplesent to witness a bluddy ruff and tumble
                  atwixt two sets of ruffyuns, when wun reflecks that witchever of the skallywags
                  whips its all right for our side.</p>
               <p>A desarter who cum in about an hour ago, ses it was a skrimmidge atwixt a South
                  Caroliny ridgement and a boddy of Virginny Volunteers as was resently enlisted
                  agen thar will at the pint of the bagnet, and that the muttonneers hed the best of
                  it. When troops of Sister States pitches inter wun anuther arter this fashin, its
                  a sign that the ties of brutherhood is brokin, and that the affairs of the rebels
                  is approachin a crysis.</p>
               <p>The grand a salt was onavoidably postponed last week, on account of the rain, but
                  the day is now fixt, and it will cumn off at the appinted time, rain or shine,
                  wether or no. In the meantime evrything goes on as agreeably as the most
                  sanguinary frends of the Union could desire. I send you the oridginal plan of
                  attact (which hes senst ben changed), but in coarse you hev tact enuff not to
                  prent it. Seckatry Stantons standin order agen givin aid and cumfurt to the enemee
                  by foretellin past events, is still in full force, and as I dont want you to git
                  inter difficulty by predictin wot might hev happened onder circumstances witch
                  dident occur, you hed better not menshin to ennybody that if Ginral Maclellins
                  first projeck hed ben carried out it mought possably hev ben consummated. I hev
                  reson to no that I am onder the strick sirvillians of the Censer of the Press, and
                  tharfore ef Yorktown should be tuck on or about or before Saturday the third of
                  May, you musn't say I told you so.</p>
               <p>Hopin to date my nex with a pen dipped in Ginral Jonson's inkstand, I remain,

                  <p>[The usually-buoyant spirits of the veteran seem to have been somewhat affected
                     by the mud and miasma of Yorktown Peninsula. He chafes, too, at the delays
                     which careful and circumspect strategists consider necessary to secure success.
                     However, the great battle cannot be long postponed—always supposing that the
                     enemy, while we are making preparations to defeat and "bag" them, do not
                     suddenly decamp without beat of drum, as they did from Manassas.—EDS.]</p>

               <p>The clerk of the wether arter keepin the winders of Hevin wide open for three days
                  and playin continually throo all the orifizzes with two and a hafe inch pipe,
                  suddently shet off the head of water, took in the seelestyal hose, and closed the
                  sashes on Monday last, senst witch this everlastin bog hes ben simmerin down,
                  dryin up, and generatin steam to keep the billyus fever bizness goin brisk and
                  lively. The seesin is oncommon faverable for fever and ager and the crop is likely
                  to be large. More'n two thirds of the wurkin parties engaged in erectin
                     <foreign>shiver de freezes</foreign> and cetery hes the chills more or less,
                  and buckets filled with a solushin of surfit of canine hes to be sent round to all
                  the pianeer hands three times a day to enabul 'em to face the mewsick. Ef it
                  warn't for that the jig would sun be up. As it is the shakedowns in the tempory
                  lazyretters is all full. Roomattics prevails considerabul in the low kwogmires,
                  and I kin ashoor you my asma in the chest hesent ben much improoved by wot the
                  doctors call miasma in the air. In fack the atmostfearic eggshellashins is wus, by
                  chorks, than the shells of the enemee. Ef we dont take the rebels down afore the
                  reglar hot wether sets in, thar'll be sum hevvy mowin dun in our ranks by the old
                  ripper Deth.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, as you air aware from the ushil ofishall sorces, evrything is
                  going on to the entire satisfackshin of evrybody. The diffrent camps hes ben
                  conneckted by blazing roads through the woods, and the sojers can now see whar
                  they're goin, insted of hevin to ax thar way continually in passin from wun post
                  to anuther. The blazin was rayther a tuff job as it hed to be dun onder the
                  enemees fire. Sevral thousand men is at present emplide in bildin corderoy
                  turnpikes. These corderoys is for the<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5729-00000072"/>
                  breeching pieces; but the moreass bein eenamost bottomless in sum places, thar
                  construckshin is a wurk of amens labor. Sumtimes the tallest monarks of the
                  forrest, when laid down as sleepers, disappears like a dream, and uthers hes to be
                  embedded over em. Howsever the grate highway leadin throo the swamp to Warwick is
                  nearly finishit and will be thrown open to the milentary publick in a few days. It
                  is a bully road, about hafe the width of the bullywards at Payris, but skrarsly as
                  present to ride over. The ruts bein all the rong way, gun carridges passin over it
                  purgresses by jerks, like the innoomerable hop-toads on the bog on each side, and
                  about at the same lively pace. The fast crabs of the Third Avenoo couldn't make
                  three minnit time over it—not eggsackly.</p>
               <p>We've got to lick the fo, thats sartain, for this tung of land is too allmity saft
                  and slippery to back down on; so, as the king ses in the play, we must push
                  forrard, "seekrin for Richmound in the throat of Deth." I spose the bombardment
                  will openly in airnest next week, ef the wether is faverabul for firewurks, and
                  Ginrals Banks and MacDowell hes by that time skewerd good places for recevin the
                  rebels with outstretcht arms, as they rush from the eggsibishin. Wun thing you may
                  relic upon—nuthin will be dun ontill the time cums to do it, and then should
                  suckemstances prove onpropishus, it will oney be postponied ontill sumnthin
                  faverabul turns up. This informanshin I hev confidenshally from a very high sorce,
                  and I trust the Censer—altho I am in bad odor in that kwaruter—will suffer it to
                  pass.</p>
               <p>The tidins from the Lower Mussysippi, witch hev ben current here senst Monday, hes
                  defused a flud of joy throo all our harts. Lovill, it seems, cut dirt without
                  showin enny inclinashin for a brush. I remember he did jest the same when he was
                  Deppity Inspector in the New York Street Department. Gustarvus Smith, anuther
                  gradeate of the same nobul institooshin, will probly flee in a simlildar manner
                  from the besum of destruckshin. The ackount given by the rebel leaders of the
                  capter of New Orleanrs is rayther a frothy story but its plain enuff that arter
                  the vessels of Porter reached the city, nuthin more was seen of thar ugly
                  mugs.</p>
               <p>I went on a skout throo the air yest'day with the speshul airtist of a picter
                  sheet named arter a sellybrated ferry in this State. The way of it was this. The
                  airist hearin as the Guverment Censer hed cum full swing from Old Pint to arrest
                  him for givin aid and cumfurt to the enemnee, by copyin an old plan of
                  Cornwallis's and Washington's camps as they appered in 1781, detarmined mined to
                  go up inter God Almighty's free and blessed air, whar they dont hev no Censerships
                  and Seckatries of War hes no jurisdickshin, and to stay thar till the offishall
                  Poll Pry hed vamosed. I ackumpaanid him, and a jolly-time we hed; smokin
                  meershams, and sipping hideseek in the rejin of clouds, and now and then directin
                  our attenshin to the shampain kentry below most, of witch is adapted to the
                  cultivashin of terbacker. We both agreed that no man of voracity in his senses
                  would fix the census of the rebel army at more'n 70,000. We could see all the
                  ridgmental camps, and Ime sartain as all the corpses put together dident number
                  70,000 souls. The seecesh as was off duty presented a curus specktickle. They
                  seemed to be sittin without thar shirts perusin the papers. On vewin em throo a
                  tellascope, howsever, we notist they were employin thar valabul time in the
                  pershoot of vermin. Wot we at fast tuck for noosepapers, turnt out on closter
                  inspeckishin to be thar onderlinen, and judgin by the way they acted, cattle must
                  hev ben plenty and actyve in the dummestick market. My cumpanyun arter sketchin a
                  bird's eye view of the remains of the old fortyficashins at Yorktown—witch he gin
                  to me, and witch I intends to publish arter the war, ef not konsidered determental
                  to past events—preposed to me to descend aloan and inkwire ef the Censer hed
                  evaporated. I dun so. How did I desend aloan? you natrally ax. Wal, I shot down
                  down in a parryshoot. Perhaps you never seen a parryshoot. Its wot airynaughts
                  takes up with em as a safegard agen dannger in case of a kullasps. A balloon is
                  but an "airy nuthin" as the poick eggspresses it, and so its as well to pervide
                  for a rainy day with a parryshoot; witch is percisely like a big umbereller.
                  Siezin this masheen by the handel I jumpt from the car and floted gently, with a
                  wobblin moshin, to the airth, with no inconveenyance except a slite seatsickness
                  cawsed by the see-saw mosshin of the consarn. On arrivin below I inkwired for the
                  Censer and found he hed gon back to whar he belonged, wharupon I gin my frend abuv
                  the spred eagle signal—an Odd Fellow's sine in witch the fingers and the nose
                  takes a conspeakus part—and he immediently tuck the hint and cum down
                  hansumly.</p>
               <p>Hopin we may sun flounder outer this bog, kivered with lorils (witch is as common
                  as sassafrax all over the swamp, ef enny boddy wanted to gether em) I remane, deep
                  in the mud, but with curridge skrewed to the stickin place.</p>

                     1862.</dateline>
                  <salute>Eddyturs of the Sunday Merkary:</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I rite this letter from a commojus manshin in Williamsbug, witch was suddently
                  vakated on Toosday night by Ginral Jo Jonson and a few of his seleck frends, to
                  make rum for Ginral Maclellin and his milentary famaly. The resent tenants was
                  cumpelled by pressin engagements to start for the inteeryur and genrusly left
                  evrything at our disposhal. I am now settin onto wun of Magruder's trunks, and
                  dippin my pen (as I sed in a resent letter mought sun be the case) in Ginral Jo
                  Jonson's inkstand. Immediently opposit to me sets Ginral Maclellin on a camp
                  stool, inditin a dispatch to his wife, on the back of a haversack, and I no by the
                  twinkel of his eye that he's puttin things in a light that'll make her feel as
                  happy as a toad in a shower. He's too much of a worrier to wurry her, even if
                  matters lucked skwally; but seein we hev given the pussnannymus cusses rats, in
                  coarse, he feels like a bird, and rites boyantly. Our departed frends doosent peer
                  to hev ben very tidy in thar habits. Empty whisky jugs, bucks on milentary
                  tacktricks, charts of the peninslur drord on the whitewashed walls with terbacker
                  juce, eppylets, boots as seems to hev hed thar soles run off with hard travel, and
                  setch artickles of clothin as perfeshinal runners diskards in a match agin time,
                  is prominent amung the embellishments of the apartment whar I am now turnin my
                  idees inter black and white. The floor presents a disgustin specktickle, bein
                  kivered with Confedrit kwids, no doubt spit out in a simultanus shower at the
                  moment of departer, to avide swallerin 'em in the wild rush to a more conjenial
                  locashin.</p>
               <p>But enuff of the sourcaustic. Seens of blud and cetery setch as I hev to deskribe
                  is too serous to be treted in my ushil vein. Regairdin the mane facks of the high
                  old rebel hunt witch commenst last Sunday at York Town and hes ben in full blast
                  ever senst, with allmity breef intermishins for recreashin, the tellagraft hes
                  allreddy posted you in advance of the mails. I shall tharfor, like the sellybrated
                  contraband in the play, confine myself self to the "har bredth scrapes and moovin
                  axdents" in witch I tuck a hand, pursenally, and witch the ornary curryspondents
                  of the press was too far in the rare to make a manyrandum of.</p>
               <p>The vamose of the rebels from York Town on Saterday night and Sunday mornin dident
                  take me by suprise. When the sege guns opend onto em to get the range, on
                  Thursday, I sed openly "they kant stand these doses, theymust evackyate." Saterday
                  night, sun arter turnin in, I hed a curus dreem. It seemed to me as ef a most
                  amazin critter rose up suddently out of the airth in my tent, like wun of the
                  stage sulfursides in Don G O Vanny. He hed the aperience of a flyin sarpint, his
                  wings bein in the form of a normons eppylets, and his boddy consistin of flexibul
                  two hunderd pounders taperin down to four and a half inch howitzers at the tail
                  eend. Ses he, rollin the red hot shot witch sarved him for eye-balls, in thar
                  sockits, as he spoke—"Ime the Milentary Annie Condy or Army Devil, <emph>I</emph>
                  am; wot Mephistufferlies was to Doctor Fostus, I intend to be to Unkel Sam, oney I
                  dont want to by souls on enny terms, hevin more on hand now than I ken find fewil
                  for. Would you like my fire-eatin frend," he continned, snappin his incinderary
                  eyes ontil the sparks flue, "to no wots up in the seecesh camp at this
                  junkter."</p>
               <p>"Ef youre the ainshint snake as got up the apple riot in Pairodice in the year
                  wun," ses I, "Ime no frend of yourn, for if it hedent a ben for your darned
                  strutegy, this mutch-to-be-laymented frayternal shindy mought never hey cum off.
                  Howsever," ses I, "I would like to larn how the blamed seecesh over to York Town
                  enjies thar invitin prospecks, ef the things possabul, my old Bore
                  Constructor."</p>
               <p>"Siss-s-s!" ses the tremenjus reptyle, rattlin his metallic karkiss and makin
                  annoys with his firy tung, like a duzzen hafe inch fuses goin on a blazin bender
                  throo the air: "Siss-iss-s-s-s! youre a nice feller to be down on me for
                  sirkimventin a cuppel of covetus, conseted upstarts, when your ginral wants to cum
                  the same game with the hull Suthern Cornfedracy. But we wont quarl old Ruff and
                  Reddy, ketch a holt of my tail."</p>
               <p>I dun so, and with a few virus flaps of his eppylet-wings we wus in the
                  oppersishin camp, when he muttered a few words too profane to be repeted in a
                  Sunday paper, and we both becum unvisabul. A moment arterwards we was in the midst
                  of a markee, in witch the head ginrals was holdin a consultashin on the rebel
                  case. Magruder was makin a speech, and as near as I ken remember the vishin, it
                  was as follers:</p>
               <p>"I go in for fighting as Old (hic)—I say, I go in for puttin em<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000074"/> throo as Old (hic, hic) Hickory did at New
                  Orleens." (Ginral Lee interruptin—"New Orleens be cust!—its gon to thunder!")
                  "Gent'men, don't run; take a sober (hic) seckind thort, and stand firm." (Here he
                  pitcht forrard and run his seegar inter Ginral Jonson's eye.) "Rains ses ef we
                  stay here we shall be tuck by storm. Let her (hic)—I say, let her rip! Can we
                  eskape the fate of Corn (hic)—of Cornwallis by flyin to Chickenhominy? No,
                  gent'men, no. Ef we air to die in the last ditch, let em (hic) hack us to peaces
                  here." ("Hear, hear!" from the sojers listenen outside.) "This is class (hic)—I
                  would say classic ground. Ef we must fall, let us die all, die nobly die like
                  demni (hic)—like demi—"</p>
               <p>Here the speeker keeled over and sobsided, Lee whisperin to Jonson—"die like
                  demijohns, I spose the drunken humbug means."</p>
               <p>At this intresting pint of the vishin I was suddently awoke by the drum beatin the
                  long role, and an orderly rusht inter my tent with his eyes as big as sawsirs and
                  informt me that the seecesh hed abandoned thar wurks and it was a sekind edishin
                  of Manasses. In less'n twenty minits I was ridin throo thar desarted camp. In
                  coarse you hev larnt by the airly despatches, that it was as full of torpedoes and
                  infarnal masheens as a rebel blankit is of like stock, and as I rode along I herd
                  em crackin on evry side. Wun of em cum all thunderin near cuttin short my
                  curryspondence with the Merkary I ken tell you. Rite in frunt of the Rebel
                  Head-kwarters a shell eggsploded onder my Busufferless, and the next instant I
                  found myself sittin astride of a dismounted piece, with the saddle still onder me
                  and my feet in the stirups, mutch suprised but parfeckly saift. Thar was nuthin
                  left but me and the saddle. It was a merackalus eskape, and shows that Providence
                  never sleeps; for this was about four o'clock in the mornin.</p>
               <p>The hull of Monday I was with the right wing, with Hancock's brigade, in pershoot
                  of the flyin fo. In the final shindy on Monday arternoon, when we turned thar left
                  flank, I cum within a hars bredth of ketchin Magruder. Ef I'd oney hed a Californy
                  laureat to hev sent singin throo the air arter him, I mought hey noosed him shoor.
                  But alass I lost him for want of a lasso. His boss was a <emph>leettle</emph>
                  swifter'n mine, and bein drunk he swung about so in the saddle that I couldn't hit
                  him with my revolver. However, I hev his wallet witch he threw away as he fled,
                  hopin to tempt me to stop and skewer it. I pickt it up as I returnt, but found it
                  warnt wuth the trubble, containin nuthin but a few dunnin letters, an obseen
                  drinkin song, and a passel of Cornfedrit shin plasters.</p>
               <p>Last night the rebels wunst more tuck up thar line of march, at a kwarter-hoss
                  stride, and our troops are now arter em with a sharp stick.</p>

               <p>We air cornerin the Cornfeds amazin rapid. Desarters report as Howl Cobb is in
                  favor of vamosin Richmound without waitin to be shelled by Maclellin. Magruder,
                  who was so feerce for a stand when he was staggerin drunk, is now lyin on his back
                  at Rumford with the shakes, they say, and fancies he sees lejins of Illanoy apes
                  swimmin acrost the Pawmonkey River, with red-hot pokers in thar hands to stir up
                  his innards. A contraband as cum in last night ses Mrs. Davis hes mutinid agen the
                  Seecesh Presdent, slapt his face, and told the poor henpect critter that
                  Secceshin's a bad egg, and that she's hartily sick of setch a disgustin
                  yokefeller. The citysins of Richmound ginally is represented to be in a revoltin
                  state, and the saft soap of the rebel funkshinaries doosent appeer to hev enny
                  effeck upon em. Menny thinks it will be onpossabul to bring the Suthern troops to
                  the scratch, in consekens of the late disaster in Louseanna.</p>

               <p>Cumberland, our present head-kwarters, is oney about twelve milds from Bottom's
                  Bridge, whar Lee allows he's goin to whip us. He's got to fight or foot it right
                  away, that's sartain, for we shell be in moshin at dawn on Thursday mornin, for
                  the porpus of lettin daylight inter him and his Fly-by-nights. A currier hes jest
                  arrived from the James, who states that the Monitor was around Gurl's Neck, and
                  that the Gayleaner, witch got in a tight place by huggin the shore too closte, hed
                  ben got off with a tug, and was hard arter her, with the Nogoduck cummin up
                  hand-over-hand a short distans below. By refrence to the maps, you will see that
                  the James is as full of elbows as the Mincio—the wun around Gurl's Neck bein the
                  most dangerus bend of the hull, with the eggsepshin of wun near the mouth. Jeff
                  hes appinted Friday, the sixteent instant, as a day of humiliashin, and I
                  predicate our gunboats and land forces 'll carry out his proclamashin purty
                  effeckshally.</p>
               <p>The clerk of the wether, who seemed detarmind to drownd us out at Yorktown, hes
                  stopt cutting shines, and now we hev rayther more sun then we want. But as Gloster
                  ses to Norfolk in the play, "Wots that to us more'n to Richmound?" We ken stand
                  100 degrees of Foreign heat better'n one in a hunderd of the natives. And why ken
                  we do so? Why, bekase we aint everlastinly fired up with red-eye. Tork of licker
                  as 'll kill at forty rods! Blame my picter ef the stuff we found in sum of the
                  whisky barls at Yorktown wouldent kill as far as a Dollgrin gun.</p>
               <p>You never seen a finer kentry than this we air travellin throo now. Thars
                  planters' housen atween Williamsbug and Cumberland, that the most plus Christian
                  would hardly wish to trade for manshins in the skies. The corn's so flurishin that
                  it gives me pain to tred onto it, and it stirs the pulse of a feller's stummick to
                  luck at the green peas. As I set in the piazzer of Ginral Maclellin's
                  head-kwarters, scratchin off this letter, the notes of the robbings steals
                  plesently on my ear, and the mewsical catbirds tutches my felines with thar
                  cherful and familyar vices. The oney things that anoise me is the mockin-birds,
                  witch, in consekens of hevin lissent so long to the seecesh bands, sings nuthin
                  but "Dixie." I giv em Hail Columby, evry now and then, with a handful of stuns,
                  but, like the jail-birds as tootered em, they oney fly a little ways ahead and
                  strike up the same infarnal toon agin.</p>
               <p>We hev, as you're aware, kwite a number of furrin offsirs attached to this
                  divishin, and they wun and all declar that a finer<foreign>core d'amme</foreign>
                  never tuck the feeld. The Duc de John Veal told wun of our John Bull captins, when
                  he culre to see us at Barboursvil last Saterday, that "Villainton (that's the way
                  the French pernounce Wellington) nevare had so mosh fine troops in hees life."
                  "No," ses the Englishman, "that's a fack; and I dont see how he ever wun the
                  Battle of Waterloo." He led the Frenchman thar, I speckylate. The Duc de Chatters
                  and the County Payris is both here. They air jolly, convivyal young fellers, and
                  not averse to puttin down Old Bourbon when they git a chanst.</p>
               <p>Thar was grate rejisin amung our men when the noose arrove that Cummodore Davis
                  hed sent three of Hollinses Rams to Davys locker. He's a rambunkshus feller is
                  Hollins, but senst Porter and Davis sheared inter his rams at New Orleens and Fort
                  Pillow, I persoom he feels like a shepherd without a flock. Horns hes ben his
                  rooin. The best thing he ken do is to rite an affeckshinit farwell letter to his
                  frends (ef he hes enny), and then drap hisself inter the drink. I reckin he'd sink
                  jest as eesy as rollin off a log, for they've ben throwin hunderds of hogsheds of
                  whiskey inter the Mussysippi lately, and he'd go to the bottom arter it in
                  obejence to his nateral instinks.</p>
               <p>Our advance gard is now feelin the enemee, and the report is that he doosent feel
                  good, and that he is tryin to slip throo our fingers. Ef that's his game, he'll
                  hev to be as lively as a lanprey eel, for we are closte onto his slimy trail, and
                  Maclellin's grip is a thunderin titan. Sum prisoners sent in by the skrimmidgers
                  this morning, ses Lee is ankshus to meet us, and eggspects to cum off with flyin
                  cullers; but Ime afeard he'll go off with flyin cullers afore we git a chanst to
                  pitch inter him in the defiles. The oney cullers warranted to stand in these parts
                  is black and yaller. Cuffee, Dinah and Co. waits for us evrywhars with open arms,
                  and would gladly embrace us, but we eggscuse ourselves, on ackount of the warm
                  wether. We air in good odor with all the darkeys, but for all thar perfeshins of
                  fiendship, they air allus tryin to get to windward of us, ef they think they kin
                  make a cent by it.</p>

               <p>Ginral Maclellin is a dissipul of Davy Crockett; he never bucks ahead till he sees
                  his way clar; but when he doos moove, sumthins got to suckum. I hope this time it
                  will be Richmound, and ef it hedent a ben for that thunderin blunderin bizness at
                  Fort Darling, we should probly hev carrid it afore now, by wot the Californy
                  blacklegs call a <foreign>coo do grab</foreign>. At the date of my last letter,
                  thar was evry aperience that we should hev it afore the sixteent, the day sot
                  apairt by Jeff Davis for a ginral humiliashin of the rebels; but Providence, witch
                  apeers to play an open and shet game with em, jest to aggravate their misforten,
                  thort it best they should hev two days of humiliashin insted of wun.</p>
               <p>Our advance is now near New Bridge, about nine milds from Richmound, and our
                  cavalry pickets is closte enuff to hear thar hosses nay. We onderstand that
                  remittent fever is playin old hob with em. Desarters report that from five to
                  sicks hunderd is taken down daily, and more'n hafe the army hes the shakes, more
                  or less. Thars considabul third day ager amung our fellers too, and buckets of
                  surfit of canine and whisky is past throo the ranks twiste evry twenty-four hours,
                  but the moment the cold stage is over the invalids is as hot as ever for a
                  fight.</p>
               <p>This mornin I went on an errornotic trip with Mr. Low and Kernil Stunman from this
                  pint. We reeched an elevashin of five hunderd feet, and hed a fine vew of all the
                  feeters of the landskip. Men, wimmen and children was running about the streets of
                  Richmound, aperiently in a panic, and but few troops was visabel eggsept over the
                  left near James River.</p>
               <p>Ef wun could vote hisself a farm somewhars around in these pairts, it wouldent be
                  bad to take. Ef thars to be enny confisticashin for the bennyfit of lyall heroes,
                  I should rayther like to hev Kernil Lee's White House farm, whar we bed our
                  headkwarters a few days senst. Its jest about the purtiest spot this side of
                  pairodice. Two things reckymend it—Ginral Washington spent the fust years of his
                  marrid life thar—and the land, eenamost without any pains, will perdooce thirty
                  barls corn to the acher. Paytryotic recolleckshins and present profit both
                  reckymends it, and it peers to me to be jest the place for a Disbanded Volunteer
                  to repose upon his lorrils. I must tork over the matter with my friend Abe. In the
                  anshent fuddle times the estates of traitors used to be bestode upon lyall men,
                  and I guess, as O Theller ses, Ive done the state some sarvice. Thars about three
                  hunderd niggers belongin to the farm I onderstand, and I wouldent mind carrying
                  out the ideer of gradjal mansipashin in relashin to em, by guaranteeing the
                  freedom of thar grate grandchilderd as fast as they arrive at the age of eighty
                  years. I reely dont know ennything on airth more desirabul than a fine plantashin
                  on the Pawmonkey River, with two or three hunderd likely "pussons held to labor"
                  thrown in. I think I could do better by em than sum of the longfaced saints in
                  white chokers as went to the Sea Islands about two munths ago to oversee the
                  plantin of cotton seed, but oney suckseeded in spilin the seed of Ham. Pius yarns
                  isent condoosive to the perduckshin of cotton yarn it seems.</p>
               <p>The Seecesh on the peninslur, findin it doosent pay to plant torpedoes, witch thar
                  own capterd offsirs and men hes to dig up at the resk of thar valabul lives, hes
                  taken to firin on flags of trooce, as a saifter way of committin murder. Thar's
                  jest wun way to stop these games, and that's hangin; and if it isn't resorted to,
                  and that right away, our men will be apt to squar accounts with the cowardly
                  ruffins thar own way.</p>
               <p>I was with Ginral Stunman in the brush at Bottom's Bridge, and a very purty foot
                  race it was. Ive seen considabul running in my day, but I never saw fellers
                  mounted on setch misabul hosses make setch good time as they did acrost the
                  Chickenhominy yestday; yet I warn't supprised at it when I seen the prisners we
                  tuck. Setch onmassaful spurs as they hed onto em I never seen outer Mexico. Thar
                  arms was all sorts and sizes, but thar warn't a pair of spurs amung em as wouldent
                  hev gon throo the hide of an elefant. Wot they cheefly depend upon in battel, is
                  thar spurs. The hull line advances to-day, so luck out for great news about
                  Saterday. Hopin for a fight, but fearin it'll be a fizzle, I remain,</p>

               <p>Bowerygard hevin slipt up on the idee of waterin his Busufferless in the
                  Tennessee, hes cum to skwench his thirst for glory on the banks of the
                  Chickenhominy. Desarters say he reeched Richmound on Sunday from the Sow West with
                  his brissels up like a Texas porkerpine, and swore he'd ether light his Havanner
                  in our camp on Saterday night, or smoke a brimstun regaly with Belzebub in the
                  Halls of Haidees. I understand that prevus to the war the Red Sulfur Springs in
                  this State was his favorit waterin-place, and I persoom in a future state he'll be
                  ackomidated at a Spaw whar the bevridge is of the same flavor, but hotter and
                  stronger, and whar thars heeps of black waiters in constant attendance to giv

                  boddy of the Cornfeds now shows a horsteal frunt south of the city, and we larn
                  they air in high sperrits over the retreat of Banks into Merryland. Onder these

                  in saber bagnets.</p>
               <p>In the intrim our Ginral, who, as you may hev heerd, is eenamost wushipt by the
                  army, is by no meens an idol man. On Monday he put Ginral Porter at the head of a
                  considabul boddy of troops, and told him to go to Hanover, witch he dun, and,
                  arter a hevy skrimmidge, tuck the place. It was a big thing and you will eggscuse
                  me for crowin over it. Our loss when footed up will be a mere handful, as ushil;
                  but I kant state the figgers, becase, altho menny of the troops hes cum back, we
                  hev no returns. Our men dun well in the engagement, and the wownded hev ben dooin
                  as well as could be eggspected ever senst. The fo left wun hunderd and nine men
                  and a sutler ded on the field, and, singlar to relate, they were all shot in the
                  eye with grape shot—showin the unerrin ackaracy of our artillry. This I hed from
                  an eye-witness, a remarkbly clear-sighted volunteer from the Buckeye State.</p>
               <p>Our men berrid the enemee's ded in thar own riful-pits, witch came handy arter the
                  fateeg of slorter, and capterd five hunderd head of seccesh alive.</p>
               <p>The jography of Hanover, witch is the court-house town of Hanover county, and
                  contains six whiskey mills, two churches, a constabul, seven squires, and a jail,
                  besides about two hunderd white trash, that no jenteel nigger will assoshiate
                  with, is as follers. It is right on the Richmound &amp; Fredericksburg Railroad,
                  mebbe twenty milds from Richmound; and so you see while Ginral Maclellin is
                  menassing Bowerygard's frunt, he hes also opened a fire in his rare. This, I
                  bleve, is what he sposed Ginral Macdoill was to do; but it seems that wunderful
                  milentary cheeftin, who hes ben pickin his teeth and jinglin his spurs in the
                  neyberhood of Fallmouth for the Lord nose how long, hes suddently ben ordered on a
                  fool's errant to Manasses, arter Jackson. He's a sprisin man, is Ginral Macdoill.
                  Settin aside Siezer, Hanna Bull, and Haveluck, he is eggsheld by few, and
                  eggseeded by nun. His former masteerly retreet from Manasses fully entitles him, I
                  should say, to be sent thar agen.</p>
               <p>Wot do you think of the Banks affare? We regard it here as an amazin peace of
                  strategy. A trap peers to hev ben sot for the rebels, and Banks and his five
                  thousand left for bait. Jackson, the poor ignarunt old rat, walked inter the
                  snare, tooth and toe-nail, and ef he happens to git off with a claw this time, in
                  coarse we must do as the old wumman did when she used her husband's boddy for
                     eel-bait—<emph>try for anuther haul</emph>. Boddies of men is of no consekens

                  made old seecesh see stars. Hindsellman raked em fore and aft with his artillry
                  and musketry, and Sedgewick and Richardson gin em pertickler fits. As sun as our
                  men got the enemee outer the woods inter the open, whar they hed full skoop for
                  the bagnet, they gin em the cold iron. The Sutherners dont peer to keer a chaw of
                  tobacker for bullits, but they wont stand spittin. When they see the shinin steel
                  cummin at thar brests, they loose hart, and run like deers for deer life. But
                  runnin dident save em this time, for they was run throo by hunderds. Four hunderd
                  is sed to hev ben wiped out by the bagnet alone. I counted more'n a hunder myself

               <p>Senst the battel of Fair Oaks (or Fair Hoax as wun of our line offsirs of the
                  British perswashin calls it) things hes remained stashinary, with few adventers to
                  relate wuth pen ink and paper. Fact is, both sides was so all-slorterusly cut up
                  in that sangwinary struggel that all hands felt inklined to paws for a spell,
                  prevus to attemptin enny new feet of arms. The hull affair was as like the two
                  days shindy at Shylow, as wun little nigger is like its bruther. The rebels dun a
                  purty good six hours wurk on Saterday, and we paid em off, and sumthin over by way
                  of advance, on Sunday. Mutch, howsever, depends upon the Seckatry of War. If that
                  extrornary institooshin orders up the nessary re-enforcements, the seecesh army
                  will be defeated and disburst; but ef, on tuther hand, he refewses the the

                  jest as hard as they luck. More over they outnumber us in the preporshin of more'n
                  three to two, and ef the spasmodic Head of the War Department wishes to avide bein
                  tuck with anuther panicky pericksism like that he hed when he rit to the Guvner of
                  Massachusets for help, he'd better make shoor of a Union victry by puttin fresh
                  troops on the rout without delay. Report ses that the Seckantry was orfully

               <p>In the subbubs of Richmound the rebels hev a hunderd and ninety-nine thousand
                  men—more or less. Thar air sum green recrutes, but upon the hole the men air all
                  well drilled. Gustarvus Smith, the New York gutter-skraper hes charge of the
                  provishin depoes, and by his advice the raw cornfederit conskrips is used
                  prencepally in the cookin department. Longstreet's divishin is practisin the

                  Longstreet doosent agree. Smith ses Lungstreet orter hev swept Casey and Couch
                  from the feeld, at the battel of Fair Oaks, and Longstreet allows that the oney
                  sweepin charge ever made by Gustarvus was agen the corporashin of New York. Ginral
                  Early's divishin is the latest milentary arrival at the cornfedrit capital. A

                  fear of gettin hung by the Seecesh minority. The purceedins of the niggers is a

                  seems to be impendin over the devoted city. The place is not onhealthy, but the
                  populashin is getting thinner evry day in consekens of the drafts. The jails air

                  placed at thar doors by the provost marshal Winder, an offsir with a forbiddin

                  a misabul shyster about the Richmound courts, and is a harder christian than his

                     ether a fight or a foot race twixt this and Independence. In the meantime, you

                     the enemee, and so let it slide. The upper seckshin of the plan reperscnts the

                     hours, and that you may larn the trap hes ben sprung, by the wires, afore you

                     and ef theyre to be bleved-mind, I say ef theyre to be bleved—the Richmounders
                     is in a blamed poor way. The lucksheries of life in that volupshus city
                     consists of half rashins of corn-dodgers and wurmy pork; and sum of the F. F.
                     V.'s indulges on Sundays in weevely hominy and salt fish. I reckin that part is
                     troo, for a more lantern-jawed, herrin-gutted, grub-forsakin,
                     short-allowance-luckin set of ragged castaways was never taken off a raff at
                     sea, arter the oridginal number hed ben redooced wun hafe by cannabullism. As
                     to takin the oath, they'd swar a legions to Bellzebub for a bellyfull of beef
                     and a horn of red-eye. They state that the peaceabul citysins is offerin fifty
                     dollars a peace for substitoots, and that most of em turns out bad eggs and
                     skedaddles at the first opportoonity. They say also as the rebel ginrals
                     encurridges the men to fight by tellin em thars plenty to eat and drink in the
                     Union camps, and that thar desput charges is not caused so mutch by seckshinal
                     hatred as feroshus hunger. Sum may larf at this, but for my pairt Ide rayther
                     meet a feller in battle that hed a bone to pick with me pollytickally, then a
                     chap as wanted to be inter my meat house becase he thort the way to dinner was

                  don't place enny faith in the curryspondence of the daylie press, for to my
                  sartain nolledge most of the quill-drivers for the New York jernils is, and hes
                  ben ever senst Thursday last, in a mental condishin witch holy incapassitates them
                  from collectin thar idees, and ef the colleckshin was made, it would be about as
                  much like the facks of the case as a last years skarecrow is like the statoo of
                  Ginral Jackson at Washington. As to the detales, it would take a vollum of your
                  valabul paper to give em in full, or even hafe full—but I will say this, that
                  senst grit was developt in the human fammaly, it never was more conspickusly
                  displaid than it hes ben by the army of the Potomac, doorin its advance backards
                  under the preshure of sooperior numbers, from the Chickenhominy to Turkey bend. We
                  hev probly lost ten or twelve thousand men, and mebbe thirty or forty cannon, big
                  and littel, but we air now saift on the banks of James River, whar the broadsides
                  of more'n a duzzen gunboats will assist in layin the seecesh flat on their backs
                  ef they renoo the attact. We mowed em down for two hours yestday arternoon, in
                  reglar swaths, and I dont bleve they'll try it on agen on a suddent.</p>
               <p>The carnidge in both armies doorin the six days conflick has ben prodijus, but I
                  bleve that fur every two Union men wiped out about three rebels hes been
                  squelched. They gin us volly for volly, and more too, but our aim was the best,
                  and we hed the biggest lump to fire at, consekently the heft of the slorterus
                  reciprossity was on our side.</p>
               <p>The hull avalabul force onder Ginral Maclellin at the beginnin of the fight, was
                  rayther less than ninety thousand men, while the rebels hed full a hundred and
                  fifty thousand, and Ginral Stunwall Jackson arterwards rushed in with forty
                  thousand more. He's a smart man, is Stunwall—eenamost as remarkabul as a skillful
                  sojer as Freemount is as a nincumpoop—and that's payin him a high complement. In
                  coarse we eggspected his case would be attended to by the Shunandoor Ginrals, but
                  they patterned their tacktricks arter Ginral Patterson, when he was orderd to
                  pitch inter Johnston, and the consekens was that Jackson cum down upon us jest in
                  the nick of time, as Johnston did on Macdoill at Bull Run.</p>
               <p>I spose the same wunderful saygasity as weakened Bankses army when Jackson was
                  re-enforced, hes afforded this ruff and reddy rebel this new opportunity to
                  destingwish hisself at our eggspense. Westurn Virginny is said to be the Seckatry
                  of War's pet milentary deestrick, his speshil manoverin ground; and I trust when
                  the histry of that immens statesman, accomplisht sojer, and imminent telygraft
                  operator is ritten, his brilyant sarvices to his kentry in that rejin will receive
                  doo honor. Ef I was good at panijerk, I wouldn't mind pronouncin a ulowjim on him
                  in advance; but Ime afeard it wouldn't be appreshiated by the awjence by which I
                  am at present sirrounded. Indeed, the probility is that if I was to venter the
                  eggsperiment, I should be linched by the foot-soar, powder-siled, bleedin, groanin
                  thousands who hev jest ben ordered to prepair for anuther retreat of ten milds,
                  from Turkey bend to Harrassin's Bar. Setch is prejewdice. My cumraids, wun and
                  all, bleve that Seckatry Stanton is at the bottom of all thar misfortins, and
                  responsabul for thar discumforture. A minister in Japan, under a simildar cloud,
                  would whip out his swoord and hurry-skurry hisself at wunst-the idee in Japan bein
                  that when an offishal is thort to hev made a stab, axedental or otherwise, at the
                  vitals of the State, he is bound to insert a few inches of cold iron inter his
                  own. But in this kentry thars a more massyful way of gettin outer the diffikulty.
                  An onpoplar minister may resign or he may be kickt outer offis inter everlastin
                  obskewrity. Prehaps ef the illustrus head of the War Department was to take the
                  former method of retirin on his lorils, it mought be satisfactory to an ongrateful
                  kentry. Republicks is setch thankless consarns that I shouldent be sprised ef
                  three-forths of the commoonity would rejice at setch a catastrofy. Sumwhars in
                  profane history, I reckin it must hev ben in Pluto's lives, Ive red of a feller of
                  the name of Arestidees, who was banishd bekase peeple was tired of heerin him
                  crackt up for his honesty. Possably the Seckatry of War's feller citysins is tired
                  of heerin him crackt up for his energee and cetery, who nose? Arestidees was tride
                  by ginral eleckshin with oyster shells for ballots, and the verdick was
                  "skedaddle", witch he dun. I wunder wether Seckatry Stanton wouldn't be shelled
                  out of the kentry ef he was put to vote in the same way.</p>
               <p>To-morrer, or prehaps this arternoon, we shall start for Harrassin Bar, and
                  eggspeck to be harrasst by the rebels on our retreat, but we shall keep along the

                  commandin ginral thinks that if we air attact we ken hold our own. Yesterday

                  of em prisners. Sum say Ginral Magruder is among em, but I hevent seen him yet. As

               <p>Considerin the way this army was pitcht inter doorin the late ripstavin fights, it
                  recooperates amazin rapid. Bein posted on risin ground, we air abuv the reach of
                  myasmatic inflewences. In the onhelthy wilderness from witch we hev eskaped, the
                  men sufferd with agar, for it rekwired the constistooshin of the hoss to stand the
                  moreasses; but in our present cool and deliteful summer retreat, the sick and
                  wownded is progressin favorably, and I larn from the docters that thars but few
                  deths from deceases of the liver. Prehaps this is owin, in part, to change of
                  treatment, as no blue pills hes ben adminstered to the troops for sum days past.
                  Nothwithstandin our losses, it was well we dug out when we did, from the swomps
                  beyont Gains' Mill, utherways ninetents of us mought hev found our graves
                  thar.</p>
               <p>Cullerd refewgeese from the rebel camp represents that thousands of thar sojers
                  was thrown inter a state of halloosinashin by the gunpowder cocktails with witch
                  they refresht tharselves doorin the recent cumbats. It peers that a kwart of
                  red-eye stiffened with hafe a pound of powder, was sarved out to each vetran, and
                  a dubble doste to the new conskrips, evry day doorin the struggel. In coarse the
                  solushin of rot-gut and saltpeter kept em continally corned, witch ackounts for
                  thar makin a salt arter a salt with the vigger of fresh troops, when we sposed all
                  the grit hed ben taken outer em. But last week, arter the final acshin, reachsin
                  commenst, and setch a bellerin and rorin as thar was in the seecesh ranks (ef the
                  fudgetives is to be bleved) was never heerd afore outside of an insanitory
                  institooshin. They all sposed, as if ushally the case in <emph>many a
                     potyous</emph>, as the Grate Incinderary was in pershoot of em with a red hot
                  poker and bein awar that the contents of thar stummickss was highly cumbustabul
                  and extree-hazardus, they naterally dredded to cum in contract with setch a
                  weepin. Accordin to the contrabands, sum fansid they was bumshells, and puttin
                  thar tungs out, rekwested thar cumraids to eggstingwish the fuse. It seems
                  tharfore that altho gunpowder punch may be an all-feroshus fightin beveridge, yet
                  ef a man takes it till he gets shot in the neck, it is liabul to play the devil
                  with him.</p>
               <p>Our lines eggstend from jest belo Harrassin Landin about seven milds up streem,
                  and the current report is, that we air to remain on the banks of the river ontil
                  the new levees is razed and drilled, and we ken advance with the sartainty of
                  overwelmin the insirgents. In the meantime, re-enforcements is reachin us in
                  transports, and the hull army is as happy as Irishmen at a wake. The rashins is
                  bully, as plenty of fresh beef cums up from the Fort evry day. Consekens is, we
                  air all galinin flesh. On the march from the Chickenhominy, we hed nothin but the
                  hardest kinder crackers, and its a wunder we dident fizzle out on setch repulsive
                  fare. More'n five hunderd contrabands is now emploid in the cookin department, and
                  no one complains that animal food is meated out with a niggerd hand. The
                  opertoonity to bathe is also a fine thing for the men, and hunderds of em may be
                  seen cuttin up thar jimnasticks in the James, at all hours of the day.</p>
               <p>In short we all feel in boyant sperrits, and sink or swimn, sirvive or perish, we
                  are reddy to strike out wunst more for Richmound at the word go. We could drive
                  the rebels like deers ef we oney hed Fort Darling. The plan is for the gunboats to
                  git a brest of it while we open on its rare with our breeching pieces, but this
                  kant be dun without a bigger force than the Girnral now hes at his disposhal. When
                  Darling yields to our arms, a few powerful rams will sun clar the channel from
                  piles and uther obstruckshins, and the strong hold of Virginny will be ours.
                  Howsever its idol to count chickens afore thar hatched, as I confess I did when we
                  began to shell the rebels on the Chickenhominy. I crowed a leetle might too kwick,
                  thats a fack.</p>
               <p>Nuthin ken be luvlyer'n our present elevated lowcashin. The gentle slopes over
                  witch we lately retreated is a perfeck panorammer of pictoresk buty, altho in
                  menny places the rebel corn hes sufferd from the tramplin feet of our sojers.
                  Feeld larks sings in the meddows all day long, and all throo these moonlight
                  nights the encurridging notes of the "whip-her-well" seems to foretell the cumming

               <p>On Toosday evenin last the hull army was thrownm inter convulshins of delight by
                  the suddent apperience of the President. He is in fine helth and sperrits and is
                  heving a tall time, holding revews and treting us all to a perfeck <foreign>few de

               <p>This mornin he axed me why he resembeld Ginral Maclellin. As he meshurs, six feet
                  five in his stockin feet and our glorlus little Mac is oney five feet six with his
                  boots on, I couldn't see it, but he immediently releved me from the angwish of
                  suspense, by statin that it was bekase he hed jest left the White House for James
                  River. Seein he was in the humerus vain, I gin him the follerin: ses I "Why is the
                  Seekatry of War like a lame letter carryer?" He couldn't wool it, so I hed to
                  eggsplain to him that the Seckatry of War was like a lame letter carryer, on
                  ackount of not bein the right Man for the Post. He wouldn't see it, but I told him
                  the peeple did. Arter remainin silent for a few moments, doorin wich I persoom he
                  was turnin the Seckatry over in his mind, the ushil pleasant twinkle cum back to
                  his eyes, and he inkwired ef I could tell him wot to do with Freemount. "My
                  venabul frend," ses I, "ef you want to do the clean thing, and wash your hands of
                  him altogether, giv him the entire cummand of the famus basin in the Rocky
                  Mountings, witch he ses he diskivered, and send Kit Carson with him to show him
                  whar it is." That fotched him—he larfed till he kwivered all over like a bean-pole
                  in a thunder-gust, and remarkt, that ef the Pathfinder would strike a bee line for
                  ennywhars outer sight, he wouldent mind treatin him to a coach and four, witch he
                  onderstood was his favrit travellin eckwipedge and re-instatin old Saygoney as his

               <p>Arter an hour or so's conversashin of a similder improovin carrickter, we pairted
                  with resiprical eggspreshuns of affeckshin and regaird. He will leve for

                  Honest Old Abe! he desarves the name. As a paytryit, he cums up to my standard.

                  a saift place in the Sennit chamber, may be made chief of balloons to this
                  divishin, as his nateral taste for gas would no doubt render him a first-rate
                  airynaught; and he mought take Freemount with him as an assistant to pill the
                  valves. Freemount resined his cummand in the presents of the enemees of his
                  kentry, and Mister Chandler went a leetle furder, by pitchin inter Ginral
                  Maclellin, jest arter he hed repulst em. Two setch conjenal sperrits would be
                  kwite to hum together in the clouds, and ef they should never cum down I ken oney
                  say that better men hev disappeard senst the time of Elijah. Ef the Seckatry of
                  War wants the right man in the right place, let him by all means puts his frend
                  Chandler at the head of the gasbag department, and send him up, with the
                  Pathfinder, to take a birds eye view of the Conduck of the War. Should the wind be
                  in the direckshin of Richmound, thar would be no harm in cuttin the balloon cord,
                  so as to make it smooth sailin for em to the rebel capital. Its easier to go thar
                  by gas than enny uther way.</p>
               <p>While the North is beatin up recrutes to enabul us to beat the rebels, we air

                  offsirs when they go by, and two minits arterwards theyre at it agin regairdless
                  of thar immortal soles. Its astonishin, considering the number of relidgus

               <p>Wen conjestive fever gits hold of a feller its no joke. It nox you down and sets
                  onto you like an inkabus, forbiddin the use of the pen. I speak by the keard, for
                  senst my last Ive hed a life-or-deth-rastle with this bog-bear of the South, and
                  cum all-blazin near gettin the <foreign>coo de grass</foreign>. Hed I ben tuck
                  with it in the Pawmonkey Swomp, no dout I should hev got my everlastin furlow, but
                  this high ground is more faverabul to valleytoodinarians, and tho mutch broken, I
                  am gradjelly mendin. At wun time my mind wanderd to that degree that the doctors
                  considered me a goner, but thars a Providence as shapes our eends, and mine warn't
                  shaped, it seems. Consekently, here I am settin up on my cot in the sick shanty,
                  with a swimmin in my hed and an orful sinkin at my stummick, tryin to get sumthin
                  lively throo my har for the collumes of the Merkary. You musn't andizzypate
                  ennything, very brilyant, howsever, for I feel as ef my upperwurks was whizzing,
                  and jerkin, and snappin, like a Yankee clock outer gearin.</p>
               <p>Its extrornary wot strange things the most sensabul man may say wen laborin onder
                  the helloocynashins of delirum. Ef the fattest offis in the gift of the guverment
                  was offerd by advertisement to the purest paytryits, I don't bleve a truer friend
                  of the Union than I be could be skared up atwixt the fedral city and Funnel Haul;
                  and yet I larn that when the fever was on, me I acktilly blastfeemed the
                  administrashin and even spoke in disporridgement of that Playdum of our Libties,
                  the mighty wurrier and statesman of Illanoy. Ef it hedent a ben that the cumraid

                  take a fence at him.</p>
               <p>It peers I thort I hed the President and sum of his constitooshinal advisers caged
                  in a carryvan and was totin em throo the North, for a sho. My nuss ses I addrest
                  the imadginary awjinces as follers:</p>
               <p>This feller citysins (pintin inter vacancy) is Abraham Lincoln, President of the
                  United States, called for shortness, and bekase, he was never addickted to petty
                  larceny, Honest Abe. He's an astonishing man at axin chesnut trees and
                  cannondrums, and ken split rails or sides with equil cumplaysensy. Mr. Lincoln, my
                  poplar frend, be kind enuff to favor this enlightened awjence with a
                  button-buster. He wishes to no, ladies and gentlemen, why his boot is like an
                  ainshent Greek republick? I dessay youll never guess, for it lucks considabul more
                  like the kingdom of Italy, a few sizes less than life. He eggsplains. His boot is
                  like an ainshent Greek republick bekase it has a Sole on. Prehaps the answer is
                  obskewer. Agen he will eggsplain: Solon was a wise man of antickity, but at the
                  present day Solan geese may be found in Greenland. You see his nollidge is
                  univarsal. Ef time permitted, he would be reminded of a story, but unfortnitly he
                  hes to be returnt to the seat of guverment before the commensment of the Fall
                  camppain. Observe, his eye twinkles—he hes an idee. Wot is it, your eggsellency?
                  He wishes me to state to this intelleckshal assemblidge witch I considder the most
                  wunaderful of all his stories. It's onpossible—thars setch an innoomerable number
                  on em, and theyre all so mutch alike. Wunst more he eggsplains: The most wunderful
                  of all his stories, is his uppers story. Thars no repressin his humor, you
                  perceeve; it spurts outer him like patroleum from the mouth of a Pennsylvania ile
                  well. His waggish tales would make a dorg larf, and its a pity thars not time to
                  git em off. Mebbe you would like to larn why this cherful citysin was eleckted to
                  the Eggseggative Cheer. For variety, ladies and gentlemen, for variety. All our
                  prevus cheef madgistrets led ben grave and dignified, and we wanted a rib-tickler
                  I spose. We've got wun, ennyhow. Like the man in the drayma, he peers to think as
                  all the world's a stage, and he wants to star it as a low commedian. He preposes
                  to save the Union on jocular prenceples; but I'me afeerd the larf wont cum in at
                  present. In the meantime, howsoever, it is a consolashin to know that wotever
                  disasters may overtake the nashin, the White House will allus be a merry as a
                  circus. The President nods and winks in the affirmative, and would offer a closin
                  remark. He says that care killed a cat, but never averted a catastrophy; and that
                  even the solem old Roman Emprors, wen they went to the sennit, had a set of
                  fellers called lickters, that carrid thar farces before em. You ken set down now,
                  Mr. President, wile I stir up the Seckatry of War.</p>
               <p>This, ladies and gentlemen (settin up the cot bolster) is the head of the War
                  Department. Wot he doosent no about milentary<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000089"/> tary strutegy and setch, all the ginrals in the
                  wurld kant teetch him. He is an inch taller than the fust Napollyun, and
                  considabully heavyer. You air awar wot the results of the conflick hes ben so far.
                  Well we owe evrything—incloodin the masterly back down in the Shunadoor Valley—to
                  this extrornary critter. Hip! hip! hip! hurrah! Why in thunder don't you cheer?
                  Youve heern, prehaps, that him and Ginral Maclellin doosent set up thar horses
                  together. But I hev it from the Playdum of our Libties, in the nex cage, that
                  Ginral Maclellin lucks upon the Honabul Seckatry with much affeckshin, and
                     <foreign>vicey versey</foreign>. Take him altogether, the Seckatry of War is
                  the biggest thing out in the milentary line, and ennybody that kwestins his
                  capassity for war and conkest will be immediently supprest as a dumestic
                  traitor.</p>
               <p>Setch was the style in witch I raved, as I onderstand, for more'n twenty-four
                  hours, wile the loonatic fit was onto me. Chase, Welles, and Seward cum in for
                  considabul abuse; but it seems I pitcht hardest inter Honest Old Abe and Seckatry
                  Stanton, two men as I equelly luv and esteem wen in the perseshin of my senses.
                  But ef a fellers outer his hed, just wot he don't want to say, and dont oughter
                  say, is wot he invariably doos say.</p>
               <p>Thars a counsel of war among the leadin offsirs to-day, and the rummer is that a
                  push is to be made at wunst for Richmound; but, on the uther hand, dont be sprised
                  ef you heer of a rebel push for Washington in less'n ten days from now. Thars

               <p>The army of the Peninsular hes rekivered from the hard batting it reseved in
                  changin its base, and is impayshint to hev the ball agin set in moshin. For sum

                  air not to advance and captivate Richmound—kwite the contrairy. The fack is that
                  the sickly seesin is cumming on, and the army is gwine to make a grand strutegic
                  slantendicaler slide for the bennyfit of its helth. Hunderds of our best hosses is
                  dyin of intestinal disorders, and the overfed buzzards bein too fat and lazy to
                  keer about hoss flesh, the aromer of discomposin carryon is onhelthily loud. The

                  air about to start in pershoot of that health and happiness which the Declarashin
                  of Independents grantease to evry citysin. The American Constitooshin is naterally
                  rayther weak, and it would be madness to risk the lives of the champions of the
                  Union in a struggle with the Suthern pestilence. Takin all these things inter
                  considerashin, the Peninslu is to be evackiated afore diaree sets in.</p>
               <p>I dunno as I oughter rit that last sentens, but the cat's shoor to be outer the

               <p>So eends our gloryus six-munts camppain in these diggins. The grand army of the
                  Potomac, that was to take "no step backards", arter being licked hafe a duzzen
                  times on this insignificant tung of land, is now necessiated, in spite of its
                  teeth, to make a rutdegrade moovement. Whars that sevagrus reptyle, the grate

                  sales and found wanting. It hes ben completely headed off and its tail is tolled.
                  Braver men and better sojers than the host as started on the root to Richmound
                  last March never drord a bead or fixed a bagnet. But how hey they ben engineerd?
                  Shuvvels and wheelbarrows hes ben the order of the day. They hev remainder is

               <p>Ime glad, however, that we air likely to quit these moreasses. Enny moove from our

                  edishin of the giant Blunderbore, we ken sartinly giv Ginral Lee and his
                  assoshiates thar quietus.</p>
               <p>Thars wun thing in the conduck of this war witch must pervoke the admirashin of
                  the hull civilized wurld, and that is the screwpullus perliteness and
                  distinguished considerashin with witch we treat the bullyin blaggards in command
                  of the seecesh armies. Ginral Lee writes to Ginral Halleck that he lucks upon sum
                  of our Major Ginrals and Bragadears as robers, cutthroats, murderers and pirits,
                  and menshins the names of a few that he means to hang when he ketches them. To
                  this Ginral Hallecock replies that as sketch langwidge is insultin to the
                  government of the United States, he <emph>respeckfuly</emph> declines to receive
                  it. The idee of <emph>respeckfully</emph> declining the insults of a blustering
                  traitor peers to me to be the height of human curtsey, and desarves to be recorded
                  in Histry as a tip-top specement of perlite litteratoor in the Nineteent Sentry.
                  But Ginral Maclellin is ekwilly considerit, ef not more so. While the rebels amuse
                  tharselves with setch practickle jokes as cuttin the throtes of unarmed Unionists,
                  and hangin em heels uppards, with thar entrals in thar mouths (I sor with my own
                  eyes the boddies of two lyal citysins as hed been sarved in this way, near the

                  subjugashin" it must be conducted "upon the highest prenceples known to Christian
                  civilizashin." Not a war of subjugashin! What in the name of chain-lightnin is it
                  then? To subjugate, my old dickshinary ses, is "to compel to submit". Don't we
                  want to compel the South to submit? Ef not, spose we throw down our arms and ax

               <p>The grand advance to the rare witch I hinted at in my last epistol is accomplisht.
                  We hev eskaped triumfantly, without a scratch. When it is rememberd that it tuck
                  the Army of the Potomack sixteen munts to make its way up the Peninslur, and oney
                  forty-eight hours to return, the human mind relizes with amazement the rapid
                  strides that hes ben made in milentary sience senst the commensment of this
                  majestickle struggle. It is onnessary to giv the particklars of our sole-refreshin
                  trip from Harrassin Landin to Yorktown. We left the plesent waterin-place whar we
                  hed ben so long reposin on our lorils about day-brake on Friday, the fifteent
                  instant, and arrove here on Sunday arternoon, singin sams of victry. The rebels,
                  bein engaged in uther persoots, sufferd us to vamose without firin a shot.
                  Opinyins differs, howsever, as to the resin we warnt mislested on the march. Sum
                  thinks that as the mane objeck of the Seecesh hes<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000091"/> all along ben to get us off the Peninslur, they
                  porpusly left the coste clar for the performence of this brillyant peace of
                  warlike strutegy. That porshin of the army as went in transports to Fortress Munro
                  happily arrove saift, with the artillry, stores, and cetry, so that nuthin to
                  speak of hes fallen inter the hands of the discumforted fo, barrin the territory,
                  witch we hev ockypied doorin the summer as a milentary cematery.</p>
               <p>So mutch for the late brillyant manover. Of the moovments now in contemplashin I
                  must speak cawslusly. Consentrashin is the idee for the ensooin camppain.
                  Maclellin, Burnside, and Pope is edgin up to wun anuther, and by the time this
                  reeches you they oughter all be within sportin distans. And not a bit too sun
                  nuther, for, as I told you three weeks ago, the rebels is goin to make a desput
                  push for Washington. Thar hull army in the Southwest, it is sed, hes ben orderd to
                  jine Ginral Lee, and all thar troops in frunt of Richmound is now moovin tords the
                  Deestrick of Columby. Thar'll be a bluddy fite within ten days from this date, and
                  I trust and bleve a Union victry. By that time we oughter hev 350,000 troops in
                  Virginny, and onless they air mismanaged most orfully, Seecesh will hev to holler
                  and run.</p>
               <p>Oney let our milentary leaders abandun strutegy and pitch right in, and we ken
                  smash em. All Ime afeard on is, complicated plans and intrickit skeems. The
                  scientific dodge game is playd out. Shot and shell, bullet and bagnet, fire and
                  swoord, is to settle this bizness. It ken be finisht up no uther way. We must fite
                  the rebels day in and day out. It wont do to giv em a back fall, and then wait for
                  em to rekiver thar wind for anuther rastle. Wen we've got em down we must stomp
                  onto em, and never kwit jumpin on thar carcusses ontil they cease to sho enny
                  sines of life.</p>
               <p>In coarse this stile of warfare will seem dredful crewel to sum. I hev a
                  broad-brimmed unkel belongin to the Sosity of Frends as would call it barbarus.
                  Wal, war is barbarus. The prencepal is to "kill, kill, kill," as the mad king ses
                  in the drayma.</p>
               <p>Purty sun we shell outnumber the rebels two to wun. In bone and mussel the Nuthern
                  troops is sooperior to the Suthern, and in pluck fully thar ekwils. Evrything
                  depends on the way our men is handeld.</p>
               <p>The Stars and Stripes will wave over Jeff Davis's head-kwarters in Richmound afore
                  the middle of October, ef our ginrals will oney fite insted of fendin off.</p>
               <p>Knowin that onless they ken gain a big victry afore our new army gits inter the
                  feeld, they air gon, bob and sinker, Lee and his assoshits will make a tremenjus
                  rush for the fedral capital with all the forces they ken muster, right away. Ef
                  they ketch Pope, Burnside, or Macllellin onsupported, its not onlikely that the
                  divishin cort nappin will git an ongodly beltin; but ef the three divishins closes
                  up and givs battle to the Cornfedrits, they'll be whipt jest as sartain as Floyd's
                  a theef and Magruder's a drunkard. The simperthisers in Washington allow that
                  thar'll be four hunderd thousand Seecesh onder arms in the Old Dominion afore the
                  fust of September. Gas and gammon! All thar troops in the feeld from wun
                  eggstremity of Seeceshy to the uther, incloodin gorillas, doosent amount to more'n
                  that number, and they hevent 175,000 sojers in the State of Virginny to-day.</p>
               <p>No reliance whatsumdever is to be placed on the stories of noosepaper
                  curryspondents about the rebel force in these rejins. It was stated at fust by sum
                  of these gesswurk humbugs that Stunwall Jackson hed sixty thousand men when he
                  attacted Ginral Pope's advance; then they put the number down to thirty thousand,
                  and, finerly, to fifteen thousand. The truth is, he hed barly six thousand!</p>
               <p>Its my firm bleef that thars as menny Union as thars rebel troops in Virginny, and
                  that all our ginrals hev to do is to mass thar divishins together, and sail in to
                  sartain victry.</p>
               <p>As to rebel re-enforcements from the Southwest, who keers for that. Doosent our
                  new recruits pore in from the North faster'n they ken send troops from
                  Chatternogo? Let em bring thar hull Southwestern army on here ef they dar. Buell
                  and Curtis ken then ockapy all thar posishins in that kwarter, while we punish em
                  here.</p>
               <p>But all depends, as I sed afore, upon our ginrals. Ef they don't sho tharselves in
                  airnest—ef they play the old shilly-shally shuvvel and wheelburrow game—ef they
                  don't make it war to the knife, and the knife to the hilt—tell evry rebel now in
                  arms is ether slorterd, or captivated, or flyin for life—then the games up on our
                  side.</p>
               <p>Hopin, blevin, prayin, and eggspectin, that we shell lick rebellyon, and that
                  rebellyun will lick the dust, I remane, swoord in hand and pistil cockt for mortal

                     bitterly true. He only says what thousands think. A more loyal citizen than he

               <p>I hev jest cum over here from Washington, whar, for the last three days, I hev ben
                  actin as a naid to the surgin-ginral and his staff, who hes ben overheadandears in
                  surgycall bizness, in consekens of the continnal pourin in of the wownded ever
                  senst the retreat from Bull Run to Centreveal. Pope is fallin back at a purty
                  actyve pace, and it seems from the hevvy skrinmmidge near Fairfacts Court-House on
                  Munday night that a considabul outlyin boddy of the enemees troops was then
                  closter to Washington than he was. Sum thinks they'll be ketched in a snair;
                  uthers allows as Pope will be attacted in frunt by Lee, while Jackson bumbards his
                  rare, and that atween the two his numerus tiles will be held as in a vice; but I
                  trust it will prove vicey-versy. The seecesh universally pretends to take the
                  latter vew of the case; but I gess theyre oney blowin, blast em. One thing's
                  sartin, howsever; that cunnin old rebel bird Ginral Jackson, got Ginral Reno inter
                  an ambush on Munday evenin down to Fairfacts, and tho the rebels was finerly druv
                  in, a hull divishin cum all-critical near bein cut off, besides loosin the brave
                  Kearny and Stevens, two as thurrowhred heroes as ever fit for the old flag senst
                  she was fust unfurld on the battle feeld of Saratoga eighty-three years ago.</p>
               <p>It must be confest that matters at present wares rayther a glummy aspic, and it
                  seems as ef the old sarpint was dooin his all-sulfurus utmost to help the rebel
                  cawse. I spose he simperthises<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5729-00000094"/> thises
                  with it on ackount of his hevin ben a traitor hisself and compeld at an airly

                  Pairodice to the unhelthy lowcashin war he now hangs out. But altho Sinsinnaughty
                  is threttened by the blastfeemin rebels with the fate of the cities of the Plain,
                  and Merryland, in consekens of Jackson's reported bender, is blevd by menny to be
                  in a grevus strait, me and my cherful and mayjestic frend, the lofty and lively
                  Lincoln, hes still the strongest confidens in the ultimut tryump of the Union
                  arms. <foreign>Legs tallionis</foreign> he ses will sun be the order of the day,
                  and he hops, to use his own sublime eggspresshin, "that the six hunderd thousand
                  men now runnin regairdless of eggspens to the reskyou of thar kentry, will sunner
                  or later return to the peaceful walks of civil life." Nuther him nor me bleves
                  that the cabbynet imbersillity and milentary jelassy and want of gumpshin, is goin
                  to swomp the Union; and we dont mean to bleve it ontil Washington is tuck by
                  storm, Bawltomore surrendered, Sinsinnaughty conflagrated, and a conkerin Suthern
                  army on root for Philadelphy and New York.</p>
               <p>It is cheerin to refleck that the last battle of Bull Run hes not been follered by
                  wus consekenses than the fust. Ginral Pope hes trod ackeritly in the footsteps of
                  his illustris predecesher Ginral Macdoill—vamosin from Bull Run to Centreveal,
                  from Centreveal to Fairfacts, and from Fairfacts to Washington, whar I persoom he
                  will arrive to-day or to-morrer. The former—wun of the modestest men in the army,
                  and remarkabul for the number of prisners he takes—announst a tremenjus victry at
                  Bull Bun, jest as Ginral Macdoill bed dun afore him, and tuck the back track by
                  way of Centreveal, Fall's Church and Fairfacts, perzackly in the same way—oney
                  Macdoill's pace was rayther lower down among the forties than Pope's. I persoom,
                  howsever, ef Pope hedent hed them seventeen thousand prisners to restore to libty,
                  as he marveld along, he mought hev ekwild the time of that gentmanly ginral.</p>
               <p>I call him gentmanly, bekase the rebels sed he was a gentman and respeckted his
                  baggidge as setch at Catlett's Stashin, and they oughter kno. The Army of the
                  Potounac will mebbe be tonight about in the persishin it was in prevus to marchin
                  outer the fedral capital for Richmound more'n a year ago "singin sams and hims of

                  twelve hunderd millyuns of dolors and using up two hunderd thousand men, that "the
                  government feels satisfied that Washinton is saift." In coarse ef the guverment is
                  satisfied the peeple must be satisfied. How in the name of desputism and Fort

               <p>I seen considabul of my venabul and farseeshus frend the President doorin the
                  short time I was in Washington, and am happy to state throo your collumes, to the
                  popolashin of this continent and the nashins of the airth in ginral, that his
                  Eggsellensy is as spry as a cricket. The keers of State doosent peer to hev dampt
                  his sperrits a mite, and notwithstandin the desputes of his ginrals and the

                  without sesashin, as ushil. He axed me yestday when I called to make my adoos at
                  the White House, "why thar was a difference atwixt Admiral Goldsburrow and the
                  hero of the Battle of Lake Erie." I remarkt that it was prehaps bekase the latter
                  went in and won, and the former oney went out and wonderd.</p>
               <p>"No," ses the distingwished Head of the Commonwelth, "no sirree!—it is bekase
                  Admiral Goldsburrow hesn't got no <emph>Perry Cranium</emph>." I hop the Naval
                  Champyun of Hamton Roads wont think it nessary to resine on ackount of this
                  harmless joak, and I dont think he will, for its purty much the same with offishal
                  foo-foos now, as it was in old Hickory's time, "few dies and nun resines."</p>
               <p>It will no dout be a consolashin to the down-harted kentry in the present tryin
                  crysis to larn that her eggsellensy, the lady Presidentess, is in salubrus helth,
                  and drives about in a butiful bayrush and pair, with et ceterys, lucking as
                  paytryotic—witch she is—as ef she hedent a traitor relashin in the world. She is a
                  remarkabul wumman; not so slim as the Empress Euginny; nor so tall as the Empress
                  of all the Rushes; nor so short as Queen Victory; but combinin all thar kwalities
                  of mind and person in a manner that it is diffikult to deskribe. Fearin I should
                  be onabul to do the subjeck jestice,I shall not attempt it; but ef the publick
                  mind will take the trubble to imadgin the stately grace of the two continental
                  empreses and the benignitty of the iland queen, kinder malgamated and mixed up and

               <p>My asspirashins is disappinted. Long ear now I eggspected to hev ben on the march;

               <p>But it warn't to be. It was my fate to be a nobjeck of competishin. About an hour

                  droring-rum cheers, with that winnin grace for witch he is notoryus, "D. V.," old

                  confidens in you then in all the bullheads in my cabnet. Salmon Chase, to be sure,
                  is well enuff," he continned, "but I kant go Seward; and as to the funkshinary of

               <p>I yielded, for I felt that to leve the rooler of the nashin, at setch a moment,

                  Maclellin is arter em in Merryland with at sharp stick, and ef he doosent stop to
                  dig, thousands of em will find a bluddy grave on this, side of the Potomack. My

                     advices would seem to indicate a ten-strike. But the forten of war is onsartin,
                     eggsept for army contractors. Hooker was wownded in the foot while chasin the
                     fo, witch is rayther agen his cummin up with em, tho he's not the man to make

                     and a hafe long, its onpossabul to say wether the wun that's tuck cummanded
                     enny of thar persishins. Upon the hull, the probility is that ef the rebel army
                     hes been forced to the Potomac, and ef the river hes riz as reported, it will
                     uther sirrender or be stript of everything, and hev to swim for bar life.</p>

                     think he's gin the Freemounters jessie, as well as treted the rebels to a lofty
                     fall. But in a fight, much depends on keerful backers. Mebbe ef Stanton hed ben
                     his bottle-holder, insted of Halleck, he mought hev ben fibbed down, as he was
                     on the Peninslur.</p>
                  <p>D. V.—Gess youre right thar my junior Hickory. Stanton's a fine feller—a kinder
                     feller in fack that would stand at a man's back and see his brains blown out
                     without budgin a har's bredth; but upon the hull I don't crave to fight under
                     his asspieces. Onderstand me, howsever, I hev nuthin to say agin the Seckatry
                     of War. Far from it. I consider him a present man for a small party, and as his

                  foremanship? We air a teem and a hafe and a bull tarrier atween the ropes, and no
                  mistake. That Nigger-manspayshin dockament was a sockdolager, warnt it? Its sum I
                  tell you, and ef it doosent eend the war afore nex summer the blacks will be sure
                  to rise in the fall. Luck at the normus axseshins its goin to bring to the army
                  from the abelishinist ranks. Them nine hunderd thousand aunty-slavers thats ben a

                  for a start on the dubbel kwick for the last eighteen tunts, waitin for jest setch

                  stashens, blessin me and Abraham Lincoln, and resolved to kiver tharselves with
                  uniforms and glory. Let em cum—don't stop em—pervide transportashin for all of
                  em—and dont ax em whether they go for the Union as it was or it wasent, as it is
                  or it isent; but take advantage of thar fewroar and let em go in—outer the draft!
                  The kullerd peeple eggspects em, rain or shine, and Cashus of Kaintucky will cross
                  the Rubygun with em, and sink or swim, survive or perish in the attemp. A
                  proclamashin as brings nine hunderd thousand men inter the feeld is a dockament
                  that'll live, as the poick ses," to the last syllabub of recorded Time." Rich Loo
                  was right—"In the hands of men entirely great," like Abe and Me, "the pen is
                  miteyer'n the swoord!"</p>
               <p>Senst the abuv parrygraft was writ, a frend of mine, a feller who is allus puttin
                  a spoke inter other peeples weals, hes stept in and subjested a diffrent vew of
                  the case. He allows that the abelishinists heving nuthin at hart in this war but
                  the onfetterin of the kullerd race, will dekline takin up arms ontil arter the 1st
                  of January, for fare of fritenin the Suthern States and causen em to return to
                  thar a legions; tharby preventin the onfortnit slaves from bein "thenceforrard and
                  forever free." Consekently, he argoos, no help need be eggspected from that
                  kwarter ontil arter New Years. But I dont bleve it. It kant be as the luv of the
                  Manspayshunists for men of Afrikin dissent, is parrymount to thar luv of this
                  blessed Union. As to usin this plee as a subterfudge in order to keep clar of
                  danger (as the feller hinted when he was goin away)—that I wont credit. Sartainly
                  no American would plead affeckshin for the race of Ham as an eggscuse to save his
                  bacon. I tharfore dismiss the insinnerashin from my mind—tho I kant help wishin

                  korrected the spellin. We alone are the orthurs, and We take the responsbility. I
                  hed great difficulty in preventin the President from making a foo-foo of hisself,
                  by takin the advice of his Cabnet on the subjeck, but I suckseeded. I dont crave
                  enny man wurship for my sarvices, howsever. I am satisfied with deservin well of

                  the door, locked it, and hung his Skotch cloke and cap over the key-hole to

                  then shuck hands corjally like two old cumraids as we air, and sot down to airnest

                  would be a breech of confidens in me to menshin it. Tharfore, as an onabul man, I

                     with the President, he is continually beset, through the mails, with
                     applications to use his influence with that distinguished personage in

                     applications, it seems, are accompanied by sums of money, which, we are
                     rejoiced to learn, he devotes to the noblest of all charitable objects, the
                     liquidation of the public debt. For the information of the ignorant, we deem it
                     due to our correspondent to say, that he has never been in Congress, the New

                  delivers his remarkabul finanshil news to the awjence in an incoherent manner with

                  witch the Seckatry of the Navy hes kindly consented to enact Rip, and it is thort

                  Mr. Seward will act as stage manager, and Mr. Chase will giv out the checks. As
                  the army is eggspected to go inter quarters shortly, thar will no doubt be a large

               <p>The President and me are dooin wot we ken to save the Union, but as he trooly
                  observes, its like the labor of Sissyfuss—a fabalus feller as is engaged in the

                  his hands, so thart it mounts to within arter all. We did spose that the Seccesh
                  was so effeckshally chawfed up by Uncle Sam at the battle of Aunteatem that afore
                  the, winter commenst thar wouldent be a grease pot left on em, But it peers the

                  gunpowder in thar rum as blinds em to thar own discomforter. Ennyhow, the more we
                  thrash em the less they seem inclinaed to acknolledge the corn. Decisive victries
                  doosent help us a might. The mane difficulty on our side peers to be want of
                  troops. We haint got mutch over three hunderd thousand men in Virginny and
                  Merryland, and re-enforcements oney arrives at the rate of three thousand a day;

                  evry day. The latest stile is douting the infallability of Major-Ginral Wool; and
                  as that distingwished Trojan hes no dout on the subjeck hisself, he has siezed the
                  douters and made em prisners of war. It is not troo, howsever, that he hes hed his

                  stop and saloot it, onder pain of a rest. That story is a liebil, got up by sum of
                  the high old seecesh simperthisers as inhabits that lowcality.</p>
               <p>The President and Me doosent alltogether approov of Ginral Wool's perceedins; and
                  the individyals as was rash enuff to kwestin his capacity will be payroled to-day.
                  We nuther of us agree with the Seckatry of War, as to the best method of puttin
                  down the rebellyun. He goes in for enforcin marshil lor and makin prisners of war
                  in the lyal North; while we air in favor of confinin them kinder operashins to the
                  rebellyus South. Howsever, we shell let him hev his swing ontil the suvrins hes
                  eggspressed thar vews, nex week, at the poles. Ef they side with us, he will
                  probly retire from public life to that cam obskewrity witch his talents and his
                  virtoos is so well calkilated to adorn. Should this be the case, I shall advise
                  the President to proclaim a ginral jail delivry of pollytickle prisners in the
                  Nuthern cities, and the re-establishment of the Union as it was, in all the Free
                  States. Ef New York and New England goes with Pennsylvany, Ohio and Indianny, agin
                  the suspenshin of <foreign>have his carcase</foreign> and Provost Marshils and
                  setch, the President will consider it an indicashin that the masses is opposed to
                  Constitooshinal Libty on the Austrean plan, and act accordinly. My illustrus frend
                  ses he is willin to be gided by the will of the peeple as spessified throo the

                  bullid long enuff, and would be yet, mebbe, ef it warnt for me. Not as I claim eny

               <p>In the absens of the President's amabul consort and air a parent, I am more with

                  remarkabul for his tenassity of porpus, wurks agent me night and day. But its no
                  use. A donkey-engine mought as well try it on with a fust-class high-presshur

                  the kentry; but declined takin his chice ontil arter the New York eleckshin. Wal,
                  the time hes arrove to make his seleckshin, but he still hangs in suspense, like
                  the Sircoffergus of Mayhumit atwixt the two magnates at Medinah. In the wurds of a

               <p>Ses I to his Eggslensy, immediently arter the New York eleckshin; We must smash
                  the Cabnet (hear in mind, I sed the <emph>Cabnet</emph>, not the
                     <emph>Constituooshin</emph>), and reconstruck. He smiled in the affirmative.
                  Ses I, in continiashin, the Onterrified hes nockt the mencipayshinests cold, and
                  bein masters of the sitiwation, they hev a right to be represented in offis. He
                  agreed to the observashin with a wink. Besides, ses I, the fienanshil meshurs of
                  the Administrashin doosent soot the publick, and evry boddy is as mad as hornets
                  at bein stuck with Blare's all-cussed stickin plasters. He nodded a cent to the
                  propersishin, and added that he hed allus looked on Blare as a square-dealin man;
                  but ef he was of a diffrent stomp, he wouldent adhere to him enny longer. Finerly,
                  we agreed to ship the hull boodle of Constituooshinal advisers, and emply a new
                  set, whoos names I gin you in my last epistol. I sposed it was all settled; but a
                  passel of ultree-Abelishinists got around my nobul payrun, and auuried him util
                  his spinal collume began to saften. Fust, he consented to hev Maclellin remooved.
                  I dont say wether he was right or rong; but I do say, the thing warnt dun in the
                  right way. The act was too suddent. It lucked too mutch like party sperrit; and
                  thar warn't suffishent resins assined for it. I told the Presi-<pb n="216-217"

                  keer no more for party pollyticks than I do for Jo Smith's Goldin Bible. But he
                  only srugged his sholders, as mutch as to say, needs must wen the devil drives.
                  Translatin the moovment en that light, I couldent help sayin that I wisht we hed a

                  K.</p>
               <p>Then I axed him about changin the Cabnet; and it peered from wot he sed, that ef
                  the present incumbrants was sacked, he would hev to put the bluest kinder hull-hog
                  mansipayshinists in thar places. I wanted to know why our oridjinal programmy
                  couldent be carrid out. Upon witch, he gin anuther hitch to his sholders, as ef to
                  intermate that the outside preshur onto him was too great. Then I venterd to hint
                  that even in down-trodden England, when the peeple voted agin the administrashin,
                  the ministers resined, and a batch with vews direckly oppersit stept inter thar
                  boots. He replid that he had hinted as mutch to the constitooshinal advisers, but
                  they indignantly remarkt that Great Briton was our nateral enemee, and it would be
                  degradin to the American carrickter to foller Brittish presidents and
                  eggsamples.</p>
               <p>I larn from the papers—for Ime not on speakin terms with the War Department—that
                  simontanusly with Maclellin's remooval, Freemount was orderd to report for dooty.
                  I should a thort we'd hed enuff of that milentary failur in Missoora and the
                  mountin department of Virginny; but I reckin Stanton's goin to giv him and that

                  thar charges doosent hev mutch effeck on the enemee, they will on the treshury. A
                  more weak and embezzele act than the revival of Freemount &amp; Co. I never heerd
                  on. I gin the amabul Abraham my opinyun on the subjeck, and told him that I
                  considerd it would be a radical error to put the Pathfinder on the war path onder
                  present suckemstances; to witch he replide, with a farseeshus twinkel of his
                  commic eye, that radical errors was so commun that wun or two more or less would
                  skarsly be notist, This mornin I inkwired of him ef enny ondertakin for overtakin
                  the pirit Semmes was onder way; to witch he responded by makin a jester with his
                  right thum over his left sholder; so I spose that godless buckunear will continny
                  to pray upon our commerce onmislested. As to the vessels that hes ben dispatched
                  to ketch him so far, its ben purty mutch like sendin tubs arter a whale.</p>
               <p>Alltogether, I feel discurridged, and hev hed sum thorts of leavin the Father of
                  his Kentry to row his hoe by hisself. But thar's so mutch good inter him, I dont
                  like to do it. Mebbe he'll straiten hisself arter a while, and, with my
                  assistance, giv the pickthanks as besets him a lofty fall. Hopin setch may be the

                  the meetin of Congress. Seckatry Chase—when not onavideably engaged in shinning
                  for small loans—is industrusly implide in figgerin out his Annual Report. It will
                  be an abel argument in faver of the idee that a currency cumposed eggscloosively
                  of rags, lampblack and sap green is preferabul abul on ackount of its buty,
                  porterbility, and the small cost of produckshin, to the preshus trash, grubbed at
                  setch a nonnus eggspense outer the bowels of the airth, for finanshil porpuses. It
                  is sed by Mr. Chase's friends that he will make this so clar that all the banks
                  will immediently see it and return at wunst to speshee payments, with the objeck
                  of gettin rid of thar gold and silver as a useless incumbrence. Mr. Chase is a
                  nice man for a small party—the ultra abelishin party, frinstance.</p>
               <p>The President and me hes ben a good deal together lately. We air fixin up the
                  Messidge. It will be a dockyment of sum lenth; fur a state paper, the consekenses
                  of witch air eggspected to reech far inter the futur, kant be skweedged inter a
                  nutshell. Still, we intend, ef possabul, to keep it down to sevin or eight
                  columes; but it may reech nine or ten. Thars oney wun thing cunsarnin the Messidge
                  that me and my lofty-minded coadjewter doosent agree about. He wants to take all
                  the responsability of the dooins of the Constitooshinal Advisers onto his own
                  sholders, while my advice is to let all offishal tubs stand on thar own bottums.
                  We shell crack up the mancipayshin projeck, and giv anuther corjal invitashin to
                  the Rebel States to lay down thar arms, hyst the Flag of the Free, and save thar
                  niggers. The colornizashin skeem will also be agin tutched upon; for when it cums
                  to capterin fore hunderd waggin-loads of "a man and a bruther" at wun hawl, it
                  becums nesessary, in the coarse of human events, to consider serusly wot is to be

                  happin to be thrown on our hands in a lump, by the conkwest of the South.</p>
               <p>We shell keep the Messidge open to the last moment, in case the capter of
                  Richmound or the Alabammer, or enny uther great event, setch as the army goin
                  inter winter-kwarters; frinstance, should cum off at the leventh hour. I could
                  tell you menny astonishin things in relashin to pollytickle matters here; but it
                  would be a breech of confidens. I may obsarve, howsever, that a crysis is

               <p>Washingtin is fillin up faster'n a Philadelfy Stashin-house arter a firemen's
                  fight. Publick pickpockits and pollytickle incinderies is as thick as flies in a
                  molasses cask and twiste as lively. The swell mob of corntractors as hev made thar
                  piles, with thar fammalies rigged out arter the latist Payris fashin plates, and
                  jeweld up to the nines, is dooin the peacock and butterfly bizness to an eggstent
                  that takes the shine outer all the furrin Plenipenitentiaries and thar soots; and
                  a new set of paytryotic Jeremy Diddlers, as hungry as seventeen year lowcusses as
                  hes jest chipt thar shells, is huverin around the public offisis in hops of makin
                  a raid on the greenbacks. Judgin from the morril aspeck of the majority of the
                  kumpany arrivin, I should say we air likely to hev a high old swindlin sesshin. Ef
                  the nashin is saved, it will be regairdless of eggspense. It is curius, but true,
                  that the biggest theeves hes the most to say about presarving the integrity of the
                  Union.</p>
               <p>You will hev lamed afore this reeches you that me and the President hes ben
                  rayther too mutch for the Seckatry of War. When I writ last, I hed jest receeved a
                  note from a frend in the war offis statin that the Honabul C. A. Daney, late
                  professor of milentary literatoor in the Tryboon Pollytecnick Academy, was
                  appinted Deppity Seckatry. Shortly arter dispatchin my letter, howsever, I
                  diskivered the informashin was prematoor; but that <emph>ef the President dident
                     object</emph>, the Honabul C. A. D. would take his place in the Administrashin
                  Line on the follerin day. I seen the modern Sinsinatus in his sanktum at the White
                  House that arternoon, and Mr. Daney hesent ben appinted. He ses he dosent keer
                  about bein Assistant-Seckatry. Mebbe not. Nevertheless you ken put down his
                  elevashin amung the axidents that mought hev happend, ef the Providence as shapes
                  our eends hedn't nockt him eendways. But in sayin that me and the President hed
                  ben rayther too much for the high minded and benevolent funkshinary at the head of
                  the War Department, I referd mainly to the order for the liberashin of State
                  prisners arrested without caws and held contrary to law, justis and humanity
                  inanity. When the thing was sot in the right light afore the Seckatry it was too
                  much for his felines. No dout he is a kindharted man at the bottom, when you git
                  to it. His better natur was apeeled to in this style.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Stanton, you ken librate those onfortnit captyves or rap yourself up in the
                  solitood of your own oridginality and retire, with the thanks of a grateful
                  kentry, to the shades of private life."</p>
               <p>He couldn't stand it. His eye glistend, his baird shuck with emoshin, his genrus
                  spirit relented, and he eggsclamed in axcents of the deepest paythos:</p>
               <p>"I am not made of iron. Open the Barsteels!"</p>
               <p>And he dun it. The prisners hes all ben oncaged, barrin one or twa as hedent
                  payshents to wait for this triump of filanthropy, and died in jail. I hope the
                  Seckatry's clemency will never be forgotten, and as a mark of the gratitood of the
                  peeple, I prepose that two stattoos of him be made outer bronze, at the public
                  cost, and put over the gateways of Fort Warren and Fort Laugheryet. When he
                  retires from the Cabnet—witch he may afore long—he oughter hev a furrin mishin. Ef
                  the President was to nominate him for Austree, the Sennit would, no doubt, confirm
                  the appintment.</p>
               <p>The messidge is compleat all but the figgers and facts from the Honabul Salmon P.,
                  and a brief flurrish at the openin and the tail eend, which will be very pius and
                  affectin. We calkilate to hev the dockyment reddy for the prenter's hands by
                  to-morrer evenin, ef Seckatry Chase ken make up his mind wot the publick det is,
                  atween this and then. He finds, as the statements cum in from the diffrent
                  burrows, that the sum totil is likely to eggseed his late ekinomical estimit of
                  640 millyuns to an all-startlin degree. I persoom, howsever, that the nayshin will
                  be let off purty cheap on paper, as tellin the trooth might create an onnessary
                  panic in the Stock Markit besides razing the premum on gold.</p>

                  sacrifises his conshense to his perliteness. Mrs. Lincoln, as you are awar, has
                  returnt to the Presidenshil Pallas, and thar is evry prospeck of a brilyant winter
                  onder her fashinabul patternage. The illustrus lady is to Washington wot the
                  Empress Eujinny is to Payris; in fack, as the man ses in the play, "She is the
                  gloss of fashin and the mould of uniform." I may be rong in the kwotashin, but the
                  sentiment is correck.</p>
               <p>The privit theaytrickles I spoke of in a former letter hes not yet cum off, but as
                  the offshal yarns is purty mutch all in, I persoom the Heads of Departments is
                  reddy at enny time to abandon goose kwills and foolscap, for the sock and

               <p>From the increasin number of army offsirs in the streets and bar rums here, I
                  persoom that a battel on the Rapperhammock may be lookt for at enny moment. Mutch
                  depends, howsever, upon the time it may take for the rebels to finnish thar
                  defenses at Fredericksbug. As sun as Lee and Longstreet is kwite prepard for a
                  shindy we shell probly go in. It is sed that the genrus and jewdishus Stanton
                  wishes em to be fully re-enforced, in order to show em how esily they ken be whipt
                  with all the odds in thar favor. The result—ef it happens—will no doubt be
                  terrably dishartnin, and prehaps eend the war with a blow. Bad wether may
                  interfere and pervent the catastrofy—but the Seckatry in coarse is not responsabul
                  for the wether Thats Heven's bizness and not hisn, as the boy remarkt when his

               <p>At lenth the tejus paws is over, and we hev pitched inter the enemee hand ovpr
                  hand. The kentry owes the suddent dash acrost the Rapperhammock to the President
                  and me. The leathergy of the War Department (and not the want of shoos as was
                  ginrally sposed) was the sole resin why the Army of the Potomac<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000114"/> didn't walk inter the rebels more'n two weeks ago.
                  My Illustrus Patron remonstrated agin the delay. He used the most forceabul
                  arguments he could think of—setch as "Delays is dangerous". "A stitch in time
                  saves nine", "Procrastinashin is the thief of Time", "Nuthin ventur, nuthin win",
                  and uther golden axeums from the mint of wisdum bequeethed to us by the ainshent
                  sages. But his elikwence was like purls cast afore swine. Stanton put him off with
                  invasive answers, and Halleck sent him milentary diegrams on sheets of foolscap,
                  as hed the aperience of bein made by a long-legged spider that hed jest crawled
                  outer an inkbottle.</p>
               <p>Things went on this way ontil last Toosday, when the President writ me a note that
                  he wanted to see me immediently on speshil bizness. He was standin on the frunt
                  door steps when I arrove at the White House, pullin his left whisker as is his
                  wont when his will is disregairded, and conduckted me at wunst to his sanktum. He
                  sed he was wurrid amazinly by the dogged obstinacy of the War Department, upon
                  witch I axed ef he wanted a peace of an honest man's mind.</p>
               <p>"Spit it out Old Fidelity," ses he, his feters lighten up with a hole-sold
                  smild.</p>
               <p>"Wal," ses I, "wot I hev to say in the first place is this. It's not so eesy to
                  lick ennyboddy as it is to lick noboddy, is it?" He remaned for a few minnits
                  absobbed in deep thort and then shuck his hed.</p>
               <p>"But," I continned, "its esier to lick a considabul boddy, then to lick the same

               <p>Arter a breef intervil for reflexshin he concurd.</p>

               <p>"D. V.," he rejined, smildin cumpleasantly, "you borrord that sillygism from a

               <p>"Ef so," ses I, "why in thunder don't you tell Burnside to go in and win, afore
                  the rebels sets thar airthwurks, and riful pits, and maskt batteries atwixt him
                  and Richmound, thicker'n mink traps in a Western swomp?"</p>

               <p>"Accordin to the Constitooshin, setch is my progative," he replied, takin his leg
                  off the arm of his cheer and drorin hisself up with nateral dignity.</p>
               <p>"Then," ses I, airnestly, "sail in. The Ship of State's in danger. Thar's lubbers
                  at the helium. Pitch em overboard and let you and me take the wheel alone."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" sithed he, in a plaintiff vice, "you want me to take the responsability; but
                  you know wot cum of that in the Macdoill affair."</p>
               <p>"That was onder bad advice," ses I. "Take mine."</p>
               <p>"State your platform and we'll see," he responded, puttin his feet on the

               <p>"Its jest this," ses I, impressivly. "Send a perumptry order to Ginral Burnside to
                  cross the Rapperhammock afore the week's over, and ef any resistance is made, to

                  <p>Ive ben sick. I <emph>am</emph> sick. Its on ackount of takin too mutch
                     responsability. Ime afeard the kentry will hold me ackountabul for the late
                     discomforture at Fredericksburg. Sartainly, I advised the President to order
                     Burnside to sail in; and, in dooin so, he run agin a snag. But wot could I do?
                     Halleck and Stanton bed setteld it that Richmound was to be attacted by the
                     Rapperhammock rout, and hed indooced my magnannymus frend to take a solem oath
                     on Helper's Crysis that he wouldent enterfear. In coarse he couldent perjer
                     hisself, and I was well awar that the longer we delayed goin in, the better
                     prepard the rebels would be to flax us out. It was a chice atwixt two evils,
                     and I tride to chews the leest. Ef the shindy hed ben postponied a fortnit
                     longer as was intended, our army would not oney hev ben severely wooled, but
                     utterly worsted.</p>
                  <p>You will reckolleck that I remarkt in my last epistol that ef it hedent ben for
                     the leathergy of the leatherheads in the War Department, our forces might hev
                     crost the river and bagged or disbursed the rebellyus hoards "weeks ago." But
                     the War Department, witch is allus forgettin sumthin, disrememberd to send the
                     pontoon bridges, and our army bein onabel, as the poick ses, to "walk the
                     waters like a thing of life", was compeld to remane with sinkin harts on the
                     rong side, while the enemee throo up thar airthwurks and prepard to vomit forth
                     a storm of fire and death onto us as sun as we began to operate. Wal, Banks was
                     off on a Quickshotic expedition to the Gulf, so thar warnt no hope of his makin
                     enny divershin to amews the enemee while Burnside pitched inter em in airnest;
                     so I thort it was best, as the mewsick hed to be faced, to face it at wunst.
                     Onder the suckemstances, wot better advice could I hev given? Ef the attact bed

                  <p>The President takes the disaster with that cherfulness witch belongs to his

                     cry over spilt milk, so he lucks at the affare from a farseeshus pint of

                  <p>But mebbe he will relent. Let us hop so.</p>

                     I rekwested him to spit it out, for I was in a hurry, and hed to attend sum to
                     serus bizness.</p>
                  <p>"Why," ses he, " the difference is that one's the slave of prenceple, and the
                     other's the prencepal of slaves."</p>
                  <p>I whistled ironically.</p>
                  <p>"Stop," he continued, "I've got anuther for you. Why is a splendid milentary

               <p>Burnside may not be wun of these onrepressabul milentary fenixes as nose no setch
                  ward as fail, but he's a morril hero, and no mistake. Ef he kant take brestwurks
                  like a Wellington, he ken take responsability like a brick. He lifts all the blame
                  of the Fredericksbug affair from the sholders of the Administrashin, and offers
                  hisself a willin sacrifice to save the President from censhur. In this respeck he
                  reminds me of the eggsemplary Isick, of Skripter sellebrity, who was willin to hev
                  his throte cut for the benefit of the Father Abraham of ainshent times. The oney
                  difference atwixt the two magnannymus individyals is, that Isick eskaped with a

               <p>The address of the illustrus Abe to the Army of the Potomac (witch is the
                  offspring of his own raity mind, onaded by any hint from me) butiffilly clars away
                  the smoke from the battelfeeld of the Rapperhammock, and shows that the lite
                  checks we receved in buckrin tagin onsirmountable obstickles was merely the result
                  of wun of those trifflin "axidents" that will happen in the best regilated
                  milentary famalies. Ginral Schunk, if you recolleck, met with a simildar misfortin
                  on a small skale, when he butted six or sevin car-loads of sojers, inter a maskt
                  battery at Vienna, in the beginnin of the war. Strange as it may seem to the pius
                  mind, a blind reliance on soopernatral favor doosent seem to pay. The Providence
                  as shapes our eends oney doos, the pollishin off, and ef the blockin out is dun
                  blindfolded, wot is to be eggspected in consekens but "the leetle eend of nuthin
                  whittled down to a pint". The triumfant manner in witch Burnside recrost the river
                  on the sly, is jestly considered a grate explite by the President. It was
                  sartainly nuther an error nor an "axident", but the brilyant idee of a sooperior,
                  intellect witch hevin but one hole to creep out at, hed the saygasity not to be
                  abuv makin use of it.</p>
               <p>The concludin passidge of my nobul frend's address, whar he simperthises with the
                  "severely wounded" is creditabul to his sensabilities. Also it shows the
                  oridginality of his discriminatin mind. An ornary man, in his sitiwashin, would
                  hev simperthised with the onfortnit cripples without distinkshin of pursons, but
                  he benevlently sellecks the wurst cases for his affeckshinit regards, levin the
                  flesh cuts and mild perferashins resultin from the "axident", to derive cumfurt
                  from the reflexshin that it mought hev ben an all-fired sight wurse.</p>
               <p>It is a luvly trait in the modern Father of his Kentry, that he never blames
                  ennyboddy for doonin ennything witch evrybody sees might hev ben avided; nor for
                     <emph>not</emph> dooin ennything witch was absolutely necessary to prevent
                  "axidents". What a happy thing it is for this glorius nayshin that our Cheef
                  Madgistrit's hed is not of the same saft materyal as his hart. Ef it was we mought
                  find it a hard matter to "ockapy and possess" the rebellyus South doorin his term
                  of offis.</p>
               <p>I hope the North is satisfied that the delay of the pontoons ontil the faverable
                  moment for leadin the army over em to hullsail slorter, wals wun of those
                  onforseen suckemstances over witch noboddy hes enny control. Hanlleck gin the
                  order to hev em sent on; but in coarse it warnt his bizuness to know whether it
                  was attended to. As Blundersby (I think that's his naane) says in the play of
                  Domboy and Son, "if so be they was sent, so, and ef so be as they warnt sent, why
                  so also." Axidentlally it was "<emph>so also</emph>". Major Ginral Halleck,, I
                  would hev the public to know, hes his place as distinkly defined as ef he was head
                  butler in a privit famaly. Now a head butler you know mought consistently order
                  the footman to tell the housemaid to leave word with the cook to send the
                  errand-boy to desire the ostler to request the coachman to harness up the losses,
                  drive the kerridge to the doctor's, and bring him forthwith to attend the sick
                  master of the establishment. Blut ef the order warnt eggsecuted and the sick boss
                  died in consekens, the butler wouldent be to blame you know. Bein suckemstanced
                  precisely the same, Ginral Halleck must be simildarly eggscused. Its dredful to
                  think that some people should be so onrighteously ignorant of offishal etiket, as
                  to spose the Ginral orter hev seen as his dereckshins was obeyed. Setch things is
                  never dun. I hope you will make this fact clar to the <emph>vox populie</emph>;
                  for tho you will hardly bleeve it, sum fokes is inconsiderit enuff to lay, the
                  blud of the brave men wiped out in the battel of Fredericksburg at Ginral
                  Halleck's door. As I wunst remarkt on a prevus ockrashin, "Republicksa
                     <emph>is</emph> ongrateful".</p>
               <p>The Constitooshinal Advisers, bein of a tenasshus nater, intends to stick to the
                  President and thar places. They rallid around him airly in the week and ashoored
                  that imminent Statesman that they would never desert him. I was not present at the
                  affectin intervew, but was informt, that Stanton's spectikles was dim with tears,
                  and that the baird of Welles kwivered with onrepressabul emoshen. Setch is thar
                  devoshin to my high-minded frend, that ef evry city and town, in the Union was to
                  get up mass meetins and petishin for thar retirement, I skarsly think they would
                  hev the hart to tare tharselves away. I should like to see the eggsperiment tried,
                  ef it was oney to test thar patytryitism.</p>
               <p>Christmas past rayther glumily here; the convalessent sojers, howsever, was treted

                  confidens to a new serious of fienancyal, milentary and navel aborshins. Mr.
                  Chase, the distingwisht manyfactorer of <hi rend="i"/>paper mashy playthings for
                  groan childern, is preparin a new Treshury Game for the gay seesin, to be called

                  for bilden housen arter the pattern of the Shattoes in Spain. The game is simpel
                  and eesily seen throo; and is kept on a slate to witch a spunge is attacht, for
                  wipin out the figgers at the conclushin. I onderstancl it is intended to lustrate
                  the great moneytary prencepul that the saiftest way to raise the wind is to
                  inflate the currency. The Seckatry, of the Treshury hes peculiar idees on the
                  spondoolick kwestin, witch, in his capassity of Constitooshinal Adviser, he
                  yestday onfolded to my strong-minded frend, the President, as follers:</p>
               <p>"Abe," ses he (for he allus addresses the President as a man and a bruther, and
                  not as a high old public funkshinary)—"Abe, my feller citysin," ses he, "gold is
                  the solid, portabul ritches of a kentry, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"I cornseed the pint," replide the seckind Washington.</p>
               <p>"Wal, then," continued the Seckatry, "the more the nayshin's gold is wuth in the
                  hum market, in coarse the richer the nayshin is; you'll not attemp to contrivert
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Nary contrivert," anserd the Hed of the Guverment, flippin up a nickel and
                  ketchin it in the pam of his hand.</p>
               <p>"Wal," resoomed the custoadyun of the publick pus, "I hev alreddy raised the
                  valley of gold thirty per sent abuv the ornary level, and I intend to keep it a
                  mountin ontil it reeches ninety or a hunderd per sent abuv par, and evry gold
                  dollar in the kentry, incloodin the ror materyal in Californy, is wuth two
                  dollars. What do you think of that, now, my troo American? and yet the
                  conservatives say Ime impoverishin the kentry."</p>
               <p>"But," ses the Eggseggative, runnin his fingers throo his bar, as if he was makin
                  winrows of it, "gold hesent riz abroad, hes it? and if our merchants purchis thar
                  truck whar a gold dollar's oney wuth its face, and hes to sell whar the same
                  coin's wuth two dollars, it peers to me that the commershil intrest will sun go to
                  the—."</p>
               <p>"Let the commershil intrest keep its munny to hum," he rejincd, sharply. "Tuther
                  side of the Atlantick is agin us. Let us inskribe on our banners," ses he, in a
                  bust of paytryotic devoshin, "Let us prent on our Star-Spangled and glory-striped
                  standard, 'No connexshin with the beggars opposit.'"</p>
               <p>"O! that, indeed," remarkt the President, cherfully eggstendin his hand—witch the
                  Seckatry skweeged with emoshin, in token that they understood wunanuther. So the
                  Seckatry's new game receved the Presidenshil sankshin, and ef Congress is willin,
                  the picters will be reddy for delivery purty recently.</p>
               <p>Perfeck repose prevails in the Navy Department. The respecktabul longshoreman as
                  persides over it feels sorry for the Ariel, and thinks the Californy gold hed
                  better be shipt direct by the way of Cape Horn in futur, or at least ontil setch
                  time as the Pacific Railroad is finisht, or the Alabammer capturd, witchever of
                  those two cummin events may chanst to happen first. He considers it an act of
                  creminel keerlessness in the San Francisky nabobs, knowin wot they know, to have
                  resked ennything in the Gulf onder the American flag. "Stupid Old Tops," ses he, "
                  why diddent they ship in English bottoms." He thinks the best way for the American
                  ship oners and shipping merchants to protect tharselves agin loss, is to keep all
                  thar ships in port and let furrin vessels do the carryin trade, ontil the
                  Alabammer, and the Oreter, and the uther rebel priviteers is captered by the San
                  Jasento or the Tuskyroarer, or sum of Wilkes's flyin Squodrun as annilates time
                  and space at the rate of six nots an hour.</p>
               <p>Thar was a gay time at the White House yestday. Evrybody as is ennybody called to
                  wish the illustrus ockipants a happy new year, and offer thar congratilashins on
                  the state of the kentry. Menny large corntractors was on hand and gin thar vews of

                  paid thar respecks, and Messrs. Halleck and Stanton presented the plan of a new
                  milentary Annie Condy for 1863; but Mr. Lincoln sed he could nuther make head nor
                  tale of it, and Seward remarkt in his sourcaustic way that it reminded him
                  onrepressably of a Gaudyan Not of red tape, and that the best thing the President
                  could do was to cut it.</p>
               <p>Chase was in high sperrits, and arter the bizness conversashin I hev, elsewhar
                  referd too, him and the President hed sum very plesent joaks together. "Torkrin of
                  bonds, Chase," sez the latter, "wot do you think of the bonds of
                  matteromoney?"</p>
               <p>The Seckatry blusht salmon cullur as he remarkt in reply, that he was negoshiattin
                  for sum skrip of that carricktor with a vew to the consolidashin of the Union.
                  Welles, cuming up at the moment, the Cheef Madgistrit axed him why Chase wos like
                  Neckar, a sellybrated French Seckatry of the Treshury. The Venabul Navel

                  hed the larf at this killin wittyschism, sobsidled, when Mr. Lincoln, with a
                  glistening eye, perpounded anuther. "Why," ses he, "is our esteemable frend from
                  Ohio like a lottery dealer?" Blair thort it was prehaps on ackount of his bein
                  engaged to be marrid, and marridge bein a lottery. But the President informd us,
                  with a wink, that it was "bekase he was the Chance Seller of the Exchecker." Mr.
                  Chase lucked rayther blank at this definishin, and edgin his way outer the crowd
                  around the Eggseggative, went and sot down in the furthest corner of the rum, whar
                  he tuck the Mansipayshin Proclalmaashin outer his pocket, and began to studdy it.

                  shouldn't wet his whissel, with a thimbulful of O. D. V. now and then ef he felt
                  like it.</p>
               <p>This prelimindary bein disposed of he axed me, as a man sirkelatin freely in

               <p>"D. V., I'm afeard you put the case too trooly," he responded, "but it never
                  struck me in that light afore."</p>
               <p>"That's bekase you lent your ear to a passel of asses," ses I "insted of trustin
                  to a faithful old hoss, like me, as never bolts the strait track of common sense

                  no more use than Faro's host at the bottom of the Red Sea. Thar's more roads to

               <p>"But Stanton and Halleck both say—"</p>
               <p>"In coarse they both say," I shouted skornfully, "theyre the greatest sayers out.

                  it; would break the Nayshin's hart."</p>
               <p>"Wall," ses he, in a husky vice, "wot route do you think Durnside oughter

                  with the job, and sleeps at it long enuff. This gloryus republick, Messrs. E

                  as enny enemee of free institooshuns and frend of the devil ken passably desire.
                  Thars obstickles in the way, I admit. We hev a furrin trade as carries our, sales
                  and paddles into evry sea. We hev eenamost onlimited internal resorses. We hev an
                  army of a millyun of the bravest men as ever smoldered ai shootin-iron, in the
                  feeld and a navy of three hundred and fifty ships and thirty-five thousand sailors
                  on the oshin and in harbor. But notwithstandin all this, our merchant vessels is
                  burned by pirits so near our shores that we ken purty nigh smell the smoke; furrin
                  craft runs throo our blockadin skwadrons as easy as fallin off a log; our credit

                  the most convenient places that is to be found on the map for bein slortered
                  without the slightest chanst for victry. It may take some years to rooin the

                  as sprinlgy; but with perseverance and the assistance of idyotic currency, tinkers
                  and smart Guverment corntractors, the eend may be ackomplisht, ef our eggsellent

                  improovements, preserves his Roman firmness, and keeps his foot set down agen all

               <p>You mustn't spose, Messrs. Eddyturs, that I mean enny disrespeck to that
                  extrornary man. His buzzum is full of paytryotic seniments jest about as good as
                  they make em. Even wen his head misleeds him, he is allus, to use an eggspreshin
                  of his own, "sound on the goose". The diffikulty is this. Sartain members of the
                  Cabnet hev perswarded him that with thar assistance he ken restore the Union, and
                  not otherways. Ef they hed told him that they tharselves, by thar own onassisted

                  throo em, and overboard theyd hev went. But by makin hin the hero of the drayma
                  and pretendin to be soopernoomerees, they hev contrived to identify tharselves
                  with hisself on the united-we-stand-divided-we-fall prenceple, and he acktilly
                  thinks that ef he was to dismiss em, the kentry would cullaps and the Guvernment
                  be a goner.</p>
               <p>In coarse I hev labored faithfully to cure him of this onhappy noshin, but I find
                  it onpossabul to make the desired impresshin. He perfesses the same frenship for
                  me as ever. He brings out the Coneyac and Mungoheeler as ushil, and lissens to my
                  eggsposishins with the solemnity of a nainshent Nester, but when I hev sed my say,
                  insted of givin me an approovin nod, as he used to do formally, he signifies his
                  dissent in a brace of shakes. Ime sumtimes inklined to think his head is going.
                  Ken it be that a black cloud is getherin over that wunst fair intelleck? Is it
                  declinin from fair to middlin, and will it finally run emptyins? I say to myself,
                  sumtimes, is this man, wunst considerd so clarsighted, destined to becum a Leer.
                  Will a time cum when like that onfornit monnick he will not know enuff to go in

               <p>A purty state of things we're cummin to, when a Sennitor gits up in his place and
                  charges the Head of the Nashin with imbesillyty. Saulsberry, a copperhead from the
                  humapathic State of Delawar, as you air well awar, a tacted the highest publick
                  funkshinnary in the most vipertuperative langwidge on Tuesday last. He sed, in
                  effeck, that the modern Father of his Kentry was a missabul spoon, for witch he
                  was very properly taken inter custardy, notwithstandin his attemp to inaugerate a
                  revolushin with his revolver. I rite warmly on the subjeck, for I feel riled and
                  put by to think that my illustrus frend should be held up to public contemp as a
                  foo-foo. Ef it hed a ben a Constitooshinal Adviser now, I wouldent hev keered a
                  mite; but to call honest Old Abe a ninnycumpoop right out in meetin, thus givin
                  countenance to the skandalus reports of that nater sirkilatin all over the kentry,
                  peers to me to be sackreligus and onchristrian. Even ef our paytryotic Cheef
                  Madgistrit, insted of bein, as he is, the Solomon of the Western Henaspear,
                     <emph>warn't</emph> more'n half rocked, would it be right for wun of his own
                  kentrymen, nussed in the same cradle of Libty as hisself, and ockapyin a seat in
                  the Upper House, to call him a nidiot? George the Third acktilly <emph>was</emph>
                  a nidiot, and yet I never heerd of a member of the Brittish Parleyment throwin
                  it'up to him in a speetch.</p>
               <p>I was on the flore of the Sennit when the Delawar chap pitcht inter the President,
                  and am bound to say that his remarks was extree-venamus; so much so that I felt it
                  to be my dooty to call at the White House and simperthise with its ockypant as I
                  would with a bruther. Ses I to him: "Wot ef you did hold palavers with Burnside's
                  offsirs, onbeknown to him; and wot ef you did encurridge em to pore thar
                  greevances inter your privit ear; and wot ef you did dekline to remoov em when the
                  Ginral ackused em of undermindin, and baring false witness and leaguin together to
                  set the army agin him, hedent you a right to do it? Air you not," ses I, "the

                  milentary pollysee, is that enny pruff," ses I, "that your brain's addled? Spose
                  you did pervent Macdoil from jinin Maclellin at the critickle moment, and
                  interfear with Burnside when he thort he hed a shoor thing, thats not to say
                  you're an ignoramus."</p>
               <p>Horris Greely's idees about stoppin the war in May or June, ef we dont lick the
                  rebels and make em sue for a piece by that time, is creatin considabul of a
                  sensashin here, and it is torked around in pollytickle sirkils that him and the
                  French Plenipenitentiary and the French Empror is skeemin to hev France offer
                  mediashin immediently. I gess Nap the III wont ketch us nappin, ef he tries it on.
                  Ef he wants to wake up a hornet's nest and git his comb cut, jest let him thrust
                  his nose inter the Union hive, thats all. Ime sprised that Horris, who hes
                  hertofore starnly refused to countenance ennything in the shape of a divishin of
                  the Union, should kinder turn doe-face now. His vews is gall and wurmwood to the
                  corntracktors here, who are all in faver of carryin on the war to the bitter eend.
                  They think he oughter be rested at wunst for high treason, and brort on here onder
                  a warrant from the Seckatry of State. Sartainly, Boilo, of the Philadelphy

               <p>Thars also a rummer here that my destingwished bruther Unionist, the President, is
                  in faver of closin up the war wun way or tuther in ninety days, but I feel
                  satisfied the story is a cunard set aflote by agents of the Brittish Guverment,
                  and Ime inklined to think that the curryspondent of the London Times in your city
                  is at the bottom of it. I onderstand Seckatry Seward hes his eye on the swell, and

                  sunner'n he andizzypates.</p>
               <p>The trooth is that the issoo of the war is nuther more nor less than a kwestin of

               <p>Curus, isent it, that jest as we was on the pint of razing Charlestun to the
                  ground, thar should be strong ground for sposin that Charlestun hes razed the
                  blockaid. Making all doo deduckshins for Bowerygard's eggsagerashins and
                  Ingarhum's bolderdash, the tail cummin as it doos ofishally from head kwarters
                  kennot be sot down as altogether a fish story. Grandfather Whitehead, the venabul
                  sumnambulist as holds the portfoolyou of the Navy Department, bleves it I
                  understand. As he was awar that the rebels was gettin reddy two powerful iron rams
                  at Charlestun, and that we hed nuthin fit to tackel em in the harbor, he naterally
                  concloods that they may have bucked inter the squodrun and given us considabul of
                  a muttoning. With his ushil prompness, howsever, he no sunner heerd of the
                  owdashus attact, than he ordered four more gunboats to be sent South from the New
                  York Navy Yard, with immedient dispatch, and I larn on good orthority that ef
                  nuthin onforseen happens, the Nantuckit, the Samgammon, and two uther iron clads
                  may be lucked for on the seen of the late outrage in about two weeks. The
                  Department is beseeched by scores of ankshus inkwirers, and the eggsightment is
                  intens. But the Seckatry is ekwil to the immnerginsea. He strokes his baird
                  self-cumpleasantly, and ses we must be prepard for ockashinal discomforters. Upon
                  the hull, he thinks the Charlestun affair won't turn out to be mutch wurse'n than
                  the Merrimack's flare up in Hamton Roads, or the Galvestun
                     <foreign>fieasko</foreign>. It hes ben subjected to him in a mild and frendly
                  wisper, that as luck appeers to be agin him, it wouldent be a bad idee for him to
                  resign; but he intermates that he will sheer the forten of the nayshin as long as
                  Uncle Sam hes a shot in the locker. The slytest hint at desartin the President at
                  the present junkter mooves him to tears. Borroring a metafore from his former line
                  of life he swars he will never give up his post ontil the King of Terrors consines
                  him to the ded letter office. The tenassity of Constitooshinal Advisers is amazin.
                  Ticks clings doggedly to the cuetickle of a tarrier, mussels holds on like grim
                  death to the rocks, and barnickles on ships bottoms sticks closter'n a bruther,
                  but the way a Constitooshinal Adviser adhears to his "coin of vantage", as the
                  poick ses, is a oawshin to Cabnet curosities. You will recolleck that when it was
                  hinted around that the diffydent Stanton and the vidgelant and thortful Halleck
                  was about to retire, I dident goinside with the ginral opinyun eggsprest by

                  Ime proud to say I didn't put too low an estimit on thar paytryitism. Look at em.
                  Thar they stand, firm and self-possest, like two Payshenses on a Moneyment smildin
                  at Grief. As for Seckatry Welles I consider him anuther Markus Curtis reddy for a

                  dessay it will be an all-scared sight wurse. Its butifuil to see how ankshus sum
                  milentary men air to rally around the President when thars danger abroad. Setch
                  pruffs off devoshin must tutch his hart, onless he is made of stun; witch he
                  isent—but, on the contrary, all softness.</p>
               <p>Congress is as bizzy as the devil in a hurrycain. Senniter Wilson's bill for
                  margin evry mail citysin abel to bare arms for his kentry a sojer, is likely to
                  pass and to be carrid out to the letter. It applies to purty mutch the hull
                  abel-boddied maskaline poppylashin, and gives the President the power to use em by
                  the kwantity as ockashin rekwires. The bill's eenamost sartain to be a lor, and
                  thar'll be a lively time ginrally when it cums to be enforst. Menny thinks it will
                  promote emmigrashin.</p>
               <p>Then thars Senniter Sumner's cullerd ridgement skeem, pervidin for the enrollment
                  of three hunderd thousand darkeys, to be paid sevin dollars a munth. As Mr. Sumner
                  purfesses to considder a nigger a good as a white man, if not more so, I wish to
                  ax him throo the columes of the <title>SUNDAY MERKARY</title> why he wants to hire
                  him at hafe price. Ef white bone and shinner is wurth thirteen dollars a munth to
                  shoot and be shot, at why shouldent a wool-and-ebony-man-and-bruther—ef he is
                  raaly a man and a brother, as the Senniter ses he is—be paid at the same ratte?
                  Why this invidyus pqniary destinkshin atwixt wool a har? Wavin this pint, I would
                  respeckfully ask whar this black force of three hunderd thousand is to be drummed
                  up. In order to carry the war inter Afriky, you must fast ketch your Afrikinus.
                  How air they to be roped in? It seems to nile that this is an important prevus
                  kwestin witch oughter be put afore the bill is past. It onfortnitly happens that
                  my nobul frend Abraham's ham's proclamashin, givin libty to the captive, is a dead
                  letter whar the black race prencepally pervails. In coarse we kant make our
                  cullerd kindred Union sojers in the rejins of the South we dont "ockapy and
                  possess", and in the other rejins—accordin to the proclamashin—the slaves continny
                  to be slaves, and we hev no right to take em from thar masters. The Mancipayshin
                  Edick is an ingeniuS dockyment; it cuts two ways, and both was is ekwilly
                  redickalus. Eggseggative wisdom is sum if not Sumner.</p>
               <p>As this Congress preposes to skwander no eend of munny (in the form of
                  sirkilatin-picters) afore it; dissolves, and as March forth is closte at hand,
                  things will be put throo amazin kwick for the nex two weeks. The nine hunderd
                  millyunn bill will mebbe hev becum a law by the time this reaches yoon, and mebbe
                  not. It is nip and tuck atwixt the Seckatry of the Treshery and the banks, but I
                  think the Seckatry will run em down and the spiles of the Chase be skewerd to the
                  Guverment.</p>
               <p>I begin to be orfully tired of Washington, and long to be wunst more in my old
                  kwarters at file Sanit Nickalas. But it shell never be sed that I turnt my back on
                  Abraham Lincoln at a time when he skailsly knew witch eend of him was uppermost.
                  Diddent I ackumpany him from Illannoy? Diddent I revise his inaugerole? Dident I
                  subjest his—no, I did not subjest his messidge! Hevent I ben his Rock of Refudge?

               <p>I congratilate the young men of the krentry on the new claws interdooced inter the
                  cornskripshin, by the Conscript Fathers of the Sennit. Accordin to the Sennit's
                  mendment Young America is not liabul to hev his idees taught how to shoot until he
                  reeches the age of twenty years—in uther-wurds, he hennot be took for a privit,
                  ontil jest twelve munths afore he attains his mayjority. The probility is that
                  this benevolent let up for hobbletehoys, as hev not seen twenty summers, will be
                  sankshind by the poplar branch of the nayshinal legislatoor, and the eggsempshin,
                  like Mrs. Winslow's Soothin Serrup, will proove a great blessin to mothers.
                  Eighteen is too jewvenile. The sperrits is boyant at that age, to be shoor, but
                  the bone is not sot, and that self-respeck and manly dignity witch grows outer
                  familyarity with the lather brush and the razor is oney parshilly developt. Ef our
                  youth kennot be aloud to tarry in Jerryco tell thar bairds is grown, let em stay,
                  at least, ontil the fibers sprout and they begin to sho sum sines of a stiff upper
                  lip.</p>
               <p>It kant be denied, I spose, that this new lor will nock the milentary attryboots
                  of the State Guvners inter a cockt hat. Thars nuthin mealy-mouthed in its
                  provishins. It goes, to the root of the matter and makes my heroic frend, the
                  President, an abesalute Dick Tater. Ef carrid out it will enabul him to run the
                  biggest milentary masheen in the hull wurld, with millyuns of men hitched to the
                  ropes all bound to obey wotever orders he chewses to shout throo the fedral
                  trumpet. But Mr. Lincoln is not of a tyrannical dispersishin—on the contrary, mild
                  and gentle and as easily led as a lam, or a kid, or a tame gaysell.</p>
               <p>On this pint I ken speak with confidens, for I was with him when he submitted
                  without a murmumr to put on a disgise and conseal his majestic form in a cloke and
                  cap, in order to presarve his preshus life for the greatest good of the greatest
                  number. The copperhed noosepapers as pretends to think he will take advantidge of
                  the Cornskripshin Act to becum a formidabul despot, nose better. His natur is not
                  that of a Naughtycrat or a Useupper. And besides thars no possibility of
                  prosecuting the war, it seems, without setch a meshur as Sennytur Wilson's. Sum
                  sos its mainly own to the Sennytur's infarnal stewpidity, in stoppin volunteerin
                  when the hull nashin was bilin over with millentry ambishin, that cornskripshin
                  hes to be resarted too; and these misabul grumblers allow that it would be a good
                  idee for the President to put him whar David put the sellybrated Hittite, namely,
                  in the fore frunt of the fust big shindy.</p>

                     subject—<emph>mud</emph>. The main boddy on the Rapperhammock is as helpless as
                  a crowd of flies in a lasses cask, and all the Union troops in Virginny and
                  Merryland is in the same waxy predlickyment. A frend of mine who was present at a
                  dress parade at Fallmouth tuther day, informt me that the divishins as they stud
                  in the ranks hed evry appearance of heving ben cut off at the knees, all below

                  resemblin shad-poles protroodin throo the slush in varus places, my frend inkwired

               <p>Ime sorry to say that the troops in Virginny is getting clamrus for thar pay. I
                  hed a letter yestday from a member of the Sixt Artillery cumplainin that his

                  His remarks about the condishin of his wife and fammaly, who it seems is starvin
                  for thar entry while he is fightin for it, mought hev drord tears from the eyes of
                  a sutler. Slim porshins of his epistol is of a carrickter that would make the

               <p>It is not so much on ackount of the men, howsever, as for the sake of the

                     Washington, with which the following letter concludes, has caused us the most

                  Constitooshinal Advisers. I axed Seward thhe other day ef it was so; and he got
                  kwite adjitated on the subjeck. He sed he heerd thar was a conspurracy agin
                     <emph>him</emph>, and he knew who was at the bottom of it. Let em cum on," ses
                  he, "Ime reddy for em, and they'll find I don't fear the face of Clay." He was
                  evidently riled, and put me in mind of a play I wunst seen, whar an ambishus chap
                  as wanted evrything his own way denounced a sassy revolushinary feller of the name
                  of Cashus as extree dangerus.</p>
               <p>This mornin I called on the President, and put the inderogatory to him plump and
                  square wether he was goin to giv enny of the Constitooshinals thar walkin tickets.
                  His ansern was rayther non-commital, arisin, I reckin, from the ambiggerus state
                  of his own felines. Ses he:</p>
               <p>"It's eesier to dismiss wun or two or three, Constooshinal Advisers, than it is to
                  seleck that number from fifty candydates without all the rest getin up a tree; and
                  its eesier to let bad enuff alone than it is to enjoy cumfort arter runnin yer hed
                  inter a hornet's nest."</p>
               <p>I ackwiest.</p>
               <p>"You remember," he continned, "the fate of the onfortnit man in the skripters, as

                  kind."</p>
               <p>"Yaaas," I ses, "the last state of that individual was wuss'n the first. But,"
                  ses, I, "he was a misabul retch as hed no mind of his own and jest gin up to the

                  Abraham the First is no Nero. He wouldn't hurt a fly. It is troo that the
                  cornskripshin Act, the Bank and Lone Acts, the suspenshin of the Heaviest Corpus
                  Act, the Indamnity Act, and cetery, make a reglar Siezer of him, but his Majest—I
                  mean his Eggsellency—is not the man to take advantidge of the late ginral and
                  genrus sirrender of the rights of the States and the peeple. His auntycedents is
                  not of an aristocratick carrickter. Let us glanst at em for a moment.</p>
               <p>Born of tall but modest patients in Kaintucky, he took, at an airly peryud of his
                  carear to the woods, whar he slung a nasty ax and mauled rails with wunderful
                  assidooity. Emergin thence he studded navigashin on board a flat-boat of the
                  largest class, makin hisself thurrowly ackwainted with the theory of the currents
                  and persishin of the poles. Naterally inklined to push ahed—witch is allus the
                  roolin instink of great minds—he abandoned the watery element and took to the bar,
                  and as he grew in wisdum and in stattur gradjally rose to eminence. Finerly that
                  perfound statesman The Honabul Horris Greeley of Chappaquaw, diskivered that my
                  Illustrus Frend was wanted at the head of the Guvernment, and bein put before the
                  peeple, they rode him on a rail inter the Presidenshil Cheer. Kwalified alike by
                  natur and eddicashin to controle the destinees of the most Enlightened Nayshin on
                  the face of the Airth, Congress dun perfeckly right in conferrin on him onlimited
                  power, in this tremenus crysis. Pressing cases reckwires desput remedees—and hens
                  the nesessity for makin Abraham cock of the walk, and placin the Swoord, the Pus
                  and the Press at his disposhal.</p>
               <p>I am awar that sartain fackshus persons pertends not to see the properiety of
                  strong meshurs agin States as isent in rebellyun; but who noes how sun they may be
                  in rebellyun? A stitch in time saves nine, and the saiftest way to pervent peeple
                  from bein seedishus is to sow thar mouths up the moment they begin to grumble.
                  Libty of Speech and Libty of the Press is all very well when the Republick is not
                  in danger, but when it is, ef Oriturs and Eddyturs will pitch inter the
                  Administrashin, in coarse they must eggspect to be shet up. Is it a time I ax, to
                  pertest agin the Constitooshin bein suspended when the Union itself is hangin by
                  ilids? Away with setch Old Fogey thorts, onwurthy of the Age of Progress! While
                  the fight lasts let us submit magnannymously to the Hyer Law.</p>
               <p>Besides as I hev repetedly sed on former ockashins, the Modern Father of his
                  Kentry is of a mild and mutherly nater, and overflowin with the milk of human
                  kindness from his toenails to his top-knot. Altho he hes a jiant's power he is the
                  last man on the footstool to use it like a jiant. Ennyboddy who looks back at his
                  perceedings doorin the last two ears will admit that. But like the sellybrated
                  Blunderbore who went to sleep and bed his Seven Legged boots stole by an owdashus
                  dwarf, thars sum reson to fear that he'll be robbed of his perogatives by a Cabnet

                  Ef the Constitooshin is suspended why shouldent the Constitooshinal Advisers be

                  The enthuizyasm for the Stars and Stripes is butiful to behold—I mean the stars as
                  denotes Bragadears and Major Ginrals, and the stripes as signifies subordinit

                  as the President's a cannondrummist. I told him so this very mornin. Ses I, "may
                  it please your Eggsellency, ef you want to put the cornskipshin throo, you must
                  take your provost marshils from the <emph>Bang-whangers</emph> of the Army and not
                  from the <emph>Slang-whangers</emph> of party cabawls. With a jester intended to

                  "retches whoos oney objeck in hevin a hand in the draft was to raze the wind,
                  would be keerfully left out in the cold." He thort, howsever, that it wouldent be
                  a good plan to employ crippeld heroes in the cornskripshin bizness, "Bekase", ses
                  he, "the site of a feller-critter that hes lost an arm or a leg on the battle
                  feeld is not calkilated to put down the too prevailing predjewdice agin balls and
                  bagnets."</p>

                  issoos his proclamashin for bringing anuther batch up to the bull-ring. "Send the
                  paymasters round to evry brigade", ses I, "and pay evry sojer up to the last dime,
                  and the letters they'll rite hum to thar frends will reckonsile em to the

               <p>The doste of bad noose we hev hed doorin the past week hes operated onfavorable
                  here. The Seckatry of War is on the ankhus seat, and the evacyashin of Vicksburg
                  would be a great releef to him. Ef Porter hed ben abel to git throo the narrer gut
                  that seperates Lake Sunflower from the Yazoo, it would hey ben more encurredgin;
                  but it seems the obstruckshins is too formadouble for him to push throo. This, in
                  coarse, is a bitter pill, and it is purty hard to stummick it, but ef by the
                  blessing of Hevin our troops ken go in transports throo the Providence Canawl
                  inter the enemee's rare, they must sun be redooced to thar last shifts. Water is
                  also lowin freely throo the canawl in frunt it seems, and ef wunst we begin to let
                  it fly at em both from the frunt and rare, I should spose they would speedily be
                  overwhelmed. By consultin the latest diegrams it will be seen that they air in a
                  tight fix—cort, as it ware, atwixt Silly and Charibadibs—and I raaly dont see enny
                  caws for the melancolly aspeck witch the Cabnet hes worn for sum days past. But
                  Public Funkshinaries is eesily deprest.</p>
               <p>No dout we shell hev stirrin intelligents from the Suthern Coste afore long; tho
                  sum of the spooneys in the Navy Department peers to be afeard that Dupont's iron
                  plates will be smasht by the Charlestun batterees. By the way, it isent by no
                  means sartain as Charlestun is to be the pint of a tack. Menny think as our iron
                  screws will first hammer down Savanner. But noboddy actilly nose whar the bolt
                  will fall. Anuther week at furthest will tell the story. In the meentime, let us
                  put our trust in the Lord, ef not in Giddyun.</p>
               <p>In Kaintucky things look promisin. Peagrim hes ben shelled outer his persishin.
                  The turn-up took place near Summerset, whar our brave Ginral Gilmore gin him a
                  lofty fall. Onless the telagram lies—witch it sumtimes doos like thunder and
                  lightnin Peagrim's raid inter Old Kaintuck is nockt eendways by the Union forces a
                  raid agin him.</p>
               <p>On tuther hand, howsever, Ginral Bragstun Brag reports to Richmound that Ginral
                  Forrest hes made a dash at Brentwood in West Tenassee, and bagged eight hunderd of
                  our men and thirty-five offsirs. Brag is remarkabul for mendashus statements, so
                  mebbe the reported capter is a misstake. Ef troop, I persoom the detachtment was
                  supprised in thar night-gownds, takin a refreshin snooze with thar heads pillerd
                  on thar nap sacks. Setch oneggspected and ongenerus visits from the enemee
                  frekwently occurs in our camps, and sarves to sho that they hev no respeck for the
                  rools and regalashins of civileysed warfare. To attack our milentary boddies when
                  asleep, is a knockturnal outrage on the manors and custums of an enlightend
                  age.</p>
               <p>A startlin report from Yorktown hes jest flasht over the wires. It is stated that
                  the seecesh is pitchin inter us at Williamsburg like a thousand of bricks, or
                  rayther like twenty thousand bricks, for that is sed to be thar numbers. Ginral
                  Keys, who cummands our forces at Yorktown, was at Fortress Monro when the ball
                  opent, and it is sed he tore his locks when he heerd the noose and vamosed
                  immediently in a steamboat for the seen of the shindy. I sor him on Pennsylvany
                  avenoo oney day before yestday, and Washington not bein more'n a hunderd milds
                  from his head-kwarters, it was kinder nateral, you no, for him to be here when the
                  enemee was moovin to a tack his persishin, Warnt Wellington at Brussils when the
                  fightin began in the neybrood<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5729-00000135"/> brood of
                  Waterloo, and dont our ginrals all take pattern arter the Iron Dook. Ef you should
                  happen to here afore Sunday that Williamsburg hes ben tuck, be sure to menshin
                  that Ginral Keys was at his post in time to pardizzypate in the defeet.</p>
               <p>The reports about the enemee retreatin from the Rapperhammock is all bolderdash.
                  Ginral Hooker nose better, and jest as sun as the sile on the banks will support
                  his legins, he will order the bugles to sound and go in like a trump. Hooker is
                  all grit and grissel from his corns to his coconut. Sum thinks he's not up to the
                  fancy dodges of a brilyant retreat, and I think its likely, for he's not of a
                  retirin dispersishin. Ef the Gardin of Edin was behint him and the infernal
                  Haidees in frunt, he'd pitch right inter the latter as joyfully as ef he was
                  rushin inter the arms of his wife. Thars nuthin of the crab about Fightin Joe; his
                  legs is oney maid to go wun way; he kant advance backards. His army is in reglar

               <p>The pollytishins here is considabully eggsersized about the cummin eleckshin in

                  Seckatry Welles is dubyus. Howsever, he doosent no the State as well as the State
                  nose him, so he may be rong. For my own pairt, Ime willin to bet high—say Guvner

                  git skunkt. I oney wisht the Conneticut regements at the Seat of War hed a chanst

                  as heving all gon to Davis Locker. Honabul Thomas Henry Seemore the blind pilot of

                  establishments and dry goods stores with desput fury. They hysted a banner baring
                  the inskripshin, "Bunnets or Blood", and went inter the fray with horrid hoops and
                  hidyus yells. Arter takin the dry goods establishments by storm, they dressed thar
                  ranks, and assailed the skeart factories, exposin thar pursons in the most
                  fearless manner, and carryin all before em. Crossin Shockoh Crick, they marched
                  agin the modests in the fashinabul pairt of the city, and tho an attemp was made
                  to barricade the streets, the breslworks did not for a moment impede thar
                  progress. Thar crownin feet was to mount all the tallest stiles in French hats,
                  arter witch they consented to listen to a speetch from Jeff Davis, who gin his

                  at his own expens; arter witch they kwitely disburst. Altho thar skellinton forms

                  rampage among the silks and ribbins and cetery began, they entirely forgot thar

                  they remembered thar famalies was starvin. Thar wardrubs bein now thurrowly

               <p>The report of the Committee on the Conduck of the War is mutch disgust in

                  hev his plans deranged by any axdent to hisself, that it made him peer ridickalus.
                  Uthers represents that altho brave as a lion, he is of a narvous temperament, and

               <p>My predickshin that we wouldent redooce Charlestun to ashes so all-thunderin eesy
                  as sum of our offishal foo-foos sposed, hes ben moanfully foolfilled, and our
                  false profits air considabully taken down by the ackounts from that kwarter.
                  Seckatry Welles looks bewilderd, like a man suddently awoke from a plesent vishin
                  by a cry of fire. It is roomered that his intelleck is givin way, but I don't
                  think thars enny solid foundashin for the report. In reply to those who condole
                  with him on the misfortin, he merely ses he "eggspected the reverse", witch is a
                  fack or a fickshin accordin to the sense in witch you take the anser. The truth is
                  that the Illustrus Minister and Mariner hed<pb n="272-273"
                     xml:id="VAC5729-00000137"/> an idee that the Charlestun forts would cave in
                  arter hafe a duzzen rounds or so, and it was oney when he heard of the sinkin of
                  the Keocuck that he reelized the rebels was reddy for the Tug of War. Ginrall
                  Halleck, whenever the subjeck is menshint in his hearin, assooms the attitood of
                  Ajacks defyin the lighthin, and ef tall torkin could conker the Secesh strongholt,
                  huthin more would be reckwisit than to send that distingwisht speshil pleeder to
                  the Charlestun Bar. It is sed that sumboddy axed him tuther day why them I seven
                  thousand men was hurrid off on a fool's eratt to Folly Island, and wot they was
                  eggspected to do agin five milds of forts mounted with a thousand cannon and
                  fifty-five thousand rebel bagnets reddy to give it to em hot and heavy at the

                  Ginral—made to this important kwestin, but I onderstand the troops was sent on to
                  see how almity kwick thirty-two guns could smash a line of works stronger'n
                  Sebasterpull, onder a corncentrickle fire from three hundred rifled peaces at a

                  to the land forces, and inspire em with no eend of ardor and devoshin; but as it
                  turnt out, they went back reflectin serously on the onsartinty of accomplishin
                  onpossabilities.</p>
               <p>The modern Father of his Kentry is cam and composed wonder the late dispensashin.
                  He says it was "not a repulse—oney a check". Prehaps he means a

                  dialog ensood:</p>
               <p>"Honabul Abe," ses I, "wot do you think of the problem of iron-clad
                  involnerability?"</p>
               <p>"Disbanded," he replied, "it is a problem no longer—the rebels hes riddled
                  it."</p>
               <p>"But accordin to Ericson," I remarkt, "the new fightin masheens wurkt percisely as
                  intended. He considders em a sucksessful eggsperiment."</p>
               <p>"That's nateral," rejoined the President, "I dessay the three navigaters of Gotham
                  as went on a crews in a bowl, crackt up their craft as a first rate speciment of
                  navel holler-ware."</p>
               <p>"He ses," I continued, "that our attact on Sumter was 'fraught with incalkalable
                  benefit.'"</p>
               <p>"Assalting to no porpus, and gettin an orful pepperin in return, doosent seem to
                  me like getting the best of the brile," he anserd.</p>
               <p>"That's troo," ses, "and I think you hed better rite to the Gentman from Denmark,
                  and ax himn ef he wont dane to eggsplane his meanin. He's a skyentific feller," I
                  added, "no kwestin about that; but he was ekwilly confident about his atmusferic
                  ship, witch howsever proved a thing of air and arter a few puffs from the press
                  sobsided with an asmlatic wheeze inter oblivyun."</p>
               <p>"I remember it, D. V., I remember it," remarkt the President thortfully, "and that
                  affair oughter have ben a monitor to the nashin, caushinin us not to put too much
                  faith in new projecks from the same kwarter."</p>
               <p>"Now you go too fur," I subjested, "the new stile of ironclads is ondoutedly good
                  things in thar way, and ef thar imperfeckshins ken be remooved they will do good
                  service under sartain contingenseas. Wot I objeck to is the assershin of the
                  inventor that 'not a single change of plan is called for.'"</p>
               <p>Our saygasheus Cheef Madgistrit agreed with me, as ushil, and the upshot of the
                  matter is that the armor of the new Monitors is to be made thick enuff to stand
                  enny kwantity of hits from the biggest kind of missills, and ef the addishunal
                  weight carries em down at thar moorins, we must let the invenshin slide, and
                  charge the expens to the sinkin fund. Ef we sink the hull thars more whar that
                  cums from, and we know rall thunderin well thars ten times as mutch whar it will
                  go to.</p>
               <p>We air ankshusly lookin for intellegens from North Caroliny, and I rather imadgin
                  that when it arrives it will be of the illstarred South Caroliny stripe—in uther
                  words onfavorabul to the Stripes and Stars. Ef the sevin thousand Union troops
                  that was despatched from Hilton Hed to chaw up the fifty-five thousand rebels at
                  Charlestun, had ben sent to Ginral Foster, he mought hev licked his assailants,
                  instead of bein as he is at present, cooped up on a tung of land, and in the jaws
                  of destruckshin. I persoom he will meet with what my illustrus paytrun would call
                  a "check "—on the banks of the Tar.</p>
               <p>But notwithstandin the imbesillyty that prevails at head kwarters, the good caws
                  is bound to cum out right in the eend. With strong faith in the kentry, but not a

               <p>Things looks a leetle brighter for our blessed old Unkel E. P. Unum, this week,
                  dont they? Ginral Foster got outer his skrape better'n thar was enny resin to
                  andissipate, and the public mind here, arter bein wurked up to a tearable pitch,
                  hes at lenth been sot at rest by the result of the late hevvy brush on the Tar.
                  The intelligens from the Blackwater, that Peck hed carrid his pint was also
                  receved with onmeshered satisfackshin at Head Kwarters. Peck is a wurthy sun of
                  the Empire State and like her'n his notto is Excel Sir. A better sojer never drawd
                  a swoord, and Old Onadagger hes a right to brag on him. I hope the way he salted
                  Longstreet's advance will be apresheated in Syracuse. The fact is when Longstreet
                  crost the Blackwater, and D. H. Hill started from tuther side of the Dismal Swomp
                  to meet him, they thort they hed Suffolk shoor. The two together hed sixty
                  thousand of the very flour of the Cornfedrit troops, enuff to suffokate Peck's
                  small corpse by that mere weight, ef they could hev throwd tharselves onto both
                  his flanks at wunst. But he gin Longstreet his grewill mity kwick, and Hill bein
                  onabul onder the suckemstances to advance to his sucker, our victry was complete.
                  About the same time too the secesh was gettin a lanmin from Ginral Getty and
                  Levetenant Lamsen, who stormed thar Nancy Mond brestworks with great ardor and
                  entire suckcess.</p>
               <p>Right on the heals of this good noose cum wurd that Admaril Porter hed run the
                  Vicksburg batterees with six iron-clads and some troops in transports, and
                  astonisht the Butternuts in the woods around Warrenton with a shower of ten-inch
                  shells.</p>
               <p>Simultants with the abuv arrove a short electree-magnetic epistol from the
                  Corinthians, announcing that Ginral Dodge hed ben lettin daylight inter the rebel
                  gentiles near Corinth, and that they hed fled from the rath to cum.</p>
               <p>Even that warnt all, for we heerd the same day from New Orleans per George
                  Washington, that Ginral Emory hed gin the enemy a severe rub in frunt, and that
                  Ginral Weasel bed made a strong demonstrashin on thar rare afore they got scent of
                  his moovements. The probility is they hev ben skunkt. A black detachment likewise
                  peers to hev ben dooin good sarvice in that kwarter. Four hunderd and fifty
                  secesh, consistin of horse foot and dragons, it seems attacted wun hunderd and
                  eighty nigs, eggspectin to chaw em up right away. But the Shiverally as went out
                  for wool cum back shorn, with a loss of twenty killed, menny wounded and three
                  snaked off as prisners, and leavin thar cullers in the hands of the cullerd
                  pursons.</p>
               <p>All this is encurridgin and I feel in fussrate sperrits, and so doos my steamed
                  frend His Eggsellency the President of the United States. Indeed I never seen that
                  great Pollytickle and Milentary Loominary more full of enthusiastick fire, and ef
                  he hedn't gin vent to his felines by admittin Western Virginny into the Union
                  sixty days arter date, I dunno but his senses mought hev ben endangered by a
                  suddent rush of victry to the head. Good tidins from the seat of war is so
                  onfrekwent, that when our troops make a successful dash, the inseargeants ken
                  skarsly be more taken by supprise than we air.</p>
               <p>The sakrid sile, I am happy to say, will soon hev suffishent consistency to allow
                  us to operate with artillery. An a decamp from the Rapperhammock informs me that
                  most of the cannon as sunk inter the moreasses when Burnside boggled in his last
                  attempt, hes ben dug out, and that the river kentry, with the eggsepshin of the
                  fishers opened in the road by heat of the sun, will be in putty good condishun for
                  a march by the last of April. The Army of the Potomac hevin jest ben paid off, is
                  in a happy frame of mind, and the men, though a good deal engaged in brag, air
                  ankshus to face the bullets of the enemy. Thar'll be an everlastin big funeral or
                  a mity rapid foot race in them diggins putty resently. The rebel ginrals eggspect
                  a shindy thar immediently, and Fightin Jo is not the man to disappint thar
                  resinable tho tresinable longins. Ef he doosent warm the wax in thar ears afore
                  the first of May, I think it will be the folt of the struttygists at
                  Washington.</p>
               <p>My heroick paytrun, the nashin's cheef, was delited, doorin his late visit to
                  Ginral Hooker, with the sojerly aperience of the sojers. He witnessed the

                  way, that it was ekquil to Oysterlitz. I bleve he intermated a wish at wun time,
                  to take command in purson, and seezin a flag, waved it tords the enemy:<pb
                     n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5729-00000139"/> but on its bein subjested by sumboddy
                  that "Deth loves a shinin mark", he waved the subjeck. It would be a gloryus sight
                  to see the galliant cheef chargin at the head of the Highland Regiment, in the

                  who demanded his munny or his life, is altogether ontroo. They simply stopt his
                  carridge, and respeckfully axed him ef he would like to hear em sing, "How air
                  you, Greenbacks?"—a beautiful solow, witch, as yon air awar, was sung with great
                  applause by Bryant of the Evenin Post, at the Minstrel Hall in Broadway, jest
                  arter his troupe got thar fat Guverment offices.</p>

                  Washington correspondents of your leaden daylies, but I am satisfide it is
                  awethentick.</p>

                  Spring is a breef and summary seesin in these diggins, and altho this is oney the

                  with my hankercher, and at the same time givin my hoss a wipe with the cowskin, I
                  dasht inter the woods at a slappin pace. Hevin resided in Prence Georges for a
                  wile, about thirty years ago, I new the names of a good menny of the old settlers,
                  incloodin the Martens, wun of hoom hes jest ben caged for indulgin in a bit of a
                  crow over Charlestun. I called on sum of the small planters fammalies, and found
                  em rayther poorer'n I left em a score and a hafe years ago; for the sile of the
                  kentry is the ongratefoolest and meenest kinder sand that mullins and broomsedge
                  ever growd on, and the longer a man lives onto it, the more lieabul he is to die
                  of starvashin. The arabul land is so ongodly barren it isent wuth a cuss, and the
                  pastors is all garlick. The inhabitans is a herrin-gutted, slab-sided race, as
                  subsists alltogether on salt shad, salt pork, beans and homany, and Merryland
                  terbacker. In coarse, I dont refer to the big planters, like the Calverts, and
                  Cramplins, and setch, who hev hunderds of niggers of evry shade and culler and
                  stile of feter, and emung the rest, quoderoons as favers thar owners as mutch as
                  wun musheroon favers enuther. Them fellers live like fightin cox, and looks down
                  upon the wun-hoss farmers as skratches for a livin in the barren sand with as
                  mutch contemp as a pecock would onto a tumble-bug. Most all the popalashin,
                     howsever,<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5729-00000140"/> rich and poor, is of the

                  ginralties. To return. As I was perseedin throo the woods I cum acrost a
                  remarkabul yaller-lookin white man sittin on the stump of a tree he hed jest cut
                  down, and amusin hisself with spittin at a mark he bed blazed onto an old chesnut
                  oak about ten feet off.</p>
               <p>"Wot mought you pay for that cretur of yourn?" ses he, as I rode up.</p>
               <p>"I dident buy him, my yaller flower of the forrest," ses I.</p>
               <p>"You look to me considabul like a Nuthern Mudsill," he remarkt throo his nose, at
                  the same time takin a lickwid shot at his terbacker-juice target.</p>
               <p>"You call yourself a Buckskin, I spose," I replide.</p>
               <p>"Umn-umn," he responded, spittin and noddin at the same moment.</p>
               <p>"Doos that mean yes, in Buckskin dialeck?" I inkwired.</p>
               <p>"Umn-umn!" he rejined.</p>
               <p>"Wal," ses I, "youre kwite right to call yourself a Buckskin, for your peltry
                  peers to be purty near the culler of my old Californy huntin shirt, eggsept whar
                  its warigated with the juce of the weed."</p>
               <p>"Umn-umn!" he ejacklated, fiercely, eggspectoratin like a hose pipe.</p>
               <p>"Have you heerd that we've givin the infarnal Secesh fits at all pints?" I
                  shouted.</p>
               <p>"Umn-umn?" ses he, inderogativly.</p>
               <p>"Darn your 'Umn-umn!'" ses I. "Why don't you utter articklit sounds, insted of
                  makin a noise like a bumble-bee with a bad catar?"</p>
               <p>"Umn-umn!" ses he agin, throwin away his kwid and spittin at it on the wing.</p>
               <p>And that was all I could git outer the interestin young Prence Georgian. I warnt
                  surprised, becase I new by eggsperiens the natur of the Prence George variety of
                  the human speeches, "Umn-umn" is the leadin frays of thar langwidge. It hes
                  twenty-five diffrent meanins, accordin to the way it is pernounst, and the oney
                  wunder to me is that they dont destroy the mewcuss membrains of thar noses, with
                  playin the variashins on it from mornin till night. Thar edicashin, upon the hull,
                  is not pollisht. Sum ken read, sum ken rite, and sum ken doo nuther; but as a
                  ginral thing oney the aristockracy ken doo both. They considder publick skools a
                  poplar error, and that the wisdom got outer books is all a follysee. The males
                  take to chawin immediently arter they hev dun teething, and parsevere in the
                  practis arter all thar teeth is gon. In thar fudes and kwarls they make it a rool
                  never to let a man up ef they ken help it, and air so fond of gouging that they
                  will amuse tharselves all day long with skoopin out the eyes of potaters, ef they
                  kant find ennything else to oprate upon. Sum of em, arter takin out the opticks of

                  convenient, with old sojers. I wunst seen this feet performt on Washington Race
                  Coarse.</p>
               <p>Takin it alltogether, I must say that my eggscurshin inter Prence George's County
                  diddent giv me a faverabul impresshin of the trooth and lyalty of the peeple of

               <p>All day yestday I was sirkilatin among a number of wownded cumpany ofsirs and
                  rebel prisners, sent in from our lines, and endevorin from thar conflicktin
                  ackounts to form sum idee of the conflick. But it was onpossabul. Our own tellers
                  unannymusly disagreed in thar stories and the rebels dident agree with, enny of
                  em. The fact is that suppleturn offsirs nose very littel of the ginral moovements
                  of a fight. They air too apt to dror thar inferences from wot occurs within thar
                  own feeld of observashin, and the premises bein narrer the conclushins is
                  laterally wide of the mark. Consekently wile a wownded captin belongin to the
                  force witch bed ockapied the ridges at Fredericksburg was sartain that we heed
                  nockt Ginral Lee inter a cockt hat, a leftenant from the right wing was of a
                  pinion that Ginral Hooker bed ben kickt higher'n a kite. Howsever as the leftenant
                  was a shiftless Dutchman from Ginral Shirtz divishin, and bed a bullet hole in the
                  sole of his foot, I let him run on without payin much attenshin to his
                  gabble-merely remarkin that as he appeered to hev ben in a bad persishin for seein
                  wot was goin on in frunt, I should prefer waitin for Ginral Slowcum's report. He
                  warnt awar I spose that I bed alreddy heerd of the grand stampede of the Dutch
                  under Shirtz, a feet as will proove to all cummin ages that altho clumsy to look
                  at, thar is wunderful fleetness in the German Race. A wownded offsir of Best's
                  Artillery, who arrove here this mornin, ses he never seen the crack runners of the
                  Turn Veerin make setch time as all hans did arter Stunwall's Jackson's gang gin
                  thar battel yell and made thar rush. "Ive heern tell," ses he darfin in spite of
                  his wownd, "of the Flyin Dutchman of the Sea, but seven thousand flyin Dutchmen on
                  the land, with a volley of musketry plumpen inter thar starns, is a mutch sublimer
                  specktickle." By all ackounts, ef they hedn't ben brort up all standin by the
                  bagnets of Sykeses Reglars, they would hev kept on to the day of thar deth, like
                  thar sellybrated kentryman with the clockwurk leg.</p>
               <p>As to the rebel prisoners, thar ginral asspeck is skallywaggish, and sum of em
                  smells like old cannon swobs, in consekens of hevin ben primed with a mens
                  kwantities of rum and gunpowder prevus to goin inter ackshin. In coarse the
                  reackshin is tremenjus, now the effecks of the steamin is goin off, and not a few
                  of em is in a condishin borderin on wot the doctors call many a pot you. Thar
                  wardrubs air mostly light and well adopted to porpuses of ventilashin; and judgin
                  from thar thredbar apperience, you would say setch men must sun be worsted. But
                  thar frames air well knit and wiry, and they hev a rattlesnaky snaky eggspreshin
                  about the eyes that is by no means engagin. As to fitin, most of em is born with a
                  nateral taste for it, wile with us Nutherners it is ackwired. Howsever, kwite a
                  number of those I hev converst with complains of the shortness of grub in the
                  rebel ranks, and seems ankshus for a speedy piece. "At first," ses wun of em to
                  me, yestday, "I thort it was a jam up thing to be a sojer; but toting a muskit on
                  an emty stummick is alarmin hard work, Il be gaul darned ef it isent!" Anuther
                  told me he bed "drord no pay for leven munths, and ben down with the billus
                  remittance besides, and he wisht he mought go ded if he dident think it was bout
                  time for both sides to stop butting and gouging, and rest on thar lorils." Several
                  that I torked to declard they hed no desire to be "traded off for Yankees," but
                  would rayther stay here and take the oath of a legions than be sent back to the
                  Secesh army.</p>
               <p>The Secesh simperthisers here is in an agerny about Ginral Lee's extree-hazardus
                  persishin, and the presents of two thousand five hunderd captivated rebels in the
                  city, with four or five thousand more to foller, sours the milk of human kindness
                  in thar coco nuts considabul. But they think it best to cork up the vials of thar
                  rath, and let consealment like a wurm in the bud pray on thar dammask cheeks, for
                  fear they should sheer the fait of Villaindigham, who, in consekens of shoin his
                  hand in Ohio, hes put his foot in it.</p>
               <p>The noose in town to-day is that the Monitors is preparin wunst more to enter the

                  the road to the sorces of the Niger, witch I remember readin about when a
                  youngstir, in Mungo Park. Hooker's dash, howsever, is sartainly an improovement on
                  the Burnside smash, tho the result of the fray is percisely the same, and was
                  announst by eye-witnesses in the same frayseology, namely "Our Army hes recrost
                  the river in saifty." It is satisfactory to no that our survivin collumes hes
                  returnt saift. The return of killed and wownded is onavoidably postponed, for the
                  present, in consekens of thar bein left on the right bank of the Rapperhammock,
                  reposin on the bed of glory. That collume, when it cums to be footed up, will be a
                  hevvy wun Ime afeard.</p>
               <p>The most cumfurtin fetor of the bluddy affair is the large number of rebels slain.
                  Bein more'n hafe slewed with rum and gunpowder, they rusht blindly on thar doom
                  and was tumbled over in heeps by our staggerin showers of grape. The sum totil as
                  bit the dust is onknown, as it warnt conveenyent to stay long enuffon the ground
                  to count em up; but when our army goes back to finish up the job, that dooty will
                  be performt, and the fishal ackount publisht. As to prisners we hev stacks of em,
                  and capterd rebel flags is so plenty in the market that they may be called a drug
                  rayther than a standard airtickle.</p>
               <p>The reports from the Theayter of War clash so orfully, that it is difficult for
                  enny wun not behind the seens to assertain the origin of our discomforter. Sum ses
                  it was the wether. Uther sum allows we sheuld hey hed to back down wether or no.
                  Distingwisht milentary men thinks the enemee outflankt us; sum thinks they
                  outspankt us. Who nose? Wun thing is shoor. The story of thar flite from the line
                  of the Rapperhammock, was a flite of fancy. In coarse you hey red Fitin Joes
                  flamming address, congratalatin our army on its defeet. Ginral Lees manyfester
                  claimin a complete sucksess is in a simildar vain. As far as Bunkum is consarned
                  it is about a tie atwixt em, but our Ginral is on the rong side of the river,
                  witch is a serus drawhack.</p>
               <p>Onder the suckemstances, it's wunderful consolin to refleck that Stunman inflicted
                  a stunner on the rebs by cuttin thar railroads when they hed no more sojers in
                  Richmound to send over em. Also we oughter to be thankful to no that ef Hooker hed
                  larnt that important fack in time, he would hev "delivered battle" with his hull
                  army, in place of deliverin the army itself, with immedient despatch, on the North
                  bank of the Rapperhammock. It is likewise a proud thort that the sight of our
                  troopers throo sevral old wimmin in the secesh Capital inter sreekin hisstearicks,

               <p>Wunst more the oncommon smartness of the man called by Providence, throo the
                  Ballet Box, to rool over the most enlightened ened nayshin out, hes ben made
                  palpabul to the meanest comprehensin. I informt you in my last that he stud alone
                  amidst the assembeld wisdunm of his Cabnet, with reports of the capter of
                  Vicksburg thunderin in his ears, and eggsprest the bleef that it had not been
                  captivated. He prayed that it mought hey ben, but he was shoor it hedent; and
                  Hevin, ankshus to oblige the kentry with a noo pruff of his penetrashin, thort it
                  best to disregaird his prayers in order to vindicate his judgment. Bein onwilling
                  to place Hevin in setch an embarrassin predickyment a seckind time, he preposes to
                  remain abeslootly non-commital dooring the remainder of the sege. I hey axed him
                  repetidly within the last few days wot he sposed would be the isoo, and his
                  uniform anser hes ben "I look for the best that ken possably happen, and also for
                  the wurst that ken possably occur, and shell cherfully ackquiess in either." He
                  hes given the same reply I understand to all inkwirin frends, and may now be sed,
                  figgeratively speakin, to be standin nooter afore the peepul, with his eyes shet
                  and his mouth opin, waitin for wot Providence may send him. From the present
                  asspeck of affairs he will probly hev to remain in that attitood for sum time
                  afore ennything draps.</p>
               <p>Yestday thar was a report in town that Ginral Pemberton was hung, but on tracin it
                  to the War Offis I found it arose from the mistake of a clerk as dident no the
                  ropes, who hed red in a Richmound paper that he was sed to hev ben suspended. The
                  noose was too good to be troo. Auger, I notis, hes given the rebels a round turn
                  at Port Hudson, and the prospect of his speedily puttin the screws to that
                  important post air, upon the hull, encurridging. Ginral Sexton hes jest ben on
                  from Port Ryal, and he intermated, I orderstand, that Hunter and the Cummander at
                  Newbern hes berrid the hatchet and smoked the calamus, like Foster-bruthers.
                  Gammon! Hunter, in coarse, hes the warm sport of Chase, but he's bound to be
                  releaved, witch will be a great releaf to Foster, who luvs him rayther wurse than
                  Satan luvs Saint Peter.</p>
               <p>Ginral Sexton speaks highly of the condishin of our cullerd brethren in arms in
                  South Caroliny. He ses thar soles air in the cause, and if they git a chanst at
                  thar late masters, the wool will be apt to fly. As a body he considers them ekwil
                  to enny race in the wurld; and feels sartain that all the charges made agin em
                  will be rebutted in thar first collushin with the enemee. I don't see myself why
                  they should be more afeard to risk thar carcasses than us Carcassians; and as they
                  hev ben Cuffed all<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5729-00000147"/> thar lives, its oney

               <p>On the banks of the Rapperhammock, a deth-like kwiet prevales. Sum sposes as
                  Ginral Hooker is ritin a full report of the Union cashualities in the late
                  splurge, and doosent want to be annoyed and put out. Bein a slow penman it may
                  prehaps take him ontil the middle of July to get throo, and then ef the wether is
                  considerd warm enuff he may possably wunst more open fire upon the enemee. In the
                  intrim the Army of the Potomac picknicks in peace in the midst of the most
                  pickteresk senery, and is serenaded evry night by hunderds of birds of the

                  thar ded comraids, disguysed in fethers, offerin a frendly subjestin as to what
                  oughter be dun to evry wayward sister of the Sutherin Cornfedracy.</p>
               <p>Torkin of sperrits, hev you heerd that sartain members of the Cabnet, as hev
                  desarvedly lost all confidens in tharselves, hes commenst consultin the sperrits
                  of just men made perfeck. They doo say as meetins hey been held at the White House
                  at witch the presense of sum distingwisht members of the underground frayternity
                  was respeckfully reckwested, in order to obtain thar vews on the conduct of the
                  war. Ef flyin rummers is to be bleved, several deceast worriers sent wurd by the
                  subtrainyan tellagraft that they considerd the kentry goin to the dogs. Ginral
                  Jackson is reported to hev rapt out his opinyun on the hed of the Seckatry of War
                  in the most emfatic terms to be found in the ded langwidges. Seckatry Welles is
                  also stated to have ben sarved in the same way by the gostes of Perry and Decatur.
                  I don't like to repeat the eggspreshins sed to hey ben addrest to the Seckatries
                  by the departed heroes, bekase I event mutch faith in the story; but ef they did
                  make the remarks attribitted to em, I honor thar judgment and respeck thar
                  candor.</p>
               <p>The minds of the Constitooshinal Advisers is considabully eggsersised jest now
                  about the Cornskripshin. To borrer a metafor, from a high sorce, witch you may hev
                  possibly met afore in the noosepapeers, every thing is reddy to "run the masheen";
                  but it is thort that it mought run eesier ef the wheels was greazed witch a leetle
                  of the ile of victory. As sun as the Gibberalter of the Mussysippi is took, the
                  President will call for three or four hunderd thousand men to finish up the war,
                  and it is hoped the draft will be cherfully honered. "Oney let us open the river,"
                  ses Stanton, "and thar'll be no difficulty about gettin the peeple to fall in."
                  And Halleck allows that when setch is the case, evryboddy abul to bare arms will
                  be willin to roll up thar shirt sleeves and do thar purtyest. On the uther hand,
                  ef Grant should go to pot the masses wont be kwite so eger to be musterd. The
                  plain trooth is—and its well onderstood here—that we've cum to the turnin pint of
                  the great shindy. Queer noshins will occur to the best regulated fammalies, and

                  about plannin campains than the Man in the Moon nose about the state of publick

                  should hev sezed upon the poplar mind; but the peeple hes ben so frekwently

                  troo, bekase the wownded is arrivin at Alexandry, witch is a kinder bulletin that
                  speaks for itself. It seems that the rebel Ginral Stuart meditated a rush inter
                  Merryland and hed mustered his collumes of a salt in the neyborhood of
                  Crullpepper, hopin to cross the Potomac afore we could ketch up with him. It was a
                  spicy project, but Hooker put his finger in the dish and spylt it. Yestdtay,
                  Ginral Plesenton pitcht inter Stuart with cavalry, infantry, and artillery, on the
                  Rapperhammock, sumwhars near Sulfur Springs, and wuul of the wownded ses we gin
                  him ——, while uthers allow he gin us an ekwilly warm resepshin. The

                  he ses nuthin, and as he is ushilly ready enuff to shoot with a lonmg bow when
                  thars the slitest ground to go upon, menny considders his silence aquiverlent to a
                  defeet. I hope its not so this time, tho when I axed him for the latest
                  awethentick informnashin, he sirveyed me contempshusly over the rims of his
                  spectickles, and sed he hed too mutch foursight to entrust importent farels to
                  mussenary skribblers. Onwillin to take offence whar, prehaps, nun was intended, I
                  shuck him corjally by the hand, and remarkin in a friendly way that he was a
                  "bully boy with a glass eye", or, ef he preferd the frays, "a big thing in
                  perryfocals". I started for the Navy Department, to pump the ruth outer Welles.
                  But accordin to that distingwisht marriner's invariabul custom, he knew nuthin. He
                  heddent even heerd that the Alabammer hed taken four more ships, and that Captin
                  Semmes hed rekwested the skippers to giv his complements to the Honoabul Rip Van

                  replide, "very mutch so," and that when a boy nuthin sooted him better than to put

               <p>Senst the foregoin parrygraft was endited, I hed a short cornference with the head

                  upon witch he gin me a playfull poke in the rebs, and anserd that we would probly
                  "lick the enemee as ushil". I sed, "May it please your Eggsllency, thats nuther

               <p>"Wots the kweery?" he responded.</p>
               <p>"Is the Mollycoff" of the Mussysippy doomed?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Thats accordin as it falls" he replide.</p>
               <p>At this pint he shet down onto me, and I could git no further satisfackshin on the
                  subjeck. About the affairs atwixt Plesenton and Stuart he was more commoonicativ.
                  He showed me, sum dispatches he hed jest received, and, on readin em, I sed, "Its
                  a brilyant victry on our side ef these ackounts air troo, and they may be
                  air."</p>
               <p>"May be air," he sithed, repeatin my wurds like an eccho. I dunno as he ment

                  intended it as a joak—wun of his solem 'ums.</p>

               <p>We air preparin for a combat. Ginral Hindshellman cummands the milentary, and
                  Ginral Panic the civillains. Ginral Abraham Lincoln cummands hisself (witch is
                  more'n ken be sed of evryboddy here), and tharfore oughter cummand universal sport
                  and simperthy. He is a trump, and ekwill to the crysis. So am I. I dont think
                  Halleck is. Nor Stanton. Hooker may or he may not. Time will tell. What time I
                  cant say; but probly sum time atween this and Saterday night. We air on the eve of
                  great events, and shell be evry evening ontil further notis. Our defenses in frunt
                  is bein made stronger by wurkin parties of contrabans. But we are weak in the
                  rare, and thar, sum thinks, the rebels will endevor to plug us. Nuthin ken eggseed
                  the eggsightment of our kullerd brethren. You ken see it in the whites of their
                  eyes and thar ginral demeaner. Evry contraban is wedded to the Union eaws, and
                  will die in the last ditch ef Washington falls. So will myself and Mr. Lincoln. We
                  swore it in his sanktum to-day, with our hands on his admirabul treaties on
                  arbitrary arrests, witch hes ben printed in pamflit form and is as troo as

                  long by eight inches acrost, and as purty a bed of glory as ever you seen. Stanton
                  kant cum in—it isent wide enuff. In this emerginsea the President feels whoos his
                  frend. We will sink or swim together. Ef ennything happens, speak of us as we
                  deserve. Nuthin exterminate nor <unclear>0</unclear> set down in mallis. Say
                  Orestus sleeps with his Pieladies; Demon with his Pithyass. And so no msore! These

                  it comes to that we shall fall on our swoords. I hed a very hansum silver-handeld
                  wun presented to me at Harrassin Landlin, with a neat speetch, by the Duck de

                  shell compleat the sacrifiz. But Washington wont fall. It will see Ginral Lee
                  darned first. Ef I was an enshoorance kumpany Ide enshoor it for sevral per cent
                  onder the extree hazardous premium. We air fortifyin Rock Crick, and air about to
                  cut a canawl throo Gorgetown Heights, in order to unite it with the Potomac and
                  bring the gunboats round inter the slashes. Slygo Crick and the Norwest, two
                  streams remarbal for catfish and lampree eels (of witch Ginral Longstreet is sed
                  to be be very fond), is also bein put in a good state of defens, and the
                  broomsedge on the plantashins in Prence Georges bounty is to be lined with
                  sharpshooters. The Tiber is also to be dug out to the dept of thirty fathums, so
                  as to allow ship's of the line to lie at anchor there and purteck the market.

                  pitch inter us with the same troops from all kwarters at the same moment. He is a

               <p>The present warabouts of the Nashins Hope, Ginral Hooker, I am forbidden to

                  hes left New York for Albany, witch is encurredgin. When Ginral G. B. M. changes
                  his base, sumthins shoor to happen. It did, you know, when he changed his base

                  the White House wun of these days. Mebbe! In the interim he is waiting on
                  Providence. Let him wait. If ever thar was a hero as knowed how to wait, he doos.
                  Whenever he was ordered to advance at dubbel-kwick, he allus waited for the
                  waggins. Wunst he waited three weeks. Ef he was a waiter at a hottel, thar

                  and a hafe in a minit, railrode time. His brow is onruffled, his temper even. Ef
                  he hes enny new rinkels they air in his capayshus mind. I looked him strait in the

                  green thar. I dident. On the contrary, it was full of fire. He thinks a good deal
                  of Stanton—bout as much as I do. Ditto of Halleck. Welles the same. He's very kind
                  to me—Heaven bless him. He ses I may say wot I like of him and his'n. By "his'n"
                  he means the Constitooshinal Advisers. Ime not to be subjeck to arbitary arrests
                  nor sent to Fort Laugheryet, nor made a present to Jeff Davis, nor utherwised

               <p>J. H.—Keep shady! We've ben keepin shady too long. We want to go right out inter
                  the open, and pitch inter the enemee wharever we ken find em.</p>
               <p>A. L.—But Washington must be defended, Hooker. Stanton ses so, and Halleck, and
                  likewise Welles. How menny live men hev you, all tolled?</p>
               <p>J. H.———thousand infantry,——thousand cavalry, and——batteries.</p>
               <p>A. L.—My Constitooshinal Advisers allows we want em all, and more too, to defend
                  Washington agen the ruthless invaders.</p>
               <p>J.—Doos your Eggsellency spose you ken "ockapy and possess" the rebel strongholts,
                  and carry out the Mancipayshin Act, by fendin off insted of goin in.</p>
               <p>A. L.—No, you thurrow-goin old fire-eater, I don't, and I confess Ime in favor of
                  vigrus meshurs myself, but Stanton and Halleck.</p>
               <p>J. H.—Sir, you air Commander-In-Chief. You ken cut the tether that keeps the
                  finest army on the planet flutterin around the capital like a hen tied to a

                  Foller the instinks of your own lofty intellect, and let the Constitooshinal

                  <p>I rite airly this week, bekase I am goin out on a reckanuisance (desguysed as a
                     rebel to that degree that my own boss wont no me), and shell not be back from
                     the frunt for sum days. My misshin is strickly privit, and, by rekwest of the
                     President, I omit to state whar Ime bound, as he thinks it mought cumpromis mis
                     the saifty of his dearest and brayvest frend. I may state, howsever, without
                     vialatin instruckshins, that, in the wurds of Duglas in the play, it is my
                     objeck to "huvver about the enemee". Ef tuck up as a spy, I shell probly be
                     hung; ef not, I hop to elevate myself in the estimashin of my kentrymen. I
                     shell start in wun hour from the abuv date, and ef suckcessful, will send you
                     the minnits of my eggspedishin as sun as I return. I am allreddy a raid in
                     desguys, and will giv you sum idee of my secesh rig, witch I prechest
                     seckind-handed of a poor white trash that was brort in prisner this mornin. A
                     more seckind-handed soot hes seldum ben seen in civileyesd sosity. It consests
                     of a butter-nut coat cut down to a jacket by the thorn-bushes in the slashes,
                     and a pair of breaches to match; the hull bein satterated with all the juce
                     that the oner hed in him when he listed in the rebel sarvis. Also a slap-jack
                     hat, witch hes the aperience—and the aroamer currysponds—of hevin ben soked in
                     castor-ile for a cupple of years or so. Likewise a pair of ventilatin boots,
                     the soles of witch is tide to the uppers with ropeyarn legaments at the toes,
                     and in setch a wownded condishin at the opposit eends as to be past healin. In
                     this elegant costoom, with my pistils stuck in a belt, considder myself "the
                     yaller flower of the forrest." My idee is to be mistuck for a secesh gorilla,
                     on his way to Pennsylvany to plunder the Nuthern slop shops. It seems to me
                     that in setch duds as these the rebel offsirs will never mistrust that Ime not
                     wun of thar own vermin. The oridginal oner of the wardrub is a well nit man,
                     about my own bild. He hails from Louseanna, and I shell try to imitate his
                     dirty and sluvenly asspeck, and ef kwestined, shell swar that I was born and
                     brort up in that state. I dessay you will think it rayther a pokerish bizness
                     Ime goin on, but Ive saved my har in menny a wuss skrape. Ef Washington,
                     Bawltomore, and Philadelphy falls inter the hands of the Cornfedrits while Ime
                     on the skout, I intend to make my way to New York by way of Vicksburg. By that
                     time the Mollycoff of the Mussysippi will be ourn, and I ken bring Grant and
                     his army along, so as to take Lee on his west flank, and turn the tide of
                     victry in faver of the Army of the Potomac, and the lively, enterprisin,
                     prompt, and paytryotic citysins of the Keystone State.</p>
                  <p>The President, tho sumwot cast down, is in faver of a firm stand at the Seat of
                     Guverment. The Slashes is to be fortyfide, and the cavalry stashind as
                     look-outs on Georgetown Heights; men on hossback bein abel to see further than
                     a-foot, and high pints of land bein particklerly faverabul for the moovements
                        of<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5729-00000153"/> redgements of boss. (See
                     "Camppains of the Duck of Marlburrow", and uther wurks.) Sharpshooters with
                     Minie rifuls are to be posted in the poplars of Pennsylvany avenoo, in the
                     manner reckommended by Joe Minie and uther poplar milentary riters. Stanton
                     will take charge of these matters, assisted by Halleck. Nether of em is as much
                     skairt as they mought be. Welles hes ben rekwired by the President to furnish a
                     force from the Navy Department and hes sent a messidge to the Maireens. The
                     Father of his Kentry is attendin to the deepenin of Tiber Crick, so as to bring
                     up the gunboat flowtiller, but he ses the mud is so thick that it is difficult
                     to run the masheen. The canawl throo the Heights, witch I spoke of in my last,
                     is not yet cumpleated, but as sun as it is the cavalry in that rejin will be
                     re-enforst with friggits and ships-of-the-line. Stanton calls for volunteers,
                     and Chase is on hand with the sinners of war. Seward doosent say mutch, but is
                     presoomed to be prepard for the onrepressabul conflick, and Blare is reddy to
                     cum forth when the trumpit sounds. In short, all the Constitooshinal Advisers
                     is in a state of eggsightment, witch, if not sublime, is within a step of
                     it.</p>
                  <p>The Adamantine Abraham is as cool and capabul as ever I seen him. No catastrofy

                     two in Spitendevil Crick.</p>
                  <p>"D. V.," ses he to me this mornin, "the Commershil Emporium must be defended to
                     the last gasp."</p>
                  <p>Ses I, "Troo, your Eggsellency; and when the New Yorkers see it

                  <p>He was satisfide. But he is onesy, tho he desdains to sho it, about
                     Philadelphy. I told him New York would rush to the reskew of her sister city
                     when the crysis came. He replide that he sposed so, and added, with his
                     customery beamin smild, that it was differcult for a city to stand firm when
                     thar was so menny Quakers in it.</p>
                  <p>The modern <emph>Patter Pattery</emph> and myself both thinks that the fate of
                     the kentry will be setteld within three weeks or a munth at furdest.</p>
                  <p>It that time it will ether be <emph>up</emph>, with us or <emph>down</emph>
                     with the rebels. Ef the men of the North air men, and ef the Army of the
                     Potomac, or rayther its offsirs, is wurth shucks, Lee and his murmurduns is
                     gonners. His invashin is the act of a madman, and onless our Ginrals is
                     downright idyots, his doom is sealt.</p>
                  <p>But it is now wun o'clock, post meriden, and I must mount and away. Ef I am
                     sezed and eggsecuted as a spy, send for my boddy—it ken be of no use to

                  and reported at the White House. The President receved me with mutch feline. When
                  I enterd the sanktum, he opend his arms, and the next moment I was in Abraham's
                  buzzum. "Allbeat unused to the meltin mood", as the More of Venus ses, I thort I

                  thar air moments when the emoshins of the human sole sets eteket at defiance. In
                  the midst of the tutchin seen, a messindger tapt at the door to say that the

               <p>"Tell the Cabnet they may go to—work, and Ile be thar presently," sed he, modifyin
                  his first idee as he finisht the sentence.</p>
               <p>Then turnin to me, he added, with a grayshus smild:</p>

               <p>We then sot down for a few minits to enjye a feast of resin, and, to mysten it, he
                  brort out the Mungoheeler and a gobblet, for my accommydashin. I say for my

               <p>"Let her run!" I eggsclamed, takin a long swaller; "the harder she runs, the

               <p>"Is thar nary ford that'll afford him a chanst to cross?" I axed.</p>
               <p>"Nary—not ef evry traytor was as tall as I am," he responded, stretchin his lofty

               <p>"Ef thats the case," ses I, "they 'll be gobbled, and we shant need anuther draft.

               <p>"Amen!" cried the Father of his Kentry. "Ef the Sutherners will oney lay down thar

                  They mooved with mesherd steps, as ef marchin to the music of the Union, and thar
                  toot in shamble was imposin. A Cabnet, takin it by and large, is an imposin

                  individyals is fond of makin hisself conspickuous and bein cock of the walk, and

                  with a baird like a mounting goat and a crest like a cockytoo. Halleck had the
                  aperience of a gentman as felt his oats tryin to look moddest onder the pressher

                  wouldn't be took by common white folks for a Cabnet Minister, but sum of our men

                  But why should I dwell on the asspecks and carrickters of these distingwisht men.
                  Thar fotagruffs air in evry winder, and thar prented dockments and speetches are

               <p>It is the ginral opinyun here that the row was got up in the hope of helpin the
                  South by a divershin in its faver at the very moment when the Union armies was
                  evrywar victoryus. It hes ben known for sum time by the Fedral orthorities that
                  thar was a sekrit conspurracy agen the Guverment in New York. It was also known
                  that rebel emiseries was at work thar, and that ef Vicksburg was took, and Lee was
                  whipt, thar was to be a traiter outbrake in the North. This was Jeff Davises
                  forlorn hope—the last keard of the rebellyun. Well Vicksburg is ourn, Port Hudson
                  is ourn, Lee is licked, Bragg is floored, Jo Johnston is flyin from the rath to
                  cum, Price is discomforted, Charlestun is as good as gon, Mobile is spoken for,
                  and the last keard of Treason is played in New York. But the dern yer resort will
                  fail. In spite of the simperthisers the rebellyun is a goner. Nearly two-thirds of
                  Jeffdom is conkerd, and the rest is cavin in. This infarnal riot may giv the rebel
                  leaders a little encurridgement, but it wont be of enny substanshil bennyfit. Let
                  the cornskripshin be gin up. We don't need it. We ken finish up the biziness with
                  the forces we hev now in the field, and freewill recrutes. Four hunderd and fifty
                  peaces of artillery and a hunderd and fifty thousand stands of small arms hev
                  fallen into our hands within the last twenty days, and about one hunderd thousand
                  rebel sojers hes ben put horse de combat. Our land forces outnumbers theirn, full
                  two to wun, to say nuthin of the Navy. I say we've got em. Salt won't save em. The

                  high cockalorum fellers of the "superur race" at Port Hudson. I tell you theyre
                  played out. I giv em credit for pluck and parseverance, but they kant save

                  the Constitooshinal advisers put thar hand to ennything, as a ginral thing they

                  for givin Jeff a Digtatership, and argews that in the present desput strait of the
                  Suthern Cornfedracy, thars nuthen for it but desputism. The Wig on the other hand,
                  intimates in the pianist kinder langwidge, that it hes no confidens wotsumdever

                  retches terms that they will jump at. The great stumblin-block is our
                  woolly-hedded bruther. We've promist that he shell be forever free, but mebbe
                  onder all the suckemstances he wouldn't mind postponyin the matter a wile and
                  takin his libty in periodical doses. Ennyhow there'd be no harm in axin him, and
                  ef he agreed it mought save afewshin of blud.</p>
               <p>John Bull's a remarkabul saygashus feller, isent he? How well he guest the fate of
                  Lee's host in Pennsylvany. The London <title>Times</title> proffersied that Jeff
                  Davis would dicktate turms of peace from Washington. How air you Thunderer? Ime
                  curus to see how the British oriculs is goin to crawl out. Wun thing's shure,
                  they've got to stop fittin out Rebel men-of-war. My friend Abraham is good-naterd
                  to a folt; but as he remarkt to me when we last disgust the subjeck, thar is a
                  pint at witch piracy ceses to be a virtoo. That pint has been reeched, and John
                  Bull may confidently eggspect kicks ef he continners to countnance free booting.
                  Whiting hes gone over to giv him fare warnin, and he's either got to fall back or
                  fite. A joak's a joak, but this prayin on our commerce in British bottoms, is a
                  bellygerent act, and kan't be tolerated enny longer. Hoping that Whiting will do
                  the matter up brown, and indooce John Bull to do wot he hates to when it
                  interfears with his intrests, and that's justice. I remain, as ushil,</p>
