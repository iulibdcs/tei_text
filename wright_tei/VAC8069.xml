CHAPTER I.&#xD;
MAKING UP 1115 MIND.&#xD;
Thnnn had been a shower in the earlier&#xD;
part of the day, but the April afternoon was&#xD;
very fair and peaceful, full of the fragrance&#xD;
of opening blossoms, the rustle of half-grown&#xD;
leaves, the glitter of rain-drops, the glimmer&#xD;
of capricious sunlight, the twitter of full-&#xD;
throated birds, the tender beauty, and the&#xD;
whole indescribable charm of the spring-&#xD;
time, when a sturdy horseman rode up to&#xD;
the door ~f Seyton House, and calling to&#xD;
one of two negro boys, who were makingg a&#xD;
great deal of play and very little work for&#xD;
themselves on its broad, green lawn, asked&#xD;
* where their master was.&#xD;
"You'll find him in the liberty, Mr.&#xD;
Blake," answered the nearest one, touch-&#xD;
ing his hat, with that subtle mixture of re-&#xD;
spect and familiarity only possible to the ser-&#xD;
vant of the ancient re'gimc.~ "He looked&#xD;
out of the window a little while back, and&#xD;
axed if you hadn't come y~t. Hold Brown&#xD;
Jerry? Yes, sir. Mus' I take him to the&#xD;
stable'?"&#xD;
"No," said Mr. Blake, dismounting as he&#xD;
spoke. '~ No-I sha'n't be long, Walk him&#xD;
till l~e cools oft; and then fasten him here.&#xD;
What are you doing, or pretending to do?"&#xD;
"Rolling the lawn, sir. Mr. Farris se1~&#xD;
us at it."&#xD;
"Mr. Farris might better have stayed to&#xD;
see it done~ then. You may tejI him so,&#xD;
when he~ comes. In the library, did you&#xD;
say?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Although ho ~is~ke.d the q~uesi4on, he 4id&#xD;
not wait for an ai~swer, but strQde away at~&#xD;
once, skirting tJ~e lofty frpnt~p~~'tie&amp;amp;, the&#xD;
jutting bay-windows, and the niaujy angles&#xD;
in which Seyton, Hojise abounded, until lie&#xD;
turned suddenly upon a hroad terrace set&#xD;
out with vases and balustrade in the Italian&#xD;
style, and commanding, a~striki~gly magi~fi-&#xD;
cent view-a. view so~ magufficent, ix~d~ed,&#xD;
and so important in the story which is to&#xD;
come, that it merits afew wo~ls of careful&#xD;
description andoareful attention.&#xD;
First, however, i1~ may be well tp state&#xD;
that Seyton House was o~e of those solid&#xD;
and somewhat stately r9lics of colonial&#xD;
times which are yet tQ be foun~l, at $i4er-&#xD;
vals throughout Yi~rginia. ani the Carolinas,&#xD;
and that it h~d been b~iilt by ~ of the&#xD;
many Cavalier aslventurer~, pf. good, blood&#xD;
but scanty fortuile, who tbrQnged t}ie~hores&#xD;
of America during the reign pflizabeth&#xD;
and her Stuart 5uccessQr8-~--one ~whpu~ atm-&#xD;

spent in the search; however, end, when ftr-&#xD;
tune at last came, youth and ,t~he capacity&#xD;
of enjoyment were alike goi~e fron~ him.&#xD;
The king he had served was~ an ~xil~, ,tbe&#xD;

6                          MABEL LEE.                                                          MAKING UP HIS MIND.                    7&#xD;
&#xD;
ugly; so, sadly enough, he resigned him-&#xD;
self to the trite fact that change and time&#xD;
stand still for no man, and prepared to en-&#xD;
joy his wealth where he had found it. He&#xD;
settled, therefore, in the colonies, drank&#xD;
King James's health to the end of his life,&#xD;
and died at last, leaving behind him two&#xD;
more than ordinarily enduring monuments&#xD;
of his existence. One was this stately house&#xD;
which bore his name; the other, a charge&#xD;
upon his descendants never to part with, or&#xD;
suffer this inheritance to be alienated from&#xD;
them, but, in case the entail expired, to re-&#xD;
new it immediately. Under English law&#xD;
the fulfilment of this requirement had&#xD;
been very easy, but, when the government&#xD;
changed~ hands, it became more difficult;&#xD;
yet, even then, family pride found such good&#xD;
means to compass its end, that for more&#xD;
than ahundredyears the Seytonpropertyhad&#xD;
remained intact, chiefly through a peculiar&#xD;
family custom, which in time became a fam-&#xD;
ily obligation. This custom made it bind-&#xD;
ing on every third possessor of the house&#xD;
to ~renew the entail (which, according to&#xD;
American law, could not be extended be-&#xD;
yond one generation), securing the noble old&#xD;
mansion and the broad lands for which the&#xD;
Seytons could still show King James's grant&#xD;
to one direct heir, and thus preserving them&#xD;
from the indignity of division and spoha-&#xD;
tion. This was the Seyton tradition, and,&#xD;
up to the time of which we write, no Sey-&#xD;
ton had ever betrayed the trust given to&#xD;
him, or taken advantage of that power&#xD;
which rested with every third one-the&#xD;
power of ceasing to renew the entail.&#xD;
Thanks to this wise policy, there was no&#xD;
such place, far and wide, as the Seyton&#xD;
place;' no such stately old house, full of the&#xD;
savor of well-preserved antiquity; no such&#xD;
grand old trees as those that girdled it; no&#xD;
sui~h treasures of pictures, plate, and furni-&#xD;
ture, as those with which it was filled; no&#xD;
such fertile fields and royal woods as those&#xD;
that stretched around it, far as the eye could&#xD;
reach, and no such view as that which could&#xD;
be gained by standing on its southern ter-&#xD;
race. For the dead and gone Cavalier who&#xD;
first selected this site for his future home,&#xD;
must have owned sonfething of an artist's&#xD;
eye, and an artist's love of the beautiful.&#xD;
&#xD;
At least he had placed his new eyry on the&#xD;
most commanding height of all the undulat-&#xD;
ing country, crowning a lofty hill, like some&#xD;
l5lhineland castle, while at its feet rolled the&#xD;
most beautiful of all our beautiful southern&#xD;
streams-that lovely Ayre, which, sweep-&#xD;
ing down through all the rich lowlands and&#xD;
fertile plains, never loses the crystal pu-&#xD;
rity of its mountain birthright, until it is&#xD;
whelmed in the vast Atlantic.&#xD;
Standing on the terrace of Seyton house,&#xD;
it would be hard to say how many miles lay&#xD;
spread out like a panorama before the gaz-&#xD;
er's eye-miles of green slope and flashing&#xD;
water, of graceful hills and cultivated val-&#xD;
leys, of waving woods and distant moun-&#xD;
tains, of oil things fair and dainty; and beau-&#xD;
tiful it seemed, as the April sunlight rested&#xD;
on them, bringing out the delicate emerald of&#xD;
early spring, the clouds of tinted blossom,&#xD;
the flickering vicissitudes of light and shad-&#xD;
ow, and the crystal depths of the river that&#xD;
lay under the tender sky, as blue and peace-&#xD;
ful as an Italian lake. The broad lawn,&#xD;
the shrubberies and gardens of the house,&#xD;
stretched away on the other side, and made&#xD;
the approach very beautiful; but here the&#xD;
ground shelved down abruptly in almost&#xD;
precipitous descent to the river-side. There&#xD;
was a narrow foot-path which wound down&#xD;
the face of the bluff; but only those who&#xD;
were at once very sure-footed and very sure-&#xD;
headed did well to try it; while, leaning&#xD;
over the balustrade, it was possible to drop&#xD;
a stone directly down, a distance of eighty&#xD;
feet, into the limpid waters below. A short&#xD;
distance up the stream lay a small island,&#xD;
which looked fair enough and picturesque&#xD;
enough to have been the haunt of fairies&#xD;
and elves unnumbered-an island half a mile&#xD;
in length, by a much narrower width, and a&#xD;
perfect wilderness of trees and flowers; a&#xD;
place which was garlanded from end to end&#xD;
by jasmine and honeysuckle, and was a&#xD;
very popular resort for picnic-parties, Who&#xD;
often came in force from a pretty town that&#xD;
not very far off nestled against the river,&#xD;
and bore its name.&#xD;
Tow, when Mr. Blake came out on the&#xD;
terrace, he paused ent, and looked&#xD;
round him. N~ot t the ospect--for he'&#xD;
was familiar eno eh ~~ith th -but at the&#xD;
&#xD;
house, whose long French windows ~th&#xD;
only modern improvement about it) opened&#xD;
on this side to the ground. The bright af.&#xD;
ternoon was all around and about, dazzling&#xD;
him with its glory, however, and it was not&#xD;
until a voice, musical enough for a woman's,&#xD;
said, "Here I am, Blake," that he recog-&#xD;
nized the near neighborhood of his employ-&#xD;
er, Mr. Seyton. Even then he did not see&#xD;
him, but, shading his eyes with his hands,&#xD;
looked eagerly toward the house, in search&#xD;
of the familiar face that should have accom-&#xD;
panied those familiar tones. For they had&#xD;
lived together forty years, these two, in a&#xD;
companionship as intimate as their different&#xD;
positions would allow. It was a long time,&#xD;
and yet, to one of them at least, it seemed&#xD;
only yesterday when he had been a poor&#xD;
Irish boy, fresh from an immigrant-ship,&#xD;
without a shadow of character or recom-&#xD;
mendation, whom Mr. Seyton had taken in-&#xD;
to his employ out of the simple charity of&#xD;
his charitable heart. It had been a mere&#xD;
impulse of kindness with him, touched as&#xD;
he was by the boy's haggard face and&#xD;
straightforward story, but perhaps the prov-&#xD;
erb concerning those who entertain angels&#xD;
unawares was never better i1justr~ted.-&#xD;
Certainly the fine gentleman who stopped&#xD;
his horse, and listened to the ragged lad&#xD;
who rose up from a wayside stone to speak&#xD;
to him, did little, it would seem, which any&#xD;
* Christian might not have done, yet our good&#xD;
deeds come back to us sometimes with.the&#xD;
royal usury of heaven, and out of all the&#xD;
days of his life this 'day was the one which&#xD;
Gervase Seyton had most cause to bless, now&#xD;
that time had rolled on and made them both&#xD;
old men. He had been at that time loaded&#xD;
to the very earth with hereditary debts and&#xD;
liabilities - debts and liabilities which he&#xD;
saw no means of meeting, without being the&#xD;
first of his race to break in upon the domain&#xD;
set aside for entail-and it was this poor&#xD;
boy whQ seemed specially sent to clear off&#xD;
the incubus, without suffering a single rood&#xD;
of the old land to pass from the old name.&#xD;
I~obody had ever called Mr. Blake an over-&#xD;
seer, since the early days when he had been&#xD;
promoted to a position, for which there is&#xD;
no eract American term, but which in Eng-&#xD;
land would have been at once steward and&#xD;
&#xD;
confidential agent; and for nearly half a cen-&#xD;
tury the entire management of the Seyton&#xD;
estate had rested in his hands. The busi-&#xD;
ness talent he possessed was so great that&#xD;
he might have made a dozen fortunes for&#xD;
himself while he had been Working in the&#xD;
Seyton interest, and making the Seyton&#xD;
property thrice as valuable as it ever was&#xD;
before; but there was something almost&#xD;
pathetic in his dogged devotion to the per-&#xD;
son and interests of the man who had stood.&#xD;
between himself and starvation; the man'&#xD;
who seemed to the rest of the world only a&#xD;
graceful, fine gentleman, somewhat givento&#xD;
the weaknesses of dilettante and valetudi-&#xD;
nan, but whose bpst points and highest vir-&#xD;
tues were perhaps known only to God and&#xD;
this one honest heart.&#xD;
"Here I am, Blake," said that musical&#xD;
voice again, and this time with a decided&#xD;
petulance. "What a time you have been,&#xD;
to be sure!"&#xD;
"I couldn't help it, Mr Seyton," an-&#xD;
swered the other, as he came toward the'&#xD;
window from which the sound proceeded ;&#xD;
"I rode over to see Mr. Gross about the&#xD;
bottom-land he has been trespassing upon;&#xD;
so I didn't get your message till about half&#xD;
an hour ago.~~&#xD;
"Did you come over at once, then?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I did, without losing a mm--&#xD;
ute."&#xD;
"That is to say, without your dinner.'&#xD;
Just like you, Blake. I don't think I ever&#xD;
knew any man before so careless of his di-&#xD;
gestion. Go, and make Mrs. I~esbitt give&#xD;
you something to eat."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir," said Blake, with a&#xD;
smile, "but I had rather not. It upsets me~&#xD;
to eat out of my regular times, and I either&#xD;
take my dinner at twelve, by the stroke of,&#xD;
the clock, or not at all. I would not know&#xD;
what to make of myself if I went to dining&#xD;
at this time of day."&#xD;
"It is not late excepting by a barbarian&#xD;
standard of time," said Mr. Sexton. "You&#xD;
had' better take something."&#xD;
"If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd&#xD;
rather not."&#xD;
"It's not all the same to me, in the least&#xD;
-but I don't suppose you care about that,&#xD;
as long as you have your own obstinate&#xD;

&#xD;
MAKING UP HIS MIND.&#xD;
&#xD;
wny. I give you up, Blake-I give you up!&#xD;
and you had better take a seat."&#xD;
Mr. Blake was accustomed to being&#xD;
given up by his employer, so he submitted&#xD;
ve~ry; quietly, and took the indicated seat.&#xD;
Than he fanned himself slowly with his&#xD;
broad straw hat, and waited for Mr. Seyton&#xD;
to speak.&#xD;
The room which he had thus uncere-&#xD;
moniously entered was very luxuriously&#xD;
furnished, but somewhat sombre in effect,&#xD;
owing to the book-lined walls and dark oak-&#xD;
en panels; a room abounding in depths of&#xD;
shadow, which even the bright April sun-&#xD;
shine could not disperse, and from out&#xD;
whose mellow twilight white statues and&#xD;
husts gleamed with an almost spectral ef-&#xD;
fect; a room that was moderate in size and&#xD;
~er3r -perfeet in appointment; wher~ Mr.&#xD;
~eyfonspunt the major part of his life, and&#xD;
i4iioh therefore reflected, as in a mirror,&#xD;
much of his character and habits-plainly&#xD;
thu room of a scholar more elegant than&#xD;
profound, but of one Who also possessed a&#xD;
keen appreciation and love of art, which was&#xD;
rafs indeed in his day and generation-and&#xD;
a room that made a very effective back-&#xD;
ground. for the two men sitting by the open&#xD;
window.&#xD;
They were curious contrasts, thete two&#xD;
meli! -~-cui~ious examples of the power of&#xD;
that bidden force which we call sometimes&#xD;
aympiithy and sometimes attraction, and&#xD;
whioh, overleaping all barriers of diverse&#xD;
oa~te'and diverse nature, had brought them&#xD;
together out of the world - equal in one&#xD;
sense, at least-as friends.&#xD;
Tha one so bhiff and hearty, so tall and&#xD;
strongly built, with health and resolution,&#xD;
a~nI iiit~llect of a certain sort, too, in every&#xD;
line ~f the honest bronzed face, and every&#xD;
glance of the clear blue eyes !-a man whom&#xD;
t~e:verie~t' skeptic in human goodness and&#xD;
human honor might have trusted blindfold;&#xD;
yeta Maii of Whom knaves and swindlers&#xD;
woul&amp;amp;ha.ve steered Qlear by instinct; a man&#xD;
who could sooner have translated Chaldaic&#xD;

terfuge, and who, it was easy to see, pos-&#xD;
sb~s~4 to the full t'he courage and devotion&#xD;
tg~d faithfulness tha.t have made his race&#xD;
* famous; a man so full of vitality, that his&#xD;
&#xD;
mere presence made ordinary men ashamed&#xD;
of their dyspeptic stomachs and failing legs;&#xD;
whose hands were hardened by the toil of&#xD;
half' a century, but whose port was as up-&#xD;
right, whose stroke was as vigorous, and&#xD;
whose seat in the saddle Was as sure, as ever&#xD;
at twenty-five.&#xD;
The other, so slenderand pale and grace-&#xD;
ful, so evidently the finest of fine gentlemen,&#xD;
as he leaned back in the depths of his pur-&#xD;
ple-velvet chair, and looked at the sturdy&#xD;
yeoman, who sat before him. All his life&#xD;
long, people had called Mr. Seyton an ex-&#xD;
ceedingly handsome man, yet his lX3atures&#xD;
were almost too delicate for masculine beau-&#xD;
ty, and his figure was slight even to fragil-&#xD;
ity, while the fret outstretched before him,&#xD;
seemed tiny enough to have worn Cinderel-&#xD;
la's slipper, and the fair, blue-veined hands&#xD;
that rested on his knees looked as if noth-&#xD;
ing, save lace ruffles, should have fallen over&#xD;
them. Of its own type, however, his style&#xD;
was very perfect, for he was one of the men&#xD;
-and they are rare enough-upon whom&#xD;
the seal of refinement is so plainly set that&#xD;
iio outward circumstances can affect om~ out-&#xD;
ward disguises conceal it. If Mr. Seyton&#xD;
had been dressed in homespun, and placed&#xD;
in a garret, he would have looked, if any&#xD;
thing, more strikingly patrician than here&#xD;
under the shadow of his own roof-tree.&#xD;
Just at present he wore a loose morning-&#xD;
coat of black velvet, and the soft rich fabric&#xD;
suited him as nothing else could possibly&#xD;
have done; suited his transparent complex-&#xD;
ion and high-bred face; suited the brown&#xD;
eyes that had once been reckoned very fas-&#xD;
cinating; suited the silken curls of golden-&#xD;
brown hair-the hair that never grows&#xD;
gray, unless from sorrow or terror-suited&#xD;
his whole appearance, which seemed. more&#xD;
that of some petit-maitre of the sixteenth&#xD;
century, than a commonplace man of the&#xD;
commonplace to-day.&#xD;
Finding at last that Mr. Sexton did not&#xD;
seem' disposed to break the silence, Mr.&#xD;
Blake took that office upon himself.&#xD;
"Since you have sent for me, sir, I sup-&#xD;
pose that you have made up your mind."&#xD;
It was hesitatingly said, and there was&#xD;
plainly anxiety of 'some unusual sort in the&#xD;
gaze directed so earnestly toward' Mr. Sey-&#xD;
&#xD;
ton-the gaze which Mr. Sexton did not&#xD;
meet.' On the contrary, he looked straight&#xD;
out of the window, with those dreamy&#xD;
brown eyes of his, as he answered, in the&#xD;
same low, musical tone:&#xD;
"Well-yes, Blake. I think I may safe-&#xD;
ly say that I have made up my mind."&#xD;
The other leaned eagerly forward.&#xD;
"Well, sir?&#xD;
"Well, Blake-" A moment's pause,&#xD;
then Mr. Seyton suddenly flashed his eyes&#xD;
full upon those of his companion, with two&#xD;
short Words, "Philip Conway!"&#xD;
After that, there was a profound still-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
Mr. Sexton was the first to speak. After&#xD;
a while he leaned forward, and laid his soft,&#xD;
white hand on the two hard rough ones that&#xD;
were locked together over Blake's hat.&#xD;
"Old friend, ~ he said, '~vith the winning&#xD;
gentleness that all his life long had wiled so&#xD;
many hearts, "I knew it is hard on you, but&#xD;
try and forgive me. Try and understand&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Sir," said Blake, hastily, "it isn't tlust&#xD;
-it isn't myself-it isn't any thing but__"&#xD;
There came a warmer pressure of the&#xD;
two hands that still obstinately held them-&#xD;
selves together.&#xD;
"iDo you think I don't know what it&#xD;
is?" he asked. "Do you think I don't&#xD;
know that you are considering me-the&#xD;
poor life that is not worth an hour's pur-&#xD;
chase, remember-and these broad acres&#xD;
that you have saved from the usurer's&#xD;
clutches and th~ auctioneer's hammer?"&#xD;
"I'm thinking of you-of nothing else,"&#xD;
answered the other, brusquely. "As for&#xD;
the land, I saved it for you, and if-and if&#xD;
you were not here, it might go-anywh~re,&#xD;
to-morrow."&#xD;
"You saved it for me, yes," said Mr.&#xD;
Seyton, "but in doing that, you also saved&#xD;
it for the name. We must remember that,&#xD;
both of us; ana yet,' my poor Blake! it&#xD;
would hurt you to'see the fruits of your toil&#xD;
in spendthrift hands."&#xD;
"It would hurt me, sir, but not an hour&#xD;
longer than it would hurt you."&#xD;
"Well, it would not hurt me at all-&#xD;
after I Was once laid down to rest in the&#xD;
graveyard yonder-even if Philip Conway&#xD;
&#xD;
oomdd dissipate property which will bestrict~&#xD;
ly entailed upon his heir."&#xD;
"Sir," said Mr. Blake, and hi~ voice rose&#xD;
into something of solemnity-" sir, [ have&#xD;
told you that I am not thinking of the prop.&#xD;
erty. I tell you so again. I will even swear&#xD;
it, if you like."&#xD;
"Then what are you thinking of?"&#xD;
"That I fear harm and evil from any one&#xD;
who bears the Conway name, or owns, a&#xD;
drop of the Conway blood."&#xD;
"Harm! Towbom?"&#xD;
"To you. To all who may now or here-&#xD;
after be brought into contact with the man&#xD;
you would make your heir."&#xD;
"But what reason have you for saying&#xD;
I&#xD;
this? Have you ever heard any thing&#xD;
against my nephew?"&#xD;
"Never, sir. But I know the blood."&#xD;
"So do I, for that matter, and distrust&#xD;
it as heartily as you can. But it is only&#xD;
fair to give the boy the benefit of a doul~t.&#xD;
He is half Seyton, you know."'&#xD;
"Sir," said Blake, whose earnestness&#xD;
seemed to deepen, "the water in this vase&#xD;
is very pure and good now, but if you pour&#xD;
even so much as one drop of poison in it---&#xD;
would you like to drink it, then?"&#xD;
There is something very unansWerable&#xD;
in a sudden practical illustration, even if&#xD;
that illustration, as in the present instance,&#xD;
be not altogether a just one. Mr. Seyten&#xD;
was a good deal of a philosopher, and v~y&#xD;
fond of dealing in metaphor, but he fou#d&#xD;
himself looking at the vase which had *0&#xD;
well served his companion, without an~ ~i-&#xD;
swer ready, either to silence or i~ebiiku.&#xD;
Whereupon, Mr, Blake seized his opportu-&#xD;
nity, and went on:&#xD;
"Sir," he said,"I know you too wolf to&#xD;
think I can offend you by speaking plainly.&#xD;
Of all the base and cruel men X ha#e aver&#xD;

The honest Celtic eyes wandered round&#xD;
the stately room, and the broad, deserted&#xD;
terrace, where never a child's voice had&#xD;
echoed, or a child's foot danced in long&#xD;
years. Then he said, quickly:&#xD;
"If only your own son' was standing by&#xD;
you now, to take up the burden when you&#xD;
lay it down."&#xD;
Had the April sunshine suddenly grown&#xD;
dim, or were there quick, rushing tears in&#xD;
Mr. Seyton's soft brown eyes? Yet he only&#xD;
laid his hand gently on the broad shoulder&#xD;
beside him, and after a moment said, qui-&#xD;
etly:&#xD;
"Then wish that I had been more pa-&#xD;
tient, and another less fickle; wish that the&#xD;
grave could give back its dead, and that I&#xD;
might see again the face it has held for&#xD;
thirty years."&#xD;
The words had scarcely passed his lips&#xD;
when a flood of golden light poured sudden-&#xD;
ly across the room, the curtains of the win-&#xD;
dow were drawn back by a pair of hands&#xD;
that might have belonged to Titania, and&#xD;
the face of which he had spoken looked in&#xD;
upon him.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
MABEL LEE.&#xD;
A r~cn that was well worth the con-&#xD;
stancy of twice thirty years, so delicate, so&#xD;
beautiful, so almost spiritual was its loveli-&#xD;
ness. But not in the least a face that&#xD;
looked as if the grave had surrendered it.&#xD;
There were earth's own tints in the exqui-&#xD;
site wild-rose complexion, in the sunny hair,&#xD;
and the quivering, childlike lips there was&#xD;
even earth's own mischief gleaming in the&#xD;
deep, violet eyes.&#xD;
After one momentary start, Mr. Seyton&#xD;
held out his hand with a smile of welcome,&#xD;
than which no lover's was ever brighter or&#xD;
warmer.&#xD;
"Ab, Mab, my darling! what brings you&#xD;
on ~ like a ghbst or an elf?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Like a fairy, if you please, godpapa,"&#xD;
answered the sweetest and clearest of girl-&#xD;
ish voices. "Only fairies bestow such gifts&#xD;
as I have here for you-only you must guess&#xD;
what it is before I give it to you."&#xD;
":Not strawberries, Mab, surely?"&#xD;
"Ah, you wicked old conjurer! You&#xD;
saw the basket."&#xD;
"On my honor, no. I only guessed that&#xD;
because I thought it impossible. Farris has&#xD;
none yet."&#xD;
"Show Mr. Farris this, then, with my&#xD;
compliments."&#xD;
And the next moment a slight, blue-&#xD;
robed figure had flitted past Mr. Blake, and&#xD;
deposited on Mr~ Seyton's knee an offering&#xD;
that the fairies themselves might not have~&#xD;
have been ashamed to bring-a graceful lit-&#xD;
tle basket, lined with moss, and filled to the&#xD;
brim with luscious strawberries.&#xD;
"l~Tow, Mr. Blake, is it not 'pretty,?"&#xD;
cried the young lady, appealing to her only&#xD;
convenient witness; "is it not pretty, and&#xD;
ought not Mr. Farris to be ashamed of him-&#xD;
self? It will be two weeks yet, godpapa,&#xD;
before you taste a strawberry from your&#xD;
own vines."&#xD;
"And where, in the name of all tle fair-&#xD;
ies, did you find these, Mab?"&#xD;
"They were grown f~or the queen of the&#xD;
fairies' own table; but I lifted them, and&#xD;
here they are."&#xD;
"But do you, know the penalty, pretty&#xD;
one?"&#xD;
"Falling under her majesty's power? I&#xD;
believe I should like that. Think of a&#xD;
moonlight flitting with a prince in a green-&#xD;
and-gold hunting suit.-Mr. Blake, ~rould&#xD;
not that be better than being soberly' mar-&#xD;
ried by Father Lawrence 'to my cousin Fran-&#xD;
cis, or-or to some one else just as stupid? ','&#xD;
"I don't know, Miss Mabel," said Mr.&#xD;
Blake, with his genial laugh. "Would the&#xD;
prince bring you back again? If not, I ~&#xD;
for your cousin Francis, or~xne~ne else&#xD;
just as stupid."'          '&#xD;
"I will tell Cousin Francis that," said&#xD;
the girl, ~ayly; "but ,I shall wait for my&#xD;
prince, nevertheless.-Godpapa, I hops he&#xD;
will have eyed like your's and hair that curls&#xD;
as softly, and, above all, your brow. It is&#xD;

&#xD;
"Is it, Mab?"&#xD;
"Quite."&#xD;
Aud in token of approbation she leaned&#xD;
over the back of his chair, and kissed it.&#xD;
They made a pretty picture, those two,&#xD;
as they were thus grouped together in the&#xD;
soft, mellow gloom, and, oddly enough, that&#xD;
little scene came back to Mr. Blake's mind,&#xD;
whenever he thought of the chain of events&#xD;
whi9ll dated a beginning on this afternoon.&#xD;
Long afterward-when the mere thought of&#xD;
it brought hot tears to his eyes-he remem-&#xD;
bered how lovely Mabel Lee had looked, as&#xD;
she bent over her godfather's chair that&#xD;
evening. One rounded arm, from which&#xD;
the loose sleeve had fallen back, was thrown&#xD;
into relief by the rich purple velvet against&#xD;
which she leaned, her light muslin dress&#xD;
enveloped her in a sort of cloud, her bright&#xD;
g~4den hair crowned her like a diadem of&#xD;
glory, band her eyes, that were deep and&#xD;
tine. ~iud tender as those of any virgin saint,&#xD;
resle&amp;amp;'fondly ~on the head she had all her&#xD;
life been taught to love and honor.&#xD;
It was Mabel lee's aunt-~-her father's&#xD;
only s~ister-7-w~o, having once been engaged&#xD;
to Mr. Sexton, had jilted him, nobody knew&#xD;
how, to marry another man, nobody knew&#xD;

saidef a broken heart; others, of neglect&#xD;
and il~ usage. However that was, she died,&#xD;
and the gossips had never again need to&#xD;

any living woman. He had not diffused his&#xD;

faVlx~r, acting against Mr., Sey~on's&#xD;

Lee, overwhelmed by ruin, became insane.&#xD;
Nut being closely~watehed, he found a pistol,&#xD;
&#xD;
loaded it, locked himself up with it, and&#xD;
when his wife, who had been absent, re-&#xD;
turned, she found his brains spattering the&#xD;
walls of her chamber.&#xD;
This was the tragedy which ushered&#xD;
Mabel into the world; and it was Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton who named her at the hurried baptism&#xD;
which took place just after her birth, while&#xD;
her mother lay raving of the awful horror&#xD;
so lately enacted. Nobody thought tho&#xD;
frail infant would live, but, nevertheless, she&#xD;
did-lived to grow into a child so exqui-&#xD;
sitely lovely that people held their breath&#xD;
when looking at her-into a maiden so&#xD;
peerlessly beautiful that high and low alike&#xD;
yielded her homage. There was no dis-&#xD;
senting voice about her beauty, as there is&#xD;
about the beauty of most women; and no-&#xD;
body was ever heard to hint that it could&#xD;
be improved. :Neither did it move anybody&#xD;
to envy, for in all the country-side there&#xD;
was no one so well loved as this girl, the&#xD;
pathos of whose mournful birth some people&#xD;
thought they saw reflected in her eyes-&#xD;
eyes which might be grave or gay, laughing&#xD;
or serene, but which, in any mood, never&#xD;
lost a ,certain deep shadow of sadness that&#xD;
rested in their depths-such a shadow as&#xD;
that which, according to the Old-World&#xD;
superstition, marks those specially set aside&#xD;
for misfortune, either in life or death.&#xD;
Said Mabel at last:&#xD;
"Godpapa, you are talking business&#xD;
with Mr. Blake, were you not? Don't let&#xD;
me interruj~ you. I will go out on the&#xD;
terrace, and you can tell me when you are&#xD;
finished."&#xD;
"We finished before you came in, lady-&#xD;
bird," answered her godfather, smiling.-&#xD;
"That is, unless this obstinate old fellow&#xD;
has something else to say.-Eh, Blake?~'&#xD;
"No, sir," answered, Mr. Blake, bringing&#xD;
his attention back to the subject under dis-&#xD;
cussion, and almost unconsciously heaving&#xD;
a deep sigh-" no, sir; if your mind's made&#xD;
up, that's enough. All I have to say now is,&#xD;
that I hope you may never live to regret it."&#xD;
"Anglicl-you hope I may live to re-&#xD;
gret it, and you may live to triumph over&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
Mr. Blake shook his head as ho rose,&#xD;
still holding his hat in one hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You know better than that, sir. I&#xD;
hope with all my heart I may be the falsest&#xD;
prophet that ever spoke; but I still think I&#xD;
will prove a true one. Remember that, sir;&#xD;
I still believe in my instinct."&#xD;
"Never a doubt of it," said Mr. Sexton,&#xD;
good-humoredly. "But I tell you what I&#xD;
mean to do, Blake. I know you have a&#xD;
great respect for Mabcl's judgment. I mean&#xD;
to consult her."&#xD;
"Do you, sir?" said Mr. Blake, with a&#xD;
comical glance at the childlike creature&#xD;
before him. "Do you? Then take my&#xD;
advice, and don't show Miss Mabel the like-&#xD;
ness you have of Mr. Philip Conway."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Blake?" asked Miss Mabel,&#xD;
a little curiously.&#xD;
"Why, ma'am? Faith, and onlybecause&#xD;
you'd' never be a woman if you didn't like&#xD;
him the better for his handsome face."&#xD;
"Mr. Blake, you are a slanderer! I&#xD;
refer you to my cousin, Mr. Francis Nowdll,&#xD;
for a refutation of that."&#xD;
"Ay, ay," said Mr. Blake, with a some.&#xD;
what grim chuckle. "I know you don't&#xD;
fancy Mi'. Nowell overmuch; but I for one&#xD;
can't see his good looks, and I doubt if&#xD;
you'd see them either, by the side of this&#xD;
picture Mr. Seyton's got."&#xD;
"Godpapa, show it to me this instant."&#xD;
"No, no" said Mr. Seyton, laughing.&#xD;
"I must not bribe your judgment, or Blake&#xD;
would never believe in it. You shall see it&#xD;
after I have heard your opinion.-Blake,&#xD;
are you going?"&#xD;
"I must, sir. I have to see Martin yet&#xD;
this evening, and give him' directions about&#xD;
replanting the cotto~a to-morrow."&#xD;
"Pahaw 1 there's no' hurry about that.&#xD;
Stay and have a sociable smoke."&#xD;
Mr. Blake only, smiled. The Seyton&#xD;
estate would never have been what it was,&#xD;
if he had yielded to the temptations to&#xD;
idleness and pr~crastinatiou ever held out&#xD;
to him by this indolent master of his.&#xD;
"N'ot this evening, thank you, sir," he&#xD;
said. "But I will see you again to-morroW.&#xD;
-~-Miss Mabel, I hope you left your mother&#xD;
and Miss Constance well?"&#xD;
"'Quite well, thank you, Mr. Blake.&#xD;
You must call' and see mamma soon. She&#xD;
was saying, only the other day, that she&#xD;
&#xD;
would like to have your advice about-about&#xD;
the asparagus-beds, I think it was."&#xD;
"The asparagus-beds are more in Mr.&#xD;
Farris's line," said Mr. Blake, sxiilling; "lint&#xD;
I may be able to give her a hint or two, and&#xD;
I'll call to-morrow."&#xD;
Then, bidding them both good-evening&#xD;
he stepped through the window, and went&#xD;
back to the front of the house, where he&#xD;
mounted Brown Jerry, without a word to&#xD;
the servant holding him-an occurrence&#xD;
in itself remarkable-and was slowly riding&#xD;
away, when he heard his name eagerly&#xD;
called by Mabel Lees s voice.&#xD;
"Mr. Blake, Mr. Blake! one moment, if&#xD;
you please."&#xD;
He wheeled round at once, and she came&#xD;
lightly bounding over the lawn toward him,&#xD;
her pretty fringed scarf floating in the&#xD;
breeze, and in her hand the basket of stra~-&#xD;
berries she had brought to Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
"I am sorry to stop you for such a little&#xD;
thing," she said, as she reached his side, and&#xD;
paused, slightly out of breath. "I am afraid&#xD;
you will think me very foolish, but you did&#xD;
not taste my strawberries, and they're the&#xD;
very first of the season. You must take a&#xD;
few, if only to please me."&#xD;
He knew what she meant-that she had&#xD;
forgotten to offer them before, and feared&#xD;
he would think her too careless of' him, and&#xD;
too careful of her' rare fruit-so he made&#xD;
none of the demur in which a coarser' iift-&#xD;
ture might have indulged.' He stooped&#xD;
dewn, and took two or three fragrafit'elu~-&#xD;
ters out of the basket she held up to him.&#xD;
"This is more than enough, Mi~s'MabeI,"&#xD;
he said, smiling into her soft, ea~'r!iest eyes.&#xD;
"I only care for them when they 6a~e of&#xD;
your growing, and great credit they do 'you,&#xD;
too. Thank y3u, very kindly. ~food-even-&#xD;

ing, ma am.&#xD;
"Good-evening,' Mr. l~lake," she ~gLid,&#xD;
and drew aside to let him pass.&#xD;
When he had ridden half-way dowit the&#xD;
lawn, he turned in his saddle tolook b~ek&#xD;

last level rays gilded' the slender, girIl~h&#xD;
figure, as she walked slowly along the tEr-&#xD;

hand.&#xD;

&#xD;
muttered to himself. "God bless her! God&#xD;
bless her!"&#xD;
Are such benedictions ever unheard?&#xD;
But then-God's modes of blessing are not&#xD;
like ours. We would do well always to&#xD;
bear that in mind.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MABEL GIVES ADVICE.&#xD;
"Now, godpapa," said Mabel, coming&#xD;
back to the window where Mr. Seyton still&#xD;
sat, "I will tell you what I want you to&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"You have only to speak and be obeyed,&#xD;
my violet-eyed darling."&#xD;
She knew that very well, but the knowl-&#xD;
edge that would have rendered many women&#xD;
exigent and unreasonable, only made her&#xD;
so exquisitely careful and moderate in all&#xD;
her requests, that Mr. Sexton was often&#xD;
very hard put to discover opportunities for&#xD;
the lavish indulgence he would have de-&#xD;
lighted to shower on her. She only smiled&#xD;
now, and lifted up her hand, with a pretty&#xD;
air of command.&#xD;
"Well, then, it is our sovereign will and&#xD;
pleasure that you order the boat to be&#xD;
made ready, and take me home by water.&#xD;
A row will do you good this lovely after-&#xD;
noon. You are not looking well, godpapa."&#xD;
"Am I not, sweetheart? We'll try&#xD;
your prescription, but not just now. You&#xD;
must spend the evening with me."&#xD;
Mabel shook her head.&#xD;
"I wish I could; but I promised mam-&#xD;
ma to be back in time for tea."&#xD;
"She Will not mind your staying.~~&#xD;
"Perhaps not. But I promised."&#xD;
That logic was evidently unanswerable.&#xD;
$o, Mr. Seyton smiled, and gave up the&#xD;
point.&#xD;
"Ring the bell, then," he said, "and give&#xD;
your orders."&#xD;
The bell was rung, and the orders given,&#xD;
~ in afew moments the boat was reported&#xD;
ready. "Take your master's cloak down,"&#xD;
said Mabel.-.-" And now get that likeness,&#xD;
godpapa, that Mr. Blake spoke of. We&#xD;
must take it along,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"What for, Mab?"&#xD;
"What for? Why, because you want to&#xD;
ask my advice, you know, and, after you&#xD;
have asked my advice, I want to see it."&#xD;
To hear and to obey were indeed synon-&#xD;
ymous things with Mr. Seyton where his&#xD;
goddaughter was concerned. He rose at&#xD;
once, and crossed the floor to a little Floren-&#xD;
tine cabinet, very quaint, very beautiful,&#xD;
and chief among his i.,irtuoso treasures.&#xD;
"I don't know what induced me to put&#xD;
the thing here," he said, when Mabel fol-&#xD;
lowed, and looked over his shoulder, "for I&#xD;
only keep valuables in this. But here it is."&#xD;
In an aromatic drawer of fragrant san-&#xD;
dal-wood, side by side with old coins, ,rare&#xD;
Italian cameos, half-effaced medals, and the&#xD;
countless other trifles, so priceless in the&#xD;
collector's eyes, so valueless in those of any&#xD;
one else, lay an oblong velvet case, which&#xD;
Mr. Sexton meditatively took up and looked&#xD;
at.&#xD;
"I wonder what induced me to put it&#xD;
here?" he repeated, as if the question puz-&#xD;
zled him. "I am sure I don't value Philip&#xD;
Conway's likeness in the least; and unless&#xD;
-yes, that must be it, Mabel."&#xD;
"What must be it, godpapa?"&#xD;
"It is so exquisitely painted," said Mr.&#xD;
Seyton, with a deprecating glance at. the&#xD;
velvet case. "It is so exquisitely painted!&#xD;
That must have been the cause. I have&#xD;
never before seen such softness and power&#xD;
of touch combined on ivory. I wish I knew&#xD;
the artist, Mab; he should paint your face,&#xD;
my darling."&#xD;
"Should he? Well, I'm glad you don't&#xD;
know him, then. Bnt, pray, don't stand&#xD;
there, talking about the picture in that way,&#xD;
godpapa, or my curiosity will mount so high&#xD;
that I ahall certainly look at it, and I d~$?~'t&#xD;
want to afford Mr. Blake that triumph."&#xD;
"I shall put that out of the question,"&#xD;
said Mr. Sexton, and he dropped the case&#xD;
into one of his coat-pockets. "Now let us be&#xD;
off, if I have to take you home before tea."&#xD;
"But the cabinet! You are leaving it&#xD;
unlocked."&#xD;
Mr. Sexton turned back with a start,&#xD;
and closed, the inlaid doors upon his beloved&#xD;
treasures. "Do you believe in omens,&#xD;
~Xab?" he asked, as he did so.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, yes," said Mabel, candidly. I&#xD;
think I do; although Father Lawrence says&#xD;
I must not."&#xD;
"If I did," said Mr. Seyton, slowly, as&#xD;
he fitted the sides into one another, "I&#xD;
should certainly think that Philip Conway&#xD;
was destined to be the master of Seyton&#xD;
House; for of one thing I am sure-" and he&#xD;
turned the key in its lock with a sharp snap&#xD;
"Cyril Harding's face would never have&#xD;
gained admission to my Florentine cabinet."&#xD;
"Who is Cyril Harding, gadpapa I"&#xD;
"I will tell you after a while, lady-bird.&#xD;
At present we must go down to the boat."&#xD;
They crossed the room together - a&#xD;
subtle likeness in their delicate, high-bred&#xD;
beauty making them almost look like father&#xD;
and daughter-and came out upon the ter-&#xD;
race.&#xD;
The sun had set, but the broken masses&#xD;
of 'gorgeously-tinted clouds, which he had&#xD;
left to mark "the bright track of his fiery&#xD;
were so faithfully reflected in the clear&#xD;
waters of the river, the air was so heavy&#xD;
with fragrance, and the tender purple mist&#xD;
of the spring-time hung so softly over the&#xD;
distant uplands, that his absence left noth-&#xD;
ing to be regretted. Yet Mabel looked&#xD;
around a little apprehensively, as they&#xD;
turned into the path which led across the&#xD;
lawn down to the water's edge.&#xD;
"Two miles," she said. "I am afraid,&#xD;
godpapa, you will be very late getting&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"And, please your majesty, suppose I&#xD;
don't mean to come back?"&#xD;
"You mean to spend the evening wit~i&#xD;
us? How delightful! What a charming&#xD;
game of piquet you and mamma can have!"&#xD;
"And how finely you can sing to us!"&#xD;
"I think it is so strange you like music&#xD;
when you are playing cards, "'she said, medi-&#xD;
tatively. "Now Cousin Francis always says&#xD;
it disturbs him."&#xD;
"Cousin Francis is-"&#xD;
"A lawyer. I don't think we need say&#xD;
any thing more, when we want to 'express&#xD;
stupidity on every subject not connected&#xD;
with that profound and soul - depressing&#xD;
science. Godpapa, I am so glad ~,ou are not&#xD;
a lawyer."&#xD;
"I am not sorry myself; Mab."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose they are good. for some&#xD;
things," pursued Mabel, with a little peni-&#xD;
tent sigh; "but being agreeable is certainly&#xD;
not one of them. Godpapa, what is Mr.&#xD;
Philip Conway?"&#xD;
Mr. Sexton laughed slightly, and&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders in the graceful,&#xD;
indolent fashion he had learned in Paris&#xD;
years before.&#xD;
"That is more than I can tell you, bon-&#xD;
nibelle. But I rather fancy he belongs to&#xD;
the wide ranks of social condottieri."&#xD;
Bonnibelle looked a little puzzled; but&#xD;
before she could ask any questions, they&#xD;
came to the boat.&#xD;
It was a graceful and well - fashioned&#xD;
little craft, built according to Mr. Seyton's&#xD;
own directions, and easily propelled by one&#xD;
oar, although two rowers were now lying&#xD;
back in their seats, waiting their master's&#xD;
arrival. Stalwart young boatmen they were,&#xD;
whose smooth black skins contrasted effec-&#xD;
tively with their white trousers and striped'&#xD;
shirts, the "two best" of a twelve-oar boat,&#xD;
which was used on state occasions.&#xD;
"Where are the cushions, Austin?"&#xD;
asked the master, as he came forward. And&#xD;
both the boatmen sprang to their feet.&#xD;
"Are you sure the bottom is quite dry?"&#xD;
"Here's the cushions, sir," said Austin,&#xD;
bringing them from the bank; "and yes,&#xD;
sir, the bottom's as dry aW'6an be.-A little&#xD;
closer, Nate-All right now, Miss Mabel."&#xD;
Mabel stepped in, followed by her god-&#xD;
father, and the next moment they were&#xD;
gliding off with that quick, steady, easy&#xD;
movelnent which only first-class oarsmen&#xD;
can attain-the swift, sure stroke cleaving&#xD;
the water right and left, and leaving show-&#xD;
ers of rainbow-spray in their wake.&#xD;
"How delightful!" said Mabel, taking&#xD;
off her hat, and letting the fresh river-breeze&#xD;
toss her fair hair according to its own ca-&#xD;
price. "What a pleasure it is to be rowed&#xD;
by Austin and Nat! Godpapa, you ought&#xD;
really to present them both with a medal,&#xD;
in testimony of their skill."&#xD;
"You may, if you want to, Mab," said&#xD;
~Ir. Sexton, with a smile. "I suspect they&#xD;
would value it more from you than from ru7e.&#xD;
-Wouldn't you, boys?"&#xD;
At which the boys touched their hatA,&#xD;

&#xD;
end an~w6red that "an'y thing from Miss&#xD;
Mabel was ~'always. acceptable." Then Mr.&#xD;
Seyton said the medals should be struck off&#xD;
with a water-nymph 'on one side, and a pair&#xD;
of oars crossed on the other. Whereupon&#xD;
Mabel laughed gayly, Austin and Nat seemed&#xD;
very much gratified, and the subject was&#xD;
changed.&#xD;
"Now," said Mr. Seyton, as they reached&#xD;
the~lower point of the island, and were glid-&#xD;
ing along past its beautifully-fringed shore,&#xD;
"now, Mabel, let me remind you that I&#xD;
mean' to ask your advice on a very impor-&#xD;
tant subject."&#xD;
"I'm all attention, godpapa."&#xD;
"Tie on your hat, then. You will take&#xD;
cold."&#xD;
Mabel knew there was no danger of that,&#xD;
but she tied it on nevertheless, and, after&#xD;
the' blue ribbons were made fast under her&#xD;
ohm, looked up with a smile that meant,&#xD;
"'Go ~n~"&#xD;
"'In one word, then," said Mr. Seyton,&#xD;
gravely, "I am going to make my will."&#xD;
Mabel started. There lar sQmething very&#xD;
suggestive in that one simple word, and all&#xD;
th~ blood which had been flushing her&#xD;
choekS rushed away at once to her heart.&#xD;
"Godpapa!" she said, with something&#xD;
like a' gasp.&#xD;
But he only smiled tenderly at her.&#xD;
"There is no cause to look so startled~&#xD;
m~ bonny flower," he answered. "No man&#xD;
dies an hour sooner for making sti~aight his&#xD;
worldly affairss, and leaving his last com-&#xD;
muands in black and white. I should indeed&#xD;
have fulfilled this duty long ago, but for one&#xD;
thing. Can you guess what that has been?"&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"If I were a free man, Mabel-free, that&#xD;
is, tis other men arO, to leave my property&#xD;
to whom 'I choose, without' any' obligation&#xD;
of honor binding it and me- do you not&#xD;
know to whom that old house up yonder&#xD;
would go?"&#xD;
Again Mabel shook her head. It was evi-&#xD;
dent that she did not conceive his meaning.&#xD;
"Ab, my darling," said the fine gentle-&#xD;
~a*i, with a rush of emotion in his VQice,&#xD;
"I would make you the richest 'heiress in&#xD;
all the country-side; I would dower you&#xD;
like a princess; I would set you up as mis-&#xD;
&#xD;
tress of all this fair, wide heritage-if only I&#xD;
dared! 0 Mabel! you can never know what&#xD;
a struggle it has been to me to take it away&#xD;
from my heart's delight-from the only&#xD;
thing on earth I love, and give it to stran-&#xD;
gers."&#xD;
Mabel's soft hand stole into his without a&#xD;
word, until she said, simply, "But, godpa-&#xD;
pa, I don't want it, and I am not a Seyton."&#xD;
"No," he said, with a deep sigh, "you&#xD;
are not a Seyton."&#xD;
Theu there was a pause of several min-&#xD;
utes, 'only broken by the splash of the water,&#xD;
the dip of the oars, and the low hum of in-&#xD;
sect-life from the island, whose drooping&#xD;
willows almost touched them as they&#xD;
passed.&#xD;
At last Mr. Seyton spoke again, quite&#xD;
abruptly:&#xD;
"It seems as if it would be easier to bear&#xD;
if I had only possessed no option in the mat-&#xD;
ter; if I had not belonged to the unlucky&#xD;
thirds in our order of succession-for you&#xD;
know the obligation of honor which is bind-&#xD;
ing upon us, do you not, Mahel?"&#xD;
"Yes," Mabel said, she knew it, ~as who,&#xD;
indeed, did not know that singular tradition&#xD;
and custom?&#xD;
"You know how the matter stands then.&#xD;
I have either to renew the entail, or to be&#xD;
the first of my name who has broken the&#xD;
trust of the dead. Another sort of dishonor&#xD;
I might have faced for you, Mabel, but not&#xD;
that. I could not resolve to meet the men;&#xD;
who went before me, with the brand of such&#xD;
a betrayal upon me! I could not even&#xD;
imagine that an inheritance so left would&#xD;
bring other than harm to you."&#xD;
She pressed closer to him, and laid her&#xD;
tinted cheek down on his shoulder.&#xD;
"Godpapa, I am sure of it."&#xD;
"Yes, so am I. And you will not re-&#xD;
member hereafter how much itwas in my&#xD;
power to have given you, and how little I&#xD;
did give? You will not think hardly of it,&#xD;
or doubt the love of the old n~an who would&#xD;
pour out his heart's bloed for you?"&#xD;
"Oh, hush! hush! You kill me when&#xD;
you talk so."&#xD;
And indeed a perfect April shower was&#xD;
raining from the violet eyes down upon the&#xD;
velvet morning-coat.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then I will not say another word; but&#xD;
you must stop crying. You know we can&#xD;
none of us bear to see that. We feel as if&#xD;
we had not been half tender enough with&#xD;
our flower. Mabel, do you not know how&#xD;
you are paining me?"&#xD;
The tone was enough to dry Mabel's&#xD;
tears at once, but she twined her arms round&#xD;
him before she spoke again, and then it was&#xD;
only to say, in a half-choked voice:&#xD;
"Nothing more like that, godpapa-&#xD;
nothing more like that."&#xD;
"Not another word. Only a discussion&#xD;
of the claims of Philip Conway now. Shall&#xD;
I show you his likeness to cheer you into&#xD;
interest?"&#xD;
"I believe not. Mr. Blake would never&#xD;
trust my opinion then."&#xD;
"You know who he is?"&#xD;
"Your nephew, is he not? I have heard&#xD;
mamma speak of your sister who married a&#xD;
Captain Conway."&#xD;
"Yes, my nephew. This same sister's&#xD;
son. Poor Adela! She has had a hard&#xD;
life. I hope he makes amends for some of&#xD;
it." After a moment's silence, he contin-&#xD;
ued:&#xD;
"Now, Mabel, you must understand&#xD;
that Conway was not an honorable man;&#xD;
he was, in fact, an unprincipled adventurer,&#xD;
and that there is natural reason to fear that&#xD;
his son may be like him. Blake thinks&#xD;
there is every reason to fear it, and warns&#xD;
me solemnly that nothing but evil ever&#xD;
came of the Conway blood. Blake is aux-&#xD;
ions that, in entailing the Seyton estate, I&#xD;
should entail it, not upon Philip Conway&#xD;
and his heir, but upon Cyril Harding and&#xD;
his heir.~~&#xD;
Mabel was becoming interested. She&#xD;
raised her head, and repeated the question&#xD;
she had asked once before: "Who is Cyril&#xD;
Harding?"&#xD;
"Cyril Harding," answered Mr. Seyton,&#xD;
concisely, "is the son of my younger sister,&#xD;
who married a clergyman of that name. I&#xD;
have told you that Philip Conway was an&#xD;
unprincipled adventurer; I must also add&#xD;
he was the most fascinating man of his day,&#xD;
and, in telling you that the reverend Mr.&#xD;
Harding was the embodiment of strict re-&#xD;
ligious principle, it is only fair to add that&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
he was likewise the embodiment of dulness&#xD;
and bigotry. Whether his son is like him&#xD;
or not, I cannot say; but the presumptive&#xD;
evidence that he may be so is at least as&#xD;
strong as in the case of Philip Conway.&#xD;
Now, the point at issue between Blake and.&#xD;
myself is simply this, which of these two&#xD;
shall I choose for an heir?"&#xD;
Mabel shrank slightly at the last word.&#xD;
She did not answer for a minute or two.&#xD;
When at last she did speak, it was quite&#xD;
slowly:&#xD;
"It scarcely seems to me, godpapa, as&#xD;
if mere presumptive evidence ought to&#xD;
weigh against anybody; or if it is just to&#xD;
judge the son b~ the father. If-if this&#xD;
were put aside, which of your nephews&#xD;
would you be inclined to choose?"&#xD;
"There is not a doubt on that subject,"&#xD;
said Mr. Seyton, with a slight grimace.&#xD;
" Even as it is, Mab, my preference is all on,&#xD;
the Conway side. Adela has always been&#xD;
my favorite sister, and, despite his being&#xD;
such a scamp, I liked her husband heartily.&#xD;
Besides, she is the elder. As a matter of&#xD;
tastd-but then, you see, that is the rub!&#xD;
In a decision of this kind, I have no right&#xD;
to consult my individual taste. I have to.&#xD;
'think of the generations to come, of the&#xD;
name, and of these "-he pointed to Austin&#xD;
and Nat-" in choosing my successor."&#xD;
"Yes," said Mabel, and her eyes ranged&#xD;
thoughtfully over the broad Seyton lands&#xD;
which lay on either side of them-"yes, I&#xD;
understand. But, then, godpapa, how can&#xD;
you possibly decide rightly without knowing&#xD;
any thing of either of them?"&#xD;
"That is the very difficulty I propose to&#xD;
obviate," said Mr. Seyton. "I promised&#xD;
poor, faithful Blake to send for both of&#xD;
them, and judge dispassionately between.&#xD;
them. But, after all, that is pretty ranoli.&#xD;
of an empty form, you know, Mab. They'&#xD;
will both be on their good behavior, and,.&#xD;
unless some accident reveals the different&#xD;
characters, I shall no~ be likely to gain&#xD;
much knowledge that can benefit me."&#xD;
Mabel shook her head very sagely.&#xD;
"I think most people show something,,&#xD;
at least, of their characters very soon, god-&#xD;
papa; and then I can't help wondering&#xD;
which one needs the inheritance most."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"There is no doubt of' that, either," Mr.&#xD;
Seyton answered. "The Hardings are very&#xD;
substantially well off while the Conways-&#xD;
ah, my poor Adela! That is another diffi-&#xD;
culty, Mab. If I clo send for her son, how&#xD;
on earth can I ever disappoint her-life has&#xD;
been such hard lines to her 1-by sending&#xD;
him away empty-handed I"&#xD;
Mabel looked up with all her heart in&#xD;
her eyes. Those few words-" life has been&#xD;
such hard lines to her "-told a very pitiful&#xD;
story that her fancy filled in at once.&#xD;
"Godpapa," she said, abruptly, "if I&#xD;
were you, I would not mind Mr. Blake. I&#xD;
would do what is right. I would make Mr.&#xD;
Conway the heir. Every thing you have men-&#xD;
tioned is for, instead of against, him, unless&#xD;
the character of his father. We know that&#xD;
many good men have had bad fathers, and-&#xD;
and if I were you, I would do what is right."&#xD;
"But his father's character is a great&#xD;
deal against him, Mab. The most fair-&#xD;
minded person in the world would, admit&#xD;
that. You don't know, you can't even im-&#xD;
agine, what a man he was. I tell you, if&#xD;
the son skoud be like him, it would be' my&#xD;
solemn duty to do a temporary evil, that&#xD;
la~ting good might come of it."&#xD;
"' Godpapa, L don't believe that good&#xD;
ever did come out of evil, or ever will."&#xD;
"In short, you. are transformed, after&#xD;
the manner of your sex, into a thorough-go-&#xD;
ing partisan."&#xD;
"'Yes," she said, nodding ga~yly~ "I am&#xD;
all for the Conway interest. You asked my&#xD;
advice, you know, so I have a 'right to give&#xD;
it, and it is this-take Philip Conway)'&#xD;
Ifr~ godfather. did not answer. He only&#xD;
smile&amp;amp; a. little, and then sat stroking her&#xD;
hair, ~vhile his eyes were absently fastened&#xD;
on the water. Indeed, he remained thus so&#xD;
long that Mabel at last grow impatient.&#xD;
"Am I 'discharged from the office of&#xD;
counsellor, godpapa?" she asked.&#xD;
He started~slightly, .nnd looked round.&#xD;
"Is it the likeness you want I"&#xD;
"Your intuition d~oes you credit, sir. It&#xD;
is the likeness."&#xD;
He took it'o~t, and handed it to her.&#xD;
She had not even instinct enough con-&#xD;
cerning the future 'to make her hesitate for&#xD;
one moment before opening it. Thanking&#xD;
&#xD;
him with a smile, she pressed the spring,&#xD;
and Philip Conway's face looked up at her.&#xD;
Mr. Blake had kept to the letter of the&#xD;
truth regarding it; for a face half so hand-&#xD;
some she had never seen before. It was&#xD;
very finely outlined, with a clear, dark com-&#xD;
plexion, and possessed more than one mark&#xD;
of the Seyton lineage, although the spirit&#xD;
nnd force which stamped it was something&#xD;
quite different from the fair, languid. Seyton&#xD;
type. Yet, even in this pictured semblance,&#xD;
it was easy to see that the chief attraction&#xD;
of the face did not rest either in grace of&#xD;
feature or harmony of coloring. The large,&#xD;
dark eyes were very perfect in size and&#xD;
color, but their fascination was quite apart&#xD;
from the one or the other, and might rather&#xD;
have been found in their wonderful power&#xD;
of expressing the two extremes of anger or&#xD;
tenderness. The gaze lingered on the well-&#xD;
cut month, less because no classic model&#xD;
was ever more faultless, than because there&#xD;
was something in the curve of the lips-de-&#xD;
fiantly compressed as they were-which&#xD;
proved how winning their senile could be&#xD;
when it came. The nose was straight-al-&#xD;
most severely regular; the eyebrows hori-&#xD;
zontal and slightly knit; while a crest of&#xD;
black curls gave finish to the forehead, that&#xD;
was else somewhat lacking in loftiness and&#xD;
amplitude. Altogether it was a singularly&#xD;
attractive face-a face without any tokens&#xD;
of degrading vice or sensual appetites, but&#xD;
~a face on which indomitable pride and in-&#xD;
* domitable resolution were plainly stamped&#xD;
-the face of a man evidently accustomed to&#xD;
make his own will the arbiter of his own&#xD;
fate, and still more evidently accustomed to.&#xD;
ride rough-shod over any obstacles placed&#xD;
in his way.&#xD;
But Mabel saw little of this and heeded&#xD;
less. When at last she looked up from&#xD;
those magical eyes, there was something in&#xD;
the scene and the hour which she never for-&#xD;
got to her dying day.&#xD;
The broad river, the deep shadows, the&#xD;
gathering twilight over the distant hills, the&#xD;
last faint, broken cloud-reflections in the&#xD;
water, the fringed banks, and the swift cur-&#xD;
rent, hastening on-on-on-still on, bear-&#xD;
ing its freight of living water down to the&#xD;
vast depths of ocean, and also bearing-&#xD;
&#xD;
though she knew it not-all quiet and peace&#xD;
and happiness out of her life, never, fur&#xD;
many a long day, to revisit it again.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
AN UNEXPECTED MEETiNG.&#xD;
"CAN you tell me, sir, which of these&#xD;
roads leads to Seyton House?"&#xD;
Mr. Blake wheeled Brown Jerry about&#xD;
like lightning, and faced the man who had&#xD;
asked this most unexpected question.&#xD;
A slender, elegant horseman, dressed in&#xD;
a dark-gray travelling-suit, riding a well-&#xD;
built 'chestnut, and bearing about him that&#xD;
nameless air of refinement and style which&#xD;
is only given by much association with the&#xD;
world-a man whose singularly handsome&#xD;
face was his least title to distinction; who&#xD;
might have been any age between twenty-&#xD;
one and thirty-five; who looked as much at&#xD;
ease there on the sultry cross-roads as if he&#xD;
had risen from a drawing-room sofa, and&#xD;
who smile a slight smile of amusement, as&#xD;
he repeated his inquiry, slightly altered:&#xD;
"Excuse me, but I have really forgotten&#xD;
some directibns that were given me this&#xD;
morning, and I would be glad to know by&#xD;
which of these roads I am most likely to&#xD;
reach Seyton House."&#xD;
Neither in question nor manner was&#xD;
there any thing save gentlemanly courtesy;&#xD;
and, considering this, there was some ground&#xD;
for his evident surprise at the grim stare&#xD;
which was, for the time, his only answer.&#xD;
Then Mr. Blake nerved himself, and jerked&#xD;
forth a reply:&#xD;
"Either road, sir, pill lead you to Sey-&#xD;
ton House. If you want the shortest, take&#xD;
the left; if you want the best, take the&#xD;
right."&#xD;
The stranger looked at both, smiled&#xD;
slightly again, and then turned his horse's&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"I have but one principle in all my jour-&#xD;
neys," he said, quietly-" the principle that i&#xD;
speed must always be subordinate to corn-  1&#xD;
fort. Thanking you for your information, f&#xD;
sir, I take the right."                d&#xD;
With an inward growl, Mr. Blake drew t&#xD;
&#xD;
aside to let him pass, scarcely deigning to&#xD;
return his salute, and then stood quite still&#xD;
looking after him.&#xD;
"Philip Conway's own face! Philip&#xD;
Conway's own figure! Philip Conway's&#xD;
own devilishly beguiling tongue," he mut-&#xD;
tered to himself. "God forgive me, but&#xD;
how I wouUl like to throttle him before he&#xD;
ever reaches Seyton House!"&#xD;
"A surly old boor," thought the stran-&#xD;
ger, who was riding away. ' "I wonder if&#xD;
he may be regarded as a specimen of the&#xD;
aboriginal inhabitants of this interesting&#xD;
[region? He seemed decidedly struck by&#xD;
my appearance-not favorably, however.&#xD;
I really cannot flatter myself that 'it was&#xD;
favorable. What the deuce could have&#xD;
been the matter? Have I lost my nose, or&#xD;
has any calamity befallen my hat?"&#xD;
He investigated his nose, and, finding&#xD;
it in its usual condition, removed his hat.&#xD;
He was still examining this with' quite a&#xD;
contemplative curiosity, wherf there came a&#xD;
clatter of horses' hoofs in the rear, and, be-&#xD;
fore he could turn in his saddle, Brown&#xD;
Jerry was reined up beside him.&#xD;
"Sir," said Mr. Blake, with a great gulp&#xD;
in his voice, "I beg your pardon for my inci-&#xD;
vility a moment ago. I ought to be 'glad tt&#xD;
do a service for any guest of Seyton House,&#xD;
and so, if you don't object, I'll see you on&#xD;
your road."&#xD;
"Object!" said the~ gentleman, with ~&#xD;
smile. "Indeed, no. I have lost my road&#xD;
often enough to-day, to be glad of such an&#xD;
offer. But, unless your way lies in that di.&#xD;
rection-"&#xD;
"My way 'lies in any direction that'my&#xD;
~luty does, Mr. Conway."&#xD;
The stranger turned round, and gave a&#xD;
iuick glance of astonishment.'&#xD;
"So you know me ?" he said.&#xD;
"Sorra a doubt of that "-.with a quiver&#xD;
)f ill-concealed bitterness in his voice-&#xD;
'sorra a doubt of that, when I know your&#xD;
'ather before you."&#xD;
Philip CQnway-for it was he-..-looked&#xD;
~t the speaker for a moment in' silence.&#xD;
~hen the mist' of'doubt cleared from his&#xD;
ace, a flash of recognition came into the&#xD;
Lark eyes, and, drawing off his glove, ho ex~&#xD;
ended his hand.&#xD;

AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.                  21&#xD;
&#xD;
20                          MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"There is but one man to whom I can&#xD;
be speaking," he sa4d, "that is my mother's&#xD;
old friend, Patrick Blake."&#xD;
Such a recognition from any one else&#xD;
would not have failed to win the warm Irish&#xD;
heart thus addressed; but if Philip Conway&#xD;
had worn the forni and smiled the smile of&#xD;
the star of the morning, h~ could not have&#xD;
done more than momentarily dispel Mr.&#xD;
Blake's deeply-rooted distrust. That un-&#xD;
compromising person did not refuse the&#xD;
hand that was offered him-the hand that&#xD;
was delicate and well-shaped as Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton's own, though supple with nervous ener-&#xD;
gy and muscular strength-but he dropped&#xD;
it almost immediately, before he enclosed&#xD;
his lip~ to answer, stiffly:&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I'm Patrick Blake; Miss&#xD;
Adela's old friend and servant, if Miss Adela&#xD;
is good enough to remember me. I hope&#xD;
yen left her well?"&#xD;
"Quite well," Mr. Conway answered;&#xD;
a little coldly, perhaps, for a duller man&#xD;
than himself might have felt the chill of the&#xD;
other's manner. "That is, she was well&#xD;
when I heard from her last; but I have&#xD;
not seen her for some time. She is&#xD;
abroad."&#xD;
"Abroad! Do you mean in the old&#xD;
country, em?"&#xD;
"Yes, in one of the old countries. She&#xD;
is in Paris, where we have both been living&#xD;
for several years."&#xD;
"And you left her there alone?"&#xD;
Mr. Conway laughed slightly.&#xD;
"My mother is quite capable of taking&#xD;
care of herself," he said. "Besides, I left&#xD;
her at her own request. My uncle sent for&#xD;
me, as I suppose you are aware. By-the-by,&#xD;
I hope he is well?"&#xD;
"Very well," answered Mr. Blake&#xD;
briefly. And then the conversation dropped&#xD;
They rode on in complete silence fo&#xD;
some time, until Mr. Conway spoke again&#xD;
rather weariedly:&#xD;
"This road has seemed to stretch on&#xD;
interminably all day. How far are we nou&#xD;
from Seyton House?"&#xD;
"Two good miles, sh~; hut you woub&#xD;
have cut off one, if you had taken the othe:&#xD;
road."&#xD;
The young man shrugged his shoulders&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a shrug more satiric and less indo-&#xD;
lent thanMr. Seyton's.&#xD;
"Better bear the ills we know, than fly&#xD;
to those we know not of.-Eh, Mazeppa?&#xD;
Cheer up, though, old fellow! We have&#xD;
nearly reached your quarters of rest and re-&#xD;
freshment." He patted the horse's satin&#xD;
neck with his hand, and then turned abrupt-&#xD;
ly to Mr. Blake.&#xD;
"I wonder if animals are half grateful&#xD;
enough for being spared all the trouble of&#xD;
talking and being talked to I" he said.~&#xD;
"I don't know, I'm sure, sir," was the&#xD;
matter-of-fact answer; "but I sometimes&#xD;
think they do understand one another."&#xD;
"Yes, so do I, but ~wIpe we are mistaken.&#xD;
I hope sincerely, for Mazeppa's sake, that&#xD;
he will not be forced to exchange any greet-&#xD;
ings or answer any inquiries, before he be-&#xD;
takes himself to his fodder and dreams to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
Mr. Blake gave Brown Jerry's bit a jerk,&#xD;
which threw his astonished head at least&#xD;
half a yard into the air.&#xD;
"If you are very tired, sir, I have no&#xD;
doubt Mr. Seyton will excuse you from any&#xD;
greetings or inquiries," he said, emphatically.&#xD;
The dark eyes looked at him with some-&#xD;
thing of a mocking gleam, and there was a&#xD;
slightly-mocking cadence in the tone, that&#xD;
answered pleasantly:&#xD;
"I would not do Mr. Seyton's courtesy&#xD;
so much injustice as to doubt it, but I do&#xD;
not know that I have made any plea of fa-&#xD;
tigue."&#xD;
Despite the cadence mentioned, the&#xD;
tone made Mr. Blake feel rather ashamed&#xD;
of himself, and his quickness to take offence.&#xD;
So he answered, apologetically:&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, then, sir; but I&#xD;
only took that for granted. Anybody&#xD;
would, I think, have done the same."&#xD;
~ There you are mistaken, mom am~,&#xD;
said his companion, good-humoredly, but&#xD;
with the same mocking light in his eye that&#xD;
L to Mr. Blake recalled his father so forcibly.&#xD;
"A wise man never takes any thing for&#xD;
granted. When I spoke of Mazeppa just&#xD;
I now, I was not thinking of myself in the&#xD;
r least. I am too much of a traveller to feel&#xD;
worsted by thirty miles in the saddle2'&#xD;
"Thirty miles since daylight, sir?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No-I am not a barbarian. Thirty&#xD;
miles since nine o'clock."&#xD;
Mr. Blake looked at the sun, it was at&#xD;
least two hours high, and then at Mazeppa's&#xD;
flanks.&#xD;
"In that case, sir, your horse is even a&#xD;
better traveller than yourself, for thirty&#xD;
miles over our roads are equivalent to sixty&#xD;
elsewhere."&#xD;
Mr. Conway smiled; "if Mazeppa had&#xD;
the power of speech we were speaking cf&#xD;
he would tell you that he feels equal to&#xD;
thirty miles farther to-night. And I tell&#xD;
you that his speed and endurance are not to&#xD;
be matched out of Arabia."&#xD;
"He is finely blooded, I perceive."&#xD;
"He is a cross of the best blood in Eng-&#xD;
land. Sired by the famous-. However,&#xD;
I spare you his pedigree, and an enumera-&#xD;
tion of the many cups his ancestors have&#xD;
won. You are probably not interested in&#xD;
the turf?"&#xD;
"Not in the least," replied Mr. Blake,&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
Then there fell another pause. It was&#xD;
a lovely afternoon, even for May. The, for-&#xD;
~sts were beautiful with magnolia, honey-&#xD;
suckle, and jasmine, that were scenting&#xD;
the air with their fragrance, and the bright-&#xD;
green foliage was in full luxuriance, but&#xD;
neither of the two men took any notice of&#xD;
these things. Mr. Blake was too well ac-&#xD;
customed to them, and Mr. Conway seemed&#xD;
as thoroughly indifferent as if he had been&#xD;
riding over the sterile sands of Sahara. So&#xD;
for a time there was a decided dearth of&#xD;
conversational topics. This time it was Mr.&#xD;
Blake who first broke the silence.&#xD;
"I suppose you have heard nothing of&#xD;
Mr. Cyril Harding on the road, sir?" he asked.&#xD;
"Mr. Seyton is expecting him every day."&#xD;
If he meant to convey a piece of infor-&#xD;
mation, he must have been disappointed, for&#xD;
Mr. Conway did not look in the least sur-&#xD;
prised. He had evidently heard that his&#xD;
cousin was expected at Seyton House, and&#xD;
quite as evidently treated the fact with an&#xD;
indifference profound as that with which he&#xD;
regarded the magnolias and honeysuckle.&#xD;
"I have heard nothing of him," he an-&#xD;
swered, carelessly; "but it is scarcely like-&#xD;
ly that I should have done so. There is a&#xD;
&#xD;
mail line running to Ayre, is there not? On&#xD;
what day does the coach come in?"&#xD;
"It is tn-weekly, and comes in on Tuea.&#xD;
days, Thursdays, and Saturdays.~~&#xD;
"To-day is Thursday, is it not? There&#xD;
is every probability, then, that my uncle&#xD;
will be gratified by the arrival of Mr. Cyril&#xD;
Harding."&#xD;
Mr. Blake started slightly, and looked a&#xD;
,little curiously at his companion.&#xD;
"You do know something of his move-&#xD;
ments, then?"&#xD;
"Not in the least," was the cool re-&#xD;
ply. "But I know something of him; and&#xD;
I am sure that he will not, of his own good&#xD;
will, allow me ~o precede him by even so&#xD;
much as an hour in my arrival at Seyton&#xD;
House."&#xD;
"As you were both coming to the same&#xD;
place, at the same time, and from the same&#xD;
direction, I wonder you did not come to-&#xD;
gether," said Mr. Blake, bluntly.&#xD;
Mr. Conway laughed-not a pleasant&#xD;
laugh-and shrugged his shoulders even&#xD;
more sarcastically than before.&#xD;
"My cousin Cyril has never forgotten&#xD;
one or two episodes of our boyhood," he&#xD;
replied. "Indeed, his memory is so good,&#xD;
and his opinion of my desperado proclivities&#xD;
so strong, that I doubt if he would bear me&#xD;
company on a lonely road, to be made mas-&#xD;
ter of Seyton house at the ~nd of it. Put-&#xD;
ting my society out of the question, how.~&#xD;
ever, I think he would, under any circum-&#xD;
stances, prefer a seat in a coach to a seat in&#xD;
the saddle. It is at once more comfortable&#xD;
and more safe, for we can scarcely consider it&#xD;
discreditable to such an eminent Christian&#xD;
that he is not above the weakness of fear."&#xD;
Again the light, mocking tone jarred on&#xD;
Mr. Blake's ear, more than it is possible for&#xD;
words to express -jarred, in recalling~ a&#xD;
voice that had never owned aught save a&#xD;
gibe for any thing in heaven or on earth~&#xD;
and for the first time in all his life he had&#xD;
laid lance in rest for the cause of fear.&#xD;
"He is a very foolish man, sir, who runs&#xD;
risks with his life for mere boasting and&#xD;
bravado. I am glad te hear that Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing is wise enough to avoid this, and yet&#xD;
brave enough to face ridicule for con-&#xD;
science' sake."&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8069-00000012"/>&#xD;
22                           MABEL LEE.                                                               FIEBE iN A RIBBON-SHOP.                    23&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Conway looked at him steadily,&#xD;
with a world of covert amusement in his&#xD;
dark eyes.&#xD;
"My good friend," he said, "will you&#xD;
be kind enough to explain what you mean&#xD;
by 'facing ridicule for conscience' sake?'"&#xD;
But there was no flinching in the man&#xD;
whom he regarded, the man who answered&#xD;
with a certain sturdy dignity of his own.&#xD;
"~ mean, sir, that his Christianity does&#xD;
him far more credit than your sneer at it&#xD;
does you."&#xD;
The honest fellow never got over&#xD;
a certain half liking for Philip Conway&#xD;
after that hour, after he saw how cordial a&#xD;
smile came over his face, and how cordial&#xD;
a tone into his voice, notwithstanding this&#xD;
rebuke.&#xD;
"I see," he said, "that my cousin Cyril&#xD;
has already gained a friend whom I envy&#xD;
him, but whose partisanship I scarcely think&#xD;
he deserves. You will have to judge of&#xD;
that, however. Only one thing allow me to&#xD;
say in self-defence, my sneer was not in-&#xD;
tended for Christianity proper-the Christi-&#xD;
anity which no. man honors more than I do&#xD;
-but for Harding Christianity. When you&#xD;
know my cousin, you will understand the&#xD;
distinction."&#xD;
Mr. Blake was on the point of under-&#xD;
standing it before that time, or at least of&#xD;
asking one or two questions relative to it,&#xD;
when a very unexpected interruption oc-&#xD;
curred. A sharp turn in the road brought&#xD;
them face to face with a horseman, who&#xD;
was an entire stranger to himself but who&#xD;
started visibly on seeing his companion, and&#xD;
at once rode forward, exclaiming eagerly:&#xD;
"Conway! Phil! My dear fellow, is&#xD;
it possible?"&#xD;
"What, Ainslie!" said the other, in a&#xD;
tone of overwhelming surprise.&#xD;
And the next moment they were shaking&#xD;
hands warmly.&#xD;
"I thought you were in Cairo, with the&#xD;
desert on one hand and the plague on the&#xD;
other," said one.&#xD;
"I thought. you were in Paris, enjoying&#xD;
Les Trois Fr~res, and the charms of baa-&#xD;
carat," said the other.&#xD;
Conway laughed gayly.&#xD;
"It is like a scene in a play, my dear&#xD;
&#xD;
fellow. We thought each other at the an-&#xD;
tipodes, and we suddenly encounter each&#xD;
other on a lonely road of the backwoods.&#xD;
Are you hound for Charleston?"&#xD;
"For nowhere else. Just as I was leav-&#xD;
ing for the East-leaving Marseilles, that is&#xD;
-a letter reached mc which left me no&#xD;
alternative but that of return. One of these&#xD;
troublesome people, who make it a principle&#xD;
to do every thing at the most inconvenient&#xD;
time imaginable, had suddenly died, and left&#xD;
me without any reliable business agent. It&#xD;
was come back, or be robbed to an unlimited&#xD;
extent. I. came back."&#xD;
"That's your sober English caution,&#xD;
Ainslie."&#xD;
"It's not your headlong Irish impatience,&#xD;
I .know. Come, turn back. with me.. Let&#xD;
us spend the night in Ayre, and go on to-&#xD;
gether to-morrow. I take it for granted&#xD;
you are drifting about as much at large as&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
"No, by Jove! I not only have a&#xD;
special object in view just now, but I'm&#xD;
nailed down to an appointment. You have&#xD;
heard me . speak of my uncle, Mr. Seyton;&#xD;
well, I must be at his house to-night."&#xD;
A glance of quick intelligence passed&#xD;
between them-a glance which Mr. Blake&#xD;
did not fail to note, and score down to&#xD;
Philip Conway's discredit; . and then Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie said:&#xD;
"Your uncle I Pray accept my con-&#xD;
gratulations. Then this gentleman is not-"&#xD;
and he turned to Mr. Blake.&#xD;
"He is my uncle's business agent," said&#xD;
Conway quickly, and somewhat warningly.&#xD;
"Mr. Blake, let me introduce my friend Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie."&#xD;
Mr. Blake touched his hat, not very&#xD;
graciously; and while Mr. Ainslie said a&#xD;
few commonplace words of greeting, he&#xD;
occupied himself in observing the personal&#xD;
appearance of this new candidate for favor&#xD;
or distrust.&#xD;
This was all that he saw: A figure strik-&#xD;
ingly like Philip Conway's both in build and&#xD;
carriage, save that what was graceful slender-&#xD;
ness in one, took the appearance of spareness&#xD;
in the other; and a sunburnt face that was&#xD;
only redeemedfrom positive ugliness byapair&#xD;
of singularly brilliant hazel eyes, with some-&#xD;
&#xD;
thing so exquisite and remarkable in them,&#xD;
that nobody could possibly have denied&#xD;
their beauty, and few people resisted their&#xD;
fascination. This one point was all the&#xD;
claim Mr. Ainslie could 'advance toward&#xD;
good looks; but a certain ease and grace of&#xD;
manner seconded it so well, that, even on&#xD;
first sight, he was an unusually attractive&#xD;
person-even on first sight people began to&#xD;
think him charming-and rarely changed&#xD;
their minds on closer acquaintance. For,&#xD;
just as there was something in Philip Con-&#xD;
way's dark, handsome face which inspired&#xD;
distrust, and made worldly-wise men and&#xD;
~vomen look askance at him, so in this face,&#xD;
which barely escaped ugliness, there was&#xD;
something that caused the most worldly&#xD;
wise to give confidence and bestow trust&#xD;
almost involuntarily.&#xD;
Even Mr. Blake felt the subtle influence&#xD;
which so many had felt before him-even&#xD;
he, looking at this man, could not but&#xD;
believe in him, and even he began to think&#xD;
better of Philip Conway for possessing such&#xD;
a friend. This feeling rather increased than&#xD;
subsided with every succeeding minute, and&#xD;
when he heard Mr. Ainslie say that he&#xD;
might possibly spend some days in Ayre, as&#xD;
his horse needed recruiting, and his mind&#xD;
needed companionship, he was conscious&#xD;
of something which was, curiously enough,&#xD;
almost a sense of relief.&#xD;
"Then I will see you early in the morn-&#xD;
ing," Philip Con way said, and with this&#xD;
understanding they parted. Mr. Ainslie pro-&#xD;
ceeded forward to the town, and, as the two&#xD;
others rode along in the opposite direction,&#xD;
Mr. Conway told his companion something of&#xD;
the man frotn whom they had just parted.&#xD;
He was immensely wealthy, he said, the&#xD;
sole inheritor of two equally colossal, for-&#xD;
tunes, one of which had been left by his&#xD;
father, and the other by a maternal uncle;&#xD;
but, instead of making this wealth the key&#xD;
to social influence or political power, or&#xD;
philanthropy or pleasure, or any other of&#xD;
the common toys of men, he had done little&#xD;
more than spend his time in wild, fantastic&#xD;
wanderings, and in dabbling after the man-&#xD;
ner of a dilettante in art and science.&#xD;
"He has been farther into Africa than&#xD;
ever a white man penetrated before," said&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Conway, warming over the mention of&#xD;
his friend's achievements. "He has ex-&#xD;
plored, and made miraculous escapes in the&#xD;
interior of India; he has ridden on horse-&#xD;
back from the Bosporus to the Arctic Ocean;&#xD;
he' has ascended the Nile, and crossed the&#xD;
Libyan Desert; he has lived in the midst of&#xD;
the plague in Smyrna and Damascus; and he&#xD;
is as well known in the Arab tents as in the&#xD;
cafes of the Palais Royal; he has sounded&#xD;
more seas, and climbed more mountains,&#xD;
than any other man of his generation ; he is&#xD;
equally at home With the pearl-divers of&#xD;
Ceylon and the fishermen of the Hebrides;&#xD;
he has won an honorable name among men&#xD;
of letters~ and science; he is welcomed like&#xD;
a brother in the studios of Rome and Paris;&#xD;
and he has painted pictures that prove he&#xD;
might, if he chose, be among the first ~f liv-&#xD;
ing artists. In short, he has done every&#xD;
thing but__"&#xD;
"But what?" asked Mr. Blake, whose&#xD;
interest was on the increase.&#xD;
"But win social position in his native&#xD;
city."&#xD;
"What! that man not a gentleman?"&#xD;
"Yes, the best of gentlemen. But his&#xD;
father left some blot on the name-I don't&#xD;
know exactly what, for such matters seem&#xD;
to me of little importance-only it Was dark&#xD;
enough to close the doors of good society for-&#xD;
ever against his son. I don't think Ainslie&#xD;
minds it much; but, if he did, it would be all&#xD;
the same. lIe may climb the Himalayas, an4&#xD;
penetrate the wilds .of Central Africa, but&#xD;
he can never hope to enter a Charleston&#xD;
drawing-room."&#xD;
Before Mr. Blake could reply, the sound&#xD;
of flowing water fell upon their ears, and&#xD;
in. another moment they were standing on&#xD;
the bank of the Ayre, with . the ferry-boat&#xD;
pulling rapidly toward them, and Seyton&#xD;
House showing clear and dark against the&#xD;
western sky.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
HE~3E IN A. RIBBON-SHOP.&#xD;
THERE has seldom been a more tired&#xD;
face, serene and sweet though it was, than&#xD;
that with which Constance Lee was walking&#xD;

JIEBE IN A RIBIION-SHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
*    home out. the Monday after Mr. Conway's&#xD;
arrival at Seyton House.&#xD;
An exceedingly tired face-for the re-&#xD;
verses of the Lee family had made this girl&#xD;
a music-teacher, and she had been giving an&#xD;
unusual number of lessons that morning to&#xD;
unusually stupid pupils-and, judged by the&#xD;
rules of beauty, not a pretty face, yet a face&#xD;
that had its own charm, nevertheless-a&#xD;
f&amp;amp;~ce ~with clear, helpful intelligence in it,&#xD;
with woman's ordinary power of endurance,&#xD;
and more than woman's ordinary power of&#xD;
thought; with earnest, steadfast g~ay eyes,&#xD;
with an exquisite mouth, and with a very&#xD;
arch humor in it sometimes, though just&#xD;
now it looked so pale and patient-scarcely&#xD;
a face to admire; but scarcely, either, a&#xD;
faca to pity, for we rarely pity those who&#xD;
seem capable of bearing their own burden.&#xD;
Our compassion all goes to the weak shoul-&#xD;
ders that bend, and to the moaning lips so&#xD;
ever ready to complain; yet, perhaps, we&#xD;
might bestow it better if we waited for one&#xD;
of those soldiers of life who pass by with&#xD;
head erect and steady step, even, sometimes,&#xD;
with smiling lip, yet the cruel weight-if&#xD;
we dare call any thing of God's ordination&#xD;
cruel !-which is laid on then~ would thrice&#xD;
double that other, on which we gaze with&#xD;
swimming eyes. Ahi surely, if sometimes&#xD;
we entertain angels unawares, there are&#xD;
other times when we live face to face with&#xD;
heroes and know them not-heroes more&#xD;
brave than those that died at Marathon!&#xD;
more enduring than those who starved with-&#xD;
in~ the walls of Genoa !-for, as there are&#xD;
deaths deeper than the mere physical pang,&#xD;
so there are starvation worse than any of&#xD;
the body-heroes for whom earth has nev-&#xD;
er a song nor a wreath, who die soundless&#xD;
as they have lived, but whom it may be we&#xD;
shall find hereafter far above those whom&#xD;
life has covered with praise, and crowned&#xD;
with laurels.&#xD;
So, on this bright Monday morning, Con-&#xD;
stance Lee was walking along very quietly,&#xD;
the pretty village street all to herself, and&#xD;
her roll of music in her hand, looking rather&#xD;
absehtly before her, and wondering whether&#xD;
Nauoy had remembered to buy the barrel&#xD;
of flour which was needed, or whether she&#xD;
ought to go and see about it herself, when&#xD;
&#xD;
there came a quick tread along the side-&#xD;
walk behind her, a man's figure at her side,&#xD;
and a voice, rather harsh than otherwise,&#xD;
saying, abruptly:&#xD;
"How badly you look, Constance!&#xD;
What is the matter?"&#xD;
She started, and then turned, with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Nothing much, Francis, thank you.&#xD;
Some of the children were unusually&#xD;
troublesome this morning, that is all."&#xD;
"You are ~sure that is all? Nothing the&#xD;
matter at home?"&#xD;
"No, nothing whatever. I left mamma&#xD;
and Mabel both in high spirits. You know&#xD;
there is to be a dinner-party at Seyton&#xD;
House to-day, and they are enjoying it in&#xD;
anticipation."&#xD;
"Yes, I know. I have an invitation,&#xD;
and I was going to ask you about it. Who&#xD;
is to be there?"&#xD;
"Everybody, I believe," she answered,&#xD;
smiling. "Everybody, that is, whom Mr.&#xD;
Sexton considers de notre ekease. It is&#xD;
meant to introduce his nephew in due form&#xD;
to society, you know."&#xD;
Her companion nodded, and then com-&#xD;
pressed his lips in a way peculiar to him-&#xD;
self, as he walked along by her side; in a&#xD;
way, too, that made quite a young face seem&#xD;
quite an old one. It was a face too lined&#xD;
and sunken for symmetry at any time, but,&#xD;
taken thus, it was peculiarly far from hand-&#xD;
some. I~een and worn, almost haggard in-&#xD;
deed, from the plainly-marked effects of in-&#xD;
tellectual toil, it might yet have been refined&#xD;
by this very toil into a beauty which of&#xD;
themselves the rugged features lacked, if an&#xD;
habitually harsh and unpleasant expression&#xD;
had not marred the effect, and if the caustic&#xD;
mouth had. not more than counteracted the&#xD;
broad and somewhat benign brow. After&#xD;
seeing his face, you were not surprised at&#xD;
his voice; after hearing his voice, you were&#xD;
not surprised at his face. Seldom has Na-&#xD;
ture fitted two things into more exact ac-&#xD;
cordance-for, there was not a tone of melo-&#xD;
dy in the voice, and there was not an ele-&#xD;
ment of softness in the face. Taking both&#xD;
together, you felt that impressions graved&#xD;
on granite were less ineffaceable than this&#xD;
man's opinions and this man's resolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How are you all going out to Seytbn&#xD;
House?" he asked, suddenly. "I suppose&#xD;
the carriage will be sent for my aunt, but&#xD;
cannot I drive yourself or Mabel?"&#xD;
"Mr. Seyton promised to send the boat&#xD;
for us, and we are going by the river,"&#xD;
Constance answered. "I think that wotild&#xD;
be pleasanter for you than driving ov'er&#xD;
these dusty roads. Come with us. li~o."&#xD;
"I should like it, but it depends upon&#xD;
who will come for you."&#xD;
She looked up a little surprised.&#xD;
"Who will come for us? Why, who&#xD;
should come besides the boatmen?"&#xD;
"Mr. Philip qonway, perhaps; consider-&#xD;
ing that he did nothing but stare at Mabel&#xD;
in church yesterday."&#xD;
"Mr. Philip Conway was not in church&#xD;
yesterday."&#xD;
"Mr. Cyril harding, then."&#xD;
"Nor he," said Constance, with a merry&#xD;
laugh. "He is said to be the strictest of&#xD;
Protestants, and would be horrified at the&#xD;
mere suspicion of attending mass."&#xD;
"And is the other one a Protestant&#xD;
too?" asked Mr. Nowdll, with something&#xD;
like an expression of relief.&#xD;
"No, I believe not. But he had a head-&#xD;
ache or something of the sort, Mr. Seyton&#xD;
said, and that kept him at home. The gen-&#xD;
tleman you saw was a friend of his, who is&#xD;
staying at the House, and with whom every-&#xD;
body-even Mr. Blake-is in love."&#xD;
"He is very ugly."&#xD;
"Ugly! how can you say so? I think&#xD;
he has a charming face, and the most beau-&#xD;
tiful eyes I ever saw."&#xD;
"He certainly gave everybody in your&#xD;
seat sufficient opportunity for observing&#xD;
them. Pray was Mabel as much impressed&#xD;
as yourself?"&#xD;
"Mabel is the only person who has&#xD;
taken an unaccountable dislike to him.&#xD;
She said so yesterday, and this morning she&#xD;
reported that she dreamed of snakes all&#xD;
night, and that the snakes, every one, bad&#xD;
his eyes."&#xD;
Mr. Newell laughed.&#xD;
"How fancy and imagination run away&#xD;
with her!" he said-but he did not say it&#xD;
half as sharply as usual.&#xD;
"Excitement; too," said Constance.-&#xD;
&#xD;
"See! yonder, she is at~ the gate, waiting&#xD;
for me now."&#xD;
There she was, indeed; a violet-eyed,&#xD;
golden-haired vision, leaning over the low&#xD;
gate toward which they were advancing,&#xD;
and looking like a Hebe of the spring, with&#xD;
a wilderness of tender foliage ~and.tinted&#xD;
blossom on either side, and drooping ten-&#xD;
drils of t~ie honeysuckle, which was trained&#xD;
in an areli over the gate, falling all around&#xD;
her. She opened the gate for them, as they&#xD;
came near, and gave her hand and a smile to&#xD;
Mr. Newell, while she looked reproachfully&#xD;
at her sister.&#xD;
"0 Constance! what a time you have&#xD;
been, and mamma so impatient. I really&#xD;
thought I should have to send Nancy for&#xD;
you. What made you leave her cap all in&#xD;
pieces, and the ribbon-nobody knows&#xD;
where?"&#xD;
Constance looked dismayed-as well she&#xD;
might.&#xD;
"Mamma's cap! I forgot it completely.&#xD;
I had it done up, you know, and I was sure&#xD;
I put the trimming back on it. However,&#xD;
there is not much to do, only-"&#xD;
"Only what?"&#xD;
"I must first go down the street for&#xD;
some ribbon, the other is too soiled to be&#xD;
put back; and I remember now ~hat was&#xD;
why I waited."&#xD;
She turned from the gate, hut Mabel&#xD;
4&#xD;
summarily laid hold of her.&#xD;
"Go down street, indeed! You look&#xD;
very much like it. Can't I see in your&#xD;
poor, pale face how tired you are? Besides,&#xD;
mamma will take hysterics in another five&#xD;
minutes, if you don't go to her. Give me&#xD;
your hat. I will get the ribbon."&#xD;
"But, Mabel, you will tire yourself~ and&#xD;
you know the dinner-party-"&#xD;
"Yes, I know all about the dinner-par-&#xD;
ty; and I know, too, that you seem to think&#xD;
nobody has a right to be tired but yourself.&#xD;
Cousin Francis, is 'this a free and indepen-&#xD;
dent country, and am I a free and indepen-&#xD;
dent citizen of it? If so, I summon you, in&#xD;
the name of liberty, to remove that hat and&#xD;
give it to me."&#xD;
"Many things quite as high-banded have&#xD;
been done in the name of liberty," said ~fr.&#xD;
Nowell, as he lifted Constance's hat from&#xD;
&#xD;
I-i&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
MABEL LEE&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb  n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8069-00000014"/>&#xD;
26                         MABEL LEE.                                                       HEBE IN A RIBBON-SHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
her brown braids, and laid it on Mabel's glit-&#xD;
tering locks. "You can quote Madame Ro-&#xD;
land, if you feel inclined, Constance."&#xD;
"She had better go and put mamma's&#xD;
cap together," said Mabel, while she tied&#xD;
the strings under her chin. "Dear, what&#xD;
makes you trim your hats with such an&#xD;
ugly color? I am sure I look like a fright&#xD;
in it, don't I, Cousin Francis?"&#xD;
"Suppose I say yes, Mabel?"&#xD;
"Suppose you know your duty better,&#xD;
sir? What are cousins for, if they don't flat-&#xD;
ter one and keep one in good-humor?"&#xD;
"I consider their duty in life to be just&#xD;
the reverse."&#xD;
"I know you do," she said, "and that&#xD;
is just the reason I don't like you-some-&#xD;
times. You lecture too much."&#xD;
"Do I?"&#xD;
"A great deal too much," she answered,&#xD;
with a pretty little toss of the head. "I&#xD;
lUre you infinitely better when you are&#xD;
agreeable, and, as you seem to be in a toler-&#xD;
able good-humor now, I will let you go&#xD;
down-street with m~.-Constance, what sort&#xD;
of ribbon do you want?"&#xD;
"Two yards of lavender lutestring, inch&#xD;
width, if you wilt go, Mabel. But I am&#xD;
really afraid the sun will give you a head-&#xD;
ache."&#xD;
"Cousin Francis will tell you that it is&#xD;
time I should get used to headaches. lie&#xD;
says I am spoiled to death, and that, if I had&#xD;
any strength of mind, I would unspoil myself.&#xD;
I mean, for once, to prove that I possess the&#xD;
necessary strength of mind."&#xD;
Constance saw that further remonstrance&#xD;
was useless. She said to Mr. Nowell,&#xD;
"Take care of her," and then she went into&#xD;
the house to find the cap, and pacify her&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mabel set off down-street,&#xD;
wearing the most simple of morning-dresses,&#xD;
her curls all dishevelled, perfectly innocent&#xD;
of gloves, veil, or parasol, and altogether a&#xD;
figure which greatly horrified the two Miss-&#xD;
es Crane-shopping in green silks and black-&#xD;
lace shawls-when she met them on the&#xD;
main street. They both stared; for Ayre&#xD;
was very fashionable, and it was not con-&#xD;
sidered the style to appear on Main Street&#xD;
in any except "dress" costume. But Ma-&#xD;
&#xD;
bel smiled as brightly as if her offence had&#xD;
been one of the most venial nature, and&#xD;
then, with a pleasant good-morning, flitted&#xD;
past them into a lace-and-ribbon shop.&#xD;
The two ladies looked at each other.&#xD;
"Did you ever see the like of that?"&#xD;
said one.&#xD;
"She has been s&amp;amp; spoiled, I am hardly&#xD;
surprised," answered the other. "People&#xD;
really seem to think her something more&#xD;
than mortal, while, for my part-I like her&#xD;
very much, of course, but I can see that she&#xD;
believes she can do exactly what she&#xD;
pleases."&#xD;
"And Francis Kowell, too!" said the&#xD;
first, a little resentfully. "I wonder he&#xD;
would have come down-street with her, and&#xD;
she such a figure!"&#xD;
"Everybody knows that Francis Now-&#xD;
dl is in love," returned the other, with a&#xD;
shrug; "and a man in love has about as&#xD;
much sense as this parasol. 'The king can&#xD;
do no wrong' in his eyes, you may be sure,&#xD;
Lavinia."&#xD;
"Men are very great fools," said Miss&#xD;
Lavinia, in an aggrieved tone, for, as it&#xD;
chanced, nobody had ever been tempted to&#xD;
folly on her account. "But still, Francis&#xD;
Nowell-he might know that a girl like&#xD;
Mabel-a girl who has been so much flat-&#xD;
tered and spoiled-would never marry a&#xD;
man like him."&#xD;
"She might do worse. He is very tal-&#xD;
ented."&#xD;
"But he is poor," said Miss Lavinia, in&#xD;
much the same tone that she might have&#xD;
said, but he is a gamester, or a felon, or any&#xD;
thing else utterly disreputable. "He is&#xD;
poor; and you. may be sure her family will&#xD;
never let Mabel marry anybody but a rich&#xD;
man. Indeed, Mrs. Phifer was telling me&#xD;
yesterday-"&#xD;
"Hush!" said her sister, in a warning&#xD;
whisper. "There is Mrs. Phifer in that&#xD;
shop."&#xD;
"Well, what of that? She did not tell it&#xD;
to me as a secret. It was only that-but here&#xD;
she comes.-Dear Mrs. Phifer, how glad I&#xD;
am to see you!"&#xD;
Dear Mrs. Phifer was a stout, elderly&#xD;
lady in black, with a very imposing pres-&#xD;
ence, a Roman nose, and an air half magis-&#xD;
&#xD;
trial ~nd half clerical, which went far to&#xD;
prove that, although a "minister's wife,"&#xD;
she was very unlike the meek creature who&#xD;
generally fills that position, but considered&#xD;
herself second in importance and influence&#xD;
.to nobody in the parish. She met the two&#xD;
green silk divinities in the middle of the&#xD;
pavement, just as she stepped out of a tai-&#xD;
lor's shop, where she had been to order a&#xD;
pair of pantaloons-not for herself but for&#xD;
her husband.&#xD;
"Mind, Mr. Pierce, a little longer, and&#xD;
not nearly so tight as the last pair," she was&#xD;
saying to the tailor, who had followed her&#xD;
to the door. "Now, don't forget which&#xD;
piece of cassimere I chose. The other is&#xD;
very inferior, and- Ab, my dears, I am&#xD;
very glad to see you. How well you are&#xD;
both looking!"&#xD;
Of course, they both returned the com-&#xD;
pliment, as they walked on together; and&#xD;
then Miss Lavinia went back to the subject&#xD;
which had been under discussion by her sis-&#xD;
ter and herself, a few minutes before.&#xD;
"We were just speaking of you, dear&#xD;
Mrs. Phifer," she said, "and I was just be-&#xD;
ginning to repeat to Ellen what you told&#xD;
me after church yesterday, about Mabel&#xD;
Lee and her godfather. Don't you remem-&#xD;
ber?"&#xD;
"Mabel Lee!" said Mrs. ~Phifer with&#xD;
rather a puzzled look; and then her face&#xD;
suddenly cleared. "Oh, yes, about her god-&#xD;
father's plan of marrying her to oneof his&#xD;
nephews, was it not? That is .the report,&#xD;
undoubtedly; but we can hardly trust mere&#xD;
gossip, you know."&#xD;
"Of course not," said Miss Lavinia, ~ho&#xD;
was the originator of half the gossip of&#xD;
Ayre. "But I thought you quoted some&#xD;
authority for it."&#xD;
"Did I?" said Mrs. Phifer, looking puz-&#xD;
zled again, for, in the multiplicity of subjects&#xD;
which engrossed her attention, she was apt&#xD;
to become somewhat oblivious of unimpor-&#xD;
tant matters. "Perhaps I did, my dear, but&#xD;
I don't remember who it could have been.&#xD;
I heard that Mr. Seyton had sent for his&#xD;
two nephews, in order to choose an heir,&#xD;
and that he wbuld choose whichever one&#xD;
agreed to marry Mabel. That was all. You&#xD;
saw one of them in church yesterday-the&#xD;
&#xD;
stranger who occupied a seat in the right-&#xD;
hand pew, next the chancel."&#xD;
"Yes, I saw him," said Miss Lavinia, in&#xD;
a tone which left no doubt of the fact.&#xD;
"How handsome he is!"&#xD;
"Very handsome, and a most excellent&#xD;
young Christian," said Mrs. ]?hifer. "He&#xD;
called on Mr. Phifer after the sermon, and&#xD;
I was never more edified than by his con-&#xD;
versation. He assured us that, instead of de-&#xD;
siring the inheritance of Seyton House, he&#xD;
very much hoped his uncle would not leave&#xD;
it to him. His cousin needs it much more,&#xD;
he said, and, for himself, he desires to enter&#xD;
the ministry. 'My Master's service,' he&#xD;
added, 'is honor enough for me."'&#xD;
The young ladies gave a low murmur of&#xD;
admiration.&#xD;
"Yes, my dears, yes. But then, you see,&#xD;
it is to be hoped that he will obtain it, for&#xD;
this young Conway is of most dreadful char-&#xD;
acter. Mr. Harding could scarcely sPeak ~f&#xD;
him without a shudder, and, although he&#xD;
said very little, it was evident what he&#xD;
thought. For myself, I confess that I ~hud-&#xD;
der "-she suited the action to the word-&#xD;
"to think of the Seyton property passing&#xD;
into such h~inds."&#xD;
"But it has not passed into them yet,"&#xD;
said the elder Miss Crane, "and Mr.&#xD;
Seyton-"&#xD;
"Mr. Seyton has not ali idea beyond&#xD;
Mabel Lee," interrupted Miss La.vinia.&#xD;
"People always prophesied that, instead of&#xD;
renewing the entail, he would leave the&#xD;
property to her. I have no doubt he would&#xD;
have done so, but for this bright idea of&#xD;
marrying her to tile heir. What a nice race&#xD;
there will be between Mr. Conway and Mr.&#xD;
Harding!"&#xD;
Said Mrs. Phifer, stiffly: "I doubt if&#xD;
Mr. Harding will make any effort to secure&#xD;
the inheritance which ou~'At to be his by&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"Oh, dear! trust him for that! "said Miss&#xD;
Crane, in an incredulous tone. "No matter&#xD;
if he ia a C~iristian, Christians want money&#xD;
as much as anybody else. And then, Mrs.&#xD;
Phifer, we all know that Mabel is so pretty&#xD;
that everybody falls in love with her. Mi'.&#xD;
Harding may do that."&#xD;
Mrs. Phifer smiled loftily, but before she&#xD;
&#xD;

28                          MABEL LEE.                                                             IN TIlE GARDEN.                       2!)&#xD;
&#xD;
could reply, in terms of sufficient force, Miss&#xD;
Lavinia gave her arm a nipping pinch, and&#xD;
exclaimed, in an intense whisper: "There&#xD;
he is now!"&#xD;
"There is who?" asked her sister,&#xD;
eagerly, while Mrs. Phifer was too indig-&#xD;
nant with her arm to take interest in any&#xD;
other matter. "There ~oho is, Lavinia?"&#xD;
"The gentleman who was in church yes-&#xD;
terday. Don't you recognize his figure?"&#xD;
* They all turned and looked quickly. A&#xD;
gentleman was leisurely sauntering down&#xD;
the street in front of them, and-yes-they&#xD;
all recognized the graceful figure and fault-&#xD;
less coat which they had admired the day&#xD;
before. True, the coat had changed from&#xD;
black to fawn color, tufd there was an air&#xD;
about the figure of the je no dais qUOi in&#xD;
style and elegance, which had been totally&#xD;
lacking before; but they could, one and all,&#xD;
swear to it as the very same they had seen&#xD;
occupying the right-hand pew next the&#xD;
chancel-when lo! the stranger turned his&#xD;
head, so that they caught a glimpse of his&#xD;
profile, and they saw at once that they had&#xD;
made a xnistake.&#xD;
"It is not he, after all," said Miss La-&#xD;
vinia, a little cre8tfallen. "But, oh, is he&#xD;
not handsome?"&#xD;
"Goodness! who can he be?" exclaimed&#xD;
her sister.&#xD;
Whoever he was, he turned abruptly&#xD;
into the very shop where Mabel Lee was&#xD;
buying two yards of lavender ribbon.&#xD;
This business had proved to be one of&#xD;
considerable duration, for Mr. Nowell elected&#xD;
himself referee in the matter, and so unhesi-&#xD;
tatingly condemned all 'the delicate tints&#xD;
which were poured out on the counter, that&#xD;
Mabel found herself at last decidedly waver-&#xD;
ing in her own judgment.&#xD;
"What will you have?" she cried, ap-&#xD;
pealingly, after every shade ~f purple, lilac,&#xD;
and lavender, had been alternately shown&#xD;
and successively vetoed. "If none of these&#xD;
suit, what do you advise?"&#xD;
"Bring some gray and stone ~ said&#xD;
Mr. :N~owell to the clerk. "That is what I&#xD;
advise, Mabel," he said, when the desired&#xD;
articles made their appearance, "Either&#xD;
of these wrn suit my aunt. But she is much&#xD;
too old to wear these frippery things."&#xD;
&#xD;
* "Too old! Mammal I don't know&#xD;
what you mean, sir. I only wish ~,'ou were&#xD;
half as young as she is. She would leek&#xD;
dreadfully in those horrid things."&#xD;
"How often must I tell you, Mabel, that&#xD;
looks are of no importance?"&#xD;
"Then if looks are of no importance,&#xD;
what must one consult when one buys rib-&#xD;
bons?"&#xD;
Propriety," answered Mr. Newell,&#xD;
briefiy-.-" propriety which says, at present,&#xD;
this."&#xD;
And he held the stoniest of the grays&#xD;
toward her.&#xD;
But Mabel drew back almost petulantly.&#xD;
"Propriety may say so, if it chooses, and&#xD;
you besides, Cousin Francis; but, for all&#xD;
thatTam not going to shock mamma by&#xD;
taking such a thing home. Delicate colors&#xD;
are becoming to her. She is like me."&#xD;
"Like you, is she? Then I should not&#xD;
be surprised to go back and find her arrayed&#xD;
in any enormity-even a red gown."&#xD;
"Did you ever see me in a red gown?"&#xD;
"I certainly never saw you in any thing&#xD;
like the sedate and proper colors Constance&#xD;
wears."&#xD;
"No, I hope not, considering that I&#xD;
don't want to make a fright of myself. But&#xD;
come, I must choose mamma's ribbon.&#xD;
Which shall it be - this lilac, or this&#xD;
mauve?"&#xD;
"They are equally unfit for the pur-&#xD;
pose."&#xD;
"And .equally pretty. Tell me which&#xD;
is the most becoming; that will decide the&#xD;
matter. See, now."&#xD;
She held a knot of the ribbon to each&#xD;
side of her sunny hair, and looked up at&#xD;
him with a smile that might have melted&#xD;
a man of bronze. Francis Newell was not&#xD;
quite a man of bronze-let him do his ut-&#xD;
most to harden himself; and he looked at&#xD;
her silently, looked so earnestly, so almost&#xD;
passionately, that, after a moment, the&#xD;
lashes sunk over the sweet violet eyes, and&#xD;
a tinge of additional color stole into the&#xD;
lovely face.&#xD;
It was at this moment that the stranger's&#xD;
glance fell on her, and he entered the shop&#xD;
at once-entered it almost like one under a&#xD;
spell.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mabel was fronting the door.-she had&#xD;
turned round from the counter to her cousin&#xD;
-and so, had only to raise her eyes, when&#xD;
the light was darkened by the entrance of&#xD;
the new-corner, She did not raise-them;&#xD;
and all that Francis Newell saw was a sud-&#xD;
den, vivid blush, which spread like lightning&#xD;
over the fair skin, until it reached even the&#xD;
roots of the golden hair.&#xD;
He turned sharply, and saw, for the first&#xD;
time, a face which he was destined to see&#xD;
often, to hate bitterly, to suspect cruelly, to&#xD;
like never. It may be that he was a jealous&#xD;
lover, or it may be only that he was a keen&#xD;
lawyer; but his first, instantaneous impres-&#xD;
sion of that face was one of distrust-an&#xD;
impression which may have been instinct,&#xD;
or only prejudice, but which after-events&#xD;
seemed to justify, and which he never con-&#xD;
quered or forgot. So, after one haughty&#xD;
stare-a st~re that was returned with in-&#xD;
terest-he brought his attention back to&#xD;
Mabel, and said, coldly:&#xD;
"Buy either of the things, Mabel, or&#xD;
both, if you choose, and let us go. I am&#xD;
sure Constance must wonder at your long&#xD;
absence."&#xD;
"Yes," answered Mabel, absently.-&#xD;
"Two yards, if you please," she said to&#xD;
the clerk. And oh! how terribly conscious&#xD;
she was of her muslin dress, her falling hair,&#xD;
and her gloveless hands.&#xD;
"Two yards of which piece, ma'am?"&#xD;
"Either-yes, that will do."&#xD;
So two yards were measured and cut off&#xD;
from the brightest shade of purple among&#xD;
them all. At last, too, it was paid for, and&#xD;
the change made, a matter which Mr. New-&#xD;
ell thought would never be accomplished,&#xD;
and, when they were once fairly out of the&#xD;
shop, he could no longer restrain his vexa-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"You ought not to come out without&#xD;
a veil, Mabel. I have told you so often.&#xD;
Women are never secure from impertinent&#xD;
staring. I should have liked amazingly to&#xD;
knock that fellow down. I wonder who he&#xD;
is? That man who caine into the shop just&#xD;
now, and stared at you so, I mean."&#xD;
Mabel did not' answer for a moment.&#xD;
She was twisting the little parcel of ribbon&#xD;
nervously round her fingers; but, after a&#xD;
&#xD;
while, she looked up at her cousin. "It&#xD;
was Mr. Philip Conway," she said, quietly.&#xD;
"1 knew him at once."&#xD;
CHAPTER VT.&#xD;
iN THE GARDEN.&#xD;
Two gentlemen were loitering on the&#xD;
terrace of Seyton House - one of them&#xD;
smoking, and the other leaning idly ov~er&#xD;
the balustrade-when the boat containing&#xD;
the Lee party came in sight.&#xD;
"Throw away your cigar, Phil," said he&#xD;
of the balustrade, with a laugh. "Your gal-&#xD;
lantry will be pu~ to the touch in a moment&#xD;
-for yonder comes your Hebe of the rib-&#xD;
bon-shop."&#xD;
"Then I hope her Cerberus is not in at-&#xD;
tendance still,"~said Mr. Conway, carelessly.&#xD;
"However, we shall not be disturbed. Th~&#xD;
landing is down yonder, and they cross the&#xD;
lawn to the front of the house. You have&#xD;
deucedly good eyes, Ainslie. How can you&#xD;
possibly tell who is in that craft, at titis dis-&#xD;
tance?"&#xD;
"It was not my eyes, but my ears, that&#xD;
were good in this Case," answered Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie. "I heard whom the boat was to b~&#xD;
sent for, and therefore did not'fird it hard&#xD;
to conjecture who was ia it. Yonder4s a~&#xD;
blue parasol. Do divinities use blue parasols,&#xD;
Phil?"&#xD;
"They only wear limp dresses, and ~ex~&#xD;
extraordinary hats, as far as my knowledge&#xD;
extends," answered Mr. Conway. "But&#xD;
you ought to know. It is said you devoted .~&#xD;
your attention to the question, in the most&#xD;
candid manner, yesterday."&#xD;
"Who says so?"&#xD;
"All Ayre, I believe. I heard several&#xD;
people mention the fact this morning, so I&#xD;
thought you must have done somo staring&#xD;
out of the ordinary way."&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie shru~ged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Staring, as it is vulgularly called, is a&#xD;
license permitted to an artist-and I am an&#xD;
artist, for the nonce. ]3y-the-hy, did you&#xD;
know your uncle has engaged me profee~&#xD;
sionally?"&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
&#xD;

30                         MABEL LEE.                                                             iN THE GARDEN.                       31&#xD;
&#xD;
"Just what I say. He was so much de-&#xD;
lighted with that miniature I painted of&#xD;
you, and regretted so deeply to find that it&#xD;
was not the work of a professional artist,&#xD;
that I could n~t help offering my services.&#xD;
And what do yoQ suppose he wanted me to&#xD;
do?"&#xD;
"Faint his own likeness."&#xD;
"No; that of some one else."&#xD;
Mr. Conway turned round and looked at&#xD;
his companion with some appearance of in-&#xD;
t~rest-the first he had evinced.&#xD;
"Not the cub's, surely."&#xD;
"Hardly," said his friend, with a laugh.&#xD;
"No; the divinity herself. Don't you envy&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Impossible to say, until I know wheth-&#xD;
er or not she has any brains under those&#xD;
golden locks of hers."&#xD;
"Brains are a very secondary considera-&#xD;
tion, caro mio. A woman's face is all that&#xD;
is worth attention-for, after all, there is&#xD;
scarcely an appreciable difference between&#xD;
the most foolish and the most wise among&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"I know you think so," said Mr. Con-&#xD;
way, indifferently. "But there have been&#xD;
women ~f sense-even from our stand-point,&#xD;
Ralph."&#xD;
"May all good angels deliver me from&#xD;
theni, then!" cried the other, fervently.&#xD;
"From ugly women and clever women may&#xD;
I be ever alike preserved I-There, the boat&#xD;
has touched the landing, and who is that&#xD;
going down to uteet it?"&#xD;
"My uncle,' I think."&#xD;
"But there is some one with him."&#xD;
"The nub, of course. He follows him&#xD;
about like a spaniel."&#xD;
"And bores him to death."&#xD;
"Tant Na jour Zui."&#xD;
Meanwhile, the boating-party were busi-&#xD;
ly disembarking, and had almost accom-&#xD;
plished that matter before Mr. Sexton and&#xD;
his nephew reached them. First came Mrs.&#xD;
Lee, the mcst delicate and helpless of hu-&#xD;
man beings, with Constance's graceful feat-&#xD;
ures, and Constance's soft, brown hair, but&#xD;
with a complexion that looked as if all&#xD;
color had long since been washed out of it,&#xD;
and wistful, lackadaialcal eyes - a being&#xD;
evidently on the gui 'vise for accidents, and&#xD;
&#xD;
ready to scream at every unoffending grass-&#xD;
hopper or caterpillar, but looking veryre-&#xD;
fined and pretty in her pearl-colored silk&#xD;
and purple ribbons, nevertheless; a being&#xD;
who was, plainly in a continual state of in-&#xD;
jured feeling and nervous apprehension-&#xD;
but extremely ladylike, and rather attrac-&#xD;
tive, despite these foibles.&#xD;
Then came Constance, all in a floating&#xD;
cloud of light gray 1~ar~ge-at which Mr.&#xD;
Nowell had looked very approvingly when&#xD;
she made her appearance down-stairs as&#xD;
they were aboutto set out. He entertained&#xD;
a very great regard for her-in a utilitarian&#xD;
point of view-and nothing pleased him&#xD;
more than the quiet style of dress she 111-&#xD;
ways adopted. He was continually holding&#xD;
up to Mabel her perfection of character&#xD;
and costume; but he would quite as soon&#xD;
have thought of falling in love with his&#xD;
aunt as with either the one or the other of&#xD;
these perfection. Yet Constance was&#xD;
looking very pretty just then-although the&#xD;
pallor had not left her face, or the tired&#xD;
look faded out of her eyes-for her misty&#xD;
draperies became her wonderfully; and so&#xD;
did the soft white lace she wore at her&#xD;
neck, and the knot of bright-blue ribbon in&#xD;
her hair.&#xD;
Last prose Mabel-to find awaiting her&#xD;
Mr. Seyton's eager, outstretched hand, and&#xD;
Mr. Seyton's loving, admiring eyes. "My&#xD;
rose-bud has surpassed herself," he said, in&#xD;
his delight; and then he led her forward,&#xD;
with quite a little air of triumph.-" Cyril,"&#xD;
he said, addressing a young man who was&#xD;
talking to Mrs. Lee, "let me present you to&#xD;
my goddaughter."&#xD;
The gentleman addressed turned quickly&#xD;
and bowed deeply; then, as he raised his&#xD;
face, he gave one long look at the exquisite&#xD;
apparition before him.&#xD;
"I almost thought you were about to&#xD;
introduce the queen of the fairies, sir," he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
And the compliment was neither so far-&#xD;
fetched nor so high-flown as might at first&#xD;
be imagined-for Titania's self never trod&#xD;
earth in lovelier guise than did Mabel Lee&#xD;
that day. Her dress was only white mus-&#xD;
lin, but of exquisitely fine fab~ie, and its&#xD;
making had been a labor of love .to Qo~-&#xD;
&#xD;
stance's nimble fingers. Mr. Nowell groaned&#xD;
vainly over the endless ruffles, the dainty&#xD;
flounces, and airy puffs; he lectured vainly&#xD;
over the broad rose-colored sash and rib&#xD;
bons; for neither groans nor lectures short&#xD;
ened Constance's labor, or curbed Mabel's&#xD;
delight, one whit. He alone had refused&#xD;
his tribute of admiration when she came&#xD;
down fully dressed that day-refused it,&#xD;
though even Father Lawrence, who chanced&#xD;
to step in at the moment, had declared that&#xD;
she might be painted for St. Agnes or St.&#xD;
Cecilia. "I am sure that neither St. Agnes&#xD;
nor St. Cecilia ever wore any thing of that&#xD;
foolish and improper description," said Mr.&#xD;
Nowell, severely-and now he had to stand&#xD;
by and hear this impertinent coxcomb make&#xD;
a still more odious comparison. "The&#xD;
queen of the fairies, indeed! They will&#xD;
spoil her beyond all hope of cure," he&#xD;
thought to himself, savagely, wishing the&#xD;
while in his heart of hearts that he could&#xD;
take her away from them all, and shut her&#xD;
up where never man's eyes save his own&#xD;
should fall upon her-nor a man's voice&#xD;
speak admiration. Perhaps in that case he&#xD;
might have seen no harm even in the white&#xD;
muslin flounces and rose-colored ribbons.&#xD;
As for Mr. Cyril Harding, he was walk-&#xD;
ing beside Mrs. Lee, and answering her well-&#xD;
bred commonplaces, but he did little else&#xD;
save stare at Mabel, all the way to the&#xD;
* house-Mabel, who was clinging to her god-&#xD;
father's arm, and talking to him gayly, quite&#xD;
oblivious of the admiring eyes bent upon&#xD;
her, except that they had struck her as very&#xD;
black and very disagreeable in expression&#xD;
when she first met them.&#xD;
Yet Mrs. Phifer and the Misses Crane&#xD;
had thought Mr. Harding an exceedingly&#xD;
handsome man-and so he was, barring the&#xD;
unmistakable stamp of the prig, and barring&#xD;
also a certain solemnity of aspect and stiff-&#xD;
ness of demeanor, which did not sit well on&#xD;
so young a man, and gave him rather the&#xD;
aspect of a saturnine divine-an aspect&#xD;
which (like many other things too tedious&#xD;
to mention) requires a cultivated evangeli-&#xD;
cal taste to appreciate it; and which Mabel,&#xD;
being neither cultivated nor evangelical, did&#xD;
not at all fancy.&#xD;
"He looks like a preacher," she wl)is-&#xD;
&#xD;
I pered to her godfather, 'with a little confi-&#xD;
dential pressure of the arm. "I don't like&#xD;
him ~in the least."&#xD;
*" I wonder if you will like the other any&#xD;
better, Mab?"&#xD;
"That remains to be seen," she an-&#xD;
swered. And the next moment they were&#xD;
under the shadow of the portico.&#xD;
Mrs. Nesbitt, the housekeeper, met theni&#xD;
in the hall with many courtesies, and at&#xD;
once led the ladies away to the chamber~&#xD;
prepared for their reception. Mrs. Lee ~vas~&#xD;
to do the honors of the house on this occa-&#xD;
sion-the first of the kind on many a long&#xD;
day--so her interest in all the details of&#xD;
arrangement was,,for the time, quite as live-&#xD;
ly as if she had been iwna ftde mistress of&#xD;
Seyton House. In this mood, Mrs. Nesbitt&#xD;
was only too ready to humor her-there&#xD;
being this thing, that thing, and the other&#xD;
thing, concerning all of which she had&#xD;
wished to ask Mrs. Lee's advice. Would it&#xD;
trouble Mrs. Lee too much just to step down&#xD;
to the dining-room and pantry?~ She could&#xD;
decide so much better about the p~r~~zes&#xD;
after she had seen them-not to speak of the&#xD;
disputed point between herself and the but-&#xD;
ler as to the serving of fruit on silver or&#xD;
glass. Mrs. Lee replied that it would not&#xD;
in the least trouble her too much; and, bare-&#xD;
ly allowing Constance to fasten her collar,&#xD;
she rustled away, with the voluble house-&#xD;
keeper in close attendance. So, left alone,&#xD;
the two sisters looked at each other and&#xD;
smiled.&#xD;
"Mamma will be happy for the next&#xD;
hour," said Constance. "Now, what shall&#xD;
we do?"&#xD;
"Go down to godpapa," suggested Mabel.&#xD;
"Well, no; because that means going&#xD;
down to the other gentlemen also; and we&#xD;
shall have quite enough of them at dinner.&#xD;
Let us go to the garden. I have not seen it&#xD;
this spring."&#xD;
"Have you not? Then you have nob&#xD;
seen any of Mr. Farris's new improvements.&#xD;
Yes, that is where we will go, Put on your&#xD;
hat."&#xD;
"I have it here. Shall we go down the&#xD;
back-stairs?"&#xD;
"Of 'course; if we were seen, we should&#xD;
be waylaid. Hush, now I"&#xD;
&#xD;
MABEL LEE.&#xD;

JMABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
They ran. lightly down the narrow stairs,&#xD;
past the pantry, where Mrs. Lee's voice was&#xD;
heard emphatic in command and advice,&#xD;
down a passage, out of a side door, and&#xD;
straight across a green slope of sunny sward,&#xD;
into the beautiful and far-famed gardens of&#xD;
Seyton House.&#xD;
They had never looked more beautiful,&#xD;
or better deserved their fame, than on this&#xD;
lovely May afternoon; and the sisters wan-&#xD;
dered up and down the long alleys, admired&#xD;
all the skilful gardener's new improvements,&#xD;
and discussed the rival merits of :Noisette&#xD;
and Bengal roses, quite oblivious of the fact&#xD;
that many carriages had already deposited&#xD;
their occupants at the door of the house.&#xD;
Mabel, in especial, seemed to have entirely&#xD;
forgotten time and circumstances; and was&#xD;
only intent upon a certain South American&#xD;
shrub that she wished to show Constance,&#xD;
but could not find. She Wandered off in&#xD;
search of it, leaving her sister quite alone.&#xD;
The latter sat down patiently to wait her&#xD;
return; but it was not long before she&#xD;
heard her name called, and saw two gentle-&#xD;
men advancing down the path toward her.&#xD;
One, she knew, was Mr. Ainslie-the other&#xD;
she could only conjecture to be Mr. Conway.&#xD;
They apologized for their appearance, ex-&#xD;
plaining that the company having all ar-&#xD;
rived, while her sister and herself were not&#xD;
to be found in the house, Mr. Seyton had&#xD;
grown uneasy, and Mrs. Lee nervous, and&#xD;
they themselves had been sent in quest of&#xD;
the truants. ~o; Miss Lee must not think&#xD;
it was a trouble-or that they did not very&#xD;
willingly ~undertake such a pleasant service.&#xD;
They were fortunate to find her so soon;&#xD;
and-if they might inquire-where was her&#xD;
sister?&#xD;
Constance gave all the information she&#xD;
possessed on that subject, and Mr. Conway&#xD;
at once volunteered to seek the missing de-&#xD;
moiselle.&#xD;
"I know the locality of the Brazilian&#xD;
plant very well," he said.-.~" Ralph, you&#xD;
had better take Miss Lee to the house. I&#xD;
will follow with Miss Mabel as soon as I&#xD;
find her."&#xD;
So saying, he lifted his hat, and strode&#xD;
away down the same path that Mabel had&#xD;
taken ten minutes before.&#xD;
&#xD;
Suddenly he paused, for there, in an open&#xD;
space, was the brilliant tropical shrub, cov-&#xD;
ered with gorgeous blossoms, and scenting&#xD;
the air with its rich fragrance, while close&#xD;
beside it, bending over the cup of a large&#xD;
bloom, was a slender, white-clad form, that&#xD;
might have been a sylph or a saint, in that&#xD;
beautiful bright framework of flowers. He&#xD;
stood for a moment of strange self-forgetful-&#xD;
ness, gazing with admiration at this lovely&#xD;
vision; and it was only her evident and in-&#xD;
creasing embarrassment which recalled his&#xD;
recollection.&#xD;
"Pardon me," he said, courteously, as he&#xD;
advanced and took off his hat; "I amsorry&#xD;
to intrude-sorry to disturb you-but I&#xD;
have been sent-'-"&#xD;
"For me?" said Mabel, with a start.&#xD;
"Qh, dear I am I so late as that?"&#xD;
"You are very late," replied Mr, Con-&#xD;
way, smiling at her consternation. "Mrs.&#xD;
Lee and my uncle are becoming anxious,&#xD;
and the latter did me the honor to send me&#xD;
to hasten your return."&#xD;
"I am very sorry to have given you so&#xD;
much trouble. I will go and find my sister,&#xD;
who is in the garden also."&#xD;
"Miss Lee has already returned to the&#xD;
house with Mr. Ainslie."&#xD;
"Indeed!"&#xD;
She started quickly forward, but her&#xD;
muslin flounces caught ~n the prickly shrub,&#xD;
which seemed loath to let her go, and in an-&#xD;
other moment there might have been a de-&#xD;
stniction of all Constance's work, if Mr. Con-&#xD;
way had not come to the rescue.&#xD;
He bent over her to loosen the filmy&#xD;
fabric; bent so close that lie marked every&#xD;
throb of the azure veins on the hand that&#xD;
strove to help and only hindered him; so&#xD;
close that something seemed to unnerve&#xD;
him completely,. and the strong, subtle per-&#xD;
fame of the shrub rushed over him with an&#xD;
almost overpowering effect. In all the after-&#xD;
years of his life, he could never endure that&#xD;
fragrance, or see without a shudder the gor-&#xD;
geous blossoms that held Mabel Lee's dress&#xD;
that day, as if they held her from the fate&#xD;
she went to meet.&#xD;
"That will do, thank you. I am entirely&#xD;
disengaged now. But I am afraid you bav~&#xD;

cisely the same degree of interest if it had I&#xD;

What could Mabel say? It was impossi- 4&#xD;
ble for her to tell him that her liking ante-&#xD;
dated even this; and that, from the first&#xD;
hour when she saw it on the river, his face&#xD;
had never ceased to haunt both her waking&#xD;
and sleeping dreams. Fortunately, they&#xD;
came in sight of the drawing-room windows,&#xD;
and she was spared reply; for who should&#xD;
appear at one of them but Miss Lavinia&#xD;
Crane, with the sombre outline of Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing looming behind her-a sight which at&#xD;
once banished every thing from Mabel's&#xD;
mind, save the dreadful thought of Ayre&#xD;
propriety!&#xD;
"What will they think of me?" she said,&#xD;
this time aloud; "and how shall I ever&#xD;
again have courage to go in?"&#xD;
"There is no difficulty about that,"&#xD;
answered her companion, encouragingly.&#xD;
"Take my ~advice, and laugh it off care-&#xD;
lessly.~ Suppose we storm one of the win-&#xD;
dows? It will be a more informal mode of&#xD;
entrance than by the door."&#xD;
Mabel would have agreed to any thing;&#xD;
so they struck across the lawn, Mr. Conway&#xD;
drew aside the heavy silken draperies, and&#xD;
the next moment they faced that most&#xD;
solemn and injured of all assemblages-a&#xD;
party of people waiting for dinner.&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
CHAI'TER VII.&#xD;
Mfl. AINSLIE'S EXPERIMENT.&#xD;
As usual, the anticipation considerably&#xD;
transcended the reality. A storm of laugh-&#xD;
ter and jesting reproaches greeted the tru-&#xD;
ant and her captor . that was all. The an-&#xD;
nouncement of dinner soon banished tliem&#xD;
from the public mind, and there ensued the&#xD;
bustle of getting more than thirty people~&#xD;
into orderly array-a bustle which Mabel&#xD;
and her cavalier watched very quietly from&#xD;
their window stand-point, until Mrs. Lee&#xD;
swept by oa the arm of a portly ex-gov-&#xD;
ernor.&#xD;
"I am. very sorry, Mr. Conway," she&#xD;
paused a moment to say, "but you wrn have&#xD;

Irns been disposed of, and-"&#xD;
"Heaven be praised for it!" said Mr.&#xD;
Conway, devoutly, as the rest of the sen-&#xD;
tence was lost in her onward progress.&#xD;
"Do you mean to say now that there is no&#xD;
truth in metaphysics, or luck in garden&#xD;
rambles, Miss Lee?"&#xD;
"I don't know," answered Miss Lee, a&#xD;
little doubtfully. "Is bringing ~ip the rear&#xD;
of a dinner-party proof of either? I hope,&#xD;
by-the-by, you don't mind cold soup, Mr.&#xD;
Conway ?-"&#xD;
"I prefer it warm, undoubtedly."&#xD;
"Then we had better move forward,&#xD;
for, as it is, I fear we shall hardly obtain&#xD;
good seats."&#xD;
They moved forward accordingly, and,&#xD;
being the last couple to enter the dining-&#xD;
room, drifted into what seats they could;&#xD;
and found on one side of them an old lady&#xD;
who had come to enjoy her dinner simply&#xD;
for her dinner's sake, and, on the other, two&#xD;
agricultural worthies, whose conversational&#xD;
ideas seemed bounded by tobacco-lands and&#xD;
Devon cattle.&#xD;
Mr. Conway made a wry face over his&#xD;
soup, which was very well cooled indeed;&#xD;
but, for all that, he did not seem to take his&#xD;
position much to heart. On the contrary,&#xD;
he was evidently in that frame of mind&#xD;
common to us all, when, from our own high&#xD;
estate of good fortune, or happiness, or&#xD;
whatever else it may be, we look with a&#xD;
sublime sort of pity on the low estate Of&#xD;
others. Glancing down the long table, he&#xD;
saw his friend Ainslie devoting himself to&#xD;
the entertainment of one of the prettiest&#xD;
girls in the room, and forthwith, without&#xD;
any apparent reason, he told Mabel that he&#xD;
was very sorry for him.&#xD;
"Sorry!" repeated Mabel, opening her&#xD;
eyes. "Why should you be sorry for him?&#xD;
Because he has not cold soup, like you?"&#xD;
"No; because he has to entertain that&#xD;
young lady with pink roses in her auburn&#xD;
hair. I tried her awhile before dinner, and&#xD;
I found-but I beg pardon, she may be a&#xD;
friend of yours."&#xD;
"She is not exactly a friend of mine,"&#xD;
said Mabel, "but I like her very much.&#xD;
She is very nice, I assure you.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"She may~ he very nice, but she is ti&#xD;
farthest in the world from being very inte&#xD;
testing. What is her name? "&#xD;
"Nina Eston."&#xD;
"Rather pretty. So is she, barring ti&#xD;
color of her hair."&#xD;
"I like red hair," said Mabel, decided;&#xD;
"I a~ree with the Spaniards in considering&#xD;
it a great beauty."&#xD;
"I like golden hair," returned Mr. Coi&#xD;
way, with a point-blank stare at her ow&#xD;
locks. "In my opinion, people should ne~&#xD;
er have any other sort. Do you think Aim&#xD;
lie's hair pretty? It is red enough to sui&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"On the contrary, it is not half rei&#xD;
enough to suit me," said Mabel, looking a&#xD;
Ainslie. ",It has a red dash, certainly; bu&#xD;
I should call it chestnut."&#xD;
"Should you? It's not my idea at all&#xD;
But I will ask him about it. He is an ar&#xD;
tist, and will know."&#xD;
"An artist!" repeated Mabel, and sh~&#xD;
looked at him again. Then suddenly, with-&#xD;
out any connection with what had gone be-&#xD;
fore, she asked, "Does he mean to stay long&#xD;
at Seyton?"&#xD;
"That depends entirely on whether Sey-&#xD;
ton proves agreeable to him or not," Con-&#xD;
way answered, carelessly. "His time is&#xD;
quite at his own disposal, and he will stay&#xD;
as long as he finds it pleasant. Certainly,&#xD;
also, he will not leave with my uncle's&#xD;
good-will, for, by some means or other, he&#xD;
has quite won his heart."&#xD;
"Everybody seems to like him."&#xD;
"Like is a faint word. I have never&#xD;
seen any thing equal his power of fascina-&#xD;
tion: He charms people almost without&#xD;
an effort, by a single glance, or a singlet&#xD;
word."&#xD;
"I suppose he charmed you in that&#xD;
way?"&#xD;
"No, truly," answered he, with a laugh.&#xD;
"I am a very cold-blooded person, and al-&#xD;
though I like Ainslie tolerably well-better,&#xD;
much, than I like most people-yet no one&#xD;
could possibly accuse me of being fascinated&#xD;
by him. There is very little in common be-&#xD;
tween us, yet we agree somehow."&#xD;
"You will not mind if I ask you a ques-&#xD;
tion about him, then?"&#xD;
&#xD;
bie "Not in the~least. I' am at your service&#xD;
r- to answer a hundred, if you will."&#xD;
She hesitated a moment, and then glanced&#xD;
up, speaking hastily.&#xD;
ic "Is he a man whom you would trust?"&#xD;
Mr. Conway looked astonished, as in-&#xD;
y~ deed he had sufficient reason for doing.&#xD;
g "Trust!" he repeated, as if uncertain&#xD;
whether he heard her aright. "Yes, I&#xD;
i- should think so, as far as one would feel in-&#xD;
n dined to trust any man of acknowledged&#xD;
integrity, whose honor has never suffered&#xD;
by a shade. It cannot be that y~u have&#xD;
.t ever heard any thing to the contrary?"&#xD;
"No, no, nothing whatever."&#xD;
I     "Then I hope you do not ask such awk-&#xD;
t ward questions about all new acquaintances;&#xD;
t for there are not many people who can&#xD;
boast a record so 8~fl8 reprocho as Ainslie;&#xD;
and T, for one, could ill afford to be judged&#xD;
in that way.~~&#xD;
"You! But I never thought-"&#xD;
"Of questioning my trustworthiness,"&#xD;
* he said, with a somewhat bitter laugh. "I&#xD;
hope you will not, Miss Lee, for there are&#xD;
many besides your friend Mr. Blake who&#xD;
will be ready to assure you that no good&#xD;
fruit ever came of an evil tree."&#xD;
"I seldom take my opinions second&#xD;
hand," said Mabel, flushing; "and I should&#xD;
no more dream of condemning a man for hi~&#xD;
ancestor's vices, than I should think it safe&#xD;
to trust him on the credit of their virtues."&#xD;
"You are very good to say so," answered&#xD;
he, gratefully. "There are so few people&#xD;
who sympathize with black sheep, that we&#xD;
appreciate such liberality of sentiment when&#xD;
we find it. Do you know, I don't think&#xD;
there would be half so many of us~ if we&#xD;
did not feel reckless from being placed ~o&#xD;
mercilessly 'under the ban?"'&#xD;
Before dinner was over, the suui went&#xD;
down, and, when they all returned to the&#xD;
drawing-room, they found its lamps lighted,&#xD;
and gleaming in every direction, though the&#xD;
windows were still open, and the spring&#xD;
dusk was dying away among the blossoms&#xD;
outside. The elder people, who had a whole-&#xD;
some fear of mists and the lik~, remained&#xD;
within, and settled themselves to whist and&#xD;
conversation; but the younger members of&#xD;
the company wandered out to the terrace,&#xD;

MR. AINSLIE'S EXPERIMENT.                  87&#xD;
&#xD;
and made more than one passer-by on the&#xD;
river start at the echo of their clear, young&#xD;
voices and ringing laughter. Such sounds&#xD;
were not common about Seyton House; and&#xD;
the boatman or two who pulled lazily past,&#xD;
stared curiously at the windows that sent&#xD;
forth broad gleams of light, and the groups&#xD;
leaning over the terrace balustrade caught&#xD;
the verses of song floating out in the still air,&#xD;
and thought, no doubt, that the festive ap-&#xD;
pearance of the whole scene was very attrac-&#xD;
tive&#xD;
"It looks pleasant, does it not?" said&#xD;
Mabel, as she sat with Mr. Hai'ding, near&#xD;
one of the windows, and gazed out with&#xD;
eyes full of wistful longing. She was very&#xD;
young yet, ~ud found it as hard to remain&#xD;
quietly in the house and listen to solemn&#xD;
dissertations on "the sublime, the heroic,&#xD;
and Mr. Carlyle," while the purple twilight&#xD;
gathered, the mocking-birds sang, and the&#xD;
gay voices laughed outside, as if she had&#xD;
been seven instead of seventeen. "It&#xD;
looks pleasant, does it not? But I beg par-&#xD;
den. 'You were saying-"&#xD;
"Nothing of much importance," said&#xD;
Mr. Harding, who did netlike to be inter-&#xD;
rupted, and who, during the lasthalf hour,&#xD;
had arrived at the conclusion that it was a&#xD;
great pity that Mabel was so pretty, and a&#xD;
still greater pity that she was Mr. Seyton's&#xD;
goddaughter, since, but for those twp facts,&#xD;
tie would have taken himself and his con-&#xD;
versational powers where they would have&#xD;
been sure of favorable appreciation-" noth-&#xD;
ing o~ much importance. I was only quot-&#xD;
ing-but it does not matter. Will you go&#xD;
on the terrace, Miss Lee?"&#xD;
"No, thank you," said Miss Lee, hasti-&#xD;
ly; for, though the terrace m itself was very&#xD;
desirable, the terrace, with Mr. Harding for&#xD;
a companion, would be worse than thE&#xD;
drawing-room, inasmuch as there could b~&#xD;
no hope of rescue there. "I am very com-&#xD;
fortable. Do you like music, Mr. Hardingi&#xD;
I see Nina Eston going to the piano, and w&#xD;
think that she sings yery finely. You msil&#xD;
have heard her. She is first soprano in__"&#xD;
She stopped short, and colored; where'&#xD;
upon Mr. Harding immediately inquire&#xD;
where it was that Miss Eston was first so&#xD;
prune.&#xD;
&#xD;
"In a place where you are not likely to&#xD;
have heard her," answered Mabel, laughing&#xD;
a little at her own stupidity. "In our&#xD;
choir, that is. Her 'Agnus Dci' last Sun-&#xD;
day was beautiful."&#xD;
At the mere sound of these words, Mr.&#xD;
Harding stiffened into reserve and silence.&#xD;
He could do a great deal, he could constrain&#xD;
himself a great deal, for the sake of the end&#xD;
he held in view; b*ut one thing he could not&#xD;
do, one point where he could not constrain&#xD;
himself, was when people spoke in his pres-&#xD;
ence of that Church which, in all sincerity,&#xD;
he believed to be the wife of the devil.&#xD;
Like Mause Headrigg, his convictions were&#xD;
too strong either for policy or courtesy, and&#xD;
it became a matter of simple necessity to&#xD;
speak his mind freely.&#xD;
"Xe, I never heard Miss Eston," he&#xD;
said. "I am sorry that I am not likely to&#xD;
do so when she sings an-an 'Agnus Dci,'&#xD;
or any thing of that sort. I hope I am not&#xD;
a bigot, Miss Lee, but I hold your churches&#xD;
to be the abodes of error, and I never enter&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"I do not think they could possibly&#xD;
harm you," said Mabel, simply. "But&#xD;
nothing is so useless as religious discussion.&#xD;
How animated they' are at the whist-table&#xD;
yonder! Are you fond of ~&#xD;
"I never play it," answered the evan-&#xD;
gelical gentleman, in his most evangelical&#xD;
tone. "I disapprove of all games on prin-&#xD;
ciple. Backgammon, now, or draughts-"&#xD;
"Will he ask me to play either of&#xD;
then~?" thought poor Mabel,'In con~terna-&#xD;
tion; but just then the diversion for which&#xD;
she had been longing arrived. There&#xD;
was a movement upon her position. Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie came to the rescue, and, notwith-&#xD;
standing her unfavorable verdict at din-&#xD;
ncr, there was no doubt but that Mabel&#xD;
was heartily glad to see him-as, indeed,&#xD;
she would have been glad to see any one&#xD;
who relieved her of the irksome weight of&#xD;
Mr. Harding's attentions. Ainslie had a&#xD;
pack of cards in his hand, and, as he sat&#xD;
down, was shuffling them.&#xD;
"Don't think that 'I mean to ask you&#xD;
I to play any thing," said he, laughing at the&#xD;
- expression on Mabel's face, for it is not&#xD;
often that ~ay seventeen has zany liking for&#xD;
&#xD;
cards. "I am something of a conjurer,&#xD;
however, and I mean to tell your fortune.&#xD;
May I?,"&#xD;
"Of course you may," answered she,&#xD;
smiling. "Isn't one always glad to have&#xD;
one's fortune told? The desire of my heart&#xD;
has always been to meet a gypsy. Are you&#xD;
a gypsy, Mr. Ainslie?"&#xD;
"For the present, I am any thing you&#xD;
choose,~' said Mr. Ainslie, gallantly.&#xD;
"'Being your slave, what should I do but tend&#xD;
Upon the hours and times of your desire?'&#xD;
"Don't think, however, that this is any&#xD;
commonplace or vulgar mode of telling for-&#xD;
tunes," he went on. "It is something quite&#xD;
unique, one of the most peculiar things I&#xD;
ever knew and" (cutting and shuffling dili-&#xD;
gently) "the accuracy of the result always&#xD;
surprises me as much as it surprises or&#xD;
could surprise any one else. It was taught&#xD;
me by an old Arab with whom I was on&#xD;
terms of great intimacy in Algiers.-Ilard-&#xD;
ing, my good fellow, will you give me&#xD;
that stand at your elbow? Thanks-much&#xD;
obliged.-Xow, Miss Lee, put your hand on&#xD;
these cards. Something of personal mag-&#xD;
netism i8 essential to the success of the ex-&#xD;
periment."&#xD;
"I really thought," said Mr. Harding,&#xD;
with a grim sneer, "that only charlatans&#xD;
walked nonsense of that kind."&#xD;
"Far be it from me to hint that you are&#xD;
mistaken," replied Mr. Ainslie. "We all&#xD;
have an element of charlatanry, more or&#xD;
less-..haven't we? My element is upper-&#xD;
most just now-that is all.-Miss Lee, your 1&#xD;
whole hand, if you pleas~ Yes-that is it." 1&#xD;
Miss Lee obediently placed her hand on&#xD;
some caltds which he laid before her. Tell-.&#xD;
ing the fortune, however, proved quite a I&#xD;
long and rather a complicated undertaking.&#xD;
An abstruse calculation of some sort was&#xD;
necessary, in which Mr. Ainslie made van- ~&#xD;
ous mistakes, as amateur conjurers usually&#xD;
do, and was various times compelled to re- t&#xD;
trace his steps, and "go back to the begin-&#xD;
ning." After he had gone back to the be- s&#xD;
ginning quite often, Mr. Harding wearied ~&#xD;
of the entertainment, and walked away. s&#xD;
Conway, who had been watching his oppor-&#xD;
tunity, then came forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Is Ralph showing you his Arabian&#xD;
mode of telling fortunes?" asked he. "It&#xD;
is surprising how often he hits the truth.-&#xD;
Ainslie, do you remember how incredulous&#xD;
Cunningham was when you told him he&#xD;
would be married within three months?&#xD;
Yet that fast Miss What.was-her-name had&#xD;
him in her toils before that time. When I&#xD;
reminded him of the cards, he only smiled a&#xD;
very ghastly smile. Poor fellow! He was&#xD;
a melancholy example of what cones of&#xD;
'only spooning' with a clever woman!"&#xD;
"That affair of Rosset was still more&#xD;
surprising," said Ainslie, between the inter-&#xD;
vals of counting his cards.&#xD;
"Yes, that was astonishing," said Con-&#xD;
way.-" He was a young fellow in Paris,&#xD;
Miss Lee-as well and strong as I am now,&#xD;
when Ralph told his fortune for him. The&#xD;
cards announced his death within twenty-&#xD;
four hours. As you may imagine, he&#xD;
laughed at it, and did not let the dismal&#xD;
prophecy prevent his starting to Bordeaux&#xD;
the next morning. The first news we heard&#xD;
was, that there had been a railroad accident&#xD;
and Rosset was one of the killed."&#xD;
"But you don't mean that yoti think it&#xD;
was any thing more than a coincidence!"&#xD;
cried Mabel, somewhat aghast. "I am in-&#xD;
clined to be credulous of marvels, Mr. Con-&#xD;
way, but really this is beyond even my&#xD;
powers of belief."&#xD;
"I merely state the facts," answered&#xD;
Qonway. "Interpret them in any manner&#xD;
~'ou please-Ralph, I am sure, will allow&#xD;
~rou every latitude. You don't intend to&#xD;
~clieve what he tells you about yourself~&#xD;
;hen?"&#xD;
"That depends upon whether or not it&#xD;
s pleasant. What is it, Mr. Ainslie? Sure-&#xD;
y you have arrived at some decision by this&#xD;
ime!"&#xD;
"'What is it, Ralph?" asked Conway,&#xD;
noticing that his friend had the cards spread&#xD;
~ut before him, and was intently regarding&#xD;
heir 'combinations.&#xD;
Thus addressed, Mr. Ainslie started, and,&#xD;
omewbat hastily, shuffled the cards to-&#xD;
~ether again. Then he looked up with a&#xD;
mile.&#xD;
"I can make nothing of it," he said.&#xD;
It is all utter nenser~se-suoh complete&#xD;

MABEL LEE.                                                          MR. AINSLIE'S EXPERIMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
nonsense that I decline to risk my conjuring&#xD;
i'4utatien upon it. Miss Lee, I will show&#xD;
you some genuine juggler's links now."&#xD;
They were very wonderful tricks, in-&#xD;
deed, and, before long, the juggler had at-&#xD;
tracted round him the major part of Mr.&#xD;
Seyto~t's guests. Even the whist-players&#xD;
forsook their table to see the ace of hearts&#xD;
vanish up Mr. Ainslie's sleeve, and reappear&#xD;
nuder a vase at the farther side of the room.&#xD;
The whole company were so harmed that&#xD;
when he came to the end of his repertoire&#xD;
they gave him a unanimous and enthusias-&#xD;
tic encore.&#xD;
"Or, if you don't want to repeat those&#xD;
things," cried Miss Eston, "show us sOme-&#xD;
thing more remarkable. I know you can if&#xD;
~o&amp;amp;~ill~ lie told me at dinner he could&#xD;
mesmerize' people," she added, turning to&#xD;
the ezpectant company. "I tell you what&#xD;
he shall do-he shall mesmerize me."&#xD;
There w~s a general laugh at this.&#xD;
"If he succeeds, he will be a wonderful&#xD;
person, Nina," said Mr. Seyton. "I can't&#xD;
fancy you a subject for magnetism-can you,&#xD;
Mr. Ah~slle?"&#xD;
"I urn only an amateur dabbler in the&#xD;
science," said Mr. Ainslie, with becoming&#xD;
modesty. "I doubt if I can succeed inmag-&#xD;
ifetizing anybody, but it will give me pleas-&#xD;
ure to try an' experiment with Miss Eston."&#xD;
The' experiment was tried accordingly,&#xD;
and, as a - matter of course, failed. The&#xD;
~ould-be'subject laughed all the time, and,&#xD;
tufter~ many passes, and much intent gazing,&#xD;
Mr. Ainsile was compelled to declare that it&#xD;
waS impossible to produce any effect upon&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Supposa you try Mabel?" said Miss&#xD;
Eston. "Somehow, I have an idea that you&#xD;
would succeed with her."&#xD;
"I doubt extremely if I would succeed&#xD;
with anybody," said Ainslie, shrugging his&#xD;
shoulders. "Still, if Miss Lee does not ob-&#xD;
ject-"&#xD;
But, as it chanced, Miss Lee did object.&#xD;
Th everybody's surprise, she shrank from&#xD;
the proposal with something almost like&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
"I cannot think of such a thing, Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie," she said. "Indeed, I cannot."&#xD;
"There is really nothing to fear," said&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie, with a laugh. "I can make&#xD;
the passes-~-I learned that much from Graf-&#xD;
ner, you know, Conway-but I assure you I&#xD;
have no idea that I will be able to affect&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Still I am so fanciful that I shrink from&#xD;
the idea, and I really cannot consent to-to&#xD;
try it."&#xD;
"Your temperament and organization&#xD;
give some hope of success," said Mr. Ainslie,&#xD;
meditatively. "You would not shrink from&#xD;
the influence if it were powerless to affect&#xD;
you. I should like to try the experiment,&#xD;
but, of course, if you object, I cannot press&#xD;
the point."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Mabel, looking re-&#xD;
lieved. "I am sorry to seem ungracious&#xD;
and unwilling to contribute my share to the&#xD;
public amusement," she added, after a mo-&#xD;
ment, "but if you only knew with what a&#xD;
nervous shrinking-almost a nervous terror&#xD;
-the mere idea fills me "&#xD;
"laugh at it," said Philip Conway, "and&#xD;
then there will be no fear of his succeed-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"That is what shc cannot do," said the&#xD;
other, in a tone of perceptible triumph.&#xD;
And indeed she could not. The myste-&#xD;
rious power already seemed to have influ-&#xD;
enced the highly-strung nervous tempera-&#xD;
ment on whose exquisite sensitiveness the&#xD;
amateur mesmerist reckoned not without&#xD;
reason. Seeing how pale she became, Ains-&#xD;
lie ceased to urge the experiment upon her;&#xD;
but others crowded around by this time,&#xD;
and beset her resolution with numberless&#xD;
entreaties.&#xD;
"Mabel, do!"&#xD;
"Mabel, pray do!"&#xD;
"Mabel, you surely have not the heart&#xD;
to disappoint us so."&#xD;
"Dear me) Mabel, how can you be such&#xD;
a coward?"&#xD;
'~ 0 Mabel, try to oblige us."&#xD;
Last came Mr. Seyton, saying:&#xD;
"My pet, you can gratify these foolish&#xD;
people."&#xD;
And thenConstance:&#xD;
"Darling, will you try to do it, or shall&#xD;
I send them all away?"&#xD;
In this strait, Mabel looked up at Philip&#xD;
Conway. If he had said, "Don't," she&#xD;
&#xD;
might have withstood them all~ But he.&#xD;
too, was curious to try the experiment; he.&#xD;
too, only thought her terror the fanciful&#xD;
child of ignorance; so he only asked:&#xD;
"Do you think your courage is equal&#xD;
to the venture now?"&#xD;
And, with a sigh, she answered "yes."&#xD;
The eager group drew near, forming s&#xD;
hollow square about them, while Ainslie&#xD;
fixed his eyes upon her with a concentrated&#xD;
expression, and, slowly and at intervals,&#xD;
made the passes. From the very first it&#xD;
was evident how rightly he had judged that&#xD;
she was entirely susceptible to the influ-&#xD;
ence; for, although there was a good deal&#xD;
of laughter and whispered comment going&#xD;
on, her attention never once wandered from&#xD;
his face; Jier gaze never once wavered from&#xD;
the deep, brilliant eyes that regarded her so&#xD;
steadfastly. After a while the pupils of her&#xD;
own eyes began to dilate perceptibly, and&#xD;
then a subtle difference of expression grad-&#xD;
ually came over the face-a difference that&#xD;
it was impossible for any one present&#xD;
to analyze-but that every one perceived.&#xD;
A sudden accession of interest came over&#xD;
them all, and then-&#xD;
"Mabel," cried an audacious voice in the&#xD;
rear, "how do you feel now?~~&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie lifted his hand in quick re-&#xD;
monstrance, but it was too late. Without&#xD;
removing her eyes, Mabel answered, drop-&#xD;
ping her syllables slowly one by one, as if&#xD;
already she had spoken under the influence&#xD;
of another power than that of mere personal&#xD;
volition:&#xD;
"I feel strangely happy-strangely at&#xD;
rest. But I also feel powerless-bound fast&#xD;
-under a spell, as it were. A cold, waver-&#xD;
ing flame seems creeping over me. I feel&#xD;
it tingling like the charge of an electric bat-&#xD;
tery. But it does not shock, it does not&#xD;
burn, it only seems to pervade me with-"&#xD;
At that moment the brilliant, steady eyes&#xD;
seemed to fix themselves upon her with&#xD;
fresh power, and the words -were hushed on&#xD;
her lip. Still looking at him, she suddenly&#xD;
relapsed into silence, andthe strange, subtle&#xD;
expression-the change which no one could&#xD;
deflu~e-deepened and deepened upon h~r&#xD;
face, until it seemed to pervade and take&#xD;
entire possession of it. Then he bent down&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
gently, and breathed slightly on her fore-&#xD;
head, remaining in the attitude for a second,&#xD;
I perhaps. The least interested among the&#xD;
lookers on had not time to grow impatient,&#xD;
I however, before he stepped away, for all to&#xD;
see the result. She was leaning against&#xD;
the back of her chair, with the careless, un-&#xD;
conscious grace of profound slumber, while&#xD;
its deep crimson velvet threw into relief her&#xD;
tinted face, her golden ~curls, and airy mus~&#xD;
lin dress. Yet not tli~ most ignorant per-&#xD;
son present could have supposed for a mo-&#xD;
ment that what they saw was slumber; for&#xD;
the eyes were open, though vacant, as if&#xD;
sleep-walking; the brow slightly contracted,&#xD;
but evidently not by pain, for the lips were&#xD;
faintly smiling, and the hands fell loosely,&#xD;
and relaxed on either side.&#xD;
There was a moment's profound hush-&#xD;
a moment in which awe rushedsuddenly&#xD;
over every heart that had been laughing and&#xD;
mocking five seconds before-and then Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie's voice broke on the stillness:&#xD;
"There, my friends, is an answer fo~ all&#xD;
who doubt the truth or power of mesmer-&#xD;
ism"&#xD;
Then broke forth a many-voiced ques-&#xD;
tion:&#xD;
"Is she mesmerized?"&#xD;
The answer was deep and almost sol-&#xD;
emn:&#xD;
"She is mesmerized."&#xD;
They gathered around close, and yet&#xD;
closer, touching her, speaking to her, lifting&#xD;
the passive hands, and proving, by every&#xD;
means in their power, how deep and perfect&#xD;
was the magnetic trance., Stir and move-&#xD;
ment there were none. Save for the regtu~&#xD;
lar breathing and the relaxation of every&#xD;
muscle, it might have been death insteadof&#xD;
life on' which they gazed. To Mr. Ainslie&#xD;
himself, Mrs. Leo was the first one to utter&#xD;
a direct inquiry bearing upon the state.&#xD;
" Good heavens! how frightful it loQk5!"&#xD;
she cried, with a shudder. "Mr. Ainsile-.-&#xD;
of course I don't mean to doubt your word&#xD;
-but are you 8U70 there is no danger in&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Danger, my dear madam?" said Ains~&#xD;

&#xD;
MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
asked Miss Lee to submit to the experi-&#xD;
ment?'~&#xD;
"But she looks so dreadfully. Make her&#xD;
do something, say something, to show that&#xD;
she is aliVe."&#xD;
"I am not at all sure that I can," said&#xD;
Ainslie, looking at Conway, who was lean-&#xD;
ing over the back of the chair, close to the&#xD;
place where Mabel's head rested. "I am&#xD;
entirely an amateur; and this result is al-&#xD;
most as unexpected to me as to any one else.&#xD;
However, I will try. What shall I ask&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
Conway, at whom he was looking, an-&#xD;
swered before Mrs. Lee could speak.&#xD;
"Ask her, my dear fellow, what was&#xD;
the fortune prophesied by the cards a little&#xD;
while ago."&#xD;
Ainslie changed color-all the curious&#xD;
lookers-on noticed that-and hesitated for a&#xD;
itioment.&#xD;
"You would only have my word for the&#xD;
accuracy of her reply," he said at last. "I&#xD;
-you better ask something which would be&#xD;
a more satisfactory proof, Phil."&#xD;
"I will take your word concerning the&#xD;
accuracy," said Conway in his easy way,&#xD;
which could yet be a very obstinate way,&#xD;
"and this proof will be quite satisfactory&#xD;
enough. Ask her, Ralph-I insist upon&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"But it is nonsense," persisted Ainslie.&#xD;
'~ The fortune was no fortune at all. I made&#xD;
a mistake in the calculation, and it came to&#xD;
nothing; I told you that!&#xD;
t' Yes, you told me that," said the other,&#xD;
dryly. "I am not a member of the honor-&#xD;
able corps of marines, however, and I knew&#xD;
better! Come, make haste-Miss Lee will&#xD;
wake up if you wait much longer."&#xD;
"Ask her, Mr. Ainslie!" criQd the vex&#xD;
populi. "You must ask her!"&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie shrugged his shoulders as he&#xD;
had shrugged them several times before,&#xD;
gave Conway a glance which did not savor&#xD;
overmuch of gratitude, and then turned to&#xD;
Mabel. When he asked the question, she&#xD;
answ4~red at once, but in a dreamy voice,&#xD;
aa of one who replied from some far-off&#xD;
region.&#xD;
"The combinations were peculiar," she&#xD;
said. "Three times the same result was oh-&#xD;
&#xD;
tamed. The prophecy was of impending&#xD;
trouble, and an early, tragical death."&#xD;
"Is that true?" said Conway, in a low~&#xD;
tone to Ainslie.&#xD;
"It is quite true," answered the other.&#xD;
"I did not like to tell her the result after&#xD;
those stories you had been relating-but,&#xD;
queerly enough, she has hit upon iii."&#xD;
"Was she right? Is it true?" asked&#xD;
those around, eagerly. When they heard&#xD;
that it was true, something like an awe set-&#xD;
tled upon them. The superstition latent in&#xD;
human nature asserted itself immediately.&#xD;
The tone of the unconscious girl had been&#xD;
more even than her words. Jesting gave&#xD;
way to gravity, and the least impressionable&#xD;
could not resist a feeling that she had been&#xD;
reading her own doom in that strange, un-&#xD;
impassioned voice. Folly? Yes, folly, of&#xD;
course, and very dangerous folly, but yet&#xD;
folly to which we are all exceedingly prone.&#xD;
Then they had been wrought up by such&#xD;
gradual degrees that they were really not&#xD;
very much to blame. Some ladies grew&#xD;
pale, others shuddered, and. the general im-&#xD;
pression seemed to be that Mabel had bet-&#xD;
ter be roused. Mr. Seyton, however, inter-&#xD;
posed.&#xD;
"One moment," said he. "You are&#xD;
sure there is no suffering in the state?"&#xD;
"Perfectly sure, but, if you desire it, I&#xD;
can ask herself."&#xD;
He turned back again, and put the ques-&#xD;
tion. It was ans~vered at once in the nega~&#xD;
tive.&#xD;
"I feel strangely happy; strangely at&#xD;
rest," Mabel reiterated. "There seems to&#xD;
be a sea of light and sweet odor around ~ne.&#xD;
It is only when you lay your hands on me,&#xD;
as you are doing now, that I feel the cold,&#xD;
wavering flame flickering up and~1own."&#xD;
"But the flame is not painful?"&#xD;
"No; only strange."&#xD;
"Do you object to remaining in the state&#xD;
a little longer?"&#xD;
-" No; not in the least."&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie looked round at his host.&#xD;
"Are you satisfied, sir?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Sufficiently satisfied to ask you to give&#xD;
us one more proof of magnetic influence, be-&#xD;
fore you rouse her," Mr. Seyton answered.&#xD;
"I have heard, or read, that a mesmerist5&#xD;
&#xD;
by the mere exercise of his will, can sum-&#xD;
mon his subject to him from any distance.&#xD;
Show us that, and we will credit your phe-&#xD;
nomenon."&#xD;
"I will do it," said Ainslie.&#xD;
This time he did not qualify his words&#xD;
by adding, "I will try;" for it was evident&#xD;
that the realization of his own power was&#xD;
coming to him by degrees, and that he now&#xD;
felt little or nothing of the doubt and un-&#xD;
certainty he had experienced at first.&#xD;
"I will do it," he said; and his eyes&#xD;
brightened, and a fiu~h rose over his face at&#xD;
the proposal.&#xD;
"Come, then," said Mr. Seyton, "come&#xD;
everybody-we will go to the library and&#xD;
see if he can summon her."&#xD;
NobodAy spoke a dissenting word, for ex-&#xD;
citement and interest were now at their&#xD;
height. Only Constance declared her in-&#xD;
tention of remaining behind with her sister,&#xD;
and was accordingly left.&#xD;
The rest proceeded to the library, which&#xD;
was on the same floor, and made one of the&#xD;
suite of the drawing-room. Several apart-&#xD;
ments intervened, however, so that the test,&#xD;
if it succeeded at all, would be very com-&#xD;
plete. There was some confusion when&#xD;
they entered, for only a single shaded lamp&#xD;
burned on one of the tables, diffusing a sort&#xD;
of mellow moonlight which made the tran-&#xD;
sition from the brilliantly-lighted rooms&#xD;
through which they had passed, almost that&#xD;
of darkness: but, after a while, their eyes&#xD;
grew accustomed to the demi-obseure, and&#xD;
they found that they could see each other&#xD;
with perfect distinctness. They all grouped&#xD;
themselves about the room in various pc~si-&#xD;
tious; but, immediately beside the table,&#xD;
Ainslie took his stand4&#xD;
"Be perfectly quiet now,'~ he said, ad-&#xD;
dressing the company in general. And then&#xD;
he raised his hand in the attitude of his first&#xD;
pass, and fixed his eyed intently on the&#xD;
closed door-fixed them so intently, so&#xD;
steadily, with such burning power, that&#xD;
Miss Nina Eston told Mr. Harding in a whis-&#xD;
per that she was sure he saw through it.&#xD;
Several minutes of profound silence fol-&#xD;
lowed, during which the mesmerist did iiot I&#xD;
move even as mt~ch as a muscle, and every I&#xD;
eye in the room ifras eagerly and anxiously&#xD;
&#xD;
TAKING&#xD;
&#xD;
COUNSEL.                            4L&#xD;
turned toward the door. Would it prove a&#xD;
failure at last? Would she remain uninfin-&#xD;
ejiced? No. Hark! was it not a light step,&#xD;
a faint rustle, an advancing movement?&#xD;
Almost as they asked themselves the ques-&#xD;
tion, and doubted in their own minds&#xD;
whether their nerves were not sufficiently~&#xD;
excited foi~ them to imagine any thing, the&#xD;
door suddenly opened wide, and there on&#xD;
the threshold, with. the same strange, sleep~&#xD;
waking gaze, stood Mabel Lee!&#xD;
Everybody present looked at his or her&#xD;
neighbor, and then back again to the mes-&#xD;
merized girl, in speechless astonishment.&#xD;
Then, before the hush was broken by even&#xD;
one word, a slender figure passed Mabel,&#xD;
and touched Mr. Ainslie's arm.&#xD;
"I cannot bear it! It is too awful I"&#xD;
Constance said. "Wake her-wake her!"&#xD;
"We will take her back to the dining-&#xD;
room first," he answered, quietly. "Jt will&#xD;
be better to rouse her there."&#xD;
"I will take her back, if you please."&#xD;
"No you must stand away, Miss Lee,&#xD;
-she will follow no one but me."&#xD;
A few minutes later he was making the&#xD;
reverse passes, while Governor Eston looked&#xD;
on good-humoredly.&#xD;
"It is my turn next," lie said. "I am&#xD;
curious to know if you will get the better&#xD;
of me."&#xD;
But he was destined not to be gratified&#xD;
by this knowledge; for just then Mabel&#xD;
began to move in a natural manner. After&#xD;
a moment she sat upright, and looked round&#xD;
her with a wild, bewildered stare, which&#xD;
lasted until her glance fell on Ainslie. Then&#xD;
she gave one shuddering cry, and sank back&#xD;
fainting into Constance's arms.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
TAKING COUNSEL.&#xD;
MANY days elapsed after this before any&#xD;
~ne saw Mabel's face beyond her chamber-&#xD;
loor. She was borne out of the room in an&#xD;
Lnsensible condition that night, and, a week&#xD;
Later, her mother and sister were still de~&#xD;
;ained with her at Seyton House. For, in&#xD;
;ruth, she was ill, as people of exquisite or~&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8069-00000022"/>&#xD;
42                              MA~W~ii&#xD;
ganizations alone can be -prostrated in&#xD;
mind and body, thoroughly unstrung and&#xD;
almost ehildish in the nervous terrors that&#xD;
beset her-terrors so fan6ful and so con-&#xD;
tinual, that only the utmost care was able&#xD;
to prevent their assuming the form of de-&#xD;
lirium.&#xD;
"It is nothing but that miserable foolery&#xD;
which is the ~ said the doctor, too&#xD;
angry to be very careful in the selection of&#xD;
terms. "I am not surprised at your moth-&#xD;
6r, Miss Constance, but I am surprised at&#xD;
you. You ought to have known your sis-&#xD;
ter's temperament better than to have al-&#xD;
lowed such a thing. You certainly ought&#xD;
tQ be aware that you can't tamper with her&#xD;
as you can with other pe~le. Or, if you&#xD;
do, by George, madam, you'll simply end by&#xD;
putting tier in a lunatic asylum!"&#xD;
"But doctor, how could I think-"&#xD;
Constance began, only the doctor was al-&#xD;
ready gone, fretting and fuming as he went.&#xD;
Like all the rest of the Ayre people, he&#xD;
loved Mabel as his own child; and it enraged&#xD;
him to see how little her nearest friends un-&#xD;
derstood the care with which she should be&#xD;
treated.&#xD;
"They seem to forget all about her fa-&#xD;
ther," he said to his wife, when he was de-&#xD;
~cribing her illness and its cause - "they&#xD;
seem to forget all about her father; and&#xD;
they seem to know nothing whatever about&#xD;
herself, or her peculiar organization. 11cr&#xD;
silly mother might be excused; but Miss&#xD;
Constance "-and that was the point to&#xD;
which he always came back. Poor Con-&#xD;
etance bad a good deal to bear during those&#xD;
days of ~Eabel's continued illness - the&#xD;
-doctor's censure, her mother's reproaches,&#xD;
Mr. -Seyton's nervous anxiety, Mr. Ainslie's&#xD;
self-blame, and, above all, her own doubts&#xD;
and fears. But then she was formed to&#xD;
bear all sorts of things, and it is to be hoped&#xD;
it did not go very hard with her, there-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
At last, however, Mabel came forth to&#xD;
the outer world, herself once more, although&#xD;
it was a very pale and drooping self, with a&#xD;
strangely nervous manner, and a shade of&#xD;
terror in her eyes, the first time she was&#xD;
~or~ed to meet Mr. Ainslie, and hear his&#xD;
earnest apologies and self-reproaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
i ij.ulIi.                                                                                 TAKING COUNSEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It was really nothing-only I was so&#xD;
very foolish," she said; and then she es-&#xD;
caped from him, as soon as she possibly&#xD;
could, being glad of an interruption even&#xD;
from Mr. Harding.&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie watched her as she moved&#xD;
away, with an expression of great chagrin&#xD;
on his face; and then he turned to Con-&#xD;
stance. They were all together, on the ter-&#xD;
race, and he had nothing to do but move&#xD;
toward the balustrade where she was lean-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"I am afraid your sister will never for-&#xD;
give me for that unhappy blunder of mine,&#xD;
he said, inca tone of deep self-vexation. "I&#xD;
wish-I wish I could do something to con-&#xD;
vince her how deeply I regret it."&#xD;
"Indeed you are mistaken," Coiistance&#xD;
said, earnestly. "Forgive you! she does&#xD;
not attach the least blame to you. How&#xD;
could she? Sh~ only blames herself; and&#xD;
if she rather avoids you-"&#xD;
"She does, undoubtedly."&#xD;
"It is only because you are associated&#xD;
with the recollection of her sufferings-not&#xD;
because there is any question of her forgiving&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"I shall never forgive myself;~~ be said,&#xD;
with evident sincerity-and then he added&#xD;
nothing more, but stood looking down into&#xD;
the clear water far below, and scarcely&#xD;
heeding, as it seemed, the light ripple of -&#xD;
talk and laughter around him. Mabel's re-&#xD;
appearance had made a great change in the&#xD;
atmosphere at Seyton House, and the spirits&#xD;
of its inmates. Mrs. Lee relapsed from a&#xD;
state of actively injured feeling, into one&#xD;
that was merely passive. Mr. Seyton was&#xD;
fairly radiant with pleasure, and the trio of&#xD;
gentlemen guests all betokened satisfaction&#xD;
-each in his own way. Mr. Harding&#xD;
showed bus, in solemn and verbose con-&#xD;
gratulations; Mr. Ainslie in freely-ex-&#xD;
pressed relief and self-reproach, and Mr.&#xD;
Conway in an intangible change of manner&#xD;
and appearance, which was easily to be ob-&#xD;
served, but hardly to be described. Nobody&#xD;
had taken much notice of him or his state&#xD;
of feeling, while Mabel was sick; but, if&#xD;
they had done so, they would have found&#xD;
that his concern was much more sincere&#xD;
and unaffected than could have been ex-&#xD;

sharply. " I was a fool to trust you, per- "My dear, how you jar one's nerves!"&#xD;
baps; but you certainly assured me Aliat said her mother, petulantly.&#xD;

benefaction of the age. It will supersede terrace, lightly vaulted over the balustrade,&#xD;

"Humbug!" concluded the other, turn- "How could you do it?" she cried, ig-&#xD;

my part, I shall never know a quiet con-&#xD;
science again until you assure me of your&#xD;
forgiveness for my share in that wretched&#xD;
"I have nothing to forgive," Mabel&#xD;
answered, very much as she answered Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie; but ah! in such a different tone.&#xD;
"I was foolish, that was all. It is I who&#xD;
ought to beg everybody's pardon, for the&#xD;
trouble and commotion I caused."&#xD;
"Everybody's pardon is freely granted,&#xD;
with everybody's heart," he said, gayly.&#xD;
"But ought you to be out here without any&#xD;
wrapping?"&#xD;
"Oh, I think so. The evening is so beau-&#xD;
tiful."&#xD;
"Is it not? As I came down the river&#xD;
I thought I had never seen any thing more&#xD;
perfect than the whole effect of time and&#xD;
scene. Will you let me row you a little&#xD;
way? I am sure you would enjoy it."&#xD;
"I am sure of it, too. But mamma&#xD;
would never consent."&#xD;
"Why not? There's nothing the matter&#xD;
with the evening, I'm sure. It is as charm-&#xD;
ing as the first of June ought to be; and-I&#xD;
am determined you shall go.-Harding, my&#xD;
dear fellow, if you will bring Miss Lee a&#xD;
scarf from the house, we may allow you to&#xD;
accompany us."&#xD;
Mr. Harding was so entirely taken by&#xD;
surprise, that for the moment he had no&#xD;
excuse ready, so he walked away, in search&#xD;
of the desired scarf, while Mabel looked ye-&#xD;
~roachfully at her companion.&#xD;
"You have given Mr. Harding that&#xD;
trouble for nothing," she said. "ThKey will&#xD;
never let me go."&#xD;
"Indeed I am not sure of that," an-&#xD;
swered he. "I am just going to try my&#xD;
power of persuasion on Mrs. Lee."&#xD;
"It is scarcely worth while; for Con-&#xD;
stance will make her say no."&#xD;
"Perhaps it is to Miss Lee, then, to&#xD;
whom I should appeal?"&#xD;
Mabel shook her head with a laugh.&#xD;
"That would be quite useless. Con-&#xD;
stance is not to be moved-even by your&#xD;
persuasions.&#xD;
"If you say that, I shall certainly try&#xD;
it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you in earnest I"&#xD;
"Yes, for I am sure you will fail.'~&#xD;
"That savors of a challenge," he said.&#xD;
And he forthwith took himself over to Con-&#xD;
stance. He returned shortly, however, look-&#xD;
ing decidedly crestfallen.&#xD;
"Miss Lee is adamant," he said~ "Tam&#xD;
sorry, for we would enjoy it very much;&#xD;
and there is really not the least danger of&#xD;
your taking cold. However, let us go and&#xD;
look at the Brazilian plant. There is no&#xD;
doubt of your being allowed to do that, I&#xD;
suppose I"&#xD;
"No," replied Mabel, with a little laugh;&#xD;
and they strolled away in the direction of&#xD;
the gardens.&#xD;
They had scarcely disappeared, when Mr.&#xD;
Harding returned, laden with a large shawl&#xD;
which he had taken, in despair, from one&#xD;
of the hall-tables; and which would quite&#xD;
have sufficed to smother Mabel.&#xD;
"What! have they gone?" he cried,&#xD;
looking round him as he came out, and&#xD;
missed two faces from the circle.&#xD;
"Conway and Miss Lee have gone, if&#xD;
that is what you mean," said Mr. Ainslie,&#xD;
carelessly. "What are you going to do&#xD;
with that shawl?"&#xD;
"They sent for it-Miss Lee sent for it,&#xD;
'that is. Where is she? In the boat i"&#xD;
"In the boat! No, of course not. She&#xD;
has gone to the garden."&#xD;
"To the garden! But she said she was&#xD;
going on the river."&#xD;
* Mr. Ainslie laughed. They were a little&#xD;
apart from th~ others, so he could say pretty&#xD;
much what he pleased without fear of being&#xD;
overheard.&#xD;
"My dear fellow," he said, "a man of&#xD;
your age is not surely just beginning to learn&#xD;
that to say one thing and mean another, is&#xD;
quite second nature with women. If Miss&#xD;
Lee said that she was going on the river,&#xD;
no doubt she meant that she was going in&#xD;
the garden."&#xD;
"Hurnph 1" (with something of a&#xD;
growl~, "I suppose Conway persuaded her."&#xD;
"No doubt Conway did."&#xD;
"Confound him!" said Mr. Harding, in&#xD;
a~very far from evangelical tone; and then&#xD;
he walked away~&#xD;
Now, before proceeding further, it may&#xD;
&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
44                          MABEL LEE.                                                               TAKING COUNS~L.                      45&#xD;
&#xD;
be as well to state that Mr. Harding ha&#xD;
heard from his Phifer and Crane friend&#xD;
the rumor which gave Mr. Seyton credi&#xD;
for intending to find an heir for his estat&#xD;
and a husband for his goddaughter at th&#xD;
same time and in the same person, and tha&#xD;
he believed it. Indeed, to him, as to th&#xD;
Ayre world, nothing seemed more likely&#xD;
Everybody knew how richly the master ol&#xD;
Sexton House would endow Mabel Lee, ii&#xD;
family honor did not stand in the way&#xD;
And what, therefore, could be more prob&#xD;
able than that he desired to give her th&#xD;
heritage in the only practicable manner, hI&#xD;
making her the wife of one of his nephews&#xD;
In reality, such an idea had never once en&#xD;
tered Mr. Seyton's head. But the world it&#xD;
which h~ lived gave him credit for it, and,&#xD;
what was more to the purpose, Cyril Hard.&#xD;
ing did so likewise. Having once iuiide up&#xD;
his mind that this was his uncle's intention,&#xD;
he was not long in also making up his mind&#xD;
to strain every nerve to win Mabel's favor;&#xD;
since Mabel's favor was an essential condi-&#xD;
tion of heirship. Of course it is unnecessary&#xD;
to say that all of Mr. Harding's grandilo-&#xD;
quent professions of desiring his cousin's&#xD;
success, had been but lip-deep; and that in&#xD;
reality he would scarcely have hesitated 'at&#xD;
any means short of actual dishonesty, to ob-&#xD;
tain the rich heritage which he had so long&#xD;
been taught to expect. From his earliest&#xD;
infancy, two things had been sedulously in-&#xD;
stilled into his mind: one was dislike and&#xD;
distrust of his cousin, Philip Conway; the&#xD;
other, a longing to be master of Seyton&#xD;
House. "My brother is a very eccentric&#xD;
man in some respects," his mother would&#xD;
loftily say, "but he is not lacking either in&#xD;
sense or principle, and he will never hesitate&#xD;
between a high-minded Christian gentleman,&#xD;
and a card-playing adventurer, like my&#xD;
sister Adela's unfortunate son." in this&#xD;
view of the case, the high-minded Christian&#xD;
gentleman entirely coinAded; and although&#xD;
he was a good enough sort of man in his&#xD;
way, and after the fashion of his narrow-&#xD;
minded class, yet the desire for this inherit-&#xD;
ance had so taken possession of him, that&#xD;
Philip Conway, adventurer though he was,&#xD;
might, in comparison, have been esteemed&#xD;
almost disinterested. No doubt the latter&#xD;
&#xD;
d was sufficiently a man of the world, and had&#xD;
s suffered keenly enough the most real forms&#xD;
.t of pecuniary difficulty and destitution, to&#xD;
e appreciate fully all the advantage~ that&#xD;
o would result from the possession of what&#xD;
t seemed his natural heritage, but his was&#xD;
o not a mercenary nature, and mercenary cal-&#xD;
culationa were simply impossible to him.&#xD;
Money was an excellent thing in his opin-&#xD;
ion, and well worth having,, for all the&#xD;
pleasure and freedom it would bring; but&#xD;
- money, for mere money's sake-the gay,&#xD;
reckless philosophy of the man knew liter-&#xD;
ally nothing of such a thing. "My poor&#xD;
boy," his mother would sometimes say,&#xD;
when creditors were particularly unpleasant,&#xD;
or something else had gone wrong, "per-&#xD;
haps some day all this will end-perhaps&#xD;
somo day you will be master of Seyton&#xD;
House."&#xD;
"I would not advise you to count on It,&#xD;
* madre mia," the young soldier of fortune&#xD;
would reply. "My uncle will hardly ever&#xD;
trust his rich acres to my hands. And in-&#xD;
deed I do not think I should know n~yself&#xD;
if I were metamorphosed into any thing half&#xD;
so staid and respectable as the master of&#xD;
Sexton House."&#xD;
He began to think, however, that ho&#xD;
might know himself, and feel his circum-&#xD;
stances to be very pleasant, as he walked by&#xD;
Mabel Lee's side, down the broad garden-al-&#xD;
leys, with luxuriant shrubs, and trim-clipped&#xD;
hedges on either side, with the bright&#xD;
June sunshine slanting over the flower-beds,&#xD;
and making the river a stream of molten&#xD;
gold, with the stately old house behind him,&#xD;
and the broad fields of the Seyton heritage&#xD;
stretching away far as the eye could reach.&#xD;
Yes, it was a happy, peaceful spot of earth,&#xD;
and for once the charm of pastoral beauty&#xD;
and content entered even into his restless,&#xD;
wayward heart. For a while he forgot the&#xD;
reckless adventure, the hard play and fast&#xD;
habits that had made his life, and thought&#xD;
to himself that the man whom Mabel Lee&#xD;
should love, and whom Mr. Sexton should&#xD;
make his heir, need ask no better fate.&#xD;
Cyril Harding was thinking the same thing,&#xD;
about the same time; but it was in a differ-&#xD;
ent way, and with the two conditions re~&#xD;
versed.&#xD;

TAKING COUNSEL.&#xD;

40                          MAflEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Ainslie was devoting&#xD;
himself to the amusement of Mr. Seyton&#xD;
and his two lady guests, and bringing those&#xD;
fascixjating qualities, for which everybody&#xD;
gave him credit, into such conspicuous re-&#xD;
lief; that even Constance was thoroughly&#xD;
charmed. Perhaps he knew this a's well as&#xD;
she did, for when the 'two elders began to&#xD;
complain of the ~'iver-mist1 and adjourned&#xD;
into the drawing-room, where Mr. Harding&#xD;
Was 'already sulking by himself; he asked&#xD;
her' to remain on the terrace awhile.&#xD;
'~ I will not detain you long," he said, as&#xD;
she assented, "though I really think they&#xD;
are mistaken about the mist.' Perhaps you&#xD;
may find it chilly, though. Shall I get you&#xD;
a shawl?"&#xD;
"Thank you, no. I do not think it at&#xD;
all chilly, but very delightful."&#xD;
"Yes, very delightful," he said, a little&#xD;
absently. Then, after a moment, he went on&#xD;
quite abruptly: "Miss Lee, I am about to&#xD;
ask and be guided by your advice, in a diffi-&#xD;
culty which is troubling m~; and, lest you&#xD;
should think that such a declaration sounds&#xD;
rather presumptuous, I shall begin by say-&#xD;
ing that it concerns your sister-partly, at&#xD;
least."&#xD;
"I am all attention," Constance an-&#xD;
swered, smiling slightly, for she could not&#xD;
imagine what this opening prefaced. "Any&#xD;
thing that concerns my sister interests me,&#xD;
of course. And even if not-well, I hardly&#xD;
think I should consider you presumptuous."&#xD;
"I am afraid you will consider me fool-&#xD;
ish, then," he said, "for in truth my diffi-&#xD;
oulty in' of my own making~.~.-an4 by no&#xD;
means great. Briefly, then, you may have&#xD;
heard that Mr. Sexton is anxious for me to&#xD;
paint a likeness of his goddaughter, and&#xD;
that Iconsented, or rather proposed to do&#xD;
so.',&#xD;
Yes, Constance said; she had heard it.&#xD;
"Well," Mi'. Ainslie went on, "the diffi-&#xD;
culty is simply this: will not the fulfilment&#xD;
of that promise cost your sister a great deal&#xD;
of annoyance? I am afraid she cannot&#xD;
cease to connect me with that unfortunate&#xD;
experiment, and the suffering it caused, so I&#xD;
scarcely feel as if I should be acting well-&#xD;
as if; indeed, I should have any right-to&#xD;
force myself upon her in the connection&#xD;
&#xD;
which this would necessitate. Yet I am&#xD;
very anxious to gratify :Nfr. Seyton, and to&#xD;
return in some sort his kindness. So it is&#xD;
simplycome to this: I cannot decide myself;&#xD;
and I am constrained to ask you to do so.&#xD;
You know your sister, and you know&#xD;
whether her prejudice is invincible, so you&#xD;
can best say whether or not I shall resign&#xD;
the attempt, or persevere."&#xD;
He paused, evidently waiting for her to&#xD;
speak; but Constance scarcely knew how&#xD;
to do so. She appreciated his difficulty, and&#xD;
felt sorry for him; but she could not say&#xD;
that she thought Mabel's prejudice likely to&#xD;
be overcome, or that the portrait-painting&#xD;
would not be a great trial to her. But there&#xD;
was Mr. Seyton to be considered, as well as&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie himself; in short, she felt what&#xD;
she had often felt before in more important&#xD;
matters, that the web of life has a great&#xD;
many threads, and that some of them are&#xD;
exceedingly difficult to manage.&#xD;
"Indeed, I am doubtful what I ought to&#xD;
say," she answered at length. "I might as&#xD;
well be frank with you, and acknowledge&#xD;
that you are not mistaken in thinking that&#xD;
* Mabel still associates you with the experi-&#xD;
ment which had such an unfortunate effect&#xD;
on her. But, further than that, I do not&#xD;
know. Whether or not this association will&#xD;
continue, I cannot say. But I am almost&#xD;
sure it will yield in time, and-and-"&#xD;
"You would counsel me to try?"&#xD;
"Yes; I would counsel you to try. *She&#xD;
is so gentle that she does not know what&#xD;
resentment is; and the vague terror which&#xD;
is connected with you now cannot surely&#xD;
last. At least this is my opinion, and it&#xD;
would be a great pity to disappoint Mr.&#xD;
Seyton."&#xD;
"Yes, it would be a great pity," he said,&#xD;
musingly. And then he was quite silent,&#xD;
and stood looking across the river toward&#xD;
the distant blue hills, the outlines of which&#xD;
melted into the soft summer gloaming.&#xD;
Constance watched him, scarcely under-&#xD;
standing the half-wistful expressing of his&#xD;
face; but thoroughly vexed with Mabel for&#xD;
the unreasonable prejudice ~nd caprice&#xD;
which had placed him in such a position.&#xD;
"Mr. Ainslie," she said at last, with a&#xD;
sudden impulse, "I really think you mag-&#xD;
&#xD;
nify the extent of Mabel's feeling-I at&#xD;
almost sure of it. I have never spoken t&#xD;
her on the subject, but I will do so, and-'&#xD;
"iNo," he interrupted quickly, "pra;&#xD;
don't attempt that. I would not like fo&#xD;
Miss Lee to put any compulsion on herself&#xD;
as far as I am concerned, and I believe tha&#xD;
is the only effect produced by remonstranc4&#xD;
in such a case."&#xD;
"I have no intention of remonstrating,'&#xD;
Constance answered. "I only mean to asl&#xD;
Mabel which is right, you or I. If I an&#xD;
right, your difficulty is at an end, for sh&#xD;
will be very willing to gratify her godfather~&#xD;
by sitting to you."&#xD;
"I hope so, for Mr. Seyton's sake," he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
And there the matter ended-at least&#xD;
between these two. But Constance called&#xD;
Mabel to account that night, and after infi-&#xD;
nite difficulty extorted a promise that she&#xD;
would submit to the ordeal.&#xD;
"But you have very little idea of how I&#xD;
dread it, or how I shrink from that man,"&#xD;
Mabel said. "I'll do it, darling, if you say&#xD;
I must; but I scarcely think I can do it cor-&#xD;
dially."&#xD;
"Then you had better not do it at all,"&#xD;
Constance answered, more shortly than she&#xD;
often spoke to Mabel. "If you behave un-&#xD;
graciously about it, you will only make the&#xD;
matter one of prolonged discomfort to Mi'.&#xD;
Ainslie; and he feels badly enough about&#xD;
your dislike and avoidance now. Mabel, it&#xD;
is not like you to act so unkindly and so un-&#xD;
reasonably."&#xD;
"Unkindly! unreasonably!" repeated&#xD;
Mabel, who was sitting ~Ialf undressed on&#xD;
the side of the bed, with her bright golden&#xD;
hair all about her like a cloud. "I-I never&#xD;
thought that any one could consider-in-&#xD;
deed, dear, I never thought at alL I have&#xD;
no dislike to Mr. Ainslie-when I am away&#xD;
from him. I feel toward him just as I&#xD;
might toward any other indifferent stranger.&#xD;
l~ut when I see him, and hear him talk, a&#xD;
repugnance comes over me which I could&#xD;
not control if my life depended upon it."&#xD;
"A repugnance of what sort?"&#xD;
can I tell? It is a 'desire to rush&#xD;
away from him at any cost, which makes&#xD;
me think that there must be more fear than&#xD;
&#xD;
a simple dislike in it. The very glance of his&#xD;
0 eye seems to have an influence over me, like&#xD;
-like that night. Constance-"&#xD;
"Well, dear?" said Constance, who be-&#xD;
r gan to feel a little uneasy, as she saw how&#xD;
the pupils of Mabel's eyes dilated.&#xD;
t "He could do what he pleased with&#xD;
~ me," said Mabel, in a half whisper. "That&#xD;
is what frightens me so. Constance, when-&#xD;
ever I am in his presence, I feel it coming&#xD;
over me-that awful powerlessness, which&#xD;
-"-but I cannot talk of it. Darling, I think I&#xD;
should go crazy, I really do, if I were much&#xD;
with him. Don't ask me to sit to him. I&#xD;
could not."&#xD;
Constance made no reply fur a moment.&#xD;
She was leaning against the toilet-table,&#xD;
looking at her sister very grhvely, and in&#xD;
truth much undecided about her next words.&#xD;
Francis I~Towell often warned Constance&#xD;
that Mabel was too much humored in the&#xD;
nervous fancies to which she was prone, and&#xD;
th&amp;amp;t a sterner course of treatment would be&#xD;
better for her health of mind. Big, on the&#xD;
other hand, the doctor's caution came back&#xD;
to her recollection, together ~v'ith a vague,&#xD;
shadowy fear that had always lain at her&#xD;
own heart-the fear of her father's fate.&#xD;
Judgment, however, inclined very much to&#xD;
Mr. ~1"Towell's theory, and when at last she&#xD;
spoke, it was with somewhat severe empha-&#xD;
sis.&#xD;
"Mabel, this is childish folly. I beghi&#xD;
to believe that Francis is right. You yield&#xD;
to fancies of this kind, until you grow mor-&#xD;
bid. If you once made a resolute effort to&#xD;
overcome them, you could do ik"&#xD;
"You think I could ever learn to toler-&#xD;
ate Mr. Ainslie?"&#xD;
"I am sure of it. Indeed, why not?&#xD;
He is a frank, pleasant gentleman, who is&#xD;
deeply wounded by your resentment; for,&#xD;
remember, it looks like resentment. Once&#xD;
more, I must say that it is not like you to&#xD;
act so."&#xD;
"Well, then, I will try and not act so&#xD;
any longer," said Mabel, with a ~i~ful light&#xD;
in her eyes, which her sister reuii~embered&#xD;
long afterward. "Dear, you must ~forgive&#xD;
my fancies. Perhaps Franci? is right in be-&#xD;
lieving thatI might conquer them by reso-&#xD;

that I will sit to him."&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
PLAIN SPEAKING.&#xD;
"I WILL certainly tell him to-morrow,"&#xD;
had been Mabel's last words when she bade&#xD;
her sister good-night; and so it was her&#xD;
first waking sensation on that morrow, was&#xD;
one of the heavy weights with which we&#xD;
are all familiar when some disagreeable duty&#xD;
is to be performed. She opened her eyes&#xD;
with a start, as the first golden sunbeams&#xD;
slanted, through a half-closed blind, upon&#xD;
her face; and with the start came the recol-&#xD;
lection of this intangible something which&#xD;
was disagreeable. The next moment she&#xD;
knew what it was; she remembered that&#xD;
she~ had promised to tell Mr. Ainslie that&#xD;
she would sit to him, and dismay followed&#xD;
close uwn remembrance. "How can I ever&#xD;
do it?" she asked herself; and then she&#xD;
thought, "at all events, I must do it." Yes,&#xD;
she must do it. There was no question of&#xD;
that, but the certainty was enough to drive&#xD;
all further thought of, sleep from her. So&#xD;
she rose at once, and made her toilet. Then&#xD;
she threw open one of the windows and&#xD;
leaned out, drinking in the fresh beauty of&#xD;
the sparkling June morning, until a faint&#xD;
perfume of cigar-smoke, floating up from&#xD;
the terrace below, proved that some other&#xD;
member of the household had matutinal hab-&#xD;
its besides herself. She leaned over a little&#xD;
farther, and ascertained that this early riser&#xD;
was no other than the person of whom her&#xD;
thoughts were just then fall-Mr. Ainslie.&#xD;
Faithful to her instinct of dislike, she drew&#xD;
back. as soon as she recognized him. But&#xD;
th9n an impulse came suddenly upon her.&#xD;
Why not prove her new resolution, and the&#xD;
new strength of mind which she meant to&#xD;
practise, by going down to him, and getting&#xD;
oyer with the explanation at once? Poor&#xD;
Mabel! It was quite easy to ask the ques-&#xD;
tion, but very hard to answer it. She stood&#xD;
with her hands locked, pale, trembling, and&#xD;
altogether such a pitiful sight that, if Con-&#xD;
stance could only have seen her, she would&#xD;
&#xD;
never have urged, or even permitted, a sac-&#xD;
rifice at such a cost. There was some pow-&#xD;
er of self-discipline in the girlish nature,&#xD;
however, for, after a time, she took up her&#xD;
hat and resolutely tied it on, left the room,&#xD;
and, as if afraid her determination would&#xD;
fail, ran hastily down-stairs, and out of the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Whatever were the subjects of Mr. Ains-&#xD;
lie's morning meditations, he certainly was&#xD;
as much astonished as a man could possibly&#xD;
be when in turning at the end of the ter-&#xD;
race, where he was pacing to and fro, he&#xD;
saw Mabel advancing toward him. He&#xD;
stopped for a moment in sheer surprise,&#xD;
then he took his cigar from his lips, lifted&#xD;
his hat, and came forward.&#xD;
"So the morning has tempted you out,&#xD;
also, Miss Lee," he said. "Is it not charm-&#xD;
ing.?"&#xD;
"Very charming," Mabel answered; and&#xD;
the feeling of repugnance rushed over her&#xD;
so strongly that she could scarcely refrain&#xD;
from instantaneous retreat. "But it was&#xD;
not the morning that brought me out," she&#xD;
went on, quickly. "I-I wanted to speak&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"To me!" he repeated, and he could&#xD;
not help looking .a little surprised. "I am&#xD;
sure I need not say that I am very much&#xD;
honored and entirely at your service."&#xD;
"You are very kind," she said, and then&#xD;
she walked on, until she reached the balus-&#xD;
trade. There she stopped and turned, with&#xD;
a leok of resolution on her face which&#xD;
might have amused him at another time.&#xD;
"Mr. Ainslie," she said, simply, and yet&#xD;
with a great deal of dignity, "I think it is&#xD;
best to be frank about almost every thing.&#xD;
This is my excuse for speaking directly to&#xD;
yourself on a subject which you have never&#xD;
mentioned to me. My godfather told me,&#xD;
some time ago, that you had kindly offered&#xD;
to paint my likeness for him, and my sister&#xD;
told me last night that you hesitated to ask&#xD;
my permission to fulfil this promise, forfear&#xD;
of annoying me. Therefore I have come&#xD;
this morning to say that I appreciate your&#xD;
consideration in the matter very highly, but&#xD;
that I am quite willing to gratify my dear&#xD;
godfather, by sitting to you.'?&#xD;
The sweet, clear, girlish tones spoke&#xD;
&#xD;
every word distinctly, and then paused, or at least tolerate me, if you 'would only&#xD;
more as if she had said her say, and was try."&#xD;
over with it, than as if waiting 'for a reply. "I-I have tried," said Mabel, and she&#xD;
A reply came, however, quietly enough. looked like a penitent child in her distress&#xD;

"Well?" he said, smiling as she stopped,&#xD;
and seemed struggling with herself for a&#xD;
minute. He was an artist' by nature, and&#xD;
he was sure he had never seen any thing&#xD;
more lovely than she looked at that mo-&#xD;
ment-her lids downcast, her lips quiver-'&#xD;
ing, and the delicate color of her cheeks&#xD;
flushing more deeply every instant. "If I&#xD;
could only paint her so!" he thought to&#xD;
himself, and, as he thought it, she looked&#xD;
up at him with her frank, sweet eyes.&#xD;
"'I only want to~ say that I am very&#xD;
grateful for your kindness and courtesy,"&#xD;
she murmured, hastily. "I know how dif-&#xD;
ferently some people would act, and-and I&#xD;
am deeply obliged to you. It makes me&#xD;
very much ashamed of myself at my want&#xD;
of reason; but I will try to struggle against&#xD;
the prejudice, the folly of which' I see so&#xD;
clearly. If I do not finally succeed in lik-&#xD;
ing you, it certainly will not be your fault,&#xD;
nor,' I hope, mine either."&#xD;
A sudden impulse, more of self-reproach&#xD;
than of any thing' else, made her hold out&#xD;
her hand as she concluded, and he bent&#xD;
down and touched his lips to it. Fortu-&#xD;
nately, he did not see the quick shudder&#xD;
that ran over her frame, or the look' on hex&#xD;
face as he did so, as he said, earnestly:&#xD;
"Not mine, at least."&#xD;

he looked grave and dissatisfied, as he ss&#xD;
at'the foot of his pleasant breakfast-tabh&#xD;
&#xD;
while Mrs. Lee, who presided opposite, re-&#xD;
flected this discontent to the full. If Mr.&#xD;
Seyton wished her to remain permanently&#xD;
in his house, that desire was as nothing to her&#xD;
own regret that it was impossible for her to&#xD;
do so. It was the sort of position to which&#xD;
she was properly born, she thought; for&#xD;
Mrs. Lee had always been one of the people&#xD;
who fancy themselves entitled by right di-&#xD;
vine to the good gifts of Fortune, and i~esent,&#xD;
as an injury of the deepest dye, any adver-&#xD;
sity or misfortune. She had been well born&#xD;
and well reared, and possessed a not uncom-&#xD;
mon love of luxury, which made the stately&#xD;
appointments of the House very pleasant to&#xD;
her. She liked the grand rooms and lofty&#xD;
corridors, the silver plate and dainty china,&#xD;
the retinue of servants, to whom she needed&#xD;
only to say, "Do this," and it was done.&#xD;
Constance always said that it spoiled her&#xD;
mother to go to the House, and that she al-&#xD;
ways required several weeks to recover the&#xD;
effect of a prolonged visit. On the present&#xD;
occasion, Constance was in deep disgrace,&#xD;
for it was she and her tiresome pupils who&#xD;
were the cause of their leaving, when it&#xD;
* would have been so easy to spend a week&#xD;
or two longer on account of Mabel's health.&#xD;
"What would be the good, mamma?"&#xD;
Constance said, when this fact was quer-&#xD;
* ulously brought forward. "We have to go&#xD;
sooner or later, and why not now, as well&#xD;
as a week hence? For my part, I like a&#xD;
* disagreeable thing over."&#xD;
I "No doubt it is very easy to talk that&#xD;
I way," Mrs. Lee petulantly rejoined; "but&#xD;
- I don't see that there is any thing disagree-&#xD;
- able to you. Of course I have to suffer.&#xD;
- I always do-and Mabel, somewhat. -As&#xD;
I for you, however, I have no doubt you will&#xD;
r be delighted to get back to that horrid Ayre,&#xD;
5 and your horrid teaching."&#xD;
r "It is better to be at work, if work is to&#xD;
be done," Constance replied, and that, was&#xD;
Y all that she said, for long experience had&#xD;
i taught her the utter fruitlessness of attempt-&#xD;
r ing to argue with her mother. She persist-&#xD;
ed in saying she must go, however, and, as&#xD;
', her going meant going for all of them, Mrs.&#xD;
o Lee sat up at the breakfast-table that morn-&#xD;
Lt ing, and ate her muffins, like a martyr tied&#xD;
~, to the stake. "I suffer, of course; but that&#xD;

Meanwhile, Mr. Ainslie had somewhat "I am fond of boating myself, and still&#xD;
smoothed away the cloud from Mr. Seyton's more fond of Miss Lee's society," broke in&#xD;

"What a charming fits 4iamp~tro could&#xD;
be given here 1"&#xD;
"Picnics here are very common,", said&#xD;
Mabel. - "I have been to them often.-Do&#xD;
you remember the last one, Constance?"&#xD;
"I remember you were sick after it,&#xD;
from th~ combined effect of thin shoes and&#xD;
damp ground, if that is what you mean."&#xD;
"I don't mean that. But you know we&#xD;
all agreed that dancing on the ground was&#xD;
vet~y disagreeable, aad in wishing that god-&#xD;
papa w6uld build a ballroom for us."&#xD;
"I never heard of it," said Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
"If you wished it, Mab, why did you not&#xD;
telluse so? But as for the good people of&#xD;
Ayre - well, they may build their own&#xD;
ballroom, I think."&#xD;
"ft was more they than I who wished&#xD;
it, godpapa," Mabel said, with a laugh;&#xD;
"though it would be pleasant, undoubtedly;&#xD;
for, although 'dancing on the greensward is&#xD;
~'ery poetical in ideal, it is very tiresome in&#xD;
reality."&#xD;
~' Suppose I give your promised inidaum-&#xD;
nier.night's ball there?" said Mr. Sexton,&#xD;
half jestingly.&#xD;
"It would be delightful!" she cried;&#xD;
while Philip Conway repeated curiously:&#xD;
"Midsummer-night's ball. What do you&#xD;
taean?"&#xD;
"I meaa Mabel's fits-day," Mr. Sexton&#xD;
answered, with a glance that effectually&#xD;
stopped i~urther inquiry. "Midsummer-day&#xD;
l~ hett'east, and so we always celebrate it&#xD;
witt du6 honor.-I promised you a ball this&#xD;
year, did I not, Mab?"&#xD;
"Pndoubtedly you did," said Mabel,&#xD;
promptly; "and I shall see that the prom-&#xD;
ise i~ fulfilled. Now, an island-ball would&#xD;
ho rapturous."&#xD;
'-Re ltwghed, and yet, despite thee laugh,&#xD;
his f4ce grew grave, for this midsummer.day&#xD;
fete had? it~ own significance. Nobody had?&#xD;
eve1~ uotieed or celebrated Mabel's birthday&#xD;
4the.dtm~rWhich, besides being her birthday,&#xD;
.w~th~ annivereary of her father's death;&#xD;
and~thIs~~e5sit3t seemed so sad to Mr. Sey-&#xD;
tea, thiit,~ihei~ she was quite a little child,&#xD;
he inau~tirai±ed the custom of observing this&#xD;
othet~ da~ with till the cei~enioisie~ that usu-&#xD;
ally attend ~%rhat poets are fond of terming&#xD;
"the natal day." Presents were offered,&#xD;
&#xD;
MAWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
good wishes made, holiday festivities insti"&#xD;
buted, and such a gala air given the occa-&#xD;
sion, that, as time went on, Mabel positively&#xD;
began to count the years of her age fiom&#xD;
this date. She scarcely ever remembered&#xD;
that it was not in truth her birthday, and&#xD;
nobody cared to remind her of the fact.&#xD;
So, now that her eighteenth year was draw-&#xD;
ing to its close, she seemed as much as ever&#xD;
oblivious of it, and as much as ever deter-&#xD;
mined that her fits should make up her&#xD;
birthday shortcomings.&#xD;
"An island-ball would be rapturous,&#xD;
would it?" said Mr. Seyton. "But how&#xD;
could I build you a ballroom in such a short&#xD;
time?"&#xD;
"Oh! there is plenty of time, godpape,&#xD;
I am sure; and af4ts over there would be&#xD;
something quite unique-something differ-&#xD;
ent from a commonplace ~ball up at the&#xD;
House."&#xD;
"Something very uncomfortable, I am&#xD;
afraid," said Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
"Why so?" asked Conway. "It would&#xD;
be very easy to construct a pavilion for&#xD;
dancing, and then, with the undergrowth&#xD;
cleared away, and the trees hung with&#xD;
lamps, not to speak of a few arches and lire-&#xD;
works, a scenic effect might be obtained&#xD;
which would be very good.-Eh, Ralph?"&#xD;
"Very," said Mr. Ainslie. "I can fancy&#xD;
the lights gleaming over the water and the&#xD;
boats darting to and fro. It is a clever idea,&#xD;
Phil."&#xD;
"But a troublesome one," said Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton. And with that the matter might have&#xD;
ended, if he had not looked up at the mo-&#xD;
ment and seen the expression on Mabel's&#xD;
face. It was only the youthful, wistful long-&#xD;
ing for a new pleasure; but it touched the&#xD;
h~iart that had never yet denied her any eu~&#xD;
joyment which wealth or love could com-&#xD;
mand..&#xD;
"Look here, my fine fellow," said he,&#xD;
turning to Conway, with a smile, "this is,&#xD;
indeed, a very clever idea of' yours. But&#xD;
are you willing to take the trouble of car-&#xD;
rying it 'out? Will you attend to the ar-&#xD;
'rangertxents,~without bothering me about it,&#xD;
and furnish Blake with necessary plans and&#xD;
directions?"&#xD;
Philip Conway looked at Mabel, and he&#xD;
&#xD;
too, read aright the longing in her eyes.&#xD;
lie, too, felt that any exertion to gratify&#xD;
that longing would be well made.&#xD;
"Yes," he said, "I will undertake it&#xD;
with pleasure."&#xD;
"Then~" said Mr. Seyton, "I give you&#xD;
~xsrte lilanche for its fulfilment, with only&#xD;
this understanding, that I am not to be&#xD;
troubled. Give Blake your orders, and lie&#xD;
will carry them out-that is, if Mabel is in&#xD;
earnest in preferring thathor ball should be&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Indeed I am in earnest 1" cried Mabel,&#xD;
breathlessly. "It will be charming-it will&#xD;
be delightful. 0 godp~pa, how can I thank&#xD;
you enough?"&#xD;
"Thank Phil, not me," said Mr. Seyton,&#xD;
with a smile; and, before they finished dis-&#xD;
cussing and talking it over, the boat swung&#xD;
round at the foot of Mrs. Lee's garden,&#xD;
where there was a landing-place, and a&#xD;
flight of steps which led down to the Wa- I&#xD;
ter's edge.&#xD;
On these steps, at the present moment,&#xD;
Mr. Nowell was standing, ready to receive&#xD;
his aunt and cousins, but wifh an expres-&#xD;
sion the reverse of sunshine, when he saw t&#xD;
who was handing Mabel from the boat. It a&#xD;
did not mollify him in the l6ast that Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton and his guests made their adieux after&#xD;
the fairer portion of the cargo was fairly o&#xD;
disembarked, and, promising to see them C&#xD;
soon again, pursued their way to the town, tI&#xD;
Miss Lee's residence being in the suburb&#xD;
nearest the House.&#xD;
"Francis, you arc not looking ~ is&#xD;
Constance said, after the first greetings were si&#xD;
'over; "and you don't seem glad to see us, fa&#xD;
either. What is the matter?"&#xD;
"Nothing," answered Mr. Newell, a b&#xD;
little shortly. "And I suspect lam as glad gi&#xD;
to see you, Constance, as you are glad to get at&#xD;
back again. Mabel, in particular, looks&#xD;
overjoyed."                            te&#xD;
Mabel was standing at the head of the&#xD;
steps, swinging her parasol in-her hand, and wi&#xD;
gazing after the vanishing boat, as her cons- ta~&#xD;
in spoke.. She heard him, however, end&#xD;
turned round with a smile.              sh&#xD;
"Do I look overjoyed?" she asked. it.&#xD;
"Well, I'm uet exactly that; but I am very ho&#xD;

only been little more than a week since we&#xD;
went away, what a time it seems!"&#xD;
"A very charming tim~, iw doubt," said&#xD;
Mr. Newell, regarding her severely.&#xD;
"I thought time seemed short when it&#xD;
was charming," she returned~ "Come, I&#xD;
will not be scolded as soon as I return..&#xD;
You may be sure of one~ thing, sir-~-nobody&#xD;
ever was cross at Seyton House; and, if you&#xD;
don't want to make me wish myself back&#xD;
there, you had better smooth your face.&#xD;
"I am not an airy gallant, like Mr. Phil-&#xD;
ip Conway, Mabel."&#xD;
"Mr. Philip Conway is not an airy gal-&#xD;
lant, as far as I am aware," Mabel retorted.&#xD;
"He's a very pleasant gentleman; - and if&#xD;
you will behave yourself; and look moder-&#xD;
ately interested, I will tell you what he is&#xD;
going to do for me."&#xD;
"Going to do for you I Pray u~hat right&#xD;
bas he to do any thing for you?"&#xD;
"He has the right of being 4~ery agree-&#xD;

lignantly. "He is going to build a pavil-&#xD;
on on the island for myfite; and we are&#xD;
o have arches, and fireworks, and dancing,&#xD;

"Yes," said Mr. Newell, who did think&#xD;
fit, to his infinite disgust. "But is Mr.&#xD;

"No; of course not. It is godpapa who&#xD;

"The permission is scarcely necessary,&#xD;

"NoU8 ~er~ono," she said, nodding her&#xD;
head, and then she went away to the house,&#xD;
vanishing 'down the long green walk that&#xD;
led direct from the river-side to the back&#xD;
piazza,~while Mr. Nowell turned to his cous-&#xD;
in, who had stood by in amused silence.&#xD;
"She is worse spoiled than 'ever, Con-&#xD;
stance," he said, as if the spoiling was all&#xD;
Constance's fault. "I am sure I don't see~&#xD;
where it is to end."&#xD;
"It would end easily enough if you were&#xD;
kind instead of severe," Constance said.&#xD;
"Your constant censure does harm instead&#xD;
of good, Francis."&#xD;
"I know that nothing but indulgence&#xD;
does good in your eyes," he returned, as&#xD;
they walked 'on toward the house.&#xD;
Constance's few words had their weight,&#xD;
however, for he exerted himself to be more&#xD;
agreeable after he caine in, and did not even&#xD;
say any thing unpleasant when he heard of&#xD;
the portrait-painting, which was in itself a&#xD;
remarkable fact.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
F 0 ii E 5 H A D 0 w I N~G 5.&#xD;
"WzLL, Blake," said Mr. Sexton, "you&#xD;
have not told me yet what your decision is&#xD;
in the case of Conway 'V8. Harding,"&#xD;
Two or three weeks had elapsed when&#xD;
the master of Seyton House addressed this&#xD;
half-imghing question to his faithful friend&#xD;
and steward. They were alone in the li-&#xD;
brary, and had been deep in business foi&#xD;
sonie time, until Mr. Seyton pushed aside&#xD;
impatiently the balance-sheet for which hE&#xD;
entertained such a disgust, and changed thE&#xD;
subject in this way. He looked at BlakE&#xD;
with a great deal of amusement in his eyes~&#xD;
and scarcely understood the half-perplex&amp;amp;&#xD;
regard which Blake returned.&#xD;
"I take it you mean your nephews&#xD;
sir?" the latter said, after a pause.&#xD;
"~L'o be sure, I mean my nephews,~~ re&#xD;
plied Mr. Sexton, good-humoredly. "Wh(&#xD;
else. should I mean? Come, don't be stu&#xD;
pid-or obstinate, either! Confess yow&#xD;
&#xD;
prejudices and mistakes, and own up, like a&#xD;
good fellow, that you would rather burn the&#xD;
old house down, than see Cyril Harding&#xD;
master of it."&#xD;
"I'm no special friend of Mr. Harding's,&#xD;
sir," Blake answered; "but I could stand&#xD;
seeing him master as well as I could stand&#xD;
seeing anybody after you are gone. If it&#xD;
was Mr. Conway, now, you may be sure I'd&#xD;
rather put a torch to the old timbers."&#xD;
"So you are as obstinately set against&#xD;
him as ever&#xD;
"If you choose to put it in that wag,&#xD;
sir, yes-I'm as obstinately set against him&#xD;
as ever."&#xD;
"You used to be a reasonable man,&#xD;
Blake; if you are a reasonable man yet, you&#xD;
must have some ground for such a prejudice.&#xD;
What is it?"&#xD;
An awkward question that, for which&#xD;
Mr. Blake did not seem to possess any reply.&#xD;
He twisted a pen to and fro in his strong,&#xD;
brown fingers for some time, before he&#xD;
replied. Then it was quite abruptly:&#xD;
"I don't know that I could make you&#xD;
understand, sir, so perhaps we had better&#xD;
not talk of it. I gave my advice once, and&#xD;
you didn't take it; that's all. I have got no&#xD;
right to give it over again."&#xD;
"Not when I ask you?"&#xD;
"I'To, sir; not even when you ask me, if&#xD;
it will do no good."&#xD;
"That's as much as saying you have no&#xD;
reason to advance in support of it, then; for&#xD;
you know, if you 7&amp;amp;ad a reason, it would do&#xD;
good. If I have been deaf to you hereto-&#xD;
* fore, it was only because you had nothing&#xD;
* but prejudice to urge. Bring any thing&#xD;
else, and see if I do not pay attention to it."&#xD;
"I have nothing to bring, sir," said&#xD;
Blake, very doggedly-" nothing, that is,&#xD;
which you don't know yourself. You know&#xD;
what the captain was, and how the captain&#xD;
ended; and you might know, too, that the&#xD;
son is following exactly in the father's steps.&#xD;
So, if you choose to set aside these things, I&#xD;
have nothing else to bring."&#xD;
"Stop a moment," said Mr. Sexton.&#xD;
"Tell me what you mean by 'following ex-&#xD;
actly in the father's steps?"'&#xD;
"What should I mean, sir, only that&#xD;
just what the captain was when he cnme&#xD;
&#xD;
here first, Mr. Philip is now. The captain&#xD;
could talk of nothing but horses and races&#xD;
and billiards, and neither can Mr. Philip;&#xD;
the captain knew every jockey and gambler&#xD;
in the country, and so does Mr. Philip; the&#xD;
captain had never any thing but a sneer for&#xD;
any good man or any decent woman, and&#xD;
neither has Mr. Philip; the captain carried&#xD;
off a sweet lady, to her own misery and ruin,&#xD;
and so is Mr. Philip about to do."&#xD;
"What do you mean?" demanded Mr.&#xD;
Seyton, sharply, on whom this climax came&#xD;
like a thunder-clap.&#xD;
Mr. Blake looked at him in surprise.&#xD;
"Surely you know what I mean, sir;&#xD;
although, perhaps, it was not my place to&#xD;
mention it," he said.&#xD;
"Do you mean any thing about my god-&#xD;
daughter ?~"&#xD;
"I mean only this, sir: that day after&#xD;
day I meet Miss Mabel and Mr. Conway&#xD;
walking, or riding, or boating together, and&#xD;
I have begun to think that the county must&#xD;
be right when it says that your heir will&#xD;
also be her husband."&#xD;
"Does the county say that?"&#xD;
"It has said it a long while, sir."&#xD;
"But it' is not true. You know it is not&#xD;
true."&#xD;
"Ho~v can I know it, sir? Miss Mabel&#xD;
is an angel of beauty and goodness-but&#xD;
she's a woman, after all. And as to what&#xD;
Mr. Philip Conway is, you're only to re-&#xD;
member what the capital was when he car-&#xD;
ried off Miss Adela."&#xD;
"But it is impossible! "cried Mr. Seyton,&#xD;
who had grown very pale within the last&#xD;
few minutes-" it's impossible, I tell you.&#xD;
Mabel would not dream of such a thing-&#xD;
and her mother-her sister-pshaw! It is&#xD;
absurd."&#xD;
"Humph!" said Mr. Blake, dryly. "Do&#xD;
young ladies usually ask the permission of&#xD;
their mothers and sisters, before they fall&#xD;
in love? I beg your pardon, sir, if I am&#xD;
speaking too freely, but it seems to me you&#xD;
might have expected this."&#xD;
"Expected it!" repeated Mr. Seyton,&#xD;
with something of a gasp, and then he got&#xD;
up and walked disturbedly to and fro.&#xD;
"You are wrong, Blake; you're totally&#xD;
wrong," he said at last. "I am sure of&#xD;
&#xD;
* that. But, if you should be right, how&#xD;
shall I ever forgive myself?"&#xD;
It was on the end of Blake's tongue to&#xD;
say, "I warned you, sir,", but he forbore.&#xD;
If what he feared was true, Mr. Sexton's&#xD;
self-reproaches would need no point from&#xD;
him. If not-but, alas! how little could&#xD;
either of them discern that darker future&#xD;
which was to come, and which would make&#xD;
even this fear seem in the retrospect a&#xD;
blessed hope!&#xD;
"I believe we have finished with this&#xD;
business to-day," said Mr. Sexton, coming&#xD;
abruptly to the table, and putting the ac-&#xD;
counts away. "If you will ride over to-&#xD;
morrow, I will try and look at the rest.-&#xD;
By-the-way, how does the pavilion come&#xD;
on?"&#xD;
"Tolerably only, sir. Mr. Conway gives&#xD;
so many orders, and is so contradictory&#xD;
about them,"&#xD;
"Well, well, it will all come right, I&#xD;
dare say," interrupted Mr. Seyton, absently.&#xD;
~"You must excuse me if I leave you now."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, certainly. Indeed, I'm just&#xD;
going.&#xD;
"Good-morning, then."&#xD;
"Good-morning, sir."&#xD;
They shook hands, and Mr. Seyton left&#xD;
the room by one door, while Mr. Blake went&#xD;
out of another, which opened on a side&#xD;
piazza. The bright, warm noonday was&#xD;
somewhat dazzling after the subdued gloom&#xD;
of the library, and he pulled his hat soi~w&#xD;
over his brow that, as he went down the&#xD;
steps, he did not see Cyril Harding, who&#xD;
was ascending them, until they came face&#xD;
to face.&#xD;
Now, notwithstanding~the warmth with&#xD;
which Mr. Blake espoused this gentleman's&#xD;
cause, in his inmost heart he entertained no&#xD;
sort of fancy for him. It was a matter of&#xD;
choosing between two evils with him, and&#xD;
as Cyril Harding was, in his eyes, an in-&#xD;
finitely less evil than Philip Conway, he&#xD;
did battle manfully in his service. But, for&#xD;
all that, his regard for him was, scarcely&#xD;
more cordial than that of Mi~. Seyton. So&#xD;
he greeted him rather stiffly, and was by no&#xD;
means pleased that Mr. Harding chose to&#xD;
turn and 'accompany him to the front of the&#xD;
house,' where his horse was waiting.&#xD;

56                         MABEL LEE.                                                              FORESHADOWING.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How does the pavilion come on, Mr.&#xD;
t3lake ~" inquired this gentleman, repeating&#xD;
Mr. Sexton's question in a patronizing tone,&#xD;
which made Mr. Blake feel very savage in&#xD;
his inmost heart. "The 21st is very near&#xD;
at hand. I suppose you will surely com-&#xD;
plete it goon?"&#xD;
"I suppose so too, sir," said Mr. Blake,&#xD;
"if Mr.Conway will know his own mind.&#xD;
It is very hard on the workmen, this hav-&#xD;
ing to tear down and put up continually,&#xD;
and Mr. Conway changes his plans every&#xD;
day or tivo."&#xD;
"The last thing I heard of was the diffi-&#xD;
culty about Tonic columns," said Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing. "What is he after now?"&#xD;
"The Lord only knows. Some hea-&#xD;
thenish roof or other, that nobody ever saw&#xD;
the like of~ as far as I know. I went there&#xD;
yesterday, and the carpenters were all at a&#xD;
stand-still over it, while Mr. Conway wa~s&#xD;
not to be found high or low."&#xD;
"That's no uncommon thing," said Mr.&#xD;
Harding, with a grim sort of smile. "Mr.&#xD;
Conway rarely ~8 to be found, excepting&#xD;
when Miss Lee is at the House. I hope my&#xD;
uncle is pleased at the prospect of the alli-&#xD;
ance pending in that direction, Mr.. Blake?"&#xD;
"I am sure I cannot say, sir," replied&#xD;
Mr. Blake, who had no idea of being sub-&#xD;
jected to a pumping-process for Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing's benefit.&#xD;
"I scarcely feel able to congratulate&#xD;
Miss Lee on her prospects of happiness,"&#xD;
pursued the latter, who was evidently&#xD;
smarting from some fancied injury or re-&#xD;
pulse. "My cousin Philip's character is&#xD;
notorious; and, if my uncle is not aware of&#xD;
it, I think-I really think-that it is the&#xD;
duty of some friend to enlighten him."&#xD;
"I wonder that you do not take that&#xD;
duty upon yourself," said Mr. Blake, who&#xD;
every moment liked Mr. Harding less.&#xD;
"There are motives of delicacy," said&#xD;
Mr. Harding, solemnly. "Otherwise-but&#xD;
I am sure you understand. It is impossible&#xD;
for me to do it-quite impossible. Now,&#xD;
yota, Blake-"&#xD;
"Excuse me, sir," interrupted Mr. Blake,&#xD;
shortly-" I ~havo no talent for tale~bear~&#xD;
ing, even when I am able to vouch for the&#xD;
tales myself. Mr. Conway's habits do not&#xD;
&#xD;
concern me ;-nor, perhaps, Mr. Sexton,&#xD;
either.&#xD;
"Why?" asked Mr.. Harding, eagerly.&#xD;
"You think my uncle not likely to-to-.&#xD;
make him his heir?"&#xD;
"As for that, I am unable to hazard an&#xD;
opinion," answered the other, stiffly; "but&#xD;
I only know this, sir, Mr. Sexton is able to&#xD;
look after his own interests, and, if he can-&#xD;
not find an heir to suit him, he will, like as&#xD;
not, cut the matter short by leaving the&#xD;
property to Mien Mahel Lee. Good morn-&#xD;
lug, sir.&#xD;
"But, good Heavens! The entail! He&#xD;
dare not-" began the astonished Harding.&#xD;
But Mr. Blake was gone. He had&#xD;
mounted Brown Jerry as he uttered the&#xD;
last words, and he was now riding away at&#xD;
a sharp trot. "A precious pair," he mut-&#xD;
tered between his teeth, for he was in more&#xD;
of a fume than he would have liked to ac-&#xD;
knowledge - "a precious pair to choose&#xD;
between! No wonder the master can't&#xD;
make up his mind, when he has to take, a&#xD;
chanting prig like this, or a gambling adven-&#xD;
turer like the other. I'm glad I gave him&#xD;
that last shot. He'll not forget it soon,&#xD;
and, if it does nothing else, it'll make him&#xD;
uncomfortable."&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Scyton had gone to the&#xD;
room which was fitted up as a studio for&#xD;
Ainslie. It was a very pleasant apartment&#xD;
connecting with the drawing-room suite,&#xD;
and opening, like the library, on the ter-&#xD;
race; but lacking sufficient light to make it&#xD;
a good painting-room. The artist had obvi-&#xD;
ated this as well as he could, by placing his&#xD;
easel in the broadest glow of an uncurtained&#xD;
window; but, even with this arrangement,&#xD;
he found that he could do no work after&#xD;
mid-day. The light changed then in the&#xD;
most exasperating manner; so, necessarily,&#xD;
all of Mabel's sittings were in the morning.&#xD;
It was morning now, and she was on duty,&#xD;
draped about with a blue scarf of son~e&#xD;
light material, while her mother sat cro~&#xD;
cheating in one of the open windows, and&#xD;
Conway amused himself by playing critic-&#xD;
in.'chief. Ha was standing behind his frisnd,&#xD;
and sn animated discussion had for some&#xD;
time been goingon between them.&#xD;
"I maintain that the spirit of the thing&#xD;
&#xD;
is all&#xD;
wrono"' Conway was saying. "Y(&#xD;
may talk about exactness of feature ai&#xD;
clearness of tint as much as you pleas&#xD;
Ralph; but expression is, after all, tI&#xD;
main point, and there you have failed e&#xD;
tirely. You may not believe it, for you a&#xD;
wonderfully set up in your own opinion, bi&#xD;
it is a fact, nevertheless."&#xD;
"I don't know that I am set up in m&#xD;
own opinion," said Ainslie, painting awa&#xD;
very coolly, "but you are not infallible&#xD;
I'hil, in art, any more than in any thin&#xD;
else. I don't agree with you; I think I hay&#xD;
caught Miss Lee's expression perfectly."&#xD;
"What! that woe-begone face and mar&#xD;
tyr-like nose? It might serve as a concept&#xD;
tion. of Iphigenia, but for her-my dear fel&#xD;
low, you must be blind. Now, if I had beci&#xD;
in your place, I should have painted her ac&#xD;
cording to one's idea of Titania-&#xD;
'With childhood's starry graces lingering yet,&#xD;
r the rosy orient of young womanhood."'&#xD;
"I paint her as she seems to me," an&#xD;
swerved the other, retreating a step or twc&#xD;
back from his canvas. "If ever I san&#xD;
Miss Lee's face in my life, I see it there,'&#xD;
he went on; "and as for the expression-&#xD;
you don't know what you are talking about,&#xD;
Phil. That expression is, above all others,&#xD;
the one which is most natural to her face."&#xD;
"I know better," returned the other, ob-&#xD;
stinately. "I have eyes, and they are as&#xD;
good eyes as yours, though I can't put down&#xD;
their expression in red and white.-Will you&#xD;
come and see which of us is right, Miss Ma-&#xD;
bel?"&#xD;
But Miss Mabel only smiled and shook&#xD;
her bead.&#xD;
"I should not know," she said. "No-&#xD;
body can judge of her own likeness-and,&#xD;
besides, I should get out of position."&#xD;
"Mrs. Lee, will you come?" asked the&#xD;
injured artist, turning to his only other&#xD;
witness, for Mr. Seyton had not yet ap-&#xD;
peared. "Will you come and say who is&#xD;
right?"&#xD;
Mrs. Lee came, rather reluctantly, for&#xD;
she knew as much of art as if she had been&#xD;
reared amollg the Xaffre; and looked at the.&#xD;
picture from a safe distance, with head a&#xD;
little on one side.&#xD;
&#xD;
)u "It is like Mabel," she said, "wender-&#xD;
id fully like her. I don't see how yomt ever&#xD;
e, managed it so well, Mr. Ainslie. The 'hair&#xD;
me is hers exactly, and the color in her cheeks&#xD;
a- is as like as life. Then the eyes-"&#xD;
.e "My dear madam, how about the cx..&#xD;
it pressing?" interrupted Ainslie. "Do you&#xD;
think it is too pensive, too sad?"&#xD;
y "It is very sad," said Mrs. Lee, doubt-&#xD;
y fully. "But I have often seen Mabel look&#xD;
~, just that way, especially when she was&#xD;
g asleep."&#xD;
e "And it is said that the face always as-&#xD;
sumes the natural expression in sleep," said&#xD;
Ainslie, looking triumphantly at Conway'.&#xD;
-"I hope you are satisfied now, Phil."&#xD;
-     "Not at all," returned    the  other.&#xD;
i "Here's my uncle; we'll refer the matter&#xD;
- to him. You are just in time, sir, to decide&#xD;
an important.jjuestion between Ainslie and&#xD;
myself-no less a questioum than whether&#xD;
Miss Mabel is to appear on hi~ canvas as a&#xD;
type of all the despairing maidens who ever&#xD;
- looked unutterable woe since the beginning&#xD;
of the world, or whether she is to be her&#xD;
own bright self. For my part," continued&#xD;
he, with emphasis, "I hate woc-begone&#xD;
faces, and I don't 'know any class of people&#xD;
bhave less sympathy with than the class of&#xD;
Mariannas in their moated granges."&#xD;
"I am perfectly willing that you should&#xD;
judge between us," said the artist, address-&#xD;
ing his host; and he moved aside, to surren-&#xD;
der the best stand-point.&#xD;
Mr. Seyton uttered an exclamation whezi&#xD;
he came in front of the painting; and then&#xD;
stood still for some minutes, regarding it&#xD;
silently. It was a singularly beautiful con-&#xD;
ception, and, apart from all question of like..&#xD;
ness, one whIch proved the artistic power&#xD;
and artistic culture of the hand that had&#xD;
produced it. Yet it was very simple. Only&#xD;
a half-length, and painted without back-&#xD;
ground or accessories, or any of the ordi-&#xD;
nary surroundings of a portrait. Instead of&#xD;
these, the canvas was covered with fleecy&#xD;
white clouds, out of which Mabel'sface shone&#xD;
like a star-her blue mantle thrown lightly&#xD;
over her head inahood-like fashion, f*tstened&#xD;
at the throat by a single golden clasp, and&#xD;
falling all around her, so that the waving&#xD;
outlines of the figure could only be dinal.y&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8069-00000030"/>&#xD;
58&#xD;
&#xD;
MABEL LEE-.&#xD;
&#xD;
perceived beneath its folds. The effect was&#xD;
exquisite. The golden hair, half waved,&#xD;
half curled round the broad, white, child-&#xD;
like brow, and then was plainly put back&#xD;
behind the ears, while the eyes, "like wood-&#xD;
land violets newly wet," looked forth with&#xD;
that sweet sad regard which all her life long&#xD;
had distinguished them. Instead of this ex-&#xD;
pression being confined to the eyes, the ar-&#xD;
tist had caused it to pervade the whole face,&#xD;
until every feature was tinged with the&#xD;
same subtle melancholy; and even her lips~&#xD;
in place of wearing their accustomed smile,&#xD;
were closed with a grave pathos, and the&#xD;
hands lightly clasped together over the&#xD;
breast increased the resemblance, which al-&#xD;
most any one would have remarked at first&#xD;
sight, to the Madonnas of the Italian school&#xD;
-to the sweet divine grace of the star-&#xD;
crowned Queen~of Heaven, as it shines upon&#xD;
us from the canvas of those great masters&#xD;
wh~ were of purer faith, as well as of&#xD;
greater genius, than any who have trod in&#xD;
the footsteps which they made immortal.&#xD;
It was Mabel Lee, but Mabel Lee ethereal-&#xD;
ized into a beauty deeper than the mere&#xD;
beauty of flesh and blood; it was Mabel Lee&#xD;
shining out of her clouds and her azure&#xD;
drapery like a vision of some tender virgin&#xD;
saint, as we picture it to ourselves, some&#xD;
loving, pitiful heart, that is smitten by the&#xD;
sin and suffering of earth, and whose sadness&#xD;
is for the fettered lives and sordid spirits of&#xD;
others, rather than for the self that has&#xD;
learned a~l wisdom, all science, all knowl-&#xD;
edge, human and divine, in two words-&#xD;
"Surau)n corda."&#xD;
* Whether Mr. Seyton saw all of this or&#xD;
not, nobody could tell; but he was silent a&#xD;
long time. Then he spoke without looking&#xD;
round.&#xD;
"It is exquisite, Mr. Ainslie, far more&#xD;
beautiful even than I had expected. Did&#xD;
3rou ask me for my opinion? I have noth-&#xD;
ing to offer but admiration."&#xD;
"I asked for your opinion, sir," said&#xD;
Conway. "I begged to know if you do not&#xD;
agree with me that, however beautiful it&#xD;
may be, it is a false conception of Miss&#xD;
Mabel's face."&#xD;
* "It looks like a saint or a Madonna,"&#xD;
said Mr. Seyton, smiling; "but I cannot&#xD;
&#xD;
find fault with that, Phil. I:hava s~e'i t~l~at&#xD;
expression on Mabel's face very~ oftan, I&#xD;
saw it this morning in church." *&#xD;
"And I saw it the first time I ever ~w&#xD;
her," said Ainslie. "I have painted ac~&#xD;
cording to my light. If it don't suW you,&#xD;
Phil, you will have to paint 4ne for your7&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"I should paint a woman and not a&#xD;
saint, then," returned Conway, impatiently.&#xD;
*" There may be too much of a good thing,&#xD;
Ralph. Miss Mabel* has quite as many&#xD;
angelic attributes at present as she has any&#xD;
need of."&#xD;
"I work according to my inspiration,"&#xD;
repeated Ainslie. Whereuponhe went back&#xD;
to his canvas, and began touching, with&#xD;
light, sweeping strokes, the folds of the blue~&#xD;
mantle.&#xD;
He painted steadily for some time; and&#xD;
they were all quite silent-Mr. Seyton's ad-&#xD;
vent, and the cloud he unconsciously brought&#xD;
along with him, having put an end to the&#xD;
pleasant flow of talk and laughter which&#xD;
had been going on previously to his en-&#xD;
trance. For perhaps it was Philip Con-&#xD;
way's invariable presence in the studio, per-&#xD;
haps it was the fact that Mr. Ainslie decid-&#xD;
edly improved on acquaintance, or perhaps&#xD;
it was only the pleasant occupation of&#xD;
knowing that her features were coming&#xD;
out one by one under the artist's brush, but&#xD;
Mabel had become quite reconciled to the&#xD;
sittings; and, although the portrait had al-&#xD;
ready been in progress some time, and was&#xD;
yet far from completion, she had never been&#xD;
heard to express impatience or wonder&#xD;
concerning the delay.&#xD;
"I think Ralph dallies over it, because&#xD;
he means to go as soon as it is finished,"&#xD;
Philip Conway once exclaimed. And yet&#xD;
the explanation was scarcely necessary, for&#xD;
nobody concerned (excepting Mr. Nowell,&#xD;
and he could hardly be said to be con-&#xD;
cerned) found fault with this procrastina-&#xD;
tion-Mr. Sexton least of all. He cordially&#xD;
liked his guest, was glad of any excuse to&#xD;
detain him, and would have submitted&#xD;
uncomplainingly to almost any privation&#xD;
which brought Mabel to the house every&#xD;
day.&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie had painted for about half&#xD;
&#xD;
FORESHA&#xD;
&#xD;
tw1i~utyaud, tired of the dulness which had&#xD;
settled eyer~them, Philip Conway had saun-&#xD;
tered a~ay, when the former suddenly&#xD;
glanw4~ ropnaN and saw that Mabel was&#xD;
1~okiii~ tired.&#xD;
at~on~t let me detain you any longer,&#xD;
Miss Lee," he said, kindly. "I shall not&#xD;
need you again to-day; and, although your&#xD;
patience is perfect, I should not like to tax&#xD;
i1~ too far."&#xD;
"You never do, Mr. Ainslie," answered&#xD;
Mabel, rising. "It i~ my fault, not yours,&#xD;
that I have grown n little weary to-day.&#xD;
Mamma, I am ready."&#xD;
"But you will wait for luncheon," said&#xD;
Mr. Seyton, throwing aside the paper he&#xD;
had taken up.&#xD;
"1N9,"jsaid Mrs. Lee, a little plaintively.&#xD;
"I am sorry I cannot. Did you say you&#xD;
were ready, Mabel? We must go, Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton, for the Boyds are to dine with me to-&#xD;
day; and, although I don't consider them&#xD;
company, still-"&#xD;
"Still we must go," said Mabel, decid~&#xD;
edly. And she put on her hat.&#xD;
"I think I shall accompany you home,"&#xD;
said Mr. Seyton, rising as he spoke. "These&#xD;
young men have had quite a monopoly of your&#xD;
society lately; and everybody knows that&#xD;
turn about is only fair play.-Toll Phil so,&#xD;
if he comes, Mr. Ainslie," he added, nod-&#xD;
ding carelessly to that gentleman.&#xD;
"There is really no necessity, Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton," began Mrs. Lee; but Mr. Seyton in-&#xD;
terrupted her in his courtly way.&#xD;
"You won't deny me the pleasure, I am&#xD;
sure, my dear madam.-Mab, you can dis-&#xD;
pense with a young gallant for once, can&#xD;
you not? Besides, I want to stop at the&#xD;
island and see for myself how the prepara-&#xD;
tions come on. Are you ready?"&#xD;
With a briglit smile Mabel assented, and&#xD;
her godfather was more than pleased to see&#xD;
that there was not even a shade of disap-&#xD;
pointment on her face. "It was all an idea t&#xD;
of Blake's," he thought. And the relief con- t&#xD;
sequent upon feeling this was so great that&#xD;
he attended the two ladies down to the boat t&#xD;
in even more than his usual spirits.&#xD;
The reverse was strikingly the case with a&#xD;
Philip Conway, however, when he entered o&#xD;
the studio half an hour later, and found no- 'tJ&#xD;
&#xD;
DOWINGS.                            59&#xD;
*body but Ainslie, who was still hard at&#xD;
work.&#xD;
"Where are they all? Where's ~fiss&#xD;
Lee?" he asked, quickly. "Surely they&#xD;
have not gone home without me?"&#xD;
"That is exactly what they have done,"&#xD;
said his friend, coolly. "You ought to have&#xD;
stayed, mon ami, if you wanted to look after&#xD;
your interests."&#xD;
"But how was I to fancy they would&#xD;
treat me this way? And you-you might&#xD;
have let me know, Ralph."&#xD;
"There was nothing to let you know,"&#xD;
the other answered, with a shrug. "V~tre&#xD;
onclo interfered, and carried them off, much&#xD;
against the fair Mabel's wishes, I imagine.&#xD;
He bade me tell you that turn about is fair&#xD;
play, if that is any consolation to you."&#xD;
"My uncle," repeated Philip Conway.&#xD;
"The deuce! What does that mean, I&#xD;
wonder? Do you know I fancied that he&#xD;
looked rather-rather queer, when he came&#xD;
in a while ago?"&#xD;
"He looked rather out of sorts; but&#xD;
what of that?"&#xD;
"Only that he may have been hearing&#xD;
some pleasant story or other about my&#xD;
many virtues and good deeds; and that, per&#xD;
cbnsequence, he thinks it a measure of pre-&#xD;
caution to guard his pet lamb from such a&#xD;
wolf."&#xD;
"A guilty conscience-you know the&#xD;
rest," said Mr. Ainslie, giving a dash of&#xD;
paint on Mabel's golden locks. "Don't bo&#xD;
~bsurd, Phil. Who would ho have heard&#xD;
my thing from?"&#xD;
"My precious cousin for one."&#xD;
"BahI he would not dare to speak, for&#xD;
~iis own sake."&#xD;
"That obstinate old Blake for another."&#xD;
"And how would he know any, thing?"&#xD;
"He is keen enough, and prejudiced&#xD;
~nough, to ferret out every ugly story that&#xD;
~ver was afloat against me, and how many&#xD;
here are, and have beep, I don't need to&#xD;
ell you."&#xD;
"hTo," said Ainslie, dryly. "But I can&#xD;
ell yon that you make a great mistake in&#xD;
thinking your uncle would listen to any gos.-&#xD;
ip of the sort. He is a gentleman of the&#xD;
ld school, and so thoroughly imbued with&#xD;
he nobleBse-oklif/e theory that to do~'auy&#xD;

&#xD;
thing underhand would be an impossibility&#xD;
to him. Besides, are you so much set upon&#xD;
this inheritance that you should fly off at a&#xD;
tangent because he' happens to look a little&#xD;
grave? That's rather a change from your&#xD;
old philosophy."&#xD;
"Yes~"said Conway, absently. He threw&#xD;
himself back in the chair where Mabel had&#xD;
been sitting, and there was silence in the&#xD;
room for several minutes, for Ain~lie painted&#xD;
steadily on and waited for the other to speak,&#xD;
which the other did not do for some time.&#xD;
~" The devil's in it," he said at last, ab-&#xD;
ruptly. "You'd scarcely think it, Ralph,&#xD;
but the devil certainly must be in it. You&#xD;
are right about my old philosophy, and it&#xD;
was a very genuine philosophy too. I&#xD;
scarcely eared a cent about the Seyton in-&#xD;
heritance during~cll these years, or, indeed,&#xD;
when I came here. But now-I wonder if&#xD;
it c~u be that fellow, Harding, who has in-&#xD;
feeted. me with his own overwhelming de-&#xD;
sire, or if it is simply the wish to win the&#xD;
race against him?"&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie looked at him with a sort of&#xD;
dry, sarcastic smile.&#xD;
" So that's all you know about it?" he&#xD;
said. "My good fellow, the secret of the&#xD;
~natter is neither the Harding rivalry nor&#xD;
your own uewly-cThveloped mercenary spirit;&#xD;
but simply and solely-this."&#xD;
He pointed his brush at Mabel Lee's&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right," answered the&#xD;
other, nowise discomposed or taken aback.&#xD;
"The master of Seyton House might afford&#xD;
to indulge himself in the luxury of a wife,&#xD;
pretty, charming, and penniless. But, for a&#xD;
poor devil like me, it would be unqualified&#xD;
madness, you know."&#xD;
"So: you are conducting your love-affair&#xD;
bn the prospects of heirship?"&#xD;
"I'm not conducting a love-affair at all;&#xD;
I'm not such a fooL You might as well&#xD;
talk to ~'&amp;amp; starving man of eating turtle and&#xD;
drinking tokay. I am simply living in the&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
"It is tobe hQped that Miss Lee is doing&#xD;
th~ same."'&#xD;
At these words a dark cloud came over&#xD;
Ctrnway's face.&#xD;
"That's the misgiving I have myself,"&#xD;
&#xD;
he said. "Sometimes-just now, ~for in-&#xD;
stance-I feel as if I were acting like a&#xD;
scoundrel. But what can I do? If I go&#xD;
away, I leave this d-d fellow, Harding, in&#xD;
possession of the field, and so throw aw~iy&#xD;
my only chance of fortune; while, as long&#xD;
as I stay-"&#xD;
The pretty fooling is bound to go on,&#xD;
said his friend philosophically. "Yes, I see&#xD;
that. But look here, Phil, does it never&#xD;
strike you that perhaps your best chance of&#xD;
the fortune would be to secure the fair Ma-&#xD;
bel at once? Her godfather could hardly&#xD;
steel his heart against the future husband;&#xD;
or (if you are bent on a bold coup) the pres-&#xD;
ent husband of his pet."&#xD;
"I said a moment ago that I felt like a&#xD;
scoundrel," answered Conway, shortly-&#xD;
"but I have no mind to be one, Ralph.&#xD;
Now, I should call that scoundrelism of the&#xD;
deepest dye. I don't pretend to indifference&#xD;
on the sul~ject of the heirship; I do want&#xD;
it; and I don't pretend to love Mabel Lee&#xD;
like a paladin, or like any thing else hut an&#xD;
ordinary man; hut I love her well enough not&#xD;
to use her as a stepping-stone to fortune."&#xD;
"Ab, I see; you've turned Quixote by&#xD;
way of variety."&#xD;
"Devil a bit of it, as you know perfectly&#xD;
well. But a. man is not necessarily a scoun-&#xD;
drel because he is an adventurer. I leave&#xD;
the first to my distinguished cousin."&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;
"Nothing, except that I doubt if he&#xD;
would consider means very much where&#xD;
Seyton House was at stake."&#xD;
"You had better look out, then."&#xD;
"I had better not pay him any such&#xD;
compliment. Let him do his best, or-his&#xD;
worst. If there is any thing that I can resent&#xD;
openly, you may he sure that I will do so;&#xD;
but if not-you would scarcely advise me&#xD;
to play the spy."&#xD;
"The matter stands thus, then," said&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie, throwing a cloth over his easel,&#xD;
preparatory to leaving it,, and dropping the&#xD;
subject of Mr. Harding very abruptly, "If&#xD;
you are lucky enough to be chosen hy your&#xD;
uncle as his heir, you wifl offer yourself to&#xD;
Miss Lee; if not-"&#xD;
"I shall go back to the old life, iirnl&#xD;
leave her to my cousin Cyril," answered&#xD;
&#xD;
the other, rising. "'To him that hath shal&#xD;

CUAPT1~R XI.&#xD;
~~LK A GONDOLA.~7&#xD;
'Thu very deuce may have been to pay&#xD;
at the ishind; but at least the question of&#xD;
payment did not trouble Mr. Conway long.&#xD;
That very afternoon his skit? swung round&#xD;
to its moo$ng at the foot of Mrs. Lee's gar.&#xD;
den; and, five minutes later, he stood at the&#xD;
door of a pretty rose and clematis arbor,&#xD;
within which a small table and some chairs&#xD;
were placed, and where Constance and Mabel&#xD;
generally sat after the mid-day heat abated.&#xD;
They were sitting there now, and both&#xD;
of them looked up with a smile of welcome&#xD;
as he made his appearance, for it had come&#xD;
to pass; without any one exactly knowing&#xD;
how, that he filled quite an intimate posi-&#xD;
tion in the Lee household. Why, it would&#xD;
be hard to say, excepting that he, and the&#xD;
like of him, generally obtain more than&#xD;
their due portion of woman's favor and sym-&#xD;
pathy, for both of which some plainer and&#xD;
more honest fellow goes begging. It will&#xD;
be remembered, however, that Mabel had&#xD;
been his advocate before she ever saw him,&#xD;
and inthis she did little more than echo the&#xD;
family opinion, for Mrs. Lee had once been&#xD;
intimate with Mrs. Conway, when that lady&#xD;
was Miss Seyton, and she did not forget this&#xD;
any more than she forgot the charming&#xD;
manners and distinguished appearance of&#xD;
that unfortunate gentleman whom Mr.&#xD;
Blake styled "the captain," and never&#xD;
mentioned without a grim sort of disap-&#xD;
proval. Like many of her sex, Mrs. Lee&#xD;
was decidedly liberal to the failings of other&#xD;
women's husbands, and could not conceive&#xD;
that the trifling matter of being a spend-&#xD;
thrift and adventurer, and next thing to&#xD;
ii swindirr, could possibly overbalance the&#xD;
handsomest face and most perfect manner I&#xD;
&#xD;
~l she had ever seen~ so her tone concerning&#xD;
I Captain Conway was invariably one of miii-&#xD;
gled pity-as for a hero unjustly maligned&#xD;
-and exalted admiration. "The most fas-&#xD;
cinating person in the world," she. would&#xD;
say. "0 my dears, if you had only seen&#xD;
him! It is true, you see Mr. Conway; but&#xD;
I assure you he is only a faint reflection of&#xD;
his father. Very charming, I grant you,&#xD;
and'~very much of an improvement on the&#xD;
young men of the day. But not to be com~&#xD;
pared, oh, not at all to be compared to the&#xD;
captain." "I hope he is an improvement&#xD;
- on the captain, as well as on the young men&#xD;
of the day, in some respects," Constance&#xD;
would answer, gravely, at which Mrs. Lee&#xD;
always gave a little cry of expostulation.&#xD;
"For shame, my dear! You have been&#xD;
hearing some of these horrid stories about&#xD;
him. I assure you, and I know all about it~&#xD;
that there was not a word. of truth in them4&#xD;
No one could have known Captain Conwt~y,&#xD;
and believed them, Constance." "Yes,&#xD;
mamma," Constance would answer absent~&#xD;
ly; for she was wondering the while if her&#xD;
own partiality for Philip the Second rested&#xD;
as entirely on the foundation of his mere&#xD;
personal fascinations, as did that of her&#xD;
riiother foi' Philip the First. "I hope I like&#xD;
him for himself-I hope I am no~ mistaken&#xD;
in liking him; I really believe he, has good&#xD;
qualities, under all his recklessness and care-&#xD;
lessness," she thought earnestly, more ear-&#xD;
nestly than she would have liked to ac-&#xD;
knowledge. as she saw Mabel's eloquent&#xD;
ey~es and flushing cheeks; for Mabel rarely&#xD;
spoke in these discussions, save by her eyes&#xD;
and cheeks; yet nobody ever seemed to&#xD;
doubt that she too was a firm Conway par-&#xD;
tisan.&#xD;
"Ladies fair," said the much-canvassed&#xD;
gentleman, as he paused before them, framed&#xD;
in the door of the arbor, and looking like a&#xD;
young cavalier, with the flickering sunlight&#xD;
falling in patches on his black curls and&#xD;
graceful' figure-" who is ready. for a row?&#xD;
My boat is on the shore, and the river is&#xD;
smooth as glass. Miss Lee, I am sure Misi&#xD;

Constance looked up from her~sewi~g.~-.&#xD;

MABEL LEE.                                                              "IN A GONDOLA."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are very kind, Mr. Conway, but I&#xD;
am afraid my answer must be the invariable&#xD;
no. I would like to go very much, but-"&#xD;
"But what? " askcd Mabel, as she&#xD;
paused. "Really, dear, I see no earthly&#xD;
reason why you should not go this evening.&#xD;
That work can very well wait, and there are&#xD;
no cakes to make for tea, nor any thing&#xD;
else, that I know of."&#xD;
"Pray, Miss Lee, think again," said&#xD;
Conway; and it was the highest possible*&#xD;
compliment to Constance's sweetness and&#xD;
charms, that he was perfectly sincere in the&#xD;
request. "I want to take you both over to&#xD;
the island, and ask your advice about the&#xD;
pavilion, which threatens to prove a failure.&#xD;
I am afraid my first essay as an architect is&#xD;
by no means a success. Ainslie laughs at&#xD;
it, and says nothing fit to be seen will ever&#xD;
come of it; but I think he may be mistaken,&#xD;
and I want your advice."&#xD;
"You want us to agree with you, that&#xD;
is," said Constance, smiling again. "Well,&#xD;
I will come, if you think me worth waiting&#xD;
for a little while. I must see Nancy first."&#xD;
"We think you worth waiting for any&#xD;
time at all," he answered, as he moved aside&#xD;
to let her pass.&#xD;
"I Won't be long," she said, as she van-&#xD;
ished from sight; but, if she had only known&#xD;
it, there was no question of the length or&#xD;
shortness of time with the two she had left&#xD;
behind her. Hours were scarcely counted&#xD;
in the garden of Eden; and once, at least,&#xD;
in life, we all of us wander in that blessed&#xD;
place. Yet to the profane ears of outsiders&#xD;
their conversation might have seemed very&#xD;
commonplace, after all, being only this:&#xD;
"I see you have been reading," said&#xD;
Conway, advancing into the arbor, and tak-&#xD;
ing Constance's vacant chair. "What is&#xD;
it? Ah, my Browning, is it not?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Mabel, with a blush&#xD;
and &amp;amp; smile, that always went together&#xD;
when she spoke to him. "It is your Brown-&#xD;
ing, though I can scarcely say that I have&#xD;
been reading it. The fact is, Mr. Conway,&#xD;
I-I'm afraid I'm very stupid; but I don'1&#xD;
understand it."&#xD;
"You are not necessarily stupid on thai&#xD;
account, I assure you," said Conway, with&#xD;
laugh. "A great many wise people fail ts&#xD;
&#xD;
comprehend Mr. Browning. He is a new*&#xD;
poet, with a new style, which I confess I do&#xD;
not like, though Ainslie raves over it. Some&#xD;
of the beauties don't lie too deep for com-&#xD;
prehension, though, and it was these I rec-&#xD;
ommended to you."&#xD;
~tYes, I know, and I have enjoyed them&#xD;
very much. You see it is the Dramatic&#xD;
Lyrics I have here. I tried 'Sordello' this&#xD;
morning, but-"&#xD;
"But you came to grief shortly? No&#xD;
wonder. I pity you sincerely if you even&#xD;
tried it. I wish you could hear Ainslie read&#xD;
some of these," he added, as he took up the&#xD;
volume. "His elocution is perfect; and I&#xD;
cannot imagine a more difficult test than&#xD;
this wonderfully involuted metre. You&#xD;
would scarcely believe it, perhaps, but he&#xD;
absolutely brings out the sense sometimes."&#xD;
"Does he? Then I should like to hear&#xD;
him. But you, Mr. Conway-I am sure you&#xD;
also read well."&#xD;
"Why do you suppose so?"&#xD;
She gave a little laugh.&#xD;
"I can scarcely tell, excepting that your&#xD;
voice is very musical. Let me hear whether&#xD;
I am right or wrong. Read something."&#xD;
"Read what?"&#xD;
"Whatever the page is open on."&#xD;
He smiled.&#xD;
"To hear is to obey," he said. And&#xD;
then he began those quick, ringing verses:&#xD;
~ You know we French stormed Ratisbon;&#xD;
A mile or two away,&#xD;
On a little mound Napoleon&#xD;
Stood on our storming day."&#xD;
He read well, certainly; with very per-&#xD;
fect taste and just emphasis; but Mabel be-&#xD;
gan to feel a little disappointed, and fancy&#xD;
she had, after all, mistaken the capability of&#xD;
expression in the voice, the depths of passion&#xD;
and energy which she had expected to find&#xD;
there, when he came to the last verse:&#xD;
"The chief's eye flashed; hut presently&#xD;
Softened ltseg as sheathes&#xD;
A film the mother.eagle's eye&#xD;
When her bruised eaglet breathes.&#xD;
'You're wounded I' 'Nay,' his sol4ler's pride,&#xD;
Touched to the quick, he saki:&#xD;
'in killed, sire!' And his chief bealde,&#xD;
Smiling the boy fell dead~'&#xD;
Then, with a sharp thrill that went&#xD;
through and through her, and with the hot&#xD;
&#xD;
tears which rushed to her eyes, she felt&#xD;
that she had n~t~ been wrong; for never&#xD;
was the spirit of a poet better caught or&#xD;
better rendered than Philip Conway had&#xD;
caught and rendered this. The emperor's&#xD;
tone of warm yet careless sympathy, and&#xD;
the proud, calm answer of the boy, who a&#xD;
moment before had spoken with such gay&#xD;
daring, the boy at whom&#xD;
"You look twice ere you saw his breast&#xD;
Was all but shot in two."&#xD;
But, by this time, and before she could&#xD;
express approbation in words, Constance,&#xD;
who had concluded her interview with Nan-&#xD;
cy, came back to them.&#xD;
"If we are going to the island, we had&#xD;
better start," she said. "It is quite late."&#xD;
They s~t out at once. It did not take&#xD;
them long to reach their destination, for&#xD;
Conway used the oars as well as a profes-&#xD;
sional boatman, and pulled against the cur-&#xD;
rent with such hearty good-will, that his&#xD;
keel soon grated on the island sand. A ne-&#xD;
gro who was standing by made fast the&#xD;
boat to a small upright stake, and then Con.-&#xD;
way sprang out.&#xD;
"I suppose the men are at work yet,"&#xD;
he said to the idler. "Are you not one of&#xD;
them? What are you about here?"&#xD;
"No, sir, I'm not one of them," an-&#xD;
swered the boy, a little sullenly. "I waits&#xD;
on Mr. Blake, sir, and I rowed him over."&#xD;
"What! is Mr. Blake here?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. You'll lind him where the&#xD;
work's going on."&#xD;
''I haven't the least desire to find him,~~&#xD;
muttered Conway between his teeth, as he&#xD;
turned to assist the two ladies ashore.&#xD;
"You see we've been clearing already,"&#xD;
he said, while they walked up a gentle as-&#xD;
cent toward the pavilion. "These arcades&#xD;
will be very beautiful, I think, when they&#xD;
are well lighted up."&#xD;
"They are very beautiful now," said&#xD;
Constance, glancing down the paths which&#xD;
opened among the undergrowth to the right&#xD;
and left. "What exquisite views !-Look,&#xD;
Mabel, at that one."&#xD;
"Ah, how pretty!" said Mabel; and&#xD;
she stood still to admire the vista that&#xD;
opened before her-a vista lined with green, ~&#xD;
&#xD;
and giving a panoramic view of the blue&#xD;
water, the wooded shore, and the distant&#xD;
hills.&#xD;
"But come this way," said her escort.&#xD;
"Now, here-I mean this to be the scenic&#xD;
effect, .par excellence, of the evening. Im-&#xD;
agine that unsightly mass of lumber yonder&#xD;
transformed into a pavilion all ablaze with&#xD;
light; imagine every tree bordering this&#xD;
avenue hung with lamps-archways span-&#xD;
ning it at intervals; then tell me what you&#xD;
think of it."&#xD;
"I think it will be like fairy-land!"&#xD;
cried Mabel, clasping her hands; for he had&#xD;
drawn her into a long, straight avenue,&#xD;
which led directly from end to end of the&#xD;
island, and in the middle of which the un-&#xD;
sightly mass of lumber, that was to be trans-&#xD;
formed into a pavilion, stood. At least he&#xD;
assured her that it stood there, and that&#xD;
the effect would be the sante if it were ap-&#xD;
proached on either side. But, from their&#xD;
stand-point, she could scarcely believe it&#xD;
did not end the vista. "It would be like&#xD;
fairy-land," she repeated. "And, 0 Mr.&#xD;
Conway, how could you slander your pa-&#xD;
vilion so? I think it is beautiful.-Don't&#xD;
you, Constance?"&#xD;
"I think it looks very pretty from here,"&#xD;
said Constance; "but a mud-cabin would&#xD;
do that, I expect. Mr. Conway, are *e not&#xD;
to see it any nearer?"&#xD;
"Undoubtedly," said Mr. Conway, with&#xD;
a laugh. "You are to examine it as closely,&#xD;
and give youropinion of it as frankly, as you&#xD;
please.-This way, Miss Mabel. Take care&#xD;
-those trilling fellows have left a great&#xD;
deal of brushwood lying about. You had&#xD;
better take my arm."&#xD;
Mabel took the arm-she would have&#xD;
been apt to take a scorpion if he had offered&#xD;
it to her-and before long they made their&#xD;
appearance on the open space around the&#xD;
pavilion, where the usual carpentering&#xD;
pounds of sawing, planing, and hammering,&#xD;
tvere going on, and where Mr. Blake stood,&#xD;
in the midst of the d~ri8, looking very&#xD;
lrim. He touched his hat when he saw the&#xD;
adies; but even Mabel's bright smile could&#xD;
iot tempt him to relax his face. Indeed, he&#xD;
lid not look at her at all, but directed his&#xD;
attention straight to Philip Conway.&#xD;

"IN A GONDOLA."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hear you've been giving fresh orders,&#xD;
sir," he said, "and I find the men consider-&#xD;
ably bothered about them. It would save&#xD;
trouble and time, sir, if you would speak to&#xD;
me in the first place, for 1 might be able to&#xD;
tell' you beforehand what can be done and&#xD;
what cannot."&#xD;
"I only gave some directions about al-&#xD;
tering the roof, Mr. Blake," answered Con-&#xD;
way, carelessly. "I considered the men&#xD;
quite capable of doing that; and really, par-&#xD;
don me, I did not know that you were in-&#xD;
terested in the matter."&#xD;
"I'ni hot interested any further than my&#xD;
business 'and my duty to Mr. Seyton require&#xD;
me to be, sir," returned Mr. Blake, with in-&#xD;
creased stiffness of voice and manner. "1&#xD;
overlook the matter at his request, sir; and,&#xD;
if I didn't do it,' I don't think you or anybody&#xD;
else~would dance here on Miss Mabel's.tiite."&#xD;
"I know it has given you a deuced deal&#xD;
of trouble, and I am very sorry for it," said&#xD;
the' other, apologetically. - "But, really, if&#xD;
the men will be stupid, and make mis-&#xD;
takes~-"&#xD;
"The men don't make mistakes, sir.&#xD;
Begging your pardon, it's you who change&#xD;
your mind so fast that you can't remember&#xD;
what it was last time."&#xD;
"Well, if I will be stupid and make mis-&#xD;
takes, then, they have to be rectified, you&#xD;
know. Now, that roof-"&#xD;
"Is a disgrace to a Christian building.&#xD;
I grant you that, sir, with all myheart."&#xD;
"I am afraid it would disgrace a heathen&#xD;
one much more deeply. But at all events,&#xD;
it must' come oft'."&#xD;
"It can't come off, sir; that is, if you&#xD;
want the thing done by the 21st."&#xD;
"Can't-the mischief!" said Conway,&#xD;
beginning' to lose patience, and glad that&#xD;
Mabel and Constance had moved away to&#xD;
observe the building from another point of&#xD;
view. "There's no such word as "can't,''&#xD;
my good friend. 'It must be done."&#xD;
" That's all very fine, sir; but, when peo-&#xD;
pIe 'say ~ tutist' in that sort of style, they&#xD;
ought t&amp;amp;be able provide ways and means.&#xD;
Now, I think it would puzzle' you to do ei-&#xD;
ther."&#xD;
"4n the devil's name, where is the diffi-&#xD;
culty? 'What are the men after now?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hard at work with 'the weather-board-&#xD;
ing and flooring, sir. Besides, there's the&#xD;
piazzas to be finished, and every one of the&#xD;
posts'to be put in."&#xD;
"Oblige me by calling them columns,&#xD;
Mr. Blake. But you don't mean to tell me&#xD;
that it is going to take the men until the&#xD;
21st to (10 nothing but this?"&#xD;
Mr. Blake looked at him fixedly. "If&#xD;
there's as many obstacles thrown in their&#xD;
way as have been, sir, I shall only be sur-&#xD;
prised if they get through in that time," lie&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
"Confound them, and the pavilion too,&#xD;
then!" said Mr. Conway, and he took him-&#xD;
self oft' in a very bad humor.&#xD;
He found plenty of sympathy ready for&#xD;
him, however, and plenty of indignation, too.&#xD;
"It is shameful of Mr. Blake," said&#xD;
Mabel. "I never thought he would he so&#xD;
mean-and about my ball, too."&#xD;
"That is certainly an added enormity,"&#xD;
said Constance, with a laugh.-" Mr. Con-&#xD;
way, I am very sorry for you. The pavilion&#xD;
would be so pretty, if only the faults of the&#xD;
roof could be rectified."&#xD;
"It would be so easy, too," said the ag-&#xD;
grieved gentleman. "I assure you I never&#xD;
meant it to slope in that outrageous fashion,&#xD;
and, instead of being pretty, it will be ridic-&#xD;
ulous, if it 1e not altered. Positively, it&#xD;
would not take these fellows three days to&#xD;
do it, nud yet that obstinate old-"&#xD;
Constance held up a warning hand.&#xD;
"Hush I You must not call Mr. Blake&#xD;
any thing uncomplimentary. He means&#xD;
well, I am sure; he always does. Shall I&#xD;
go and try my powers of persuasion with&#xD;
him? Perhaps I might bring him to terms."&#xD;
"I should be inestimably obliged if you&#xD;
can. But I have not much hope."&#xD;
"Neither have I,', said Constance. But,&#xD;
nevertheless, she went toward the place&#xD;
where Mr. Blake still stood, with determina-&#xD;
tion in every line of his face. What she&#xD;
said nobody heard, but she came back after&#xD;
a time with a very radiant smile.&#xD;
"What will you give me for good&#xD;

&#xD;
"No doubt you are right," he said;&#xD;
"you always are, for that matter."&#xD;
Then he went to Mr. Blake, who received&#xD;
his acknowledgments civilly enough. The&#xD;
two sisters, meanwhile, strolled away tow-&#xD;
ard the boat, and there sat down to wait&#xD;
until he came. It was a beautiful spot, for&#xD;
the verdure of the island rose like a green&#xD;
wall behind them; the water rippled softly&#xD;
past at their feet, the fair prospect of the&#xD;
shore, with its wooded slopes' and green&#xD;
meadow-land lay before them, while Seyton&#xD;
House rose to the left among its terraces&#xD;
and gardens, with the blazing Western sky&#xD;
behind it, and one faint silver star gleaming&#xD;
just above the roof.&#xD;
"The sun has been down some tin~ie,"&#xD;
said Constance, after a while. "I wish Mr.&#xD;
Conway would come. We are two good&#xD;
miles from home."&#xD;
"The June twilight is quite long," said&#xD;
Mabel, "and-but here he is, now."&#xD;
She turned as she spoke, and there he&#xD;
was, im~deed, breaking With' quick steps'&#xD;
througit the brushwood to their side.&#xD;
"The matter is all settled," he said, gay-&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
The hour was certainly an exquisite one,&#xD;
and the charm of it entered deeply into the&#xD;
hearts of two 'of them at least. It wassuch an&#xD;
evening as only June ever gives us-so gold-&#xD;
en and serene in its royal wealth of beauty.&#xD;
The western sky still burned with the&#xD;
glow which in this month never quite fades&#xD;
from it all the night long. A crescent moon&#xD;
was shining where the crimson and golden&#xD;
tints melted into the misty sapphire of the&#xD;
upper skies, and more than one star had by&#xD;
this time come forth into sight. The river&#xD;
looked deep and dark along the shadowed&#xD;
banks, but where they gilded the surface&#xD;
still glittered with sunset reflections, even&#xD;
though all distant objects were now draped&#xD;
in the soft summer gloaming.&#xD;
"Mr. Conway," said Mabel, at last, "this&#xD;
is the time, of all others, for music or poe-&#xD;
try. We have not got the first, but we ca~&#xD;
have the last. Repeat something to us-&#xD;
something appropriate-and let Constance&#xD;
judge of your elocution."&#xD;
He looked up at her with a quick light&#xD;
in his eyes. Her allusion to Constance had&#xD;
passed unheard. All his good resolutions&#xD;

poems-the matchless "In a Gondola."&#xD;
Neither of the sisters had ever heard it be-&#xD;
fore, as few of us ever chance to hear any&#xD;
thing-heard it interpreted with all t'~ 'as-&#xD;
sion and tenderness that can fill a h. ian&#xD;
heart, for he rendered it with all the expres-&#xD;
sion that told one at least of them how en-&#xD;
tirely the spirit of the poem had entered&#xD;
into the man, and the man into the poem,&#xD;
until they two seemed but one-until it was&#xD;
not the ill-fated Venetian lover, but Philip&#xD;
Conway's self, who spoke, in the flow of&#xD;
perfect verse, his love and hope. They sat&#xD;
silently listening, while the dusk deepened&#xD;
round them, while the boat swept steadily&#xD;
on with the broad, majestic current, and,&#xD;
after a time, the lights of Ayre gleamed into&#xD;
sight, like distant stars, just as the end&#xD;
came, and Conway's voice, vibrating with&#xD;
marvellous tenderness and triumphant scorn,&#xD;
with proud daring and prouder resignation,&#xD;
spoke the closing words:&#xD;
"'It was ordaIned to be so, Sweet-sod best&#xD;
Comes now, beneath thine eyes, and on thy breast.&#xD;
Still kiss ~neR Care not fo~ the cowards (lare&#xD;

To death, because they never lived: but I&#xD;

diel'"&#xD;
After his voice sank on the last cadence,&#xD;
there was profound stillness. They could&#xD;
not see each other's face, and nobody spoke&#xD;
until he guided the boat ashore and touched&#xD;
land at the foot of Mrs. Lee's garden.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
ox THE WI5~G.&#xD;
~o the days went by, lengthening into&#xD;
weeks, until the 21st of June was near&#xD;
at hand. The pavilion had been finished&#xD;
in good time, and the preparations for the&#xD;
ball were inaugurated in due state; but all&#xD;
&#xD;
of a sudden Conway seemed to lose both&#xD;
spirit and interest in the matter. lie still&#xD;
worked as zealously as ever, superintended&#xD;
the decoration of the island, helped Mabel&#xD;
to fill out her list of invitations? and made&#xD;
himself useful and obliging in a good many&#xD;
different ways. But the animation, the&#xD;
personal zest, as it were, seemed to have&#xD;
deserted him; and one day he electrified&#xD;
the two Lee sisters by saying that he&#xD;
thought it doubtful whether he could re-&#xD;
main for the ball, or whether midsummer&#xD;
night would not find him distant by many&#xD;
miles from Seyton and Ayre. The conster-&#xD;
nation which ensued was very gret~t, and&#xD;
they asked at once why he had arrived at&#xD;
such a resolution. He was reticent, and by&#xD;
no means satisfactory for some time; but&#xD;
at last he said frankly that he saw no good&#xD;
in staying any longer.&#xD;
"You see," he went on, looking not at&#xD;
Mabel, but at Constance, "there are several&#xD;
reasons why I think I ought to go. For one&#xD;
thing, my mother is quite alone in Paris;&#xD;
and for another-well, for another, I think&#xD;
the limit of any reasonable visit has by this&#xD;
time expired."&#xD;
"But Mr. Sexton," cried Constance,&#xD;
eagerly. "Has he said nothing? Will he&#xD;
allow you to go without-without declaring&#xD;
his intentions concerning you?"&#xD;
The young man threw back his head a&#xD;
little haughtily, in a way peculiar to him.&#xD;
Somehow~ of late, any mention of the heir-&#xD;
~ship had seemed to annoy him.&#xD;
"My uncle only invited me to pay him&#xD;
a visit," he said, with a very unusual amount&#xD;
of dignity. "Of course we both knew what&#xD;
that meant; but he has never directly al-&#xD;
luded to the question of inheritance, and I&#xD;
don't think he ever will. I don't think,&#xD;
either, that I have the shadow of a chance.&#xD;
Of course, there will be no certainty-can&#xD;
be no certainty-for some time; but I fancy&#xD;
Cyril has won the race by several lengths."&#xD;
"I think you are mistaken," Constance&#xD;
began, but he interrupted her quickly.&#xD;
"I have the best possible reason for be-&#xD;
ing sure that I am not mistaken; and, after&#xD;
all, it may be best so. Cyril will enjoy the&#xD;
life amastngly, while I should probably&#xD;
never do more than barely endure it,&#xD;
&#xD;
'Better fifty years of Europe,&#xD;
Than a cycle of Cathay.'&#xD;
For Cathay read Seyton. 1 am philosophy&#xD;
cal at least.-Am I not, Miss Mabel?"&#xD;
Mabel looked up at this appeal, but&#xD;
was with very troubled eyes, and a mont]&#xD;
slightly quivering, despite the faint emil&#xD;
she forced.&#xD;
"I wish you were less philosophical,'&#xD;
she said. "I wish very much you wouli&#xD;
remain at Cathay, at least until after tht&#xD;
ball. It will not seem like the ball if yo~&#xD;
go away."&#xD;
"You will have Mr. Harding in mj&#xD;
place."&#xD;
"Do you think Mr. Harding can fill you:&#xD;
place?"&#xD;
"Why, not?" asked lie, a little bitterly.&#xD;
"The heir of Seyton House is the heir of&#xD;
Seyton House, you know, whatever his&#xD;
other name may be."&#xD;
"Don't mind him, Mabel, he is becom-&#xD;
ing cynical by way of variety," Constance&#xD;
laughed. But Mabel did mind him. She&#xD;
gave one glance of reproach, then turned&#xD;
without a word and left the room.&#xD;
Stricken by remorse, Conway followed&#xD;
to make his peace, and in ratification there-&#xD;
of was forced to promise that he would&#xD;
certainly defer his departure until after the&#xD;
ball; but oven Mabel saw that his intention&#xD;
was firm to go then, and that persuasion&#xD;
would have been useless, if she had had a&#xD;
mind to try it.&#xD;
"We will leave together,'~he said to&#xD;
Ainslie that same day. "I will go with&#xD;
you down to Charleston, and, taking passage&#xD;
thence t6 New York, I can time my move-&#xD;
ments exactly, so as to leave in the Arago,&#xD;
which sails for Havre on the 10th."&#xD;
"You are determined to go, then?"&#xD;
Ainslie asked, looking at him with some sur-&#xD;
prise. "If I were you, Phil, I would think&#xD;
twice about it. Remember you are leaving&#xD;
the field entirely in the hands of your rival."&#xD;
"What difference does that'make?" re-&#xD;
turned the other, shortly. "My uncle is&#xD;
not such a weak fool as to be influenced by&#xD;
the nearest person about him. He has seen&#xD;
enough of both of us to make up his mind&#xD;
in the matter; and staying here will neither.&#xD;
help nor hinder his resolution. l3dsides, it&#xD;
&#xD;
07&#xD;
&#xD;
is an undignified position, and one 1 don't&#xD;
fancy."&#xD;
They w6re smoking together on the ter-&#xD;
race, watching the sun go down over the&#xD;
t distant mountains, and Ainslie blew a per-&#xD;
~ feet cloud before he spoke again; then he&#xD;
a knocked the ashes from his cigar, and said,&#xD;
significantly:&#xD;
' "How about Miss Lee?"&#xD;
Simple as the question was, it brought a&#xD;
3 cloud over Conway's face such as had dark-&#xD;
ened it once before at sound of the same&#xD;
name.&#xD;
"Xothing about her," he answered, even&#xD;
more shortly than a moment back.&#xD;
"Come, come, Phil, don't take that tone&#xD;
to me," said the other, good-humoredly.&#xD;
"What is the good of being churlish over&#xD;
the loss of your pretty plaything? Haven't&#xD;
you made up your mind yet that 'lightly&#xD;
won and lightly lost' is to be your motto,&#xD;
now as ever?"&#xD;
"I have made up my mind that I wish&#xD;
Seyton and all its belongings were in the&#xD;
depths of the Ayre," answered Conway,&#xD;
with an unmistakable emphasis of sincerity.&#xD;
"I wonder why I was such a fool as to come&#xD;
here? I might have known that harm of&#xD;
dome sort would be the upshot. I never&#xD;
was fortunate in my life. But you know&#xD;
this would be suicidal, Ralph."&#xD;
"This - what?" asked the other, still&#xD;
smiling. "I never expected to see you take&#xD;
any thing so au tragique. What is the&#xD;
matter? A pleasant flirtation, a good-by,&#xD;
a heartache or two on each side, perhaps,&#xD;
and then-forgetfulness. Is that a matter&#xD;
to be regretted?"&#xD;
"Not fl'Qm your stand-point, perhaps,"&#xD;
returned Conway, a little ungratefully. "I&#xD;
see as plainly as you do how it must end,"&#xD;
he went on, tossing his cigar far out into&#xD;
the river; "but the consolation of that end-&#xD;
ing is what I don't see, just at present.&#xD;
However, I don't mean to put a climax on&#xD;
my folly, if that is any palliation of the folly&#xD;
already achieved. In my present position,&#xD;

"Perhaps it is best," said his friend,&#xD;
amusingly. "If your chances here are good,&#xD;
absence won't hurt them; and for the rest&#xD;
-eke sard SEZTtI, you know."&#xD;
So itwassettled, and that night Conway&#xD;
announced his intended departure to his tin-&#xD;
cle. N1r. Sexton received the news very&#xD;
quietly, and made little or no demur, being,&#xD;
indeed, exceedingly glad of the intelligence.&#xD;
Of late he had been growing more and&#xD;
more uneasy concerning Mabel's evident&#xD;
predilection for his black sheep of a neph-&#xD;
ew; and had wavered' toward the Harding&#xD;
side more on that account than on an~ other&#xD;
whatever. He felt sure that, if the pecuni-&#xD;
ary obstacle were removed, the course of&#xD;
true love would be very apt to run smooth&#xD;
toa matrimonial conclusion, let friends and&#xD;
'common-sense say what they chose. And,&#xD;
dearly as he loved Mabel, he would almost&#xD;
rather have seen her In her coffin than seen&#xD;
her Philip Conway's wife. Blake himself&#xD;
h4dciiO deeper distrust of the Conway blood,&#xD;
no, mere profound horror of the Conway na-&#xD;
ture,, than had Mr. Sexton, when the mat-&#xD;
ter was brought home to him. It was won-&#xD;
derful how he veered round to the Harding&#xD;
interest during these days of anxiety, and&#xD;
how secure he felt in the pragmatic stupid-&#xD;
ity and, formal piety of the man for whom&#xD;
he had hitherto entertained such a disgust.&#xD;
:N'ow all that was changed; and for some&#xD;
time the heirship of Seyton House hung on&#xD;
rnorp of a thread than it had ever done be-&#xD;
fore, or was ever destined to do again. But&#xD;
he kept his own counsel, and, save by&#xD;
shrewd surmises, nobody knew this, though'&#xD;
everybody saw plainly enough his deep and&#xD;
manifest anxiety about Mabel. It was the&#xD;
perception of this anxiety, and of his uncle's&#xD;
growing coolness toward him, that deter-&#xD;
mined, Conway on departure.&#xD;
"I was a fool to com~i," he thought,&#xD;
again and: again. "I might have known&#xD;
that, there was no such thing as luck for&#xD;
me. Y~, if he'had only known' it, be was&#xD;
~erving his, interests better, by going than if&#xD;

out qf his difficulty, the only means of corn-&#xD;
pron~i~ing3wilIi two ~onfiicting desires. lie&#xD;
wanted to make Conway his heir, ,and he&#xD;
&#xD;
also wanted to put him forever out of Ma-&#xD;
bel's path of life. He had not seen any pos-&#xD;
sibility of reconciling these two things, un-&#xD;
til the young man himself came forward&#xD;
with the mode.&#xD;
"I am going back to Europe," he said;&#xD;
and eagerly, almost joyfully, Mr. Seyton&#xD;
bade him go. He was young, he could af-&#xD;
ford to wait, thought the elder man; he&#xD;
could afford to remain in ignorance of the&#xD;
good fortune awaiting him-it would be all&#xD;
the more pleasant when it came, and, mean-&#xD;
while, Mabel would marry somebody else,&#xD;
and' be safely out of the way of danger.&#xD;
"It will be all right when he comes&#xD;
back," thought this simple-hearted gentle-&#xD;
man, as he stood that night by his chamber-&#xD;
window, and looked out to a spot where,&#xD;
beyond the luxuriant bloom of the garden,&#xD;
white shafts and garlanded crosses gleamed&#xD;
in the silver moonlight. It was the burial&#xD;
ground of the family-the ground where&#xD;
every Seyton had been laid, since the first&#xD;
of the name was played to rest under the&#xD;
soil of the New World; and it spoke well&#xD;
for this man's brave, steadfast faith, and&#xD;
quiet, stainless life, that the thought that he&#xD;
would be sleeping there when the time of&#xD;
* which he spoke came round, cost him not a&#xD;
sigh. On the contrary, he smiled, and say-&#xD;
ing, "It will be all right then," turned&#xD;
away full of content.&#xD;
On the 20th, while everybody else was&#xD;
full of the approaching f.~te, Ainslie shut&#xD;
himself up in his studio, and gave the fin-&#xD;
ishing touches to the portrait, which for&#xD;
some time had been needing only these fin-&#xD;
ishing touches to complete it. Then, on&#xD;
the morning of midsummer-day, he took Mr.&#xD;
Sexton in and showed it to him. If it had&#xD;
been beautiful, before in its crude, half-fin-&#xD;
ished state, it was something much more&#xD;
than beautiful now. It was a picture such&#xD;
as we seldom see from the hand of an unin-&#xD;
spired artist, from one who has none of the&#xD;
grand impulses of faith, or the tender graces&#xD;
of devotion stirring in his heart, but who&#xD;
works out his conception merely accoMing&#xD;
to the earth, ~arthy. Th~re was about it&#xD;
an exquisite spirituality, and, an almost di-&#xD;
vine loveliness, which could only be likened&#xD;
to "the lamp 'of ~aphtha in the alabaster&#xD;

MABEL LEE.' ,&#xD;
&#xD;
ON THE WING.&#xD;
&#xD;
the spirit of Terpsichore which was ever&#xD;
bubbling up in the breasts of these gay,&#xD;
fresh country maidens, who bad not yet&#xD;
learned to despise every thing save the Ger-&#xD;
man, and vote even that only tolerable&#xD;
with an entertaining partner.&#xD;
"A partner!" cried Miss Nina Eston,&#xD;
when a languid, city-spoiled young lady&#xD;
suggested this new view of things. "I like&#xD;
a good partner, of course; but, my dear&#xD;
child, I would dance with a stick, to be&#xD;
dancing."&#xD;
And this was not only the theory, but&#xD;
also the practice, of all the demoiselles of&#xD;
Ayre. So, as "sticks" tibounded there, as&#xD;
well as elsewhere, wall-flowers were conse-&#xD;
quently next thing to unknown. This line&#xD;
of liberal sentiment gave animation and zest&#xD;
to the small assemblies with which Ayre&#xD;
occasionally amused itself, and made them&#xD;
su~ch pleasant scenes that the veriest bigot&#xD;
who ever declaimed against "the sin of&#xD;
shuffling the feet" might have been con-&#xD;
~erted, if he had watched for one half-hour&#xD;
those bright faces and graceful forms, as&#xD;
they moved through the quadrilics, or tried&#xD;
a quiet polka or two. ]3ut, as it chanced,&#xD;
such bigots were rare in Ayre; and even&#xD;
the two Misses Phifer, who represented as&#xD;
much of the element as was afloat, had&#xD;
pledged the attendance of their Roman&#xD;
noses at Mr. Seyton's fe4te.&#xD;
Great were the preparations of this day,&#xD;
therefore, and poor Constance (who was a&#xD;
very popular referee in matters of costume)&#xD;
really thought that it would never come to&#xD;
an end, and night fairly close over them.&#xD;
it closed at last, and the important busi-&#xD;
ness of dressing began. It was a business&#xD;
which cleared Mrs. Lee's house very speedily&#xD;
of all eave its regular occupants, and left&#xD;
bnly a permanent thunder-cloud in the per-&#xD;
son of Mr. Kowell. He was what Mabel&#xD;
called "boiling with ill-humor," on account&#xD;
of the ball, and had utterly refused to go to&#xD;
it. But still he haunted the house all day,&#xD;
and made himself particularly disagreeable.&#xD;
After tea, Mabel went up-stairs to array her-&#xD;
self; but, before doingso, gave him his orders.&#xD;
"You are not to leave until I come down&#xD;
and show myself to you," she said; and,&#xD;
chafed and vexed though he was, he could&#xD;
&#xD;
not find it in his heart to disobey. Poor&#xD;
fellow I he was not the kind of man whose&#xD;
love-troubles meet with much sympathy&#xD;
from the outside world-rarely even with&#xD;
much encouragement from their object-yet&#xD;
they were none the less sipcere for that.&#xD;
They made him moody and bitter, they en-&#xD;
raged him against himself and his own folly,&#xD;
they even rendered him harsh and disagree-&#xD;
able to the woman he would have died to&#xD;
serve; but they were, perhaps, the most&#xD;
real thing about a nature which was intense&#xD;
in its reality. Once for all, it may be as&#xD;
well to say here that Francis Nowell loved&#xD;
Mabel Lee as it is the fortune of few women&#xD;
on this earth of ours to be loved; and that&#xD;
he could not remember a single day, since&#xD;
her childhood, when he had not loved her&#xD;
in this absorbing fashion. She embodied&#xD;
every thing that was tender and soft in his&#xD;
nature and conception, for, beyond that, he&#xD;
was a man whose sentiments toward the&#xD;
world were, at best, those of simple indiffer-&#xD;
ence. Mother or sisters he had none. Con-&#xD;
stance he liked, in a certain cold way of his&#xD;
own; and for his aunt he entertained a pro-&#xD;
found contempt. But Mabel had twined&#xD;
herself into the inmost recess of his heart,&#xD;
and remained there, without change or&#xD;
shadow of turning, to his dying day.&#xD;
Left alone now, he walked restlessly about&#xD;
the little sitting-room, where tokeimuf her&#xD;
met his eye on every side, and tokens, too,&#xD;
of this new life which was estranging her&#xD;
from him. There lay some fragments of her&#xD;
dress-the dress over which Constance had&#xD;
toiled so lovingly and patiently: there a rib-&#xD;
bon that ~had dropped from her hair; there&#xD;
the gloves she had trimmed with lace, and&#xD;
forgotten to take up-stairs; and there, close&#xD;
beside them, for she had read it in the inter~&#xD;
vals of sewing, a volume of Browning, open&#xD;
on the last page of "In a Gondola." He&#xD;
did not know, of course, the association&#xD;
connected with this; but still he eyed it&#xD;
disapprovingly, and, after glancing at the&#xD;
closing verses, had just laid it down with a&#xD;
muttered "Stuff!" when there came a rus-&#xD;
tle of drapery, and a light footstep on the&#xD;
stairs. The next moment she flashed in&#xD;
upon him through the open door.&#xD;
And how beautiful she was! Long&#xD;
&#xD;
years afterward, in the sternness and gray&#xD;
ness of his age, his heart warmed into hf&#xD;
whenever he recalled her as she stood be&#xD;
fore him that night in the full flush of ho&#xD;
youth and beauty. She was dressed b&#xD;
white gauze, of the most airy and web-lik&#xD;
texture, embroidered with a silver oak-leaf&#xD;
and-acorn device, the full, sweeping skir&#xD;
falling in a train behind, but short enough&#xD;
in front to uncover the dainty, slippere&#xD;
feet. Her rich golden hair was arrange&#xD;
in loose curls that hung quite to her waisi&#xD;
behind, while a chaplet of pearls, whici&#xD;
had been Mr. Seyton's gift that day, bound&#xD;
them back from the brow in front, but they&#xD;
fell over the bare shoulders and arms like&#xD;
rippling masses of sunlight; and the effect&#xD;
was so dazzling, that she seemed to briug a&#xD;
glory into the room with her. 'No detail&#xD;
of the costume was careless or lacking; and,&#xD;
as she stood looking at her cousin, full of&#xD;
laughing pride and conscious loveliness, he&#xD;
could scarcely, for once, forbear the utter-&#xD;
ance of his admiration. He did forbear,&#xD;
though it was hard for him to do so. He&#xD;
swallowed down the words of praise that&#xD;
rose to his lips, and spoke after a while in&#xD;
quite his usual fashion:.&#xD;
"I suppose you think you are looking&#xD;
very charming, Mabel? I wonder if you&#xD;
will turn anybody else's head to-night half&#xD;
as much as your own is turned?"&#xD;
"So you~don't think Jam looking charm-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"I think I have seen you look quite as&#xD;
well often before; and, indeed, to my mind,&#xD;
a great deal better."&#xD;
"In a calico, or something of that sort,&#xD;
perhaps?"&#xD;
&#xD;
'11&#xD;
&#xD;
even with Francis. So she only looked up&#xD;
'e at him with a smile-that came back to him&#xD;
afterward, many a time, and pierced more&#xD;
sharply than a sword-stroke-saying:&#xD;
a "I see you mean to put me out of lin-&#xD;
S mor; but that is even beyond your power&#xD;
to-night. I would not quarrel with the&#xD;
t most provoking person in the world-which&#xD;

I I suppose I ~nust be resigned. But I have&#xD;
a favor to ask of you. Please think better&#xD;
of your resolution, and come to my ball."&#xD;
She spoke very pleadingly; but the mere&#xD;
mention of the ball was as wormwood to&#xD;
him, and he answered, sharply enough:&#xD;
"I never think better of my resolutions,&#xD;
Mabel. It is impossible. I shall be very&#xD;
busy to-night, and, besides, I should not be&#xD;
likely to contribute to your enjoyment."&#xD;
"That depends entirely upon yourself.&#xD;
You could contribute to it very much, if&#xD;
you would."&#xD;
"Pretty speeches are not necessary be-&#xD;
tween us, Mabel."&#xD;
"I am not making pretty speeches," she&#xD;
said, a little indignantly. "What is the&#xD;
matter with you to-night? 7ou are even&#xD;
itmoi~e dis-cross than usual."&#xD;
"Then I would be even less likely to&#xD;
prove a welcome addition to your ball com-&#xD;
pany."&#xD;
"I only wish I could persuade you to&#xD;
come in character, as Diogenes, or Timon&#xD;
of Athens. Everybody would be sure to&#xD;
say, 'How appropriate! '"&#xD;
"That would be very kind of everybody;&#xD;
but I shall not afford thorn the gratifica-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes; in a calico, or something of that "You positively will not come?"&#xD;
sort, if it was neatly made, and modestly "I have already answered that question,&#xD;
put on."                                Mabel."&#xD;
Mabel flushed suddenly. It was right "Well," said Mabel, who felt herself&#xD;
hard to meet such a reception, and be strangely rebuffed, "as you please, of course.&#xD;
greeted by such censure, when she had come But I am sure I would do as much to give&#xD;
down full of her happiness. and pleasure; you pleasure. If it were your flte, now-&#xD;

of her nature prevailed now, as ever. She words, and nobody, save himself; knew how&#xD;

&#xD;
suddenly smote him. It was, as she said,&#xD;
her flte, and, when every one else was at&#xD;
her feet, he alone thwarted and vexed her.&#xD;
In another moment he might have agreed to&#xD;
go, had not a sudden interruption come-&#xD;
steps were heard advancing along the gar-&#xD;
den-patl~, voices and laughter sounded quite&#xD;
near. Mabel flushed up with warm delight,&#xD;
and ~Towell drew back into his shell, cold&#xD;
and hard as ever, when the glass door 'lead-&#xD;
iftg into the garden opened, and a brilliant&#xD;
gro~1p entered. It was Mr. Sexton and his&#xD;
three guests, in full, evening costume, and&#xD;
they made a very imposing appearance,&#xD;
even though the dress suited Mr. Harding&#xD;
about as well as it would havesuited an un-&#xD;
d~rtalcer. He looked singularly out of&#xD;
plaoe, and singularly out of humor, too, so&#xD;
that his face was a very good foil to the&#xD;
brightziess of the three other faces, as they&#xD;
came in together.&#xD;
Perhaps, if the truth had been known,&#xD;
their r~ioods were not much more tuned to&#xD;
enjoyment than his; but they were all&#xD;
three, in their different ways, men of the&#xD;
wbrld, and had at command the lip-deep&#xD;
siiiiles that Society (which cares not a jot&#xD;
whether the' heart be gay or breaking) de-&#xD;
mands from all her votaries. Mr. Harding&#xD;
had infinitely less of the conventional power&#xD;
of self-control about' him; and then his&#xD;
grievance was the most real of all. The&#xD;
latter should be taken into consideration;&#xD;
for, let people talk as they will of sentimen-&#xD;
tal grievances being as bad or worse than&#xD;
real ones, they have, at least, the merit of&#xD;
being more easily concealed and put aside.&#xD;
A man may smile when the woman he loves&#xD;
has just told him that he is nothing to her&#xD;
-indeed, it sometimes affords him a great&#xD;
deal of gloomy satisfaction to do so-but he&#xD;
must possess rare facial muscles if he can&#xD;
smile when bankruptcy is hanging over his&#xD;
head, or when Poverty grins at him from an&#xD;
empty larder.&#xD;
Mr. Harding's trouble was not quite so&#xD;
real as this, but still it was not a light one;&#xD;
for on that day he had heard, from his un-&#xD;
cle's own lips, that all his hopes of the Sey-&#xD;
ton inheritance were at an end.&#xD;
"I tell you this, because I think it is&#xD;
right you should know it," Mr. Sexton had&#xD;
&#xD;
said, after his resolution was declared as&#xD;
kindly and gently as possible. "It would&#xD;
be wrong to let you cherish expectation&#xD;
which my death would only disappoint. I&#xD;
have not told Philip yet, and do not intend&#xD;
to tell him. But ~ou are different. I felt&#xD;
it a duty to let you know. When I die, you&#xD;
will find that 1 have remembered you in the&#xD;
little which is mine to give; but Philip is&#xD;
the natural heir. Adela is older than your&#xD;
mother, and it seems his right."&#xD;
"I only hope you may never regret it,&#xD;
sir," was all that Mr. Harding replied, for&#xD;
he had, some dignity in his own fashion;&#xD;
but it would be hard to say how bitterly re-&#xD;
sentful he felt at heart.&#xD;
This bitterness and resentment were&#xD;
still very evident in his face and manner-&#xD;
for brooding over his wrongs had only&#xD;
strengthened his conviction of them-and&#xD;
made his presence any thing but one of sun-&#xD;
shine when he entered Mrs. Lee's sitting-&#xD;
room, and saw the young queen of the even-&#xD;
ing, in her white gauze dress and shim-&#xD;
mering pearls. It is not too much to say&#xD;
that he fairly hated her, as she stood before&#xD;
him all flushed and radiant, looking more&#xD;
like a shining ~eri, than the sad Madonna&#xD;
Ainslie had painted. In his heart, he firm-&#xD;
ly believed that she was the cause of his&#xD;
uncle's decision in favor of. Conway. He&#xD;
thought, as a more keen-sighted person&#xD;
might have been pardoned for thinking,&#xD;
that it was simply on account of the ten-&#xD;
di-esse existing between those two, that Mr.&#xD;
Sexton had bestowed the inheritance (as&#xD;
Ayre had said, from the first, he meant to&#xD;
bestow it) on the choice of his goddaugh-&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
"He has played his cards better than I&#xD;
have," thought Mr. Harding, bitterly, as he&#xD;
watched the light on Mabel's face, while&#xD;
she stood talking to his cousin, a little apart&#xD;
from the rest~-for Mrs. Lee and Constance&#xD;
had appeared by this time-and felt all the&#xD;
humiliation as well as the sting of defeat.&#xD;
"He has played his cards better then I&#xD;
have, for it is very plain that all my utinle's&#xD;
talk about the eldest. and the right, and the&#xD;
natural heir, means simply tlii L It is all&#xD;
because of her baby face 'and baby liking&#xD;
that he is chosen. He saw it from thefirat,&#xD;

&#xD;
sight; for the massing of the figures, the&#xD;
constant picturesque combinations which&#xD;
they form, the unconscious harmony with&#xD;
the rise and swell of music, that tones down&#xD;
almost any movements to grace, the brightly-&#xD;
lit faces, the "dancers dancing in tune,"&#xD;
and th9 cadenced rhythm of "flute, violin,&#xD;
and bassoon," all conspire to make up the&#xD;
delight of the eye in no ordinary degree.&#xD;
But this ballroom seemed, to its partial&#xD;
lookers-on, welluigh the~ prettiest they had&#xD;
ever seen.&#xD;
Through the length and breadth of the&#xD;
State, Ayre was renowned for its' pretty&#xD;
women, and never had they better sustained&#xD;
their reputation than on this night. Look-&#xD;
ing through one of the broad windows on&#xD;
the dancing-room, it was a perfect "rose-&#xD;
bud garden of girls" which charmed the&#xD;
glance, as they circled in and out of the&#xD;
time-honored and time-worn quadrille fig-&#xD;
ures, 'or threw themselves body and soul&#xD;
'   into the old-fashioned waltz, than which&#xD;
nothing more graceful, nothing more de-&#xD;
lightful, has ever been, or ever will be,&#xD;
invented. The girl of the period had not&#xD;
yet arrived, bringing along with her the&#xD;
dance of the period; and, when the baud&#xD;
struck up one of the sweet old Strauss&#xD;
waltzes, eyes brightened and lips smiled as&#xD;
gayly as they brighten and smile now over&#xD;
the last galop from "La Grande Duchesse,"&#xD;
or "La Belle H6l~ne."&#xD;
"Don't let me keep you, Frank," said&#xD;
Constance, turning to a young man who&#xD;
stood with her near one of the windows,&#xD;
where they could feel the cool night air,&#xD;
and enjoy the animated scene at the same&#xD;
time. "I know you 'want to be dancing.&#xD;
Fray go."&#xD;
The person thus addressed-a young col-&#xD;
legian, who quite unconsciously kept time&#xD;
to the music with his foot, and whose hand-&#xD;
some face, "beneath its garniture of curly&#xD;
gold," proved his near relationship to the see-&#xD;
end best beauty in the rooms i. e.7 Miss Nina&#xD;
Eston, of musical fame-looked round with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
"I'll go, certainly, Miss Constance," he&#xD;
answered, "if you will go too, but not&#xD;
otherwise. Shall we take a turn? It looks&#xD;
pleasant, I am sure."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It looks extremely pleasant," Con-&#xD;
stance replied; "and that is why I bid you&#xD;
go and find a partner. I believe .1 don't&#xD;
care to take a turn-waltzing is much too&#xD;
warm work for to-night. But I see that you&#xD;
can hardly keep still, so take yourself off at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
"And leave you alone?" asked he,&#xD;
plainly anxious to obey, and yet fearful of&#xD;
transgressing 168 l~iCfl8&amp;amp;8flCe8 too far, in so&#xD;
doing.&#xD;
"What does it matter about leaving me&#xD;
alone?" said she, laughing. "But here is&#xD;
Mr. Seyton, so now you need not hesitate~&#xD;
Do go. I want to see what new steps you&#xD;
have learned at the university."&#xD;
"We don't learn steps at the univer-&#xD;
sity," said he, shrugging his shoulders.&#xD;
"And, besides-I don't see any available&#xD;
partner."&#xD;
"Yonder is Maggie Bradford."&#xD;
"I don't care to ask Miss Maggie."&#xD;
"Why not? She is a very good waltz-&#xD;
er:"&#xD;
"Yes," answered he, a little hesitating-&#xD;
ly; and then after a moment his grievance&#xD;
came out. "I was engaged to her for the&#xD;
last waltz, and she snubbed me in the cool-&#xD;
est       possible, to give it to that-" he&#xD;
paused, glanced at Mr. Seyton, and concluded&#xD;
his sentence in a manner plainly different&#xD;
from what he had intended-" that Mr.&#xD;
Conway."&#xD;
Constance laughed.&#xD;
"Well, yonder is Mabel," she said.&#xD;
"Go and make her snub Mr. Conway for&#xD;
your benefit. That will be only fair, I am&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"It would be only fair, hut how am Ito&#xD;
do it?"&#xD;
'~ As if you need to ask me! Claim the&#xD;
right of friendship, of course; and be as&#xD;
plaintive as possible. Tell her you have&#xD;
not danced with her to-night, and that you&#xD;
must have one waltz at least for auld ac-&#xD;
sake. AAIA, also, that you may&#xD;
be in Asia, Africa, or Oceanica, on her next&#xD;
f4te-day, and I hardly think she will refuse&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The young man laughed, and went off&#xD;
right willingly. Constance and Mr. Seyton&#xD;
watched him as he crossed the room, dex~&#xD;
&#xD;
't~rously avoiding collision with several&#xD;
waltzing couples, and gained an alcove&#xD;
where Mabel stood surrounded by several&#xD;
gentlemen, of whom Conway was one. As&#xD;
Eston drew near, she laid her hand on the&#xD;
arm of the latter, and was on the point of&#xD;
turning away, but the young collegian&#xD;
stopped her, and an animated discussion&#xD;
ensued.&#xD;
"I have no idea that Frank will suc-&#xD;
ceed," said Mr. Seyton, regarding the scene&#xD;
with very manifest anxiety; but Constance&#xD;
smiled, and answered that she thought he&#xD;
would. The result proved her opinion&#xD;
right. After a moment they saw Conway&#xD;
fall back with only tolerable grace, and the&#xD;
next instant Mabel's white dress floated by&#xD;
them, and ~'rank Eston nodded triumphant-&#xD;
ly over his shoulder, as he bore his prize&#xD;
round and round in that swift, delicious&#xD;
whirl which sets the blood dancing and the&#xD;
whole frame tingling like nothing else in&#xD;
the world.&#xD;
Undoubtedly, there were many fair wom-&#xD;
en present that night-women with all the&#xD;
beauty of face and form and all the name-&#xD;
less fascination of voice and manner which&#xD;
have made their land famous-but fairest far&#xD;
among them all was the young belle of the'&#xD;
evening. It seemed as if an accession of&#xD;
loveliness had come to Mabel like an in-&#xD;
spiration that night, and astonished even&#xD;
the people who had known and admired&#xD;
her all her life. It was not the mere ad-&#xD;
vantage of costume, or the beauty, but it&#xD;
was something deeper, richer, rarer than&#xD;
any of these, which shed over her a glory&#xD;
next to divine. The girl was dead, the&#xD;
woman had waked to life, and the change&#xD;
startled even her own sister.&#xD;
"She looks as if she were enchanted,"&#xD;
Constance had said, almost unconsciously,&#xD;
yet in her unconsciousness she struck home&#xD;
to the truth. Enchanted That was the&#xD;
solution. That was the key to all this new&#xD;
afiluenee of beauty, this dazzling transfl~ura-&#xD;
tion of the familiar face till it seemed unfa-&#xD;
miliar. The dewy lustre of the eyes, the&#xD;
smile that rested like sunshine on the sweet&#xD;
rose lips, the whole expression was changed&#xD;
and 'glorified into something that the fair,&#xD;
serene features had never known before-&#xD;
&#xD;
something, too, that had a certain pathos of&#xD;
its own, and touched into sadness more than&#xD;
one among those who were old enough to&#xD;
have seen many such bright dawns darken be-&#xD;
fore noonday into clouds and tempest. Ma-&#xD;
bel herself was conscious that it was an un-&#xD;
natural excitement which filledher veins like&#xD;
a subtle elixir, but she yielded willingly to&#xD;
the spell, and shut her eyes to every thing&#xD;
save the passing hour.&#xD;
"I mean to think of nothing but to-&#xD;
night," she said t~"herself and for once this&#xD;
resolution-a resolution very hard to carry&#xD;
out-was faithfully fulfilled. She thought of&#xD;
nothing hut the night-not of the morrow&#xD;
with its farewell, and still less of the long,&#xD;
blank morrows that were to come after-&#xD;
and, thus feeling, possessed once at least&#xD;
that hoard of fairy gold which is far more&#xD;
bright and far more ~r~cious than all the&#xD;
currency of earth. Ah I who has not been&#xD;
thrilled by its magical glitter, its wonderful&#xD;
promise of happiness and beauty; and who&#xD;
also has not waked to find it moss and&#xD;
leaves?&#xD;
Now, it happened that when Mabel had&#xD;
yielded to young Eston's auld acquaintance&#xD;
plea, she had done so rather reluctantly,&#xD;
saying, "If you insist, Frank, I suppose 'I&#xD;
must give you one turn, but~ the waltz is&#xD;
Mr. Conway's, and he has a right to the&#xD;
rest-that isif he chooses to wait for it."&#xD;
She looked at Conway interrogatively,&#xD;
as she spoke, and he fell back, as before&#xD;
mentioned, with only tolerable grace.&#xD;
"Let it be only one turn, then," he an-&#xD;
swered, "and of course you know there is&#xD;
no question of my choosing to wait. You&#xD;
will find me here."&#xD;
"A~&amp;amp; revoir, then,1' she said. The next&#xD;
moment she vanished from his side, and he&#xD;
only caught a glimpse of her bent head over&#xD;
Frank Eaton's' shoulder, as they joined the&#xD;
waltzers. lIe did not tronible himself to&#xD;
find a seat, or seek a companion, but re-&#xD;
mained where she had left him, leaning&#xD;
against the side of an open window in the&#xD;
careless, languid fashion that had been a&#xD;
revelation to the country-bred youths .of&#xD;
Ayre. Glancing out on one sideV he Saw&#xD;
the cool, dark arcades stretching away in&#xD;
long vistas, broken here and there by gleam?&#xD;

ing lanips.; glancing in on the other, he&#xD;
watched' the gay. crowd shifting its many&#xD;
colors like ~ kaleidoscope, and, if Tennyson&#xD;
had given his "Maud" to the critics sev-&#xD;
eral y~ars before its actual appearance, he&#xD;
might have solaced himself by quoting the&#xD;
sweetest love-song of our day, and mur-&#xD;
mured, as 'he saw Mabel first nearing him&#xD;
in the dance:&#xD;
"Come forth, little head, sunning over with curls,&#xD;
Tothe flowers, and be their sun;&#xD;
In gloss of satin1 and glimmer of pearls,&#xD;
Queen lily, ~nd rose, In one."&#xD;
As it was, however, he only thought&#xD;
the same thing, in much less poetical form.&#xD;
"It is confoundedly warm in here," he&#xD;
said to himself, "and these people bore one&#xD;
to death. Instead of the waltz, I shall&#xD;
take her out into the grounds, and I only&#xD;
hope&#xD;
lie broke off abruptly, for she had&#xD;
reached him, and, as he stepped forward to&#xD;
claim her, whirled past again more rapidly&#xD;
than before. He could not see that she did&#xD;
so with little' or no volition of her own;&#xD;
that Frank Eston had borne her on quite&#xD;
against her' intention or desire, saying, "We&#xD;
are just in the spirit of it, and this has been&#xD;
only a taste. One more turn, Miss Ma-&#xD;
bel; ". nor did he catch the half-appealing,&#xD;
half..apologetio glance that she sent back to&#xD;
him, for at that moment Fate cast a sud-&#xD;
den and most unexpected treasure upon his&#xD;
hands in the substantial shape of Miss Nina&#xD;
Eaton.&#xD;
It chanced that this young lady was one&#xD;
of the best, if not the very best, among the&#xD;
fair waltzers of Ayre, and, to use her own&#xD;
form of asseveration, was "perfectly de-&#xD;
voted" to that Terpaichorean exercise; but&#xD;
it also chanced that 'she was unfortunately&#xD;
addicted to a trick of losing her head, on all&#xD;
waltzing occasions, and, unless she had a&#xD;
partner who was capable of regulating her&#xD;
course, w'as very apt to increase her pace&#xD;
iui~iiI she came to grief in consequence of&#xD;
colliding with some unwary couple, or over-'&#xD;
Vw~ning some innocent bystander. On this&#xD;
oceftalon, sh~ had been dancing with a young&#xD;
college friend of her brother's, a thin,' pale&#xD;
y4rnth who knew the least in the world&#xD;
about waltzing, who took wild, uncertain&#xD;
&#xD;
steps in every direction, and had not the&#xD;
strength of a feather with which to oppose&#xD;
his partner's momentum when she took him&#xD;
by the shoulder and carried him along, help-&#xD;
less and terrified, at a whirlwind rate of&#xD;
progress. The lookers-on laughed, for they&#xD;
saw that a catastrophe was inevitable, and&#xD;
more than one of them said, "Poor fellow!&#xD;
he'll know what's what, if he once feels the&#xD;
full weight of Nina's hundred and fifty&#xD;
pounds." That he did not feel it, was cer-&#xD;
tainly not the result of his own skill or&#xD;
Nina's caution, or their common good for-&#xD;
tune; but was simply owing to the fact that&#xD;
Conway had stepped forward to meet Ma..&#xD;
bel, and had been left in the lurch in the ig-&#xD;
nominious manner above recorded. For,&#xD;
just as Frank Eston whirled her past him,&#xD;
the unfortunate collegian was precipitated,&#xD;
without any agency of his own, full against&#xD;
Mr. Harding, who, with Miss Lavinia Crane&#xD;
on his arm, had been rash enough to at-&#xD;
tempt the passage of the room. Both gentle-&#xD;
men reeled, lost their balance, and came&#xD;
down together, with a thundering crash&#xD;
which was heard above the pealing of the&#xD;
band, and turned every eye at once upon&#xD;
them. Miss Crane had save~1 herself by&#xD;
dropping her escort's arm and retreating&#xD;
with a slight scream, when she saw what&#xD;
was coming; but Miss Eaton would infal-&#xD;
libly have gone down in the common disas-&#xD;
ter, if Conway had not been at hand, and&#xD;
caught her just in time. lie drew her back,&#xD;
and then lent his aid to the two unfortu-&#xD;
nates, who, instead of compassionating each&#xD;
other, were mutually an~ry and indignant.&#xD;
Mr. Harding was very red, the collegian was&#xD;
very purple, and they both began talking&#xD;
in an excited tone as soon as they gained&#xD;
their feet. Finding that no bones were&#xD;
broken, Conway left them to settle the mat-&#xD;
ter as best they could, and went hack to&#xD;
the real culprit, who stood aloQf laughing as&#xD;
only a pretty hoyden of eighteen can laugh.&#xD;
"Did you ever see any thing more ab-&#xD;
surd?" she cried, as he came toward her.&#xD;
"Of all people in the room, for that ~olemn&#xD;
Mr., Harding to have been knocked over;&#xD;
and then if you could have met thWk in&#xD;
poor Bartlett's eyes when he went ~&#xD;
foremost against him! I am very sormy,~&#xD;
&#xD;
course, for it was all my fault; but I never&#xD;
saw any thing more ridiculous. And what&#xD;
a tremendous thump they made! I fully&#xD;
expected the floor to give way. It certain-&#xD;
ly would have done so, if you had not&#xD;
caught me, Mr. Conway. I am extremely&#xD;
obliged to you, for I am sure that poor boy&#xD;
would have been crushed to death between&#xD;
Mr. Harding and myself; and then Ayre&#xD;
would never have got done laughing at&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Never got done laughing at you for&#xD;
crushing Mr. Bartlett to death? That&#xD;
would be rather a funereal subject for mer-&#xD;
riment, it seems to me. But I hope you&#xD;
are not hurt. It was rather close work."&#xD;
"I hope my dress is not hurt," said she,&#xD;
examining ljhe fleecy clouds of tarletan that&#xD;
enveloped her. "That would be a matter&#xD;
of some importance. Look, please, Mr. Con-&#xD;
way, and see if there are any rents. I am&#xD;
almost sure I heard it tear."&#xD;
Conway looked critically all over the&#xD;
skirt, and comforted her by the assurance&#xD;
that no rents were visible, which she de-&#xD;
clared to be quite providential, since the&#xD;
unhappy Mr. Bartlett had floundered about&#xD;
like a fish on land, or a cat in water, and&#xD;
might have done any amount of mischief.&#xD;
~ I consider it really next thing to a&#xD;
miracle," said she, putting up some locks of&#xD;
ruddy hair that were straying about unbid-&#xD;
den, for, though it was quite early in the&#xD;
evening, her violent exercise had made her&#xD;
look dishevelled before the ordinary time&#xD;
for that appearance. "If you could only&#xD;
imagine all the thinks he did with his feet!&#xD;
Frankly, I don't believe he ever tried to&#xD;
waltz before in his life. ' Is he coming this&#xD;
way again? Oh, for mercy's sake, Mr. Con-&#xD;
way, rescue me. Throw me out of the win-&#xD;
dow, if there is no other mode of escape."&#xD;
"I will do better than that," said Con-&#xD;
way. "Are you too tired for another&#xD;
round?"&#xD;
"Oh, dear no-not too tired for a dozen&#xD;
more rounds with a partner who knows his&#xD;
business."&#xD;
"En auantV' said he, gayly; and, when&#xD;
poor Mr. Bartlett eame up to make his'&#xD;
weak-voiced apologies for having been&#xD;
knocked. ever, he -saw his plirtuer floating&#xD;
&#xD;
round the room in the best of spirits and&#xD;
best of looks, on Philip Conway's arm.&#xD;
Mabel saw it too, and felt more grieved&#xD;
than indignant threat. "He might have&#xD;
waited for me," she thought; but she also&#xD;
thought it natural enough that he had not&#xD;
done so; and instead of being cross to Frank&#xD;
Eaton, according to the general impulse of&#xD;
feminine nature in such cases, she waltzed&#xD;
with~ him for some time, then pleaded fa-&#xD;
tigue, and sat down, looking, indeed; de-&#xD;
cidedly pale and tired.&#xD;
"I don't think I shall dance the next&#xD;
set," she said to Constance; but she glanced&#xD;
down on her tablets the next moment, and&#xD;
shook her head. "I see that I must," she&#xD;
added. "It is Mr. Ainslie's set, and I can-&#xD;
not refuse him, for he was so good about&#xD;
giving up to somebody else before this even-&#xD;
ing. If it were anybody else, now-"&#xD;
But, when Mr. Ainslie came up, he saw&#xD;
at once how weary she looked, and very&#xD;
summarily put all question of the set aside.&#xD;
"You have had more than~enough already&#xD;
of the heat and crowd ,"he said. "Ithink&#xD;
some fresh air would doyou more good than&#xD;
any thing else. Have you admired any of:&#xD;
Conway's scenic effects yet? Let me take&#xD;
you out and show them to you."&#xD;
"Take her, by all means," said Con-&#xD;
stance; and, although Mabel was rather&#xD;
reluctant to go, she made no demur, but&#xD;
submitted to be led away at once.&#xD;
About half an hour after this, Conway&#xD;
came up to Miss Lee in a very ill-humor in-&#xD;
deed.&#xD;
"What has become of Nliss Mabel.?" de-&#xD;
manded he, in much the aggrieved tone of&#xD;
one who has been defrauded of some right-&#xD;
ful and undoubted piece of property. "She&#xD;
threw me overboard in the coolest way im-&#xD;
aginable some time ago; and now I cannQt&#xD;
find her anywhere. What has she done&#xD;
with herself?"&#xD;
"She went out with Mr. Ainslie," said&#xD;
Constance, answering over the heads of&#xD;
two or three intermediate people; for she&#xD;
chanced to be surrounded at the momeilt,&#xD;
being, in her own way, quite popular, espe-&#xD;
cially with men who, were old enough 'to&#xD;
Like to talk sense even in a ballroom, and&#xD;
bhose who were young enough to be in bash-&#xD;

"You will finder iu the grounds, Mr, Con-&#xD;

of an hour ago," vo~unteeredii youthful rep-&#xD;

"You are very good," said Mr. Cosiway,&#xD;
"but I believe I prefer to go myself. I dis-&#xD;

I am afraid you have some interested motive&#xD;
at the bottom. Experience of the world is&#xD;
apt to make one cautious; and after the&#xD;
manner in which I was treated a little while&#xD;
ago-"&#xD;
"Conway, get a partner, and be our&#xD;
vis.d-vis," said a gentleman, hurrying past,&#xD;
with a dark-eyed girl on his arm, who looked&#xD;
back and cried, "0 Mr. Conway, please do."&#xD;
"Conway, have you seen Miss Lavinia's&#xD;
fan anywhere?" said Mr. Harding, coming&#xD;
up with the look and manner of a detective&#xD;
officer. "She has lost it, and somebody said&#xD;
you had it."&#xD;
"How should I have it?" asked Conway,&#xD;
pettishly. "Don't keep me, my dear fellow&#xD;
-I am just now on my way to fulfil an en-&#xD;
gagemnent, and I can't possibly stx~p."&#xD;
"But hold, on; that's it in your j'ocket&#xD;
there," cried Harding, seizing him. "I see&#xD;
the tassel."&#xD;
"Nonsense I you don't."&#xD;
"But I tell you I do."&#xD;
"Where?"&#xD;
"There."&#xD;
He pointed as he spoke, and Conway,&#xD;
looking impatiently down, saw the tassel of&#xD;
a lady's fan hanging from the breast-pocket&#xD;
of his coat. He jerked it out with a laugh,&#xD;
and held it toward the other.&#xD;
~'There, take it!" he said. "I don't&#xD;
know how Miss Lavinia's fan came to be in&#xD;
my pocket. She must have dropped it in&#xD;
her consternation at your accident, and I&#xD;
must have picked it up under the impression&#xD;
that it was Miss Eston's. If there are any&#xD;
mere articles of her property missing, don't&#xD;
come to me for them, I beg."&#xD;
He hurried away1 and Harding retraced&#xD;
his steps toward the owner of the recovered&#xD;
&#xD;
property, congratulating himself as he went&#xD;
that the fan had beei~ recovered with so lit-&#xD;
tie trouble. Naturally, therefore, it was quite&#xD;
a damper when the lady shook her head at&#xD;
first sight of the silk and ivory toy.&#xD;
"It is not mine," she said. "Mine was&#xD;
painted with Chinese figures, and had mara-&#xD;
bout feathers. Who did you take it from,&#xD;
I Mr. Harding?"&#xD;
"From my cousin."&#xD;
"Then I suppose it is Nina Eston's. Yon-&#xD;
der she is, just across the room. Suppose&#xD;
you go and return it to her?"&#xD;
"After a while," answered Mr. Harding;&#xD;
for another waltz had just been struck up,&#xD;
and he had no mind for another collision.&#xD;
"You had better go at once," said his&#xD;
companion, warningly. "If she sees it in&#xD;
your hand, she will come for it; and there&#xD;
is really no telling what sh~ might do in&#xD;
that case. She would think nothing of mak-&#xD;
ing you waltz with her, whether you would&#xD;
or no."&#xD;
"I am not afraid of that," said Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing; but he evidently thought it might be&#xD;
wiser to beard the lioness, instead of wait-&#xD;
ing for the lioness to beard him. So he cau-&#xD;
tiously made his way across the rooni, to&#xD;
where Nina stood, surrounded by a staff of&#xD;
admirers. She received him with a courtesy&#xD;
that somewhat set at rest his fears of a vio-&#xD;
lent assault; but she denied in tote the own-&#xD;
ersliip of the fan.&#xD;
"It is not mine," she said. "I think it&#xD;
Is Mabel's. Who did you say you got it&#xD;
from, Mr. Harding?"&#xD;
"From Conway."&#xD;
" Then of course it is Mabel's," said&#xD;
she, with a laugh. "I wonder you could&#xD;
imagine any thing else. We all know-Is&#xD;

that we all know-Dear me, Frank, take your&#xD;

"We all know that Conway is not likely&#xD;
to have any one else's fan," said Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing, concluding the sentence for her, in his&#xD;
solemn way. Then he went ~back to Miss&#xD;
Crane, and told her that for the present he&#xD;
would retain the property.&#xD;

in one side, while a thicket of luxuriant ~in-&#xD;
dergrowth rose behind. A spot which was&#xD;
as quiet and peaceful as~ there had been no&#xD;
revelry within ear-shot where the odorous&#xD;
midsummer night and the soft rush of the&#xD;
river had all the solitude to themselves, and&#xD;
filled it with a monotone of inexpressible&#xD;
sweetness. Conway arranged a seat for&#xD;
Mabel, and made her lean against the tree,&#xD;
while he himself sat down partly at her&#xD;
side, and partly at her feet. Then there&#xD;
was silence for several moments-silence&#xD;
which Mabel was the first to break.&#xD;
"Mr. Ainslie tells me that you have&#xD;
agreed to defer your departure," she said.&#xD;
"That is good. news for all your friends in&#xD;
Ayre."&#xD;
"Did he?" said Conway, with a start;&#xD;
and, if the darkness had not been all around&#xD;
them, she might haveseen that he frowned&#xD;
~ suddenly. "I wonder he told you; for it&#xD;
is only deferred twenty-four hours. 'We&#xD;
agreed that it would be next thing to bar-&#xD;
barous to start, unless on a matter of life&#xD;
and deaTh, the day after such dissipation as&#xD;
this. So we have put off our move until&#xD;
Friday; but we go then, without fail."&#xD;
"You are determined?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am determined. As I told you&#xD;
before, there is no good in staying any lon-&#xD;
ger."&#xD;
After this,. there was silence again. It&#xD;
was not ~&amp;amp;Iabel's place to combat this reso-&#xD;
lutioxi,'and she h~d not the faintest idea of&#xD;
attempting to do ~o. If she had known that&#xD;
omie ~~ord of hers would influence him to&#xD;
change~his mind, she would hardly have ut-&#xD;
tered that word. It was not in her to do it.&#xD;
Some women, without overstepping the&#xD;
boundary of womanly reserve, can stoop far&#xD;
enough to make their hearts intelligible to&#xD;
hesitating lovers; but this woman was not&#xD;
of that stamp. To a frank question she&#xD;
would have rendered a frank answer; but&#xD;
she could sooner have built a city than tak-&#xD;
en one s~tep toward encouraging that ques-&#xD;
tion. A woman whom there would have&#xD;
been no difficulty in wooing, for she was&#xD;
almost grand in the simplicity of her hones-&#xD;
ty and truth, but a woman whom ne man&#xD;
need hope to gain by half-expressed passion,&#xD;
or tacit avowal. She was perfectly silent,&#xD;
&#xD;
therefore, and it was Conway who spoke&#xD;
next:&#xD;
"Yes, I am determined; there's nothing&#xD;
gained by keeping a sword hanging over&#xD;
one's head, you know. Even if it is to go&#xD;
to one's heart, it might as well go soon as&#xD;
later. Don't you think I am right? Look&#xD;
at the matter from my point of view, and&#xD;
tell me-don't you think I am right?"&#xD;
She could not see his face, for the light&#xD;
was dim, and he did not turn it toward her;&#xD;
but his tone was full of suppressed passion,&#xD;
as they went out in the darkness; and she&#xD;
had to steady her own voice for several min-&#xD;
utes before she could answer as quietly as&#xD;
she wished.&#xD;
"How should I know, Mr. Conway?&#xD;
How should I be able to judge?"&#xD;
"I think you know," he replied, "and&#xD;
I am sure there is no one better able to&#xD;
judge. You cannot tell how hard I have&#xD;
tried to do. right," he went on quickly. "It&#xD;
is not inclination that I consult in going&#xD;
away. With all my talk of Cathay, and the&#xD;
like, Seyton has been so pleasant to me,&#xD;
that I would willingly turn Arcadian for the&#xD;
rest of my life. But 'he needs must whom&#xD;
the devil drives7' and what devil is there&#xD;
like poverty? Sometimes I think I would&#xD;
sell myself as bondsman for my whole *ex-&#xD;
istence to buy one day-one hour-of free-&#xD;
dom now. Sometimes I think-"&#xD;
He broke off abruptly-just in time. Al-&#xD;
ready he had'said more than he meant to say;&#xD;
already he had told her every thing in voice&#xD;
and manner~, if not in words; but there was&#xD;
still time to pause. There was still time to&#xD;
curb himself before ho was committed Vast&#xD;
recall, and he stopped short, resolved to do&#xD;
so.&#xD;
"I am afool," he said, "and more than&#xD;
a fool, to talk to you like this. I have no&#xD;
right to rebel-life is no harder lines to me&#xD;
than to many another poor wretch who is&#xD;
warned away from Paradise by a flaming&#xD;
sword; but it seems hard to leave, certain&#xD;
that in all human probability we shall never&#xD;
meet again."&#xD;
"Why not? You wrn come back to&#xD;

"l~ro," said he, moodily. "No; Isbal~&#xD;

will scarcely be likely to invite me; and&#xD;
you-you will soon forget me."&#xD;
~CYou know better than that!"&#xD;
"How should I know better than that?&#xD;
It is the nature of people to forget those&#xD;
who play no active part in their lives.&#xD;
Tow, I go out of your life to-~norrow, and&#xD;
I shall never enter it again. Years hence,&#xD;
when ~ou are the beautiful Mrs. Somebody,&#xD;
the leader of county fashion, you will re-&#xD;
member me as a poor soldier of fortune who&#xD;
once had the honor of contributing to your&#xD;
amusement."&#xD;
"Ahi"&#xD;
It was a low, faint cry which he wrung&#xD;
from her, and which came to him full of&#xD;
pained reproach, striking with a sudden re-&#xD;
morse a sudden sense of his own impru-&#xD;
dence. The lamp-light did not pierce where&#xD;
they were sitting, but his eyes had by this&#xD;
time grown accustomed to the clear star-&#xD;
light of the June night; and, turning tow-&#xD;
ard her, he saw that she was quivering from&#xD;
head to foot, and only controlled her emo-&#xD;
tion by the strongest possible effort. That&#xD;
sight broka down the last barrier of pru-&#xD;
dence and resolution. They had been grow-&#xD;
ing weaker and weaker, the temptation&#xD;
stronger and stronger for some time, and&#xD;
now they were swept utterly away by the&#xD;
tide of feeling that rushed over him. After&#xD;
all, what were these scruples and hesita-&#xD;
tions but the voice of the world, and what&#xD;
had the world to do with them that night?&#xD;
Better one hour of freedom than a lifetime&#xD;
of bondage-better one long, deep draught&#xD;
of the sweet elixir of love, than to go down&#xD;
to tl~e grave with the cry of the starved&#xD;
heart still unsatisfied. Come what might,&#xD;
he could not leave her thus-he must speak&#xD;
now. If it was only to say farewell, they&#xD;
must say it with heart bared to heart. So&#xD;
he made a sudden movement, and possessed&#xD;
himself of her hands, grasping them tightly,&#xD;
holding them firmly.&#xD;
"Forgive me," he said hurriedly; "for-&#xD;
give me if I have pained you. I did not&#xD;
mean it. I don't think you wrn forget me.&#xD;
I only wish to God that you could! "&#xD;
She looked up at him, with breath half&#xD;
hushed on her lips.&#xD;
"Why do you wish that?" she asked.&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't-don't say any thing more if it is&#xD;
wrong. I will go back now."&#xD;
She made a movement to rise; but he&#xD;
held her, so that it was an impossibility,&#xD;
and spoke-this time without a shade of&#xD;
hesitation.&#xD;
"Why do I wish it? Only because it is&#xD;
selfish and cruel to tell you that I love~ you,&#xD;
to strive, or even to wish to link your life&#xD;
with mine to cloud your bright future with&#xD;
my dark one-and to bind you, by even so&#xD;
much as a memory, to one little worthy, of&#xD;
you. Others can bring something besides&#xD;
themselves; but what have I to offer? A&#xD;
tarnished name, a bankrupt fortune, a-O&#xD;
Mabel, why did I not fight the fight to the&#xD;
end, and go away without having been mad&#xD;
enough to say all this!"&#xD;
of ~ was a strange form for a declaration&#xD;
love; but the earnestness, the sincerity,&#xD;
the passion of his words, thrilled through&#xD;
and through the girl who listened-showing&#xD;
her all at once how dear she was to him,&#xD;
and how he had hesitated for her sake&#xD;
rather than for his own. With this reali-&#xD;
zation, came the consciousness - scarcely&#xD;
understood before-of what he was to her,&#xD;
and the impulse to show him how little she&#xD;
regarded the worldly question that weighed&#xD;
so heavily with him. So, she looked up&#xD;
after a moment, and spoke simply but&#xD;
steadily~&#xD;
"If it is of me. you are thinking, don't&#xD;
regret what you have said. If love is worth&#xD;
any thing at all, it is certainly worth more&#xD;
than all these things of which you speak.&#xD;
You know best whether or not you must&#xD;
go; whether or not we must part to-mor-&#xD;
row; but I know best this-that it is better&#xD;
to part knowing that we love each other,&#xD;
better to have the open right to think of&#xD;
each other, and, it may be, to wait for each&#xD;
other, than to have left that love unspoken&#xD;
perhaps forever. Even if we have to give&#xD;
each other up, I think we can better do it&#xD;
face to face with the knowledge of our own'&#xD;
hearts, than secretly and by stealth. As for&#xD;
these worldly drawbacks, they seem so little&#xD;
to me that I can scarcely realize how you&#xD;
count them so mu~h4 But you may. be&#xD;
right. I cannot tell~ that; 12 can only te~l&#xD;

be richer to the end of our lives for this&#xD;
hour.'7&#xD;
The sweet, clear voice ceased, but the&#xD;
spirit of her words had gone home to her&#xD;
listener's heart more powerfully than if she&#xD;
had spoken with all the eloquence of all the&#xD;
schools, No man knew better than he the&#xD;
manner in which worldly wisdom would re-&#xD;
fute such philosophy no one had ever&#xD;
mocked more openly or more persistently&#xD;
at such sentiments; but, just then, he could&#xD;
sooner have refuted-sooner have mocked&#xD;
an angel from heaven. The knowledge&#xD;
came to him-as it comes to all sooner or&#xD;
later-that there are diviner things on this&#xD;
earth of ours than the bodies we inhabit,&#xD;
and the needs that go with them; that there&#xD;
are powers neither tangible nor material&#xD;
which no man can safely disregard; and&#xD;
that who so constructs a philosophy ignor-&#xD;
ingthese powers, or professing to curb them&#xD;
by the strong hand of force, must pay the&#xD;
penalty of rashness and folly. To the very&#xD;
core of his heart he felli her last words,&#xD;
"Come what'~nay in the future, we will be&#xD;
richer to the end of our lives for this hour"&#xD;
-and he bent down and laid his lips on the&#xD;
hands he still held.&#xD;
"You are right-I am wrong," he said.&#xD;
"Yes; we will be richer always for this&#xD;
hour, and we will not speak of parting.&#xD;
You are mine now, and I shall not sur-&#xD;
render you at any earthly bidding."&#xD;
* Half an hour later Nina Eston was leav-&#xD;
iug the pavilion with Ainslie, when they&#xD;
came upon Mr. Harding just entering it.&#xD;
He looked so singularly pale and disturbed,&#xD;
that both of them paused involuntarily.&#xD;
"Why, Harding! What is the matter?"&#xD;
Ainslie asked.&#xD;
"Have you seen a ghost, Mr. Harding I"&#xD;
the young lady cried.&#xD;
Harding shook his head, and gave a sort&#xD;
of forced smile, as he strove to pass on, but&#xD;
his lips quivered in the effort, and so did his&#xD;
voice when he answered:&#xD;
"Nothing is the matter with me, and I-&#xD;
Ihave not seen any ghost. Can you tell me&#xD;
where Miss Lee is, Ainslie-Miss Constance,&#xD;
I mean? I have her sister's fan in my pos-&#xD;
session, and I want to give it to her."&#xD;
"Why don't you return it to Miss Mabel?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have been looking for her, and-and&#xD;
I cannot find her."&#xD;
"Yonder is Miss Constance, then; but I&#xD;
should not think the possession of a fan&#xD;
would cause you so much uneasiness."&#xD;
"It seems to cause him more than un-&#xD;
easiness," said Miss Eston, as they walked&#xD;
on, while Mr. Harding pursued his way to&#xD;
Constance. "He appears to be seriously&#xD;
troubled, and looks for all the world as if he&#xD;
had seen a ghost."&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE DOSE DY THE WATEE'S EDGE.&#xD;
DAYLIGHT was beginning to break in the&#xD;
east, when Mr. Sexton's boat unloaded a&#xD;
party of very pensive and yawning passen-&#xD;
gers at the foot of Mrs. Lee's garden. The&#xD;
ball was over, midsummer night was past,&#xD;
and the pale faces and crushed dresses&#xD;
looked very little in keeping with the fresh&#xD;
summer morning, whose purple dawn and&#xD;
early birds had shamed their late revelry.&#xD;
Mrs. Lee looked ennu~i~e and pettish, Con-&#xD;
stance seemed. fairly worn out, and Nina&#xD;
Eston, who had been left by her own party,&#xD;
and accepted Mr. Sexton's invitation to re-&#xD;
turn with him, was wearied and dishevelled&#xD;
to the last degree. She had not opened her&#xD;
lips (excepting to yawn), from the island to&#xD;
Ayre; but she landed with alacrity when&#xD;
their destination was once reached, and,&#xD;
having made her acknowledgments to Mr.&#xD;
Seyton, took her brother's arm to go home.&#xD;
"We must make haste, Frank," she said,&#xD;
as they went up the garden-path, and into&#xD;
the back piazza together. "It is growing&#xD;
light very fast, and I am such an object&#xD;
that I would not like to be seen even by a&#xD;
pig. Oh, dear!" (with a tremendous yawn),&#xD;
"I wonder when I ever will get sleep&#xD;
enough again?-Mabel, you surely are not&#xD;
talking about going anywhere to-morrow--&#xD;
to-day, I mean?"&#xD;
She stopped as she spoke, and looked&#xD;
with a sort of sleepy curiosity at Mabel,&#xD;
who was standing on the piaEza-step~ with&#xD;
Conway, and who answered with a smile:&#xD;
"1 am only talking of going on tb~ river&#xD;
&#xD;
late this evening, Nina. We will surely&#xD;
have had sleep enough by that time, won't&#xD;
we?"&#xD;
"I don't know whether you will, but I&#xD;
am sure I shall not.-Mr. Conway, you ought&#xD;
to be ashamed to make such a proposal! She&#xD;
should not go."&#xD;
"Not at six o'clock this evening, Miss&#xD;
Eston?"&#xD;
"Indeed, no; uor at six to-morrow&#xD;
evening, either. Besides, I thought you&#xD;
were going away?"&#xD;
"I thought so myself, but I am really&#xD;
afraid I shall not be able to tear myself&#xD;
from Ayre.-Don't forget,~~ he went on,&#xD;
turning to Mabel, "that you need not feel&#xD;
bound to go if you are tired."&#xD;
t~TIierp is no fear of my being tired,"&#xD;
Mabel answered; while Nina shrugged her&#xD;
shoulders, and went on into the house. "I&#xD;
will be ready for you. And, Philip-"&#xD;
"Mic&amp;amp; cc&amp;amp;ra?"&#xD;
"Shall I tell Constance and. mamma&#xD;
now, or shall I wait for you to do so?"&#xD;
Conway hesitated; then answered, on&#xD;
the spur of the moment:&#xD;
"Wait-a little while, at least. I owe&#xD;
it to my uncle to speak to him at once; and&#xD;
then we will see about the rest. That is--&#xD;
but you had better do as you think best. If&#xD;
the opportunity offers, tell them, and-"&#xD;
"Conway, we are waiting for you,"&#xD;
came Ainslie's voice from the boat.&#xD;
"I must go," said he, reluctantly. "I&#xD;
will see you this afternoon. Good-by."&#xD;
"Good-by," she echoed, drawing her&#xD;
hand gently from the lingering clasp of his.&#xD;
Then she watched him down the garden-&#xD;
path, until ho vanished from sight; and, af-&#xD;
ter he' was finally gone, turned, and entered&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
She found that Nina and Frank had tak-&#xD;
en' their departure, while Mrs. Lee had F&#xD;
thrown herself into a chair, and declared&#xD;
that she was too tired to go up-stairs.&#xD;
"I knew I should be fatigued to death,"&#xD;
she said; "but then nobody minds me-no-&#xD;
body ever did, for that matter. I only hope&#xD;
I shall not have one of my nervous attacks t&#xD;
to pay for it."               '&#xD;
"I hope not, I am sure," said Constance, I,&#xD;
very sincerely. "But, if you are so tired, ~&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
mamma, you. ought to go to bed. Shall I&#xD;
help you up-stairs?"&#xD;
"No," answered Mrs. Lee, snappishly.&#xD;
"I can drag myself up-stairs by myself.&#xD;
You need not trouble yourself~ Constance.&#xD;
It makes no matter about what I endure.&#xD;
I must only beg that you will not talk any&#xD;
in your room to-night, or I shall not sleep a&#xD;
wink."&#xD;
"Certainly we shall not, mamma, if you&#xD;
desire not. Indeed, we should hardly have&#xD;
been likely to talk any way. Mabel must&#xD;
go to sleep, and I am very tired."&#xD;
"I am often kept awake by your talk-&#xD;
ing," said Mrs. Lee, fretfully. "I have&#xD;
meant to speak about it several times; but,&#xD;
then, I bear a great deal, sooner than com-&#xD;
plain. Nobody could ever say of me that I&#xD;
complain, without great provocation. I as-&#xD;
sure you of that, Constance."&#xD;
"Yes, mamma."&#xD;
"And I beg, therefore, that there may&#xD;
not be even so much as one word spoken to-&#xD;
night. Talking is not necessary to undress-&#xD;
ing; and, before you go to bed, I wish you&#xD;
would bring me a glass of warm sangaree.&#xD;
It may make me sleep."&#xD;
"Will not cold do, mamma? None of the&#xD;
servants are awake, and there is no fire. I&#xD;
don't see how I could get any warm water."&#xD;
"It is always the way whenever Iwant&#xD;
any thing," said Mrs. Lee, injuredly.&#xD;
"Heaven knows it is seldom enough I&#xD;
make any demands on other. people's time&#xD;
or patience; and yet this is always theway.&#xD;
If I were like some people, and gave a great&#xD;
feal of trouble, I might be attended to; but,&#xD;
as it is, you need not trouble yourself about&#xD;
bhe sangaree. I can go to bed; yes, and&#xD;
stay awake, too, without it."&#xD;
"If cold will do, mamma-"&#xD;
"Cold will noC do. I abominate cold&#xD;
;angaree. Give me a candle, unless I am to&#xD;
~o to bed in the dark, and let me try to get&#xD;
little rest, at least."&#xD;
Constance brought the candle very&#xD;
quietly , an&amp;amp; lighted her up-stairs with it.&#xD;
rhen she came down again to find the ma-&#xD;
erials for the cold sangaree, which, after&#xD;
lie was in her' chamber, Mrs. Lee* gracious.&#xD;
y agreed to take, and bade Mabel go to bed&#xD;
withoutt waiting for her.&#xD;

"I will come as soon as I can, dear1"&#xD;
she said; "but go to bed yourself; and be&#xD;
sure you go to sleep."&#xD;
"I will try," said Mabel. Then she&#xD;
kissed her, and went up-stairs.&#xD;
It took Constance some time to find a&#xD;
initmeg for her sangaree, and when at last&#xD;
she had administered it, and entered her&#xD;
own room, she found that Mabel's trying&#xD;
bad resulted better than she herself had ex-&#xD;
pected; for she was fast asleep, lying back&#xD;
on the pillows, in the attitude of a tired&#xD;
child, and breathing with the gentle regu-&#xD;
larity of profound sleep.&#xD;
"I am so glad!" thought tha patient,&#xD;
tired~ ~elder sister; and she extinguished&#xD;
the -eandle at once, and knelt down to say&#xD;
her prayers in the early, purple dawn.&#xD;
The purple dawn had changed to broad,&#xD;
bright afternoon, however, when Mabel at&#xD;
last awoke with a start. She looked about&#xD;
her, somewhat bewildered for a moment,&#xD;
~woudering what she was doing in bed at&#xD;
that hour of the day, and why the house&#xD;
wa~ sd quiet. But the next instant, recol-&#xD;
lection flashed over her-the ball, her bright&#xD;
gala-dress, her gay reign of enjoyment and&#xD;
triumph, the lights, the music, the dancing,&#xD;
all caineback at once; and with them another&#xD;
yet brighter and sweeter memory-a mem-&#xD;
ory which caused the warm blood to rush&#xD;
over eirery portion of the fair skin which&#xD;
was visible; and, although she was all alone&#xD;
in the room, made her bend her~face down,&#xD;
and cover it with herhands, while a tide of&#xD;
golden hair fell heavily all about her. It&#xD;
was trpe, then~-~-he had spoken! He had&#xD;
told her thathe loved her, he had asked her&#xD;
to sharehis fortune for good or. for ill, to the&#xD;
end of their lives; he had made her under-&#xD;
stand how fair and sweet and lovely every&#xD;
thing.that she did or said was in his eyes.&#xD;
And she-~--ah, she clasped her hands and&#xD;
wondered if he even half guessed how in-&#xD;
finitely dear he was to her, this stranger,&#xD;
ttds knight-errant, this fairy prince who had&#xD;
eiitered her life like a dream, and made it&#xD;
oneklOng story ofomanoe.&#xD;
Itwas no wonder that she lingered long&#xD;
over her, toilet~ he had said that he was&#xD;
&amp;amp;~ihhig thiit afternoon, and she must dress&#xD;
for him. What a labor of love that dress-&#xD;
&#xD;
lag was; and 'when at last she came down,&#xD;
and opened the sitting-room door, how fair&#xD;
and sweet she looked to Constance's loving&#xD;
eyes, arrayed in a white muslin that had&#xD;
just come pure and spotless from under&#xD;
Nancy's smoothing-iron, and with a cluster&#xD;
of blush-roses in her breast!&#xD;
"Come in, dear, but don't make a noise,~~&#xD;
said Constance, in a low voice. "Mamma&#xD;
waked with a nervous headache~ so she is&#xD;
still in bed, and we must be very careful.&#xD;
How pretty you look; and not at all as if&#xD;
you had danced all night."&#xD;
"That is because I have slept all day,"&#xD;
said Mabel, with a smile. "When did you&#xD;
get up, Constance? And why did you let&#xD;
me be so lazy?"&#xD;
"I got up long ago," answered Con-&#xD;
stance, as she rang a bell near her hand;&#xD;
"and as for your being lazy, I was only too&#xD;
glad to see you sleeping.-Bring in Mabel's&#xD;
dinner, Nancy," she added, as. a black face,&#xD;
surmounted by a red-and-yellow turban, ap-&#xD;
peared at the door.&#xD;
"Dinner!" repeated Mabel, in dismay,&#xD;
"Is it so late. Did you finish dinner while&#xD;
I was in bed?"&#xD;
"It is nearly five o'clock," said Con-&#xD;
stance. "I finished my dinner some time&#xD;
ago, and-but there is mamma a bell."&#xD;
~. A tinkle was heard in the upper regions,&#xD;
whereupon down went her work, and away&#xD;
she went, to answer a demand for the bot-&#xD;
tle of cologne, or something equally impor-&#xD;
taut.&#xD;
Mabel wandered to the garden-door, and&#xD;
stood looking out at the river, that gleamed&#xD;
by under the sweeping willows-that river&#xD;
that would bring her lover to her after a&#xD;
while-when Nancy came in with a tyay,&#xD;
bearing a cup of coffee, a broiled chicken,&#xD;
two or three of the light rolls on W~iich&#xD;
Nancy prided herself; and a feathery ome-&#xD;
let.&#xD;
"It's a deal morS like a breakfast than a&#xD;
dinner, heney," she said, as she set it down,&#xD;
"but Miss Constance would have it so;&#xD;
and vegetables don't keep warm good, no&#xD;
how, so there was a nice corn-pudding and&#xD;
potatoes for dinner, not to spbak of the&#xD;

THE ROSE BY TUE WATER'S EDGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
bel, turning round; and, indeed, it proved&#xD;
to be much' more than she eared for. It&#xD;
must be a singular sort of person who has&#xD;
any appetite the day after dancing all night;&#xD;
and, although Mabel drank her coffee, and&#xD;
was very glad of it, the rest of the dinner&#xD;
did not receive similar appreciation. She&#xD;
trifled over the chicken and rolls, but her&#xD;
absolute consumption came to so little, that&#xD;
she was forced t~ call in the friendly and&#xD;
willing assistance of a large cat, who was&#xD;
washing her paws in the depths of Con-&#xD;
stance's work-basket. With this aid, the&#xD;
dinner had been partially, at least, dis-&#xD;
patched, when Constance herself came&#xD;
back. Now was Mabel's time to tell her&#xD;
sister all the last night's history; hut, as&#xD;
she looked up, meaning to do so, she was&#xD;
startled l~y the pallid aspect of the face at&#xD;
which she gazed, and she forgot her own&#xD;
story in sudden anxiety.&#xD;
"What is the matter, dear?" she asked.&#xD;
"I never saw you look worse. Is it only&#xD;
because of the ball? Dissipation does not&#xD;
seem to agree with you."&#xD;
"It is only because lam a little tired,&#xD;
and my head aches," Constance answered.&#xD;
"Nothing much is the matter. Don't&#xD;
trouble about me."&#xD;
" Nobody ever does trouble about you,~~&#xD;
said Mabel, a little indignantly; "and that&#xD;
is the reason why you fag yourself to death.&#xD;
My darling, you are the best one of us, and&#xD;
you bear all the burden. It seems so hard."&#xD;
"No; not hard at all," said Constance;&#xD;
but, nevertheless, she laid her head down&#xD;
right wearily on the soft shoulder 'that was&#xD;
near, as Mabel came aiA put her arms about&#xD;
her. Nobody knew how much of the pain&#xD;
and the weariness thoseclinging arms took&#xD;
away, nor how doubly hard a burden Con-&#xD;
stance would willingly have borne for this&#xD;
reward.&#xD;
The ~wo sisters were still standing to-&#xD;
gether, wl~ien there came another sharp tin-&#xD;
kle, and Mabel said, with a half-impatient&#xD;
sigh:&#xD;
"Mamma's bell again. 'Let me go this&#xD;
time, and do you stay here and take a cup&#xD;
of coffee."&#xD;
"No, no," said Constance. "You know&#xD;
inamma~does not like any one but me in her&#xD;
&#xD;
room, when she has these attacks. And, as&#xD;
for the coffee-I bad some at dinner. Let&#xD;
me go, dear."&#xD;
"If you will," said Mabel; but she kissed&#xD;
her before doing so. "You dear, dear sis-&#xD;
ter," she said. If I were ever so miserable&#xD;
in any other way, Constance, I don't think&#xD;
I should be utterly forlorn while .1 had&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"And you are the very sunlight of my&#xD;
life," said the other, passionately; and then&#xD;
she laughed a little. "We are growing&#xD;
quite sentimental; and I, at least, ought to&#xD;
be too old for that. Come, let me go.&#xD;
There is the bell again'&#xD;
Mabel let her go, but she took tip h&amp;amp;&#xD;
hat, and the volume of Browning, at the&#xD;
same moment.&#xD;
"If I am to be left alone," she said, "I&#xD;
am going into the garden. Will you come&#xD;
after mamma is done with you I"&#xD;
"I am afraid I cannot. She may want&#xD;
me again at any moment. Don't let' me&#xD;
keep you in, though. Only please don't go&#xD;
on the river to-day. I am a little uneasy&#xD;
about you. You are not used to such fa-&#xD;
tigue as that of last night."&#xD;
"But it agrees with me excellently.&#xD;
lElowever, I won't go on the river, if you&#xD;
say not. I can't stay here, though, and.&#xD;
face Nancy when she sees that onielet.&#xD;
Tell. mamma I am so sorry about her head-&#xD;
ache, and-"&#xD;
Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle!&#xD;
"Go, go," said Mabel, laughingly, as she&#xD;
pushed her sister toward the door. "Main-&#xD;
ma must be dreadfully impatient, or she&#xD;
would not ring in that way. Give her my&#xD;
love, and ccme to the garden, if you can."&#xD;
She waved her hand gayl~, and flitted&#xD;
out of the open door. The last thing Con-&#xD;
stance saw, as she herself left the room, was&#xD;
a flutter of the white dress among the green&#xD;
shrubs outside.&#xD;
An hour or two later Mr. Nowell came&#xD;
in, and found Constance sitting alone in her&#xD;
usual seat, busily engaged.in her usual work.&#xD;
She looked up as be entered, and gave him&#xD;
the same caution she had given Mabel.&#xD;
"Good-day, Francis. Don't make a&#xD;
noise, please. Mamma is very unwell."&#xD;
"Just as I expected," said Mr. Nowell,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8069-00000045"/>&#xD;
with a little air of triumph. "I said from&#xD;
the first this would be the result of your&#xD;
island folly. And Mabel -is she sick,&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
"The farthest in the world from it,"&#xD;
answered his cousin, smiling. "I never&#xD;
saw her look more blooming than she does&#xD;
to-day. And I really don't think the island&#xD;
folly, as you call it, had any thing to do&#xD;
with mamma's indispositions. It is just one&#xD;
of her usual headaches."&#xD;
"'It may boone of her usual headaches;&#xD;
but, no doubt, the exposure of last night&#xD;
gave it to her. I am glad to hear that M:a~-&#xD;
bel is well, for I was afraid- Whore is she?&#xD;
In bed yet?"&#xD;
"No. She came down an hour ago, and&#xD;
went into the garden. You will find her in&#xD;
the arbor, probably."&#xD;
"Won't you come with me?"&#xD;
"I believe not. I must be within hear-&#xD;
ing of mamma's bell."&#xD;
He went away without further apology,&#xD;
for he stood very little on ceremony in his&#xD;
aunt's house, and he was more anxious to&#xD;
see Mabel, and make some amends for his&#xD;
ungracious refusal of the night before, than&#xD;
he cared to acknowledge even to him-&#xD;
self. The remembrance of his hardness had&#xD;
tormented him unspeakably, and he went to&#xD;
seek her in a strangely softened mood-a&#xD;
mood which melted even his rugged face&#xD;
into something like gentleness.&#xD;
Constancel's swift needle had not trav-&#xD;
elled over more than one short seam, before&#xD;
he returned, looking vexed and disappointed.&#xD;
"You sent me on a bootless errand," he&#xD;
said. "She is not there."&#xD;
"Not there!" repeated Constance, won-&#xD;
deringly. "She must be there, for she is&#xD;
not in the house, and I am sure she has not&#xD;
gone out. You did not look well, Fran-&#xD;
cis.',&#xD;
"I went to the arbor first, and then&#xD;
walked round the garden," he answered.&#xD;
"If you don't call that looking well-But&#xD;
she is not there. l~erhaps she is up-stairs?"&#xD;
"No. I was in her room ten minnte0&#xD;
ago. I assure you she went into the garden,&#xD;
and if she is not there she must have gone&#xD;
on the river. Yet that cannot be, for I&#xD;
asked hernot to do so."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I doubt if your asking would avail&#xD;
much, if Mr. Conway brought his boat and&#xD;
persuaded her."&#xD;
"Yes, it would. Mabel never broke a&#xD;
promise in her life; and she promised me&#xD;
not to go on the river this afternoon."&#xD;
"Promised?"&#xD;
"Yes; promised."&#xD;
"Humph I" said Mr. Nowell, dryly.&#xD;
"Come, and let us see."&#xD;
"As you please," she answered; "but I&#xD;
know I am right."&#xD;
She put aside her work, and went down&#xD;
the garden-path to the arbor. Mabel had&#xD;
been there, evidently, for a chair was drawn&#xD;
before the table, where the volume of&#xD;
Browning lay open, with. her handkerchief&#xD;
and one of the blush-roses marking the&#xD;
page.&#xD;
"She is near by somewhere," said Con-&#xD;
stance; "in the orchard, perhaps' And&#xD;
she sent her voice through the calm summer&#xD;
afternoon, with the clearness of a bell, call-&#xD;
ing again and again her sister's name, but&#xD;
no answer was returned.&#xD;
"Now come down to the steps," said&#xD;
Nowell, who had stood by silent. "Per-&#xD;
haps we may find some trace of her there,&#xD;
despite your incredulity."&#xD;
Constance shook her head; but shewent&#xD;
along with him, and they soon reached the&#xD;
landing-place, which was as silent and de-&#xD;
serted as the arbor.&#xD;
"Yousee," she said, triumphantly.&#xD;
A' Yes, I see," answered her cousin, quiet-&#xD;
ly, and he pointed to a mark on the wet&#xD;
sand, which had evidently been lately made&#xD;
by the prow of a boat."&#xD;
"You forget," said Constance, "the&#xD;
boat this morning.&#xD;
"That was never made by a twelve-oar&#xD;
boat," he replied, sharply. "It is the mark&#xD;
of a skiff; and, instead of being made this&#xD;
morning, it has been done within the last&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
"I scarcely think so."&#xD;
"Perhaps this will convince you, then,"&#xD;
and, suddenly stooping down, he took up&#xD;
something which lay just at the foot of the&#xD;
steps, by the water's edge. Turning to Con-&#xD;
stauce, he placed it in her hand.&#xD;
It was one of the blush-roses.&#xD;

not to come home after dark. Constance suddenly gave an exclamation of&#xD;

in substance, though far from reasonably in "Of course Mabel is with him. No-she&#xD;

and glancing quickly around, as he did so.&#xD;
"Mr. Nowehl, good-morning. I am glad to&#xD;
see, ladies, that you have not suffered from&#xD;
our dissipation. Miss Mabel is not indis-&#xD;
posed, I hope?"&#xD;
He was astonished at the singular effect&#xD;
which this simple question produced. There&#xD;
was an instant's silence, while cold upon the&#xD;
heart of each of his three hearers flashed&#xD;
the conviction that Mabel's absence, which&#xD;
had seemed to them a moment ago only "a&#xD;
little strange," was, in truth, unaccountable.&#xD;
They gazed at Conway without speaking;&#xD;
Mrs. Lee in bewildered surprise, Newell&#xD;
with stern scrutiny, and Constance with a&#xD;
startled and doubting look, that was quite&#xD;
inexplicable to him.. But she was the first&#xD;
to recover self-possession, and the very hor-&#xD;
ror of the undefined dread which had mo-&#xD;
mentarily seized her made her throw it off&#xD;
with incredulity.&#xD;
She forced a laugh, as she exclaimed, in&#xD;
a tone which, notwithstanding its cheerful-&#xD;
ness, was not quite steady:&#xD;
"I was just going to ask you about Ma-&#xD;
bel, Mr. Conway. Why did she not come&#xD;
with you? Mamma has been a little un-&#xD;
easy about her."&#xD;
It was Conway's turn to be stricken&#xD;
dumb with amaze and apprehension.&#xD;
"I do not understand," he said at last.&#xD;
"I have not seen Miss Mabel. Is she not at&#xD;
home?"&#xD;
"Did you not come for her yesterday&#xD;
afternoon? Is she not at Seyton House?"&#xD;
asked Constance, eagerly.&#xD;
"Certainly not. I have not seen her&#xD;
since yesterday morning!"&#xD;
Again there was a moment of blank si-&#xD;
lence, while glances of deepening astonish-&#xD;
ment and dismay were exchanged, and again&#xD;
Constance was the first to speak. By an ef-&#xD;
fort, she spoke with composure.&#xD;
"No wonder you are astonished, Mr.&#xD;
Conway. I suppose we are looking and act-&#xD;
ing very strangely. But we cannot help&#xD;
feeling a little uneasy about Mabel, now&#xD;
that we hear she is not at Seyton House.&#xD;
Are you sure she is not there?" she cried,&#xD;
suddenly. "Perhaps she told you jestingly&#xD;
to say she was not. But no; that is not&#xD;
1lke-~."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What do you mean?" demanded Con-&#xD;
way, in great agitation.&#xD;
"Mabel left home yesterday afternoon,&#xD;
and has not yet returned. We thought, of&#xD;
course, that she had gone with you on the&#xD;
river, and stopped at Seyton House. She&#xD;
must have gonewith somebody else. Per-&#xD;
haps the Estons or Bradfords called at the&#xD;
landing, and persuaded her to go with them.&#xD;
Yes, she must have gone with them. It is&#xD;
very foolish of us to be alarmed in this way.&#xD;
-Francis, go and bring her home. It is&#xD;
foolish t~ be uneasy, but-"&#xD;
Mrs. Lee, who had sat as if paralyzed&#xD;
during the preceding minutes, recovered the&#xD;
power of speech, as she saw Nowell silently&#xD;
hurry out of the room to do Constance's&#xD;
bidding.&#xD;
"Oh, she is drowned I I am sure she is&#xD;
drowned!" she cried, in a shrill, excited&#xD;
tone. "You said you found that rose by&#xD;
the river. She is drowned. Oh, my poor&#xD;
child is drowned!"&#xD;
"What is that about the river?" de-&#xD;
manded Conway, growing very pale. "For&#xD;
God's sake, tell me!"&#xD;
Constance explained in a few words,&#xD;
while, unnoticed by either of her compan-&#xD;
ions, Mrs. Lee went off into something very&#xD;
nearly approaching to violent hysterics.&#xD;
"I see no reasonable cause for alarm,"&#xD;
Conway said, in a tone which reassured&#xD;
Constance, although she observed how pale&#xD;
he had become. "No doubt she went on&#xD;
the. river with some of her friends, and, be-&#xD;
ing late, spent the night with them. She&#xD;
may cotue in any moment. Meanwhile, I&#xD;
will look for her. Tell me wI~tere to go."&#xD;
Constance ran over half~4ozen places&#xD;
quickly, to not one of whkt~ at another&#xD;
time, would she have considered it probable&#xD;
that Mabel had gone, and, almost before she&#xD;
finished, Conway disappeared. Then she&#xD;
called Nancy, and sent her in another direc-&#xD;
tion, while she herself ran down to the land-&#xD;
ing in the vague hope of seeing Mabel com-&#xD;
ing home. The deep, clear water made her&#xD;
shudder: and there was nothing to be seen,&#xD;
so she hastened back again into the house,&#xD;
and found her mother just issuing from the&#xD;
front door bonnetless and distracted.&#xD;
"I must go and look for my child," she&#xD;
&#xD;
cried, vehemently, as Constance, catchin~&#xD;
her arm, tried to draw her back. "Let m&#xD;
go-I must look for her. 0 Mabel, Ma&#xD;
bel, where are you? Mabel, don't you hea:&#xD;
me? Mabel-"&#xD;
"Mammahush!" said Constance, am&#xD;
she drew her into the sitting-room by maiz&#xD;
force, for her voice had risen at the jas&#xD;
words into a scream, which rang shrilly uj&#xD;
and down the quiet village street. "Main&#xD;
ma, for Heaven's sake, don't! We are ~er~&#xD;
foolish, I dare say. Mabel must be some&#xD;
where. She will be here presently-she h&#xD;
sure to come. Francis and Mr. Conway ar&#xD;
both looking fo# her, and-O Father Law-&#xD;
rence-"&#xD;
She broke off thus, as a shadow dark-&#xD;
ened the door, and a tall, spare man, in thc&#xD;
garb of a Catholic priest, caine hurriedly in-&#xD;
to the room.&#xD;
"My child," he said, "I met your cousin&#xD;
on the street a moment ago, and the news&#xD;
he told me has brought me at once-"&#xD;
"He has not found her then, father?"&#xD;
"No; but he was hurrying on to the&#xD;
Bradt'ords, hoping she might be there. My&#xD;
dear child, I trust you are not seriously&#xD;
alarmed, for it seems tome that the cause&#xD;
for fear is very slight."&#xD;
"But it is so unlike Mabel, father."&#xD;
"We cannot say that. No exigency of&#xD;
the sort has ever occurred before-that is&#xD;
all. We cannot judge; but I see your&#xD;
mother is quite overcome."&#xD;
"Speak to her, father. See if you can&#xD;
reassure her."&#xD;
The good priest-for no one could look&#xD;
in his face an~ meet his sweet, calm glance,&#xD;
without feelld~oure that he was good-&#xD;
drew near, an4 bent over Mrs. Lee, who lay&#xD;
on the sofa. "My child," he said, "my&#xD;
poor child, look up. You are very prema-&#xD;
ture in this excess of grief. God is very&#xD;
good to ~us, and never tries us beyond our&#xD;
strength. I think Mabel will return. I&#xD;
hope she will soon be in your arms. But,&#xD;
meanwhile, try to make an act of resigna-&#xD;
tion, and leave her to Him; try to remem-&#xD;
ber__"&#xD;
The cliok of the front gate at that mo-&#xD;
ment made Constance spring to her feet.&#xD;
The next instant she had left the room and&#xD;
&#xD;
met Nowell in the hail. His face told at&#xD;
a once that his search had been fruitless.&#xD;
"Well?" she gasped.&#xD;
r "I can hear nothing of her," ho an-&#xD;
swered; "and I have been to every prob-&#xD;
I able house in town. Call Nancy at once,&#xD;
i and let me hear her story of the boat she&#xD;
heard."&#xD;
"Nancy is not here now; I sent her out&#xD;
- also. I would have gone myself, but main-&#xD;
ma-ah, there she is now!"&#xD;
There was another click of the gate&#xD;
as she spoke, and Nancy came up the walk&#xD;
shaking her head dismally after the manner&#xD;
of her kind.&#xD;
"No news, ~&#xD;
"Nobody has seed or heard a thing of&#xD;
her, ma'ain. A great many of the gentle-&#xD;
* men said they was coming to help look for&#xD;
her, ma'am-but Mr. Nowell, he told 'em&#xD;
* not-and the sweet child may be dead and&#xD;
drownded-"&#xD;
"Hold your tongue! "said Nowell, short~&#xD;
ly. "Yes, I told them not to come. Ma-&#xD;
bel is certainly not lost in that way. Now&#xD;
tell me quickly and distinctly what you&#xD;
know about a boat coming yesterday.after-&#xD;
noon."&#xD;
"I knows no moi-e 'an I does know,~~&#xD;
said Nancy, sullenly. She could not bear&#xD;
Newell, and, even when her heart was&#xD;
wrung with grief, the dislike came over her&#xD;
at his peremptory tone. "I heard a boat&#xD;
-that was all."&#xD;
"But what did you see?"&#xD;
"I never seed nothing."&#xD;
"What did you hear, then? Be quick&#xD;
about it!"&#xD;
"Tell every thing, Nancy, for Heaven's&#xD;
sake!" said Constance.&#xD;
So adjured, Nancy told all, which was&#xD;
briefly this: She had been ironing in the&#xD;
kitchen, the afternoon before, and, ds her&#xD;
table was just placed under an open window,&#xD;
she had heard the arrival of a boat at the&#xD;
landing-place. A little while after she wa~&#xD;
crossing the yard to hang out some clothes,&#xD;
and then she caught the sound of voices in&#xD;
the arbor, one of which was Mabel's, and&#xD;
the other that of a man. Here Newell in-&#xD;
terrupted her. Did she recognize the man's&#xD;
voice? No; she did not recognize it at aU.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8069-00000047"/>&#xD;
90                           MABEL LEE.                                                                 CONFLICTING EVIDENCE.                    91&#xD;
&#xD;
It was not like anybody's voice she knew;&#xD;
but then she didn't pretend to know many&#xD;
folks. Was it like Mr. Conway's? Nancy&#xD;
could not say, knowing nothing about Mr.&#xD;
Conway's voice. Well, what kind of talk-&#xD;
ing did it seem to be? Very well pleased,&#xD;
as far as she could judge. She heard them&#xD;
both laugh several times; and, the window&#xD;
being open, she heard Miss Mabel's voice&#xD;
when they were going down to the boat.&#xD;
Did she hear what they said? No, not a&#xD;
word, only a murmur of laughing and talk-&#xD;
ing, and after a while the rattle of a chain,&#xD;
as the boat was unfastened, and the -sound&#xD;
of oars in the water-that was all. Noth-&#xD;
ingelse? Nothing else at all.&#xD;
"You may go, then," said Mr. Nowell;&#xD;
and, after she was gone, tossing her head in&#xD;
high offence, he looked steadily and silently&#xD;
at Constance.&#xD;
"What is it, Francis?" she asked.&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake, speak! Any thing is&#xD;
better than this."&#xD;
"Do you want to hear my opinion, Con-&#xD;
stance?"&#xD;
"Yes, yes-you know I do."&#xD;
"It is that the viper you have been&#xD;
nursing among you all has stung you at last.&#xD;
The man you have trusted has betrayed you,&#xD;
as I told you, from the first, it was in him to&#xD;
betray."&#xD;
"Do you mean Mr. Conway?"&#xD;
"Who else should I mean? Who else&#xD;
would Mabel accompany in the way you&#xD;
have heard described?"&#xD;
"But, my God !-what do you suspect&#xD;
him of?&#xD;
"How can I tell? I am not a villain,&#xD;
and I cannot read a villain's heart. He may&#xD;
have carried her off to marry her, and es-&#xD;
tablish a claim on Mr. Seyton-or he may&#xD;
have murdered her to put her out of his&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"Hush, hush!" cried Constance, ex-&#xD;
tending her hand with a gesture of horror.&#xD;
"0 Francis, that you can be so cruelly un-&#xD;
just! You saw him when he heard the&#xD;
news;~ you saw his astonishment, his agita-&#xD;
tion-he could not have simulated it."&#xD;
"I believe that he could simulate any&#xD;
thing. I believe that he has carried off&#xD;
Mabel, and, by the God above us, if I find&#xD;
&#xD;
even so much as a shadow of proof against&#xD;
him-"&#xD;
"Rush!" cried Constance again, and&#xD;
there was a tone of almost solemn command&#xD;
in her voice. "This is no time for such&#xD;
threats. Who cares for proof against him?&#xD;
Find her for me, Francis-" and the voice&#xD;
changed to a wail of agony-" you do not&#xD;
mean that any serious harm has befallen&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
He took her by the shoulders and put&#xD;
her out of his path without a word. Then,&#xD;
as he was going, he turned and looked back&#xD;
at her.&#xD;
"You pray to God," he said. "I go to&#xD;
find her."&#xD;
-4---&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
CONFLICTING EvIDENCE.&#xD;
TWENTY-FOUR hours later, it was a very&#xD;
weary and worn-out group of men who as-&#xD;
sembled in Mr. Seyton's library, where Mr.&#xD;
Seyton himself sat, pale and haggard, with&#xD;
the wan, stricken aspect of an old man,&#xD;
under the sudden grief that had fallen upon&#xD;
him. After twenty-four hours of constant&#xD;
search, not a trace of Mabel Lee had been&#xD;
discovered; and the searchers now as-&#xD;
sembled after their fruitless exertions to&#xD;
consult concerning what steps were to be&#xD;
taken next.&#xD;
Besides Mr. Seyton, Philip Conway was&#xD;
the only sitting figure; but he, who until&#xD;
now had not taken a moment's rest since&#xD;
he first heard the news of Mabel's disappear-&#xD;
ance, was so utterly exhausted- that he had&#xD;
flung himself half unconsciously into a chair&#xD;
as soon as he entered the apartment, and&#xD;
sat in an attitude of profound dejection-his&#xD;
head drooped, his eyes fixed on the floor,&#xD;
and apparently heedless of all around. Near&#xD;
him stood Ainslie, slowly drawing off a pair&#xD;
of riding-gloves, and listening the while at-&#xD;
tentively to Mr. Blake, who was briefly de-&#xD;
tailing the failure of his efforts, though he&#xD;
had spent the day and the night in the sad-&#xD;
dle-a fact which was at once very evident,&#xD;
for his boots were splashed with mud, his&#xD;
clothes covered with dust, and his usually&#xD;
&#xD;
ruddy and genial face, hollow and overcast.&#xD;
:Next to him Francis Nowell stood, leaning&#xD;
on the back of a tall chair, in the seat of&#xD;
which he had thrown his hat-a riding-&#xD;
whip still in his hand, and his eyes fastened&#xD;
steadily and ominously on the unheeding&#xD;
Conway. He, too, showed unmistakable&#xD;
traces of the wear and tear of physical fa-&#xD;
tigue and mental suffering; and even his&#xD;
friends might scarcely have recognized in&#xD;
his haggard face and sunken eyes the man&#xD;
they were accustomed to see. The only one&#xD;
of the group whose appearance had not al-&#xD;
tered in the least, but who seemed quite his&#xD;
usual self, with a shade, perhaps, of ad-&#xD;
ditional solemnity, was Mr. harding, whose&#xD;
head and shoulders loomed up behind Mr.&#xD;
Seyton's chair. He had made some pre-&#xD;
tence of joining in the search the day be-&#xD;
fore; but had returned to the house in the&#xD;
evening, and spent the night quietly in bed.&#xD;
"There is no trace or clew whatever,&#xD;
sir," said Blake, "excepting the confused&#xD;
story of a boat, which Mrs. Lee's cook tells.&#xD;
Miss Constance thinks that her. sister must&#xD;
have fallen into the river; and the Ayre&#xD;
people are dragging the stream. But, for&#xD;
my part-"&#xD;
"It is sheer folly!" broke in Nowell,&#xD;
sternly. "They must be made to think&#xD;
that Mabel could fall into the river. Let&#xD;
them drag it if they choose; but it is not&#xD;
there-it is not in the river-that she must&#xD;
be sought."&#xD;
"The matter is so unaccountably ulyste-&#xD;
rious," said Ainslie, "that it is almost im-&#xD;
possible to decide on our next course of ac-&#xD;
tion. If we had only the faintest clew to&#xD;
guide us-but I am afraid the cook's story&#xD;
does not furnish one."&#xD;
"That remains to be seen," said Nowell,&#xD;
speaking in the same repressed voice as&#xD;
before, and coming forward to the table&#xD;
round which they were all grouped. "The&#xD;
cook's story proves this much," he went on,&#xD;
emphatically, "that some boat did arrive&#xD;
on that afternoon, and that Mabel accom-&#xD;
panied some person or persons on the river.&#xD;
What we liave to do is to find that boat,&#xD;
and that person or those persons.~~&#xD;
"Well?" said Mr. Seyton, in the tone&#xD;
of " go ~&#xD;
&#xD;
"1 will begin, sir, by asking you to ac-&#xD;
count for your own boat, which is the one&#xD;
most likely to have been used, and by&#xD;
requesting these gentlemen "-he looked&#xD;
round the table at Mr. Seyton's three guests&#xD;
-"to be kind enough to tell us how they&#xD;
were engaged on that afternoon."&#xD;
"Upon my-word, Mr. Nowell," said Mr.&#xD;
Harding, flushing up suddenly, "do you&#xD;
mean to insult us, sir?"&#xD;
"Hush, Harding!" said Mr. Ainslie,&#xD;
quickly. "This question is a mere form.-I&#xD;
quite agree with you, Mr. Nowell," he went&#xD;
on, turning to the young lawyer who stood&#xD;
before him. "Of course it is best to do so.&#xD;
Shall we begin with the boat, or with our-&#xD;
selves?"&#xD;
"The boat is not here, and you are,"&#xD;
answered :Nowell, briefly. "We will waste&#xD;
no time, if you please, but begin with your-&#xD;
selves.-Mr. Seyton, will you conduct the&#xD;
examination?"&#xD;
Mr. Seyton started, for he had sunk&#xD;
into abstraction, and looked up, as if sur-&#xD;
prised.&#xD;
"Certainly," he said. "But it seems&#xD;
scarcely worth while-Philip is the only&#xD;
one who would have been likely to go for&#xD;
her, and Philip spent the afternoon with&#xD;
me."                                 -&#xD;
"Begging your pardon, sir," said Mr.&#xD;
Blake, abruptly. "You forget that I called&#xD;
to see you, and that you lost sight of Mr.&#xD;
Conway for some time, while we sat on the&#xD;
piazza."&#xD;
"But he was in this room. I left him&#xD;
here when I went out, and found him when&#xD;
I returned."&#xD;
"Can you vouch for his presence during&#xD;
that interval, sir?"&#xD;
"Blake !-What do you mean?"&#xD;
"I mean, sir," said Blake, with a cer-&#xD;
tain dignity in his tone and manner, "that&#xD;
this is no time for mincing matters, and that&#xD;
Mr. Nowell and I are both of one mind-&#xD;
there's been black work here of some sort&#xD;
or other, and if Mr. Conway does not wish&#xD;
to be suspected, he had better lift up his&#xD;
head and clear himself at once."&#xD;
The honest, indignant voice rang through&#xD;
the room fearlessly, and Conway lifted his&#xD;
head quickly enough. At first his face mdi-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8069-00000048"/>&#xD;
MABEL LEE.                                                           CONFLICTING EVIDENCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
eated only profQund. astonishment, but as he&#xD;
met the looks of dark suspicion with which&#xD;
Blake and :l{owell were regarding him, he&#xD;
rose and stood confronting them-amaze-&#xD;
ment, incredulity, indignation, rage, and&#xD;
scorn, chasing each other in quick succes-&#xD;
sion over his countenance. He seemed for&#xD;
a moment incapable of speech, but con-&#xD;
tinued to gaze at the two men with eyes&#xD;
literally blazing with passion, while the&#xD;
large veins rose and stood out like cords&#xD;
upon his clear, dark forehead.&#xD;
Shocked by the accusation just made,&#xD;
Mr. Seyton was about to interfere, but be-&#xD;
fore he had time to speak, Conway recov-&#xD;
ered self-possession and anticipated him.&#xD;
Unconsciously, perhaps, he drew himself&#xD;
up, and threw back his head, while the&#xD;
glance which was fixed on Blake's eyes&#xD;
grew colder but more menacing. His whole&#xD;
airy and his voice, when he spoke, were'&#xD;
different from his usual manner. Haughty&#xD;
and grave, he looked as he felt-the gentle.&#xD;
man addressing his inferior.&#xD;
"Did I hear you mention my name a&#xD;
moment ago, in a most extraordinary&#xD;
way?" he said, in a tone so quiet that&#xD;
every one present felt the slight but sensi-&#xD;
ble thrill with which we listen to that low&#xD;
moaning of the wind which always pre-&#xD;
cedes the burst of a tempest's fury. Mr.&#xD;
Harding turned a little pale, and shrank in-&#xD;
stinctively behind his uncle's chair. But&#xD;
Blake did not flinch.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Conway," he was commen-&#xD;
cing, when Mr. Seyton stopped him.&#xD;
'~ Not a word more, Blake!" he ex-&#xD;
claimed, the first real anger he had ever&#xD;
felt toward his faithful friend flashing in his&#xD;
eyes. "t~ou insult me, not less than my&#xD;
nephew, by the infamous accusation which&#xD;
you dare to suggest.-My dear boy," he&#xD;
continued, rapidly, looking up at Conway,&#xD;
"forgive him, for the sake of the motive&#xD;
which prompts his zeal."&#xD;
Before either Blake or Conway could&#xD;
reply, Noweil laid his hand on the table,&#xD;
and addressed Mr. Seyton. -&#xD;
"Sir," he said, in a grave and measured&#xD;
tone, "I respect your feelings; I am sorry&#xD;
to shock them-by what I am about to say.&#xD;
But I must be heard: My cousin, whose&#xD;
&#xD;
nearest relative and natural protector I am,&#xD;
has suddenly and mysteriously disappeared&#xD;
from her home. I believe, and so does Mr.&#xD;
Blake, that she was either forcibly abducted&#xD;
or treacherously wiled away by this man&#xD;
he pointed sternly to Conway. "It is right&#xD;
that you should hear a detail of the circum-&#xD;
stances upon which this belief is based, and&#xD;
that he should have the opportunity of prov-&#xD;
ing our suspicions to be unfounded before I&#xD;
formally make\ the charge against him at a&#xD;
legal tribunal. The following are the facts&#xD;
which I have gathered, and upon which my&#xD;
accusation rests: First-Mabel has, for more&#xD;
than a month past, been in the habit of&#xD;
going on the river almost every afternoon&#xD;
with this man; on no single occasion has&#xD;
she gone with any one else. Secondly-&#xD;
Frank Eston and his sister heard her make&#xD;
an engagement to go boating with him on&#xD;
the afternoon in question, as they parted at&#xD;
daylight, when returning from the ball.&#xD;
Frank and Miss Eston will both testify to&#xD;
this on oath. Thirdly-Mrs. Lee's servant&#xD;
heard a boat come to the landing at the&#xD;
very time named when the engagement was&#xD;
made; heard a man's voice laughing and&#xD;
tallying with Mabel in the arbor; heard this&#xD;
voice and Mabel's own, talking as they went&#xD;
down the garden-walk to the river; and&#xD;
heard the clink of the chain when the boat&#xD;
was unfastened. Shortly afterward, I my-&#xD;
self, together with her sister, saw the mark&#xD;
of the boat on the sand at the landing, and&#xD;
just beside this mark I found a flower&#xD;
which Constance recognized as one of a&#xD;
cluster worn by Mabel that afternoon. An-&#xD;
other one of the same flowers was lying in&#xD;
an open book which she had been reading&#xD;
in the arbor. Lastly-By Mr. Blake's tes-&#xD;
tiinony and your own admission, you lost&#xD;
sight of Mr. Conway during a considerable&#xD;
part of the afternoon-fully two hours and&#xD;
a half, Blake thinks-during which time he&#xD;
could easily have taken the boat from her&#xD;
mooring at the foot of the blufl' gone to&#xD;
Mrs. Lee~s landing, and persuaded my cous-&#xD;
in to fulfil the engagement she had made,&#xD;
returning in time to be in the library when&#xD;
you re~ntered it. What were the motives&#xD;
influencing him, and how he has disposed&#xD;
of Mabel, I pretend not even to conjecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here are facts, and I ask what Mr. Conway&#xD;
has to say regarding them?"&#xD;
"That your suspicion is not so inexcus-&#xD;
able as I thought before hearing the circum-&#xD;
stantial evidence in support of it, and eon-&#xD;
sequently I will endeavor to satisfy you,&#xD;
Mr. Nowell, that in this case, as in many&#xD;
others, circumstantial evidence is mislead-&#xD;
in&amp;amp;' answered Mr. Conway, in his usual&#xD;
frank inauner. He had listened to Nowell,&#xD;
*as had Mr. Seyton, with a surprise which&#xD;
soon transcended every other emotion, ac-&#xD;
knowledging mentally that the young law-&#xD;
yer was not merely excusable but perfectly&#xD;
justified in entertaining a suspicion which&#xD;
wore such a plausible appearance. As he&#xD;
thought thus, his brow relaxed from the&#xD;
heavy frwn that contracted it, the expres-&#xD;
sion of his face grew clear and open, and he&#xD;
continued in his natural tone of voice:&#xD;
"Your information concerning the en-&#xD;
gagement made by Miss Mabel Lee to go&#xD;
boating with me is perfectly correct. I&#xD;
mentioned this engagement that morning&#xD;
at breakfast, as you, sir, may remember?"&#xD;
He turned to Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
"Certainly!" answered the latter.&#xD;
"My uncle," proceeded Conway, "ob-&#xD;
jected to my taking Miss Mabel out that&#xD;
day, saying that, after the fatigue of the&#xD;
night before, she ought to rest. He even&#xD;
desired that I would not call upon her. He&#xD;
was going to send Anderson to Ayre in the&#xD;
afternoon, he said, and would tell him to&#xD;
stop at Mrs. Lee's and inquire how the la-&#xD;
dies were. And he added that, if I was&#xD;
concerned at breaking my engagement, An-&#xD;
derson could take my apologies to Miss Ma-&#xD;
bel."&#xD;
Again lie turned to Mr. Seyton, who&#xD;
said, mournfully: "Yes, I remember.&#xD;
Would to God I had let you go!" And&#xD;
Conway knew, from the tone as well as&#xD;
the words, that there did not exist in his&#xD;
uncle's mind a shade of distrust toward&#xD;
him.&#xD;
As I was leaving the breakfast-room,"&#xD;
he went on, "I met Anderson, and request-&#xD;
ed him to come to me for a note which I&#xD;
wished to send to Ayre, when hewent there&#xD;
in the afternoon, and accordingly he' came&#xD;
to me in the library at the time that my&#xD;
&#xD;
uncle was occupied with Mr. Blake.-You,&#xD;
Mr. Nowell, have adduced the statement of&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's servant, that she heard a boat at&#xD;
the landing in her mistress's garden, a man's&#xD;
voice, and the departure of Miss Mabel. I&#xD;
will prove to you on equally reliable testi-&#xD;
mony, that of my uncle's valet, that I was&#xD;
in this room a very short time before my&#xD;
uncle returned to it from the piazza, and&#xD;
that he, Anderson, saw Miss Mabel Lee af-&#xD;
ter he had discharged the errand that took&#xD;
him to Ayre-having called at Mrs. Lee's,&#xD;
he assured me, just before he left town to&#xD;
return home-at least an hour after he left&#xD;
me here in the library.-With your permis-&#xD;
sion, sir, I will ring for Anderson."&#xD;
Mr. Seyton nodded his head, Conway&#xD;
rang, and Anderson, whose business it was&#xD;
to answer the library-bell, soon made his&#xD;
appearance, and approached the group sur-&#xD;
rounding his master, with a very solemfi&#xD;
and rather startled expression of counte-&#xD;
nance.&#xD;
"Anderson," said Conway, quietly-for&#xD;
he wished to put the man at hisease-" An-&#xD;
derson, do you remember what time it was&#xD;
when you saw Miss Mabel Lee, on Thursday&#xD;
afternoon?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," was the prompt reply. "I&#xD;
called at Mrs. Lee's the last thing before I&#xD;
left town, and it was just six o'clock. I&#xD;
heard the town clock striking while I was&#xD;
waiting in the garden for Miss Mabel to an~&#xD;
swer your note."&#xD;
"You are sure it was six o'clock?" said&#xD;
his master.&#xD;
"I'm sure of it, sir. I counted every&#xD;
strike of the clock, for Mr. Jones wasn't at&#xD;
home when I went to his office, and-"&#xD;
"Never mind about Jones. Might you&#xD;
not have been mistaken in counting the&#xD;
clock?"&#xD;
"No, sir; I know I wasn't mistaken.&#xD;
I noticed particular about the time, because,&#xD;
if you recollect, sir, you told me to hurry&#xD;
and get back, if I could, before Mr. Blake&#xD;
left, so that he could hear what Mr. Jones&#xD;
said. I started fromhere just a little before&#xD;
five. When I come for Mass Phil's note I&#xD;
looked at the clock there, and it wanted ten&#xD;
minuteS to five; and I know I thought I&#xD;
could ride fast, and git back by six, but I&#xD;
&#xD;
MABEL LEE.&#xD;

94                          MABEL LEE.                                                                  CONFLICTING EVIDENCE.                    95&#xD;
&#xD;
had to run about so before I could find Mr.&#xD;
Jones that it was six when I got to Mrs.&#xD;
Lee's."&#xD;
"And you ~&#xD;
Mr. Seyton's voice failed. He could not&#xD;
pronounce the name of his lost darling. He&#xD;
cleared his throat, and said, "Whom did&#xD;
you see first at Mrs. Lee's?"&#xD;
"I saw Miss Constance first, sir. She&#xD;
was coming down-stairs, as I went up the&#xD;
front walk. She come to the front door to&#xD;
meet me, and after I had asked how they&#xD;
all was, I handed her the note for Miss Ma-&#xD;
bel. She took it, and then she give it back&#xD;
to me, and told me to go on through the&#xD;
house into the garden and that I would find&#xD;
Miss Mabel in the arbor. I went and found&#xD;
her there, and give her the note, and, after&#xD;
she read it, she star ted to go in the house&#xD;
to answer it. I told her I was in a great&#xD;
hurry, and asked her not to be long, if she&#xD;
pleased, and she laughed and said, 'Well, if&#xD;
you're in such a hurry, Anderson, I'll just&#xD;
tear a leaf out of this book and write with&#xD;
a pencil; but you must be sure and tell&#xD;
your Mass Phil that it's not my fault I&#xD;
send him such a note.' So she tore out a&#xD;
leaf and wrote on it, and told me to be sure&#xD;
and not lose it, and not to let anybody but&#xD;
Mass Phil see it. And then I hurried&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"And you counted the clock striking&#xD;
six while you were in the garden?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir. While Miss Mabel was writ-&#xD;
ing the note."&#xD;
"You rode to Ayre?" asked Newell.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. I went a-horseback!~~&#xD;
"There is one place on the road where&#xD;
there is a very good view of the river, just&#xD;
this side of town, you know. Did you no-&#xD;
tice the river-if there were any boats on&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"No, sir. I didn't notice the river go-&#xD;
ing or coming. I was in a hurry both times,&#xD;
and was looking straight before me all the&#xD;
time."&#xD;
* "That will do," saidhis master, and An-&#xD;
derson retired.&#xD;
* As soon as the door closed on his exit,&#xD;
Mr. Sexton raised himself in his chair with&#xD;
a look of mere energy than he had yet ex-&#xD;
hibited. "I hope, Mr. Newell and Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Blake," he said, in a tone of cold displeas-&#xD;
ure, "that you are now satisfied. Ander-&#xD;
son's word would not be received in a court&#xD;
of justice, it is true, but if your acumen does&#xD;
not go so far as to suspect my nephew or&#xD;
myself of suborning his evidence, perhaps&#xD;
you may give it the same credit which you&#xD;
accord to that of Mrs. Lee's cook, who is&#xD;
also ineligible in law as a witness; and if,&#xD;
further, you do not suspect me of collusion&#xD;
with my nephew in the commission of the&#xD;
crime of which you have accused him, you&#xD;
may possibly accept my testimony as cor-&#xD;
roborating what Anderson says relative to&#xD;
time. It happened that, as I am not fond&#xD;
of business, and Blake was talking of busi-&#xD;
ness all the while he was with me, I looked&#xD;
at my watch repeatedly. I had it in my&#xD;
hand when Anderson came to me for the&#xD;
message he was to take to Ayre. It was,&#xD;
then fifteen minutes before five o'clock.&#xD;
My watch and that timepiece "-he pointed&#xD;
to the clock over the mantel-" generally&#xD;
run very well together. Saying that I de-&#xD;
tained Anderson five minutes giving him&#xD;
my directions, and I think that was about&#xD;
the length of time thus occupied, he. would&#xD;
have entered the room precisely at ten min-&#xD;
utes to five, as he said. And half an hour&#xD;
afterward, by my watch, Blake took leave,&#xD;
and I came in from the piazza. That is to&#xD;
say, at twenty minutes after five I found&#xD;
my nephew where I had left him an hour&#xD;
and three-quarters before, for Blake is mis-&#xD;
taken in his estimate of the time spent in&#xD;
the piazza; I looked at my watch when I&#xD;
left the room and when I returned. There&#xD;
was an interval of one hour and three-quar-&#xD;
ters only. And from twenty minutes after&#xD;
five o'clockuntil bedtime, Philip was not out&#xD;
of my presence. If you do not reject An-&#xD;
derson's testimony, and will bear in mind&#xD;
that he saw my goddaughter at six o'clock,&#xD;
you must acknowledge, Mr. Nowell, that it&#xD;
proves an alibi."&#xD;
Nowell and Blake exchanged glances.&#xD;
Neither of them entertained a shade of&#xD;
doubt as to the truth of Anderson's state-&#xD;
merit. An alibi was proven-Mat they&#xD;
could not dispute. It was clear that Con-&#xD;
way had not been himself the active agent&#xD;
in Mabel's'abduotion or elopement; but not&#xD;
&#xD;
the less wOre they confident of' his guilt.&#xD;
His astonishment when the charge was&#xD;
made, and the candor with which he after-&#xD;
ward admitted that circumstances afforded&#xD;
some ground for suspicion, they considered&#xD;
only a part of the plot-a specimen, perhaps,&#xD;
of his powers of dissimulation.&#xD;
After a momentary pause, Nowell spoke,&#xD;
in a tone as cold as Mr. Seyton's own.&#xD;
We accept Andersen's testimony, sir.&#xD;
It proves an alibi, undoubtedly," h6 said.&#xD;
"If you do not object, I will, as a matter&#xD;
of form "-he laid a slightly ironical empha-&#xD;
sis on the last words-" ask a few questions&#xD;
of yourself and these other gentlemen before&#xD;
we go to examine the boat. Mr. Conway,&#xD;
it seems, spent the afternoon and evening&#xD;
with yourself. Were Mr. Ainslie and Mr.&#xD;
Harding also with you?"&#xD;
"Mr. Ainslie was on the terrace all the&#xD;
afternoon, I understand. Cyril was riding&#xD;
and came in about dark, or a little after.&#xD;
We all spent the evening together."&#xD;
"You were on the terrace all the after-&#xD;
noon, Mr. Ainslie I"&#xD;
"I was, though I don't know that I can&#xD;
produce~ any witnesses to the fact," Ainslie&#xD;
answered, quietly.&#xD;
"The terrace commands a view of the&#xD;
river for some distance up and down. You&#xD;
would have noticed any boats passing, I&#xD;
suppose?"&#xD;
"I think so. I cannot say with cer-&#xD;
tainty that none passed, for I was reading,&#xD;
and, being thus occupied, they might have&#xD;
escaped observation. But I think that any&#xD;
movement on the river would have attract-&#xD;
ed my attention."&#xD;
"I hope Mr. Harding will not consider&#xD;
himself insulted, if I ask him where he spent&#xD;
the afternoon."&#xD;
"I spent it riding," said Mr. Harding.&#xD;
"Riding? That is rather indefinite.&#xD;
Riding where?"&#xD;
"Really, Mr. Nowell, I am not accus-&#xD;
tomed-"&#xD;
"Tell him and be done with it, Cyril,"&#xD;
interrupted his uncle, sharply.&#xD;
"But it is impossible for me to tell him!"&#xD;
cried Mr. Harding, indignantly. "I hardly&#xD;
know myself. I felt badly, and I thought a&#xD;
ride might help me, so I had a horse saddled&#xD;
&#xD;
and set out. I went some considerable dis-&#xD;
tance, and was late getting back-that is&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"But you surely know the direction you&#xD;
took?"&#xD;
"I took the high-road leading to Ayre,&#xD;
but after a while I struck into the woods,&#xD;
skirted some fields, rode along the river&#xD;
bank, and came back by a large mill I&#xD;
hope that is sufficiently explicit!"&#xD;
"Bat did you meet no one?"&#xD;
"I met a good many people, but 1 knew~&#xD;
none of them. Good Heavens! Mr. Newell,&#xD;
surely I am the last person in the world you&#xD;
would connect with such a matter as this!&#xD;
What possible concern could I have with&#xD;
Miss Lee? And as for her going on the&#xD;
river with me, I'd hardly have been likely&#xD;
to ask her, after the manner in which she&#xD;
treated my last invitation."&#xD;
"I do not suspect you in the least, Mr.&#xD;
Harding, but you ought to clear yourself&#xD;
from even a shadow of doubt."&#xD;
"What doubt can there be? Everybody&#xD;
knows that for weeks past I have scarcely&#xD;
seen Miss Lee. It seems to me that my&#xD;
cousin Philip is the only one likely to know&#xD;
any thing of her movements, considering, at&#xD;
least, that I overheard a declaration of love&#xD;
which he made to her the night of the&#xD;
ball."&#xD;
Mr. Sexton started' and looked up at&#xD;
Conway inquiringly.&#xD;
"It is true," his nephew responded to&#xD;
that look, "though I did not expect that&#xD;
you would hear in this way, or that my&#xD;
worthy cousin had been playing the eaves-&#xD;
'dropper." His eyes, full of eloquent scorn,&#xD;
glanced from the face of Mr. Seyton to the&#xD;
smooth visage at his shoulder, and then&#xD;
back again. "For a month past," he con-&#xD;
tinued, meeting his uncle's gaze steadily,&#xD;
"I have been aware that you saw and dis-&#xD;
countenanced my admiration for your god-&#xD;
dai~ghter. I knew, or thought I knew, that&#xD;
it would be useless to attempt to obtain your&#xD;
approval of my suit; and I felt that you&#xD;
might, not unreasonably, condemn my con-&#xD;
duct if I persisted in prosecuting it, with tl~e&#xD;
full knowledge that her family and you your-&#xD;
self would never consent to her marrying me.&#xD;
I determined to leave Seyton House, to re~&#xD;

&#xD;
tuin to Europe; and I should have left more&#xD;
than a week ago, had not Mabel, one day&#xD;
when I mentioned my intention to her sister&#xD;
and herself, asked, as a personal favor, that&#xD;
I would remain until after the ball. Very&#xD;
reluctantly I consented to delay my de-&#xD;
parture, resolving to guard every word and&#xD;
look in r~y association with her. I would&#xD;
willingly have abjured her society altogether,&#xD;
but it was impossible to do this without&#xD;
exciting her own wonder and the remark&#xD;
of others. Therefore, I could only avoid&#xD;
it partially. But I adhered strictly to my&#xD;
resolution, until the night of the ball. On&#xD;
that evening I met her in the belief that I&#xD;
saw her for the last time, for I designed&#xD;
leaving the next day, and meant to take no&#xD;
formal farewell of her," he paused a moment,&#xD;
and his hitherto pale cheek flushed crimson.&#xD;
"The excitement of the .hour "-he went&#xD;
on hurriedly-"the thought of the approach-&#xD;
ing separation-overcame my self-control.&#xD;
I was wrong - that I acknowledge, sir.&#xD;
But; before you condemn me utterly, re-&#xD;
member what the temptation was, and how&#xD;
long I had resisted it."&#xD;
'Mr. Sexton had listened with evident&#xD;
emotion while his nephew spoke. To his&#xD;
ear, at least, the recital, both in manner&#xD;
and matter, had in it the ring of truth.&#xD;
And, "thought, quick-winged as lightning,"&#xD;
filled in the bare outline sketched by Con-&#xD;
way of the 'struggle maintained with a&#xD;
temptation the strength of which he, of all&#xD;
men, could best understand. . The memory&#xD;
of his own love for one who was the pro-&#xD;
totype ~f Mabel, came so vividly upon him,&#xD;
that he was obliged to steady hi~ voice for&#xD;
a moment before answering.&#xD;
"Yes, you were wrong," he said, gently;&#xD;
"and a man who himself has never strug~&#xD;
gled with and been conquered by passion&#xD;
might condemn you. I am not that man~&#xD;
I forgive you freely."&#xD;
H~ extended his hand, and pressed warm&#xD;
ly the one which so eagerly grasped his own&#xD;
Conway was deeply affected by his uncle'~&#xD;
generous trust and sympathy, and his voic&#xD;
faltered a little as he continued:&#xD;
"I ought to have told you at once ol&#xD;
this, and so I intended. But one triflin~&#xD;
circumstance after another prevented m~&#xD;
&#xD;
speaking to you in private, until just before&#xD;
Mr. Blake caine in. At the moment that ho&#xD;
entered the library I was about to tell you."&#xD;
"I recollect," said Mr. Sexton, "your&#xD;
asking if I would give you my attention, as&#xD;
you bad something to say to me, and I re-&#xD;
member being struck by your manner.&#xD;
This, then, was the communication you&#xD;
were about to make?"&#xD;
"It was. I-"&#xD;
He stopped. The color, which had a&#xD;
moment before rushed to his face, as quick-&#xD;
ly disappeared. A sudden faint sickness&#xD;
came over him, objects grew dim before his&#xD;
sight, and he hastily sat down. lie had not&#xD;
tasted food for twenty-four hours, but it&#xD;
was not physical exhaustion which thus af-&#xD;
fected him. The soft summer air, entering&#xD;
the room through the windows, bore with&#xD;
it a sound that caused all of the group of&#xD;
men, even the solemnly phlegmatic Mr.&#xD;
Harding, to shudder involuntarily. Mr.&#xD;
Seyton bent his head forward, and covered&#xD;
his eyes with one hand, while the haggard&#xD;
face of Nowell became, if possible, more&#xD;
rigid and colorless than before. Dulled by&#xD;
distance, but yet perfectly distinct, and bit-&#xD;
terly significant to the ear, came the report&#xD;
of a heavy volley of musketry. At the&#xD;
earliest dawn, crowds of the town and coun-&#xD;
try people of Ayre and its vicinity, had&#xD;
gathered along the bank of the river, drag-&#xD;
ging it all the way from Mrs. Lee's landing&#xD;
to the island-a distance of more than a&#xD;
mile-but to no purpose. Something over&#xD;
thirty-six hours having elapsed since the&#xD;
time at which it was supposed that Mabel&#xD;
might have been drowned, they were now&#xD;
firing into the stream, to the end that the&#xD;
vibration of the water, following the concus-&#xD;
sion so produced, might cause the body to&#xD;
rise to the surface. As Ayre did not pos-&#xD;
sess even a single field-piece, volleys of&#xD;
musketry were substituted for the boom of&#xD;
cannon, but these volleys were so heavy&#xD;
that, the day being unusually still, they&#xD;
were distinctly audible at Seyton House.&#xD;
Nowell was the first to recover himself,&#xD;
and there was a tone less of harshness in his&#xD;
voice as he said, "We will go and examine&#xD;
; the boat!" lie did not believe that Mabel&#xD;
~ was drowned-indeed, he scoffed at the idea;&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and would not have hesitated a moment&#xD;
to stake his own life on the opposite opin-&#xD;
ion; he was mentally anathematizing the&#xD;
people who were, he considered, "ma&#xD;
fools of themselves," by prosecuting their&#xD;
search for her body, as he led the way to&#xD;
where the boat was made fast-but yet that&#xD;
sullen boom, boom, now recurring at short&#xD;
intervals, realized to him with fresh inten-&#xD;
sity the terrible fact that .31a&amp;amp;el 'was miesin~,&#xD;
and seemed to his heart, though not to his&#xD;
mind, like volleys over her grave.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
U2~DER 5U5PICIO~.&#xD;
THEY fSund the boat moored at the foot&#xD;
of the bluff', where the servants who were&#xD;
called up said it had been ever since the&#xD;
ball, and that after that night it had not, to&#xD;
their knowledge, been used until Mr. Con-&#xD;
way went to Ayre on the morning of the&#xD;
second day.&#xD;
"You see as how we was all monstrous&#xD;
tired, sir," said Austin, "and pretty nearly&#xD;
everybody got enough of rowin' the night be-&#xD;
fore. I'd take my Bible oath on it that none.&#xD;
of the white folks touched her, sir; and I'm&#xD;
still more s4rtain that none of the black ones&#xD;
did."&#xD;
"You are perfectly sure of this?"&#xD;
"As sure as if it was the last word I&#xD;
ever spoke, sir."&#xD;
"I hope you are satisfied, Nowell," said&#xD;
Mr. Seyton, wearily.&#xD;
"No, sir! I shall never be satisfied un-&#xD;
til I have laid open the whole devilish plot,"&#xD;
Nowell answered.-" Mr. Ainslie, the boat&#xD;
might have been entered here, and, by keep-&#xD;
ing close along the bank under the willows,&#xD;
h&amp;amp;ve effectually eluded your observation&#xD;
from the terrace."&#xD;
"Perhaps so," said Ainslie, "for I con-&#xD;
fess I paid very little attention to the river,&#xD;
or to any thing else, for that matter, on the&#xD;
afternoon in question."&#xD;
"Come, Blake," said Nowell, abruptly,&#xD;
"we are wasting time. We will take the&#xD;
boat and go at once to Ayre "&#xD;
lie ceased speaking, and stood still in the&#xD;
"I&#xD;
&#xD;
act of stepping into the boat, for at this mo-&#xD;
ment a breathless servant came running up.&#xD;
"Please, sir, there's some gentlemen to&#xD;
see you," he panted, addressing his master;&#xD;
"and they say as how they've. got some&#xD;
pa'tic'Iar news for you."&#xD;
News! What a sharp pang-half of&#xD;
hope, half of fear-went through the hearts&#xD;
of three at least of the group of men! They&#xD;
looked at each other for one instant, saw&#xD;
the same thought flash into the eyes of each,&#xD;
and turned swiftly and silently toward the&#xD;
housed The three others followed; the&#xD;
three whose thoughts were known only to&#xD;
themselves and to God-and it chanced that&#xD;
Mr. Harding walked alone, while Ainslie&#xD;
and Conway brought up the rear together.&#xD;
"Phil," said the former, after a mo-&#xD;
meat's silence, "I detest half-confidences.&#xD;
You never told me about any declaration;&#xD;
on the contrary, you expressly said that you&#xD;
had no intention of making one."&#xD;
"No, Idid not tell you," Conway an-&#xD;
swered, "principally because I saw the folly&#xD;
of it so plainly that I did not care to hear&#xD;
an echo of my own thoughts from you. Be-&#xD;
sides, I had not time. It was all so unex-&#xD;
pected. I committed myself before I knew&#xD;
what I was about, the other night, andthen&#xD;
-but what is the good of talking of it? I&#xD;
never knew how dear she was to me until&#xD;
now-now, when I cannot tell whether she&#xD;
is dead or alive, but when I would give up&#xD;
every hope of fortune, and live to the end of&#xD;
my existence a slave and a drudge, only to&#xD;
see her beside me again!"&#xD;
Ainslie looked at him intently-looked&#xD;
at him, as it seemed, a little curiously. "I&#xD;
think you mean it-for the time," be said,&#xD;
after a moment.&#xD;
"I mean it for any time, and all time,"&#xD;
answered the other. "And I only wish I&#xD;
might be taken at my word. You should&#xD;
never hear me complain if I had to hew&#xD;
wood or draw water for my daily food.&#xD;
And yet these miserable fools really suspect&#xD;
me of having made away with her."&#xD;
"I wonder what they suppose your ~b-&#xD;
ject to have been?"&#xD;
"The devil only knows! I suppose, ikE&#xD;
the first ~plaee, they pitched upon me as a&#xD;
subject of suspicion, because of their great&#xD;

good-will toward me. Though," he added,&#xD;
with gloomy indifference, "that lawyer&#xD;
made out a pretty strong case against me, if&#xD;
I had not been able to prove an alibi. I&#xD;
don't blame him for suspecting me under&#xD;
such circumstances, but I do think he is a&#xD;
fool not to be convinced of his mistake, af-&#xD;
ter all that he has heard."&#xD;
"He is blinded by jealousy. There is&#xD;
some excuse for him in that fact. Now,&#xD;
Phil, don't let his example infect you.&#xD;
Don't lose your head and your temper, as&#xD;
you came very near doing a while ago.&#xD;
Keep cool, whatever they say. Their accu-&#xD;
sations can do you no harm in the end; and&#xD;
~Towell, as Miss Lee's cousin, has a claim on&#xD;
your forbearance. As to that fellow Blake,&#xD;
not being a gentleman, he is beneath your&#xD;
resentment."&#xD;
"Yes," said Conway, listlessly. "Ah I"&#xD;
he cried, the moment after, with an energy&#xD;
and passion so new to him that his friend&#xD;
was quite startled-" ah! I am not think-&#xD;
ing of their preposterous accusation, but of&#xD;
Iter / Ralph, tell me what you think?" he&#xD;
went on in a tone of great agitation. "You&#xD;
do not believe it possible, do you, that she&#xD;
could have been-could have fallen into the&#xD;
river? ".&#xD;
Ainslie hesitated.&#xD;
"It is hard to say," he replied at last,&#xD;
"but I-am inclined to think so."&#xD;
"I do not, I cannot believe it," said&#xD;
Conway, passionately. "I go with Nowell&#xD;
that far. I think that she has been ab-&#xD;
ducted!" and he glanced with a dark frown&#xD;
at Harding, who was just disappearing&#xD;
through the library-door, a little in advance&#xD;
of them.&#xD;
Ainslie shook his head. "He may be&#xD;
knave enough, but I doubt if he has nerve&#xD;
enough, for such a business."&#xD;
"We shall see I I am determined to&#xD;
find her, and I think Nowell is not less so.&#xD;
Between us, we shall succeed, sooner or&#xD;
later."&#xD;
Ainslie had no time to reply, for at that&#xD;
moment they entered the library, where&#xD;
quite a number of gentlemen 'were assem-&#xD;
bled. Governor Eston was speaking.&#xD;
"The man to whom I allude," he said,&#xD;
"an entirely honest and respectable man,&#xD;
&#xD;
L. LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
named Jacob Stone, declares, and is willing&#xD;
to. testify on oath, that, as he was coming&#xD;
home in his boat shortly before sunset, on&#xD;
Thursday afternoon, he passed a skiff con-&#xD;
taining Mabel Lee and a man whose face he&#xD;
did not see, but whose figure reminded him&#xD;
very much of-"&#xD;
He paused suddenly on perceiving Con-&#xD;
way in the open door before him; and, as&#xD;
he paused, the latter stepped forward.&#xD;
"Finish your sentence, sir, I beg," he&#xD;
said. "Of whom did the figure remind&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
The governor bowed with very stately&#xD;
but rather stiff courtesy.&#xD;
"I regret to say," he answered, "that&#xD;
it was of yourself, Mr. Conway."&#xD;
"And he is willing to testify that, on&#xD;
oath?"&#xD;
"No; he expressly says that he is cer-&#xD;
tain only of Mabel's identity. He did not&#xD;
catch even a glimpse of the face of her com-&#xD;
panion, but he took it for granted that it&#xD;
was yourself. And he remarked, what has&#xD;
often struck others, that a great similarity&#xD;
exists in the figures of you three gentle-&#xD;
men."&#xD;
"And is he certain that it was one of&#xD;
them?" asked Mr. Kowell.&#xD;
The governor hesitated before replying,&#xD;
but after a while he spoke slowly:&#xD;
~ he said. "He is absolutely cer-&#xD;
tain that it was one of them."&#xD;
"In what direction was the boat going?&#xD;
Where did he pass them?" asked Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton? "It seems to me that is of far more&#xD;
importance that any thing else."&#xD;
"They were coming in this direction,&#xD;
and he passed them a short distance below&#xD;
Morford's Landing. It is very terrible and&#xD;
very strange, Mr. Seyton-we scarcely&#xD;
know what to think. Ayre is more excited&#xD;
than I ever remember it to have been; and&#xD;
the whole town is busily engaged in drag-&#xD;
ging the river. But this information entire-&#xD;
ly sets at rest the question of her having&#xD;
been drowned."&#xD;
"It sets at rest the question of acciden-&#xD;
tal drowning," said one of the othergentle-&#xD;
men, "but, if she was murdered, her body&#xD;
would most probably have been thrown into&#xD;
the river."&#xD;

"Pray, my good sir, spare us," said' the&#xD;
governor quickly, for he saw how whit~&#xD;
and shuddering Mr. Sexton looked, as he&#xD;
sat down in his chair. "1 hope all may yet&#xD;
be well, but-Mr. Nowell, are you leaving?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Nowell, as he took up his&#xD;
hat, and turned toward the door. "I am&#xD;
going to Morford's Landing.-Good-morn-&#xD;
big, Mr. Sexton. I will see you soon again.&#xD;
-Good-morning, gentlemen."&#xD;
"Mr. Ainslie," said Mr. Blake, "are you&#xD;
coming with me ?-or is it you, Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"Does not Mr. Conway take any part in&#xD;
the search?" asked the governor, signifi-&#xD;
cantly, as his glance turned on Conway,&#xD;
who stood apart from the rest.&#xD;
"He was in the saddle all night," began&#xD;
Ainslie; but, before he could say more, Con-&#xD;
way advanced into the centre of the room,&#xD;
until he stood beside Mr. Sexton's chair.&#xD;
Then, facing the entire grdup, he spoke for&#xD;
himself:&#xD;
"I understand the suspicion with which&#xD;
~ou all regard me," he said, "and the man-&#xD;
ner in which you have juaged and con-&#xD;
demned me while in profound ignorance of&#xD;
any thing save the fact that Miss Lee has&#xD;
disappeared. Why this is so, only your-&#xD;
selves can tell. Mr. Nowell had indeed&#xD;
strung together a somewhat plausible-look-&#xD;
ing array of 'suspicious circumstances,' but&#xD;
I proved to him, in a manner to satisfy any&#xD;
reasonable mind, that I was here in this&#xD;
very room during the whole of the after-&#xD;
noon upon which Miss Lee disappeared.&#xD;
Moreover, I can prove, by my cousin, Mr.&#xD;
Harding, who has already done me the fa-&#xD;
vor to testify to the fact "-he could not&#xD;
quite repress an intonation of sarcasm in his&#xD;
voice-" that I proposed to and was ac-&#xD;
cepted by Miss Mabel Lee on the night of&#xD;
the ball. How any sane man could suspect&#xD;
me of abducting or murdering the woman&#xD;
who was my affianced wife, it passes my&#xD;
powers of imagination to conceive. That-"&#xD;
"Excuse me," interrupted Mr. Harding,&#xD;
at this point, to the surprise of Conway&#xD;
himself, and that of his whole audience.-.-.&#xD;
'excuse me, Philip, if I correct what is no&#xD;
doubt an inadvertent mistake on your part,&#xD;
but which I feel it right to rectify. I did not&#xD;
&#xD;
testify to the fact of your having proposed&#xD;
to and been accepted by Miss Mabel Lee,&#xD;
but only to your having made a declaration&#xD;
of love to her. It was by the merest chance&#xD;
that I overheard this declaration, and I hur-&#xD;
ried away without waiting to hear her re-&#xD;
ply. 1 was looking for her to return her&#xD;
fan, which had come into my possession by&#xD;
accident, but when I heard your-that is,&#xD;
the subject of your-conversation, I did not&#xD;
wish to intrude my presence upon you, and&#xD;
so I retired at once."&#xD;
"Ah, I comprehend I" said Conway,&#xD;
scornfully. "You mean to insinuate that,&#xD;
though I offered myself, I was not ac-&#xD;
cepted?"&#xD;
"No," answered Mr. Harding, hastily,&#xD;
growing very red, and speaking with some&#xD;
indignation-" no; I mean to insinuate no&#xD;
such thing! I only corrected the mistake&#xD;
and made the explanation, because you&#xD;
spoke as if-as if you thought my hearing&#xD;
the conversation between Miss Lee and&#xD;
yourself was intentional."&#xD;
Conway did not reply to this speech, but,&#xD;
taking out a russian-leather pocket-book,&#xD;
he extracted thence a small folded paper,&#xD;
and addressed Mr. Seyton. "Hero is the&#xD;
note which Anderson brought to me on&#xD;
Thursday afternoon. Will you read it, sir,&#xD;
and satisfy whomsoever it may concern,&#xD;
whether Miss Lee was engaged to me ~r&#xD;
not?~~&#xD;
Mr. Seyton took the note, but, before he'&#xD;
had time to read it, he was interrupted by&#xD;
the entrance of Anderson, who, hastily ap..&#xD;
preaching him, said:&#xD;
"Mr. Martin's out here, sir, and wants&#xD;
to see you. I told him you was busy and&#xD;
couldn't be disturbed, but he says he's got&#xD;
something to tell you, and, if you can't see&#xD;
him, will Mr. Blake come there directly?"&#xD;
"Bring him in at once," said Mr. Soy-&#xD;
ton, with mingled eagerness and apprehen-&#xD;
sion. And he laid the 'paperwhicl.i Conway&#xD;
had given him on the table at his side.&#xD;
Anderson returned to the open door,&#xD;
and ushered in the overseer, who was wait-.&#xD;
big just outside, it appeared. A rough but&#xD;
good-natured looking man, with honest face&#xD;
and open manner, he ~took off his hat as he&#xD;
advanced into the apartment, nodded short-&#xD;

&#xD;
ly to the company- in general,' and more re-&#xD;
spectfully to Mr. Sexton. and Mr. Blake, his&#xD;
eyes resting on the former for an instant&#xD;
with an 'expression of compassionate wonder&#xD;
at his altered appearance, and then, turning&#xD;
to Blake:&#xD;
"You know the flat-boat that was lost&#xD;
the night of the ball, Mr. Blake?"&#xD;
Blake nodded.&#xD;
~"Wall, it's found; and this here was&#xD;
found in it~-.stuck fast to the bottom, in&#xD;
some wet mud."&#xD;
He extended, not to Blake, but to Mr.&#xD;
Sexton, what the latter took to be a piece&#xD;
of wet 'clay-soiled black lace, crushed to-&#xD;
gether into an unsightly lump, until he had&#xD;
it in his hand, when he saw that it was a~&#xD;
half-length glove of the kind then univer-&#xD;
sally worn in summer by ladies. Gazing at&#xD;
it with n shudder, unable and unwilling to&#xD;
identify it as Mabel's, he turned to Conway,&#xD;
and said in a low tone, "Look at it, and see&#xD;
if you think it is hers."&#xD;
Conway shuddered, too, as he received&#xD;
it from his' uncle's outstretched hand. He&#xD;
exanilnud it closely,, but, so far as the glove&#xD;
itself was concerned, there was nothing by&#xD;
which he could identify it. Mabel wore&#xD;
such gloves,. he knew, but so did every lady&#xD;
of 14s acquaintance. Mechanically, he en-&#xD;
deav'ored to straighten it out, the better to&#xD;
ji~dge of its size and shape, and while doing&#xD;
so he found that it enclosed some foreign&#xD;
substance, to which it was pasted firmly by&#xD;
the half-dry mud. Crumbling this mud off,&#xD;
he ,started at the sight of a note-his own&#xD;
note, ~s he divined by instinct at the very&#xD;
first glimpse. He extricated it with some&#xD;
difficulty from the 'inside of the glove,&#xD;
opened it, gave one look at the blurred but&#xD;
perfectly' legible writing, and placed it in&#xD;
his uncle's hand. "The glove' is hers," he&#xD;
said~ ,"Se'e 1 - That is my note, written to&#xD;
her on Thursday." He pointed to the date,&#xD;
whieh~ Mr. Sexton read, and then spoke&#xD;
eagerly to the overseer.&#xD;
"Wheir and where was the boat found?"&#xD;
he exclaimed.&#xD;
'~ Why, you see, sir, the boat was mission'&#xD;
a Thursday zil4rnin', the day after the ball,&#xD;
and as she's a right new boat that Mr. Blake&#xD;
had had built after a notion of'his own, and&#xD;
&#xD;
so light that two hands can manage her&#xD;
easy, though she's big, why,, he didn't like&#xD;
the loss of her; and he spoke pretty sharp&#xD;
when I reported it to him, and said it was&#xD;
keerlessness on my part not to cv looked&#xD;
after things, better, for that no doubt the&#xD;
hands had got out of her in a hurry, and&#xD;
mebbe not fastened her at all, or&#xD;
"But where was she found?" inter-&#xD;
rupted Mr. Seyton, who, having listened&#xD;
very impatiently so far to this irrelevant&#xD;
tirade, could contain himself no longer.&#xD;
From the force of habit, he looked up at&#xD;
Blake, as much as to say, "Make him come&#xD;
to the point!" To which adjuration Blake&#xD;
replied by a slight negative motion of the&#xD;
head, signifying, "Let him tell his story his&#xD;
own way, or he'll never get to the end of&#xD;
it." And the man, unconscious of this by-&#xD;
play, replied:&#xD;
"I'll come to that presently, sir. Well,&#xD;
Mr. Blake he thought she hadn't bin fast-&#xD;
ened proper. He said all the niggers was&#xD;
on their heads last night, and that I must a&#xD;
bin on mine too, not to a noticed what they&#xD;
was about, and that he'd no doubt they'd&#xD;
just flung the chain round the stake, with-&#xD;
out pretending' to fasten it into the staple.&#xD;
I didn't think so, because Old Ike and Big&#xD;
Jim was the boat-hands, and there ain't two&#xD;
better or more dependable boys on the&#xD;
whole plantation, and they said they hitched&#xD;
her up just as usual. Well, when I cheered&#xD;
yesterday morning' that Miss Mabel was&#xD;
mission , I couldn't help thinking' that mebbe&#xD;
her bein' gone, and the boat's bein' gone,&#xD;
had something' to do with one another; and&#xD;
I sent Old Ike and Big Jim down the river&#xD;
in a canoe yesterday evening' late, to Mr.&#xD;
Dawson's plantation, to make inquiries&#xD;
whether anybody there had seed or cheered&#xD;
of, the boat's gem' by there. The boys&#xD;
hadn't got half-way to Mr. Daweon's be-&#xD;
fore they met Andy Campbell on his raft,&#xD;
comm' up for a load of timber, and he had&#xD;
the fiat towen on behind him, and said he&#xD;
had picked her up away 'down the river,&#xD;
and kno-wed her, and was bringin' her home&#xD;
as he passed gem' up the river. Well, it&#xD;
was after dark when Old Ike and Big Jim&#xD;
got back, and I wasn't at home, and didn't&#xD;
git 'home this. morning' till after breakfast,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
for I was scourin' the country all night with&#xD;
a party of hands, looking' for some trace of&#xD;
Miss Mabel. When I did git home, I foimd&#xD;
the boys waiting' for mc; and when I cheered&#xD;
their story I was a most of Mr. Blake's way&#xD;
of thinking , that the flat had got loose and&#xD;
floated off down the stream; but I thought&#xD;
I'd go and take a look at her, and you see I&#xD;
found that in her "-he pointed to the glov~&#xD;
-" and, what's more, there's bin people and&#xD;
horses, too, in her sence we used her our-&#xD;
selves, Wednesday night, because it was&#xD;
very dry weather then, and the boat was as&#xD;
clean as she could be, and there was nothing'&#xD;
to dirty her. And now she's full of mud,&#xD;
and there's the plain tracks of wheels and&#xD;
horses' feet-yes, and men's feet, too! And&#xD;
it's my opinion," he concluded, gravely,&#xD;
"that ~iss Mabel was carried off down the&#xD;
river in that boat."&#xD;
Most of the gentlemen shook their heads&#xD;
at this idea, and Governor Eston explained&#xD;
to the man that it was impossible, because&#xD;
of 'the story of Jacob Stone, who was posi-&#xD;
tive that he had seen Mabel in a skiff,&#xD;
adding, "You know he is not the sort of&#xD;
man to tell a cock-and-bull story, or to be&#xD;
mistaken in what he so positively says. For&#xD;
my part, I am just as firmly convinced that&#xD;
she was in the skiff, as if I had seen her&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"I don't dispute it," returned Martin.&#xD;
"Stone's not the man to tell a lie, one way&#xD;
or another, I know. All I say is, she might&#xD;
a bin in the skiff when he saw her, and she&#xD;
might a bin in the flat afterward. And I'd&#xD;
like to know, governor, how you'd account&#xD;
for her glove bein' in the flat, if she hadn't&#xD;
bin in it herself?"&#xD;
"That I can't account for," said the&#xD;
governor. "That is strange, certainly.-You&#xD;
are sure it is her glove, Seyton?"&#xD;
For answer, Mr. Sexton held out to his&#xD;
inspection the back of the note upon which&#xD;
the address,&#xD;
"Miss MABEL Lnz, "Ayre,"&#xD;
was legible at a glance.&#xD;
"And Mr. Conway recognizes this as a&#xD;
note written by himself?" asked the ~gov-&#xD;
ernor, in a very non-committal tone.&#xD;
Mr. Sexton turned the other side, and&#xD;
&#xD;
folding it back, so that the signature and&#xD;
date were exposed, he again held it out for&#xD;
the inspection of all who were inclined to&#xD;
examIne it. Then he put it on the table&#xD;
beside, the one already there, rose, from his&#xD;
seat, placed his hand on Conway's shoul-&#xD;
der, and, so standing, addressed the com-&#xD;
pany.&#xD;
"Before we proceed further with the&#xD;
subject of the boat, I must ask you, gentle-&#xD;
men, to give me your attention while I per-&#xD;
form an act of justice and of' duty-that of&#xD;
denouncing, as not only preposterous, but as&#xD;
infamous-infamous in the highest degree-&#xD;
the suspicion whieh Mr. ~Towe]l and Mr.&#xD;
Blake have thought fit to express, and, I&#xD;
believe, to disseminate, concerning my&#xD;
nephew 1-a suspicion that he was the ab-&#xD;
ductor of my goddaughter! As some cir-&#xD;
cumstances mentioned by Nowell are calcu-&#xD;
lated, upon a superficial view, to misle~4&#xD;
opinion, I will, with your permission, go&#xD;
over the explanation and the proofs which&#xD;
I gave to Mr. Nowell, just before your ar-&#xD;
rival, as to the fact of my nephews presence&#xD;
in this house during the whole of Thursd~y&#xD;
afternoon and evening." He recapitulated&#xD;
the explanation to which he alluded-.-his&#xD;
own veto of the engagement made by Con-&#xD;
way and Mabel to go boating; Anderson's&#xD;
account of the delivery of Conway's note&#xD;
and Mabel's answer; his own and the ser-&#xD;
vant's perfect recollection of the time at&#xD;
which the different events of the afternoo~i&#xD;
transpired. "H&amp;amp;re are the two notes in&#xD;
question," he continued. "I do not know&#xD;
whether Anderson can recognize this, in its&#xD;
present condition "-he put his finger down&#xD;
upon the discolored and rumpled one-" but&#xD;
the other' he cannot mistake, as it is not&#xD;
written on ordinary note-paper, but on the&#xD;
fly-leaf torn from a book.-Ring the bell, if&#xD;
you please, Cyril."&#xD;
Mr. Harding obeyed.&#xD;
"Anderson," said his .master, when the&#xD;
man came in, "I want you to repeat to&#xD;
these gentlemen what you were telling us&#xD;
a while ago about your errand to Ayre, on&#xD;
Thursday afternoon. I think you said you&#xD;
heard the town-clock strike six while you&#xD;
were at Mrs. Lee's&#xD;
"Yes, sir ;." and he proceeded to give&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8069-00000053"/>&#xD;
a substantial repetition of what he had said&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"Look at these notes," said Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
"Are they the ones you carried that day?"&#xD;
"That is Miss Mabel's, sir," replied&#xD;
Anderson, without hesitation~ "The other&#xD;
looks like Mass Phil's, only it's so dirty.&#xD;
Will you let me see it a minute, sir, and I&#xD;
can tell you? If it's the one I cared that&#xD;
day, it's got some blood on one corner. As&#xD;
I was riding along, trimming a switch, I cut&#xD;
my finger, and it bled a good deal, off and&#xD;
on, all the evening, and some of the blood&#xD;
got on both of the notes."&#xD;
Mr. Sexton had given him the note, and&#xD;
he was fumbling with it as he spoke, and he&#xD;
now pointed to a dull-red stain on the cor-&#xD;
ner, that might have passed for a streak of&#xD;
clay a little darker than that which stained&#xD;
the whole paper, but which, o'n close scru-&#xD;
tiny, was obviously blood. "Here is the&#xD;
mark, you see, sir. It's Mass Phil's note."&#xD;
"Very well. That is all I want," said&#xD;
Mi'. Seyton.&#xD;
"I have nothing more to say," he re-&#xD;
s~mmed, when the servant had left the room.&#xD;
"Any reasonable man must 'admit that I am&#xD;
right in characterizing the suspicion which&#xD;
has been suggested as at onceppo.storona&#xD;
and i,~famous. If there are men so blinded&#xD;
by jealousy, or besotted in prejudice "-he&#xD;
looked significantly toward Blake-" as to&#xD;
entertain the insane idea that my nephew&#xD;
was in any wise connected with the dis-&#xD;
appearance of his affianced wife-such these&#xD;
documents (he pointed to the notes) prove&#xD;
my goddaughter to have been-why, I trust&#xD;
that both he and myself can support the&#xD;
knowledge of their ill opinion without con-&#xD;
cern, regarding it with the contempt which&#xD;
alone it deserves.&#xD;
"Now," he proceeded, sitting down,&#xD;
and speaking in a different tone, "how&#xD;
about this boat? I confess that the more I&#xD;
think of it, the more do I incline to Martin's&#xD;
opinion." He looked around.&#xD;
An animated discussion followed. Every-&#xD;
body was ready to admit that the presence&#xD;
of Mabel's glove in the boat seemed strong&#xD;
evidence of her having been in it herself.&#xD;
"But not by any means conclusivee proof of&#xD;
the fact," said Mr. Bradford. "The glove&#xD;
&#xD;
may have been put there purposely, to mis-&#xD;
lead inquiry, by directing it in a wrong chan-&#xD;
nel. One thing, however, is certain~ The&#xD;
disappearance of the boat was a preliminary&#xD;
to the abduction of Miss Lee, but whether&#xD;
used for the purpose and abandoned when&#xD;
no longer needed, in the expectation that&#xD;
the current would carry it out of reach of&#xD;
discovery; or whether it was intentionally&#xD;
left where it would be found, with her glove&#xD;
in it as a decoy for suspicion, seems to me a&#xD;
matter of doubt, It will be only prudent&#xD;
to make every effort to discover traces, and&#xD;
obtain information all along the river, from&#xD;
here down to the spot where the boat was&#xD;
found, but, at the same time, we must not&#xD;
relax in pursuing the search in all ether&#xD;
directions as vigorously as possible."&#xD;
"It seems to me," said another one of&#xD;
the gentlemen, "that it will be the easiest&#xD;
thing in the world to find out all about the&#xD;
boat. She must have been seen by some-&#xD;
body on her way down the river. For fifty&#xD;
miles down from here, there is not a stretch&#xD;
of three miles not overlooked by some plan-&#xD;
tation or residence. It is impossible that&#xD;
a boat of that size, or indeed any size,&#xD;
whether occupied or empty, should have&#xD;
escaped notice the whole way."&#xD;
"That's if she went down in the day-&#xD;
time," said Martin, with stubborn convic-&#xD;
tion of the corectuess of his own surmise;&#xD;
"but my notion is that she went down in&#xD;
the night."&#xD;
"You mean that you think Miss Lee&#xD;
was carried down the river in this boat at&#xD;
night?" asked Governor Eston.&#xD;
"That's what I think, gov~nor.~~&#xD;
"But Miss Lee did not disappear until&#xD;
Thursday afternoon, late, while the boat&#xD;
was missing on Thursday morning?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Then, what do you suppose became of&#xD;
the boat all day Thursday? She must have&#xD;
been on the river somewhere, and not very&#xD;
far off either, if she were to be used as you&#xD;
think that night. Now, if she had been on.&#xD;
the river, she would certainly have been seen,&#xD;
and we should have heard of it before this&#xD;
time?"&#xD;
"She bought a bin run up into some&#xD;
creek that day. There's plenty of 'em, you&#xD;
&#xD;

MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
know, on both sides o' the river. There~s&#xD;
Caney Creek right below here, where she&#xD;
could a laid all day without any diffikilty.&#xD;
It twists about so, that there's no a&#xD;
hundred yards ahead any place on it-and&#xD;
it's so swampy along the banks that nobody&#xD;
ever goes a nigh it. She could a bin hid&#xD;
there handy enough, and come out after it&#xD;
was dark, and come up the river mebbe, to&#xD;
meee the skiff that Stone saw."&#xD;
This suggestion seemed so reasonable,&#xD;
that a majority of the company at once&#xD;
adopted the overseer's opinion, and were&#xD;
eager to set out on this new track of dis-&#xD;
covery. Some ~verc still doubtful, and in-&#xD;
slated on prose~~ting the search in other&#xD;
directions. A more organized plan than&#xD;
that which had been pursued up to this&#xD;
time wa's adopted, the gentlemen present&#xD;
being formed into different parties, a speci-&#xD;
fied locality allotted to each, and, agreeing&#xD;
upon Seyton House as the point of rendez-&#xD;
vous to which all intelligence was to be&#xD;
brought as speedily as possible, they sepa-&#xD;
rated.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
vox POPtILI.&#xD;
Arrun this, the days went by slowly&#xD;
and heavily, each one deepening the gloom&#xD;
and the mystery which hung over the fate&#xD;
of the missing girl: By degrees the activity&#xD;
of the search was discontinued, for no further&#xD;
trace was discovered, and a sort of hopeless&#xD;
apathy began to settle over the searchers.&#xD;
It was not from weariness or loss of interest,&#xD;
but simply because they had been met by&#xD;
blank failure in every direction, and because&#xD;
discouragement follows failure, as inevita-&#xD;
bly and as naturally as night follows day.&#xD;
They would have made any effort, they&#xD;
would have hesitated at no sacrifice, to re-&#xD;
cover her, but when all efforts and all sacri-&#xD;
fices proved utterly vain, when the fourth&#xD;
week of her absence had gone over, and&#xD;
they had not made the least advance toward&#xD;
discovery, It was only natural that the peo-&#xD;
ple at large-the people that were not bound&#xD;
to her by any ties of kindred or peculiar&#xD;
&#xD;
affection-should have lost heart, and begun&#xD;
to think those right who had, from the first,&#xD;
asserted a steady belief of her death. It&#xD;
was true that the question of accidental&#xD;
drowning had been entirely set at rest, and&#xD;
that no one in his senses could have&#xD;
doubted the testimony of Jacob Stone, or&#xD;
the evidence of the glove which had been&#xD;
found in the fiat-boat; but there remained&#xD;
the terrible surmise of violent death, and&#xD;
the morbid mind of the populace ever&#xD;
ready to receive, and, if necessary, to invent&#xD;
horror for itself- caught at the surmise&#xD;
with avidity. The intelligent portion of&#xD;
the community clung to a belief in her ab-&#xD;
duction, and could not see that the evidence&#xD;
tended in any other direction, but tife mass&#xD;
drew back from the search in sullen despair,&#xD;
and, looking at each other, said, "She has&#xD;
beea murdered!"&#xD;
It is almost unnecessary to say that her&#xD;
own family and friends opposed this belief&#xD;
with steady incredulity; clung, as people in&#xD;
their positions will cling, to the vaguest&#xD;
shadows of life, and shut their ears abso-&#xD;
lutely to the tragic solution of the mystery.&#xD;
Among them Nowell stood chief-a very&#xD;
bulwark of strength on which to lean~ But&#xD;
for his indomitable belief that Mabel was&#xD;
living, and his indomitable resolution to find&#xD;
her, every one else might have resigned&#xD;
himself through sheer despair, to a con-&#xD;
viction of her death. As it was, his pro-&#xD;
found skepticism and stern determination-&#xD;
a determination that never faltered for an&#xD;
instant - affected them as any strongly-&#xD;
rooted opinion must always affect the minds&#xD;
of others. They could not doubt, they&#xD;
could not sink down in absolute hopeless-&#xD;
ness, while he held his steady way, without&#xD;
a shadow of change or turning. "I will&#xD;
find her!" he had said on the first day of&#xD;
her disappearance, and he said it now' with a&#xD;
resolution, if any thing, deeper than before,&#xD;
when days had lengthened into weeks, and&#xD;
no gleam of success had cheered him. It&#xD;
was not singular that this belief infected&#xD;
every one around him, that it preserved Mr.&#xD;
Sexton from absolute despair, that it kept&#xD;
even Mrs. Lee up to some faint point of&#xD;
hope, and that it influenced Constance until&#xD;
she thought with his thoughts and accepted&#xD;

all his conclusions, save only the one eon-&#xD;
elusion that led him to a conviction of Con-&#xD;
way's guilt. On that point she remained&#xD;
flrmand in all Ayre her hand was the only&#xD;
onO ~utheld to the young man against whom&#xD;
there rose a deep and ever-growing murmur&#xD;
of recreation. For it was only natural that&#xD;
Ayre sh~uId adopt Nowell's opinion on the&#xD;
subject, and, looking about for an object of&#xD;
suspicion, should select the man whom Ma-&#xD;
bel's nearest connection was well known to&#xD;
have accused of a share at least in her dis-&#xD;
appearance. perhaps, if he had borne any&#xD;
other name, they might have qualified their&#xD;
judgment a little; might have given him at&#xD;
least the benefit of a doubt; but a Con-&#xD;
way-I ills patronymic in itself con-&#xD;
demned him past hope.&#xD;
Yet it would be hard to say how little&#xD;
this opinion or this indignation mattei:ed to&#xD;
the object of it-how little he regarded or&#xD;
even heard the ominous murmur of wrath-&#xD;
ful feeling daily growing stronger and&#xD;
deeper around him. He was still at Seyton&#xD;
House-waiting, hoping, looking for some&#xD;
clew, but, up to this time, waiting, hoping,&#xD;
looking, vainly. The other two gentlemen&#xD;
were gone. Mr. Harding took his depart-&#xD;
uro as soon as- he decently could, for lAs&#xD;
uncle's resolution in favor of Conway had&#xD;
)~Ot been rescinded~ as he had perhaps ex-&#xD;
pected, and, divested of any mercenary in-&#xD;
terest, Seyton House had become but a dull&#xD;
abode. He left with what show of dignity&#xD;
he could muster, and not long after Ainslie&#xD;
was reluctantly compelled to follow his ex-&#xD;
ample, having remained as long, or perhaps&#xD;
a little longer, than his convenience war-&#xD;
ranted. He had proved indefatigable in&#xD;
the search; but at last, like most of the&#xD;
rest, he seemed to lose heart. "My deaf~&#xD;
boy, be sure and summon me, if there is&#xD;
any emergency in which I can be of ser-&#xD;
vice," he said, when he was taking leave;&#xD;
but Conway saw that he thought such an&#xD;
emergency little likely to arise. So he, too,&#xD;
left the saddened house behind him, and,&#xD;
after the manner of human nature, set his&#xD;
4ee toward brighter scenes. Thus left&#xD;
alone-face to face with his position and its&#xD;
strasige responsibilities-Conway had little&#xD;
beside his own stout heart on which to lean.&#xD;
&#xD;
SLEE,&#xD;
&#xD;
His uncle was broken down in mind as well&#xD;
as body, and unable to afford him any as-&#xD;
sistance, save the material one of placing&#xD;
unlimited means at his command; and, be-&#xD;
sides Constance, there was not a single face&#xD;
which did not meet him with cold distrust&#xD;
or dark suspicion. The sins of the fathers&#xD;
are visited upon the children, by men as&#xD;
well as by God, and in nothing is this great&#xD;
law more conspicuously shown forth than&#xD;
in the matter of name and reputation. Who&#xD;
has not felt that the best earthly heritage&#xD;
which a man can leave his children, is the&#xD;
heritage of a good name ?-and who, also,&#xD;
has not felt (God help them, if it was in&#xD;
their own person!) that the most bitter and&#xD;
most clinging of all shame is that which&#xD;
comes by inheritance? It was this les-&#xD;
son which Mabel's outraged townspeople&#xD;
taught Conway now. "Do men gather&#xD;
grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?" the&#xD;
religious-minded among them were ready to&#xD;
quote on all occasions; while every discred-&#xD;
itable story which had ever been told of the&#xD;
father was revived, exaggerated, and used&#xD;
against the son. As a general thing, there&#xD;
is a sort of rough justice in this mode of&#xD;
treatment-it is well that men should be&#xD;
made to feel that the consequences of wrong-&#xD;
doing end not with themselves, that the few&#xD;
should suffer for the benefit of the many-&#xD;
but there was no justice at all in the form&#xD;
of it thus displayed; and so Conway bitter-&#xD;
ly felt. Feeling this, he bore himself tow-,&#xD;
ar.d his aggressors with a proud contempt,&#xD;
which they were quick enough to resent,&#xD;
quick enough to take hold of as fuel for the&#xD;
already rising flame-and so it was that all&#xD;
of a sudden he found his personal safety&#xD;
threatened.&#xD;
"I must warn that fellow," said Gov-&#xD;
ernor Eston one day, as he stood on a street-&#xD;
corner with several friends, and saw Con-&#xD;
way ride past. "Tbe people are at fever-&#xD;
heat, and he will be mobbed, if he keeps on&#xD;
coming here in this style."&#xD;
"Why need you interfere?" asked one&#xD;
of the others., "It is his own lookout, I am&#xD;
sure-the people express their sentiments&#xD;
plainly enough-and, for my part, I would&#xD;
not give him a warning to save him from&#xD;
the devil himself!"&#xD;

"Law and orddr are to be considered,"&#xD;
said the governor, who had been a governor,&#xD;
and therefore thought much of these things.&#xD;
"You don't suppose I am thinking of him-&#xD;
confound him! I confess, I should dislike&#xD;
any thing of the sort, on Mr. Sexton's no-&#xD;
count, though. He is pitiably broken down,&#xD;
and he clings to this fellow yet, you know."&#xD;
"So I suppose; but can you conceive&#xD;
how it is? Mr. Seyton used to be a man&#xD;
of some sense."&#xD;
"I don't pretend to account for the&#xD;
blindness of partiality," said the governor,&#xD;
shrugging his shoulders. And then he went&#xD;
off to warn Conway that for the present he&#xD;
would do well to avoid the vicinity of Ayre.&#xD;
He had not gone very far before he en-&#xD;
countered his son, who was leisurely stroll-&#xD;
ing alon~ in an opposite direction.&#xD;
"Have you met Conway anywhere,&#xD;
Frank?" the governor asked. "I saw him&#xD;
pass a moment ago, and I want to speak to&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I saw him pass, too," said young Estoh,&#xD;
carelessly, "but I took the best possible&#xD;
care not to look at him, since I had no de-&#xD;
sire to speak to him. There were three or&#xD;
four boys hooting after him; perhaps if you&#xD;
would ask some of them, they could tell you&#xD;
lils whereabouts."&#xD;
"What boys?" asked his father, frown-&#xD;
ing slightly.&#xD;
"Indeed, that is more than I can tell&#xD;
you-some nondescript ragamuffins or other.&#xD;
But it is a pity somebody does not warn&#xD;
him-Conway I mean-that Ayre is not the&#xD;
safest place in the world for him just now.&#xD;
They talk very suspiciously up-street."&#xD;
"Who talks?"&#xD;
"Almost everybody among the idlers,&#xD;
and working-men, and people of that ilk.&#xD;
Jim Barker was haranguing a small crowd&#xD;
at the street-corner a while ago."&#xD;
"I'll answer for him," said the gov-&#xD;
ernor, more assured than ever that it was&#xD;
high time to wara off the reckless young&#xD;
stranger who rode thus boldly into the lion's&#xD;
mouth. "I rather like his pluck," thought&#xD;
this brave, genial gentleman, who, in truth,&#xD;
liked pluck wherever or in whomsoever he&#xD;
might discover it; "but it won't do. There's&#xD;
no question of that-it won't do. He'll&#xD;

and then poor. Sexton -Halloa! what's&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
He had cause enough to know, having,&#xD;
spent thirty years in political life, and being&#xD;
therefore well acquainted with that peculiar&#xD;
sound, half hiss, ha If groan, by which an&#xD;
American mob expresses disapproval, and&#xD;
which now suddenly saluted his ears. He&#xD;
quickened his steps, and, turning a corner&#xD;
of a street, came full in view of a sight he&#xD;
had half expected.&#xD;
It chanced that some little time before&#xD;
Conway had alighted in front of a drug-&#xD;
store, and entered to make some small pur-&#xD;
chases. lie did not stay very long, but the&#xD;
fact of his presence sufficed to gather quite&#xD;
a knot of boys on the pavement opposite,&#xD;
who amused themselves by interchanging&#xD;
comments and remarks in loud tones with&#xD;
the loungers on the other side of the streeL&#xD;
"I say, Tom," shouted one o.f the bat-&#xD;
talion, to an ally in the door, "you better&#xD;
let Mr. Grinders know who's in his store.&#xD;
lie might like to put Miss Ellen under lock&#xD;
and key. She'll be apt to turn up missing&#xD;
if he don't."&#xD;
"P'raps he had better look out him.&#xD;
sell', too," suggested another. LL ~Long as&#xD;
his hand's in now, the gentleman, mebbe,&#xD;
won't stop with women."&#xD;
"No doubt he's a-buyin' pisen," said a&#xD;
third.&#xD;
"If anybody's took awful with sudden&#xD;
fits to-night, we'll know what give it to&#xD;
'em," cried a fourth.&#xD;
"Mebbe he means to finish off the fam-&#xD;
ily-tell him to be sure and not forget Mr.&#xD;
Newell while he's about it, Tom," said num-&#xD;
her one again.&#xD;
"Let's give him a salute when he comes&#xD;
out," cried another. "There~ he is now!&#xD;
Steady, boys. Hiss-s!"&#xD;
A perfect roar of groans, hisses, and&#xD;
cries ensued; but Conway paid no more&#xD;
attention to it than if it had borne no sound&#xD;
to his ears. He did not even glance toward&#xD;
the small indignant; but quietly unfastened&#xD;
his horse's bridle from the post over which&#xD;
it was thrown, and mounted. It was just&#xD;
as he did so, just as he settled himself in the&#xD;
saddle, that a heavy missile of some deserip-&#xD;

tion whirled past, and, narrowly missing his&#xD;
head, grazed his shoulder. And it was at&#xD;
this instant-as he wheeled about with a&#xD;
riding-whip uplifted in his hand-that Gov-&#xD;
ernor Eston caine round the corner.&#xD;
The matter looked serious enough, for&#xD;
several men who had been standing by with&#xD;
their hands in their pockets, not exactly&#xD;
participating, 'but only encouraging, the&#xD;
boys, now came to the fore with angry&#xD;
countenances.&#xD;
"None o' that here," said one of them,&#xD;
a tall, burly giant. "You had better put&#xD;
that whip down, and take yourself off, if&#xD;
you know what's good for you. We'll have&#xD;
no murderers threatening our children.&#xD;
Take yourself ofl and be d-d to you, before&#xD;
we pitch you into the river."&#xD;
"Try it," said Conway, curtly. "You&#xD;
insolent scoundrel, stand out of the way&#xD;
immediately, or I'll break this whip over&#xD;
your head!"&#xD;
"At him, Jim! Give it to him!" cried&#xD;
one or two voices in the rear.&#xD;
"D-n him, let him come off 'en his&#xD;
horse," said Jim, "then I'll show him.&#xD;
It's only a coward what threatens a man on&#xD;
foot when he's on horseback. Yea, it's only&#xD;
a coward."&#xD;
He had scarcely spoken the last word,&#xD;
when the loaded whip-handle descended on&#xD;
his head with a force that sent him to the&#xD;
ground like a felled ox. Then, inamoment,&#xD;
all was tumult and violence. Men who had&#xD;
been watching the scene from a distance,&#xD;
rushed eagerly forward; those near by&#xD;
dashed at Conway fiercely, and for several&#xD;
minutes his safety was more than question-&#xD;
able. The mad mob spirit had needed only&#xD;
a spark to set it in ablaze, and, as Governor&#xD;
Eston hurried forward, the scene was one&#xD;
of the wildest confusion and uproar. Curses&#xD;
were freely hurled back and forth~ to-&#xD;
g~ther with such pleasant cries as "Take&#xD;
him off!" "Pull him down!" "Knock the&#xD;
horse in the head!" while'all that was to&#xD;
be seen was a surging mass of men and&#xD;
boys, the rearing, plunging horse in the&#xD;
middle, Conway firm as an equestrian statue&#xD;
on its back, and the whip still clinched in&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
"Whoever touches me gets this!" he&#xD;
&#xD;
said, raising it as he spoke. "Come on, if&#xD;
you dare! If you are cowards enough to&#xD;
attack an unarmed man-come on!"&#xD;
"Not half such cowards as you," cried&#xD;
another one of those voices in the rear.&#xD;
"We never carried off a woman or&#xD;
drowned her either."&#xD;
"Come out, where I can see you, and&#xD;
repeat that!" said Conway, with his eyes&#xD;
gleaming like coals of fire.&#xD;
But the unknown worthy had no mind&#xD;
for this. Indeed, although at least fifty men&#xD;
had assembled by this time, they were all&#xD;
for the moment held at bay by the rearing&#xD;
horse, the uplifted whip, and the defiance&#xD;
and courage which the man's whole attitude&#xD;
breathed. If there had been one sign of&#xD;
falter, or token of fear in face or figure, his&#xD;
fate might have been sealed then and there,&#xD;
for the hot Southern blood is not much&#xD;
given to reasoning, or to counting conse-&#xD;
quences on occasions of this kind; and it&#xD;
had been at fever-heat for many days. But,&#xD;
as it was, they followed the notable example&#xD;
of the Tuscan chivalry in the ballad-&#xD;
"And those behind cried 'Forward!'&#xD;
And those before cried Back!"'&#xD;
So they were still swaying to and fro, in&#xD;
confused irresolution, when Governor Es-&#xD;
ton saw his opportunity and took it.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of all this I" he&#xD;
cried, and his voice-a voice accustomed to&#xD;
rise above the roar of popular assemblages&#xD;
-rang clearly over the heads of the aston-&#xD;
ished crowd. "Is it Ayre men who are&#xD;
insulting an unarmed stranger, in such a&#xD;
manner as this? Shame to you all! Double&#xD;
shame to whoever began the row! Stand&#xD;
back, and let me pass. I am an Ayre man,&#xD;
and I must apologize for the conduct of my&#xD;
townsmen."&#xD;
"He's a murderer, gov~nor~you know&#xD;
he's a murderer!" cried several, though&#xD;
the majority were silent, and, as there was&#xD;
little or no unanimity of purpose, began to&#xD;
fall back.&#xD;
"How do you dare to sa.y that?" cried&#xD;
the governor, angrily. "You have no right&#xD;
to judge any man till the law decides his&#xD;
guilt-and the law no more decides Mr.&#xD;
Conway's guilt than it does mine. Stand&#xD;
back, I say, and go home."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
~'He's knocked all the sense out of Jim not to the point. I was about to say, Mr.&#xD;
Barker, any way," cried one spirit, too Conway, that if you consult your safety,&#xD;

AFTER his abrupt parting with Governor&#xD;

Street, whel~e the late encounter had oc-&#xD;
curred, into the quieter portion of the town&#xD;
where Mrs. Lee lived. His way to her&#xD;
house led him past the Catholic church, and&#xD;
the priest's house, which adjoined it; but&#xD;
he did not turn his head, and so failed to see&#xD;
that Father Lawrence, followed by Nancy,&#xD;
was just issuing from the latter, as he went&#xD;
by at a sharp canter.&#xD;
"Is not that Mr. Conway?" asked the&#xD;
father, speaking over his shoulder to Nancy,&#xD;
as she tramped along behind. "Did Con-&#xD;
stance send for him 'also?"&#xD;
"Not as I knows of, sir," was the re-&#xD;
sponse. "Deed, I'm sure she didn't-for&#xD;
she sent Uncle Jack for Mass Francis, and&#xD;
me for you, and she didn't have nobody to&#xD;
send for Mr. Conway."&#xD;
"He is going to your house, though, I&#xD;
-think."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I 'spect he is."&#xD;
"He will be just in time, then."&#xD;
"I wonder-" began the good priest,&#xD;
thoughtfully. But at that moment Conway&#xD;
chanced to look back, and, seeing those two&#xD;
together, turned and galloped hastily toward.&#xD;
them. He understood at once that Father&#xD;
Lawrence had been summoned by Con-&#xD;
stance or her mother, and i{ that summons&#xD;
foreboded news, whether good or ill, he&#xD;
wished to hear it at once.&#xD;
"Good-morning, father," he said, as he&#xD;
drew~ near, and reined up Mazeppa so&#xD;
suddenly as alin9st to throw him on his&#xD;
haunches. "Have they heard any thing&#xD;
new at Mrs. Lee's?"&#xD;
'~ Good-morning, Mr. Conway, answered&#xD;
the father,~a little more ceremoniously than&#xD;
he often spoke, for, kind and gentle as he&#xD;
was by nature, and little given to judging&#xD;
auy one, he could ziot but regard with some-&#xD;
thing of distrust this blacji sheep who had&#xD;
&#xD;
wandered into his fold,' and whom every&#xD;
one believed to be connected, either directly&#xD;
or indirectly, with the loss of its pet Iamb.&#xD;
"Yes; they have heard some news at Mrs.&#xD;
Lee's-not ill news, however," he added,&#xD;
quickly, as he saw how pale thG young&#xD;
man's face became. I' Good news, rather.&#xD;
Constance sends me word that she has just&#xD;
received a letter from Mabel."&#xD;
"A letter I-from Mabel!"&#xD;
It was all he could say, for his aston-&#xD;
ishment was so great that it quite over-&#xD;
whelmed him. He ~Iooked at Nancy, with&#xD;
a mute interrogation which Nancy answered&#xD;
in her own dry fashion.&#xD;
"Yes, sir; a letter from Miss Mabel.&#xD;
Miss Constance got it about half an hour&#xD;
ago, and she sent me right straight for Fa-&#xD;
ther Lawrence."&#xD;
"Why did she not send-why did she&#xD;
not let me know I"&#xD;
"There has not been time," said Father&#xD;
Lawrence. "Of course she would have sent&#xD;
and let Mr. Seyton and yourself know, if-&#xD;
But don't let me detain you, Mr. Conway.&#xD;
I see you are in haste to go on."&#xD;
Conway had not the least idea of allow-&#xD;
ing himself to be detained; but he mut-&#xD;
tered something like a hasty acknowledg-&#xD;
ment for this consideration, and, striking his&#xD;
spurs almost unconsciously into the aston-&#xD;
ished Mazeppa, galloped forward, and was&#xD;
out of sight in a moment.&#xD;
A few seconds later, he had dismounted&#xD;
at Mrs. Lee's gate, and was walking up the&#xD;
rose-bordered path that led to the front&#xD;
door. It stood 'open, as usual; but an inex-&#xD;
pressible air of silence and sadness brooded&#xD;
over the house. No voice sounded, no foot-&#xD;
step echoed, no pleasant carol of song, or&#xD;
'ripple of laughter, came from the sitting-&#xD;
room, or floated down the stairs. All was&#xD;
rigid order and unbroken silence. He stood&#xD;
listening for a moment, but the house 'might&#xD;
have been deserted, for all sign of life it&#xD;
gave-and then knocked gently on one side&#xD;
of the open door. The next instant there&#xD;
was a rustle of garments, a light footstep,&#xD;
and Constance came down the staircase to&#xD;
meet him. She started when she saw who&#xD;
it was; but it was not a start of ill-plessd&#xD;
surprise. On the, contrary, she~ smiled as&#xD;
&#xD;
he had not seen her smile in weary weeks,&#xD;
and held out her hand.&#xD;
"You are just in time," she said. "I-&#xD;
but I see you have heard the news. Hush!&#xD;
-not a word! Mamma will overhear us if&#xD;
we talk here. Come in."&#xD;
He followed without a syllable, as she&#xD;
led the way into the sitting-room, the blinds&#xD;
of which were closed to exclude as much as&#xD;
possible of the sultry August air, and the&#xD;
cool, fragrant atmosphere of which might&#xD;
at another moment have brought to him a&#xD;
sense of positive rest and peace. But now&#xD;
he could think of nothing save the news he&#xD;
had heard and was yet to hear-the strange,&#xD;
incomprehensible news, as it seemed-and&#xD;
the moment they were within the room, he&#xD;
turned to her.&#xD;
"Tell' me," he said, hurriedly, "is it&#xD;
true? Have you-have you really heard&#xD;
from her?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have heard from her," she an-&#xD;
swered, in an almost solemn tone. "It is&#xD;
very strange, but it is true. She gives no&#xD;
explanation. She tells us nothing-but, 0&#xD;
Mr. Conway, she is living! and that is all&#xD;
we need care to know."&#xD;
"All we need care to know!" he re-&#xD;
peated, passionately. "It is what I haye&#xD;
known all the time, and it is tlte thought&#xD;
above all others which sets me mad! It-&#xD;
hut this is folly. Let me see the letter."&#xD;
He spoke imperiously-spoke as one who&#xD;
deniands a right, rather than as one who&#xD;
requests a favor-but Constance made no&#xD;
demur. She drew the letter at once from&#xD;
her pocket and held it toward him.&#xD;
"It will hurt you," she said. "I give&#xD;
you warning of. that beforehand. Bat it is&#xD;
your right to see it, and I would not with-&#xD;
hold it if I could. Only, before you take it,&#xD;
thank God with me, once at least, that she&#xD;
is yet spared to us."&#xD;
But he did not say a word. He took&#xD;
the letter to one of the windows, dashed&#xD;
open the shutters, and read the few lines it&#xD;
contained.&#xD;
"My DARLING: Don't think hardly of&#xD;
me that I should have gone away~as I 4id,&#xD;
and caused you all the suffering and anxiety&#xD;
of the past three weeks. I could not help&#xD;
&#xD;
it-indeed Ii could not-and when you hear&#xD;
my story, you will forgive me, I am sure. I&#xD;
am happy-quite happy; and I beg you to&#xD;
believe so. Don't fret about me, and don't&#xD;
let mamma fret. Tell her to feel as if I had&#xD;
gone on a visit, and to believe-what I sol-&#xD;
emnly assure her-that I will return very&#xD;
soon. I hoped indeed to see you before&#xD;
this; but it is impossible just now. I only&#xD;
write to relieve your mind; to tell you that&#xD;
I am alive and well; that I have done noth-&#xD;
ing which need grieve you, and that I love&#xD;
you as dearly as ever. Kiss mamma for me,&#xD;
and my dear godfather. Tell them both that&#xD;
I am certainly coming back; and remember&#xD;
always that you have the whole heart of&#xD;
"MABEL."&#xD;
That was all. Not a word of explana-&#xD;
tion concerning her departure, her com-&#xD;
panion, or her intention; not the faintest&#xD;
clew of her whereabouts; not the slightest&#xD;
mention of the lover to whom she had gone&#xD;
away affianced. The letter which Constance&#xD;
greeted so gladly had only made the mys-&#xD;
tery deeper than ever; and only added ten-&#xD;
fold darker doubts and fears than those&#xD;
which had encompassed it before.&#xD;
And Constance, looking on, saw Con-&#xD;
way's face pale whiter and whiter, as he&#xD;
read the short page to the end; and when&#xD;
he finished, instead of turning round and&#xD;
speaking, his eye went back to the begin-&#xD;
ning, as if he could not believe that what he&#xD;
saw was indeed all. Then suddenly he&#xD;
turned and flung it on the table before her.&#xD;
"It is a lie!" he said. "My God, Miss&#xD;
Lee, do you thing I am mad, to credit -such&#xD;
a thing as this?"&#xD;
She looked at him with eyes full of piti-&#xD;
ful amaze, but before she could reply sLeps&#xD;
sounded in the hall, and Father Lawrence,&#xD;
accompanied by Nowell, entered the room.&#xD;
They had encountered ~ich other at the&#xD;
gate, and it was very evident that the latter&#xD;
as well as the former had already heard the&#xD;
news which was the cause of their abrupt&#xD;
summoi~s. 'He soaroely noticed Vonway at&#xD;
all, and gave his companion no time for greet-&#xD;
ings, but walked directly up to his cousin.&#xD;
"You sent for me, Constance-what is&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
&#xD;
$&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8069-00000057"/>&#xD;
A FORGERY                           111&#xD;
&#xD;
110                           M4.BEI~ LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
He had advanced to the table near which&#xD;
she was standing, and, instead of replying,&#xD;
she pushed the letter across to him. He&#xD;
seized it at once, opened and read it just&#xD;
where he was. The three, looking on, saw&#xD;
the lines of his face deepen and harden&#xD;
with every moment-the rugged eyebrows&#xD;
draw nearer and nearer together, until they&#xD;
knit themselves into a dark frown, while&#xD;
the narrow lipa were compressed like iron.&#xD;
When he finished reading, he looked up,&#xD;
not at Constance, nor at Conway, but at&#xD;
Father Lawrence, and held the open sheet&#xD;
toward him.&#xD;
"I suppose you would like to see it," he&#xD;
said, in his cold, harsh voice. "Take it, by&#xD;
all means, and admire, if you can, such a&#xD;
notable device."&#xD;
"A notable device!" the other re-&#xD;
peated. "What do you mean?"&#xD;
"Read it, and answer that question for&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
Father Lawrence received the letter, but,&#xD;
as he did so, his eyes wandered to Con-&#xD;
stance, and, seeing how pale and faint she&#xD;
was, he took a step forward, and before she&#xD;
knew what he was about, seated her in a&#xD;
deep chair that stood near. Then he laid&#xD;
his hand on her shoulder. "My poor child,&#xD;
keep still!" he said. It was all that he did&#xD;
say; but his sweet, solemn voice spoke as&#xD;
much to her heart as to her worn-out frame.&#xD;
Keep still! It is what faith says to us al-&#xD;
ways-what it tells the troubled, the weary,&#xD;
and the anxious, in all trials, however great&#xD;
or however small. Our puny efforts can&#xD;
avail literally nothing against the mighty&#xD;
barrier of circumstance which is the expo-&#xD;
nent of God's decree ;but there is Another,&#xD;
and a Stronger, who holds all things in His&#xD;
hand, to whom all things whatsoever are&#xD;
possible, end who susteins those who lay&#xD;
down all weapons of warfare at His feet.&#xD;
Keep still I Poo; aching, wretched human&#xD;
hearts,~ when shall we learn that in this is&#xD;
comprised the answer to all enigmas, the&#xD;
ending of all griefs, the cessation of all aux--&#xD;
ieties? When shall we learn it? Ah, sure-&#xD;
ly, not while the agony of bereavement or&#xD;
of outrage is pressing upon us, while every&#xD;
heart-string is torn and bleeding, and every&#xD;
nerve is quivering with some bitter hope-&#xD;
&#xD;
lessness, or when the gray pall of some&#xD;
mighty desolation comes down and shuts&#xD;
out all glory, all beauty, all comfort, human&#xD;
or divine, in one great blackness! Yet, even&#xD;
then, it is taught us sometimes, through&#xD;
sheer exhaustion; and it was thus that Con-&#xD;
stance learned it now. She sank back,&#xD;
closed her eyes, and faintly moved her lips&#xD;
in prayer, while-with his hand still resting&#xD;
on her shoulder-Father Lawrence read the&#xD;
letter signed with Mabel's name.&#xD;
When he finished, he looked up at Now-&#xD;
dl, with astonishment and incredulity legi-&#xD;
ble on his face.&#xD;
"What is the meaning of it?" he asked.&#xD;
"It cannot be Mabel - our Mabel - who&#xD;
writes thus?"&#xD;
"Mabel!" repeated the other, scornfully.&#xD;
"Can you think such a thing? Is it possi-&#xD;
ble you do not see the object for which that&#xD;
precious effusion has been manufactured?"&#xD;
"I-how should I?"&#xD;
"How should you? Why, the plot is so&#xD;
shallow that a child might read it! So&#xD;
shallow, that the end aimed at-the end of&#xD;
calling off search and inquiry-was never&#xD;
further from being gained than at this mo-&#xD;
ment! So shallow, that the plotter, who-&#xD;
ever he may be, might have done better, if&#xD;
he had tried, I am sure!"&#xD;
His eyes turned darkly and sternly tow-&#xD;
ard Conway as he uttered the last words;&#xD;
but Conway paid no attention to the glance.&#xD;
On the contrary, he, too, looked directly at&#xD;
Father Lawrence, and addressed himself to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I agree with Mr. Nowell, sir," be said;&#xD;
"and you, I am sure, will agree with both&#xD;
of us. That letter is not-cannot be-.--gen-&#xD;
nine.&#xD;
The priest looked down at it and shook&#xD;
his head slowly, like one much troubled and&#xD;
perplexed.&#xD;
"I cannot believe that it is genuine," he&#xD;
said, "but yet it is Mabel's writing. We&#xD;
must all recognize that."&#xD;
"It is a forgery of her writing," said&#xD;
Nowell, curtly.&#xD;
Conway started and looked at him ea-&#xD;
gerly. "You think so?" he asked.&#xD;
"No," the other answered. ~' I know&#xD;
it."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"But you must have some reason-some&#xD;
proof for such a belief?"&#xD;
"I desire no better reason, no better&#xD;
proof, than its own internal evidence, Mr.&#xD;
Conway," said Nowell, coldly. "I do not&#xD;
despair of finding others, however.-Con-&#xD;
stance, will you get me some of Mabel's&#xD;
writing? Father Lawrence, if you have fin-&#xD;
ished with that thing, I will trouble you for&#xD;
it."&#xD;
Constance left the room, and Father&#xD;
Lawrence handed over "the thing" at once.&#xD;
When the former returned, she brought an&#xD;
open letter in her hand.&#xD;
"This was written last Christmas, when&#xD;
Mabel was spending a month at Colonel&#xD;
Mordaunt's," she said. "I have nothing&#xD;
later."&#xD;
"It Will do," said Nowell, and he car-&#xD;
ried the two letters to the window which&#xD;
Conway had thrown open, and laid them&#xD;
side by side before him-side by side, com-&#xD;
pared them patiently. They were very&#xD;
much alike, so much alike that it was not&#xD;
wonderful Constance, had been deceived,&#xD;
and that he himself had only been enlight-&#xD;
ened by what seemed a flash of inspiration.&#xD;
They were almost identical in general ap-&#xD;
pearance, but an eye less quick than his&#xD;
might have noticed that in detail they dif.h&#xD;
fered. Many little tricks of the pen were&#xD;
visible in the first, which the second totally&#xD;
lacked; and there was a formality, a regu-&#xD;
larity of aspect in the last, which the other&#xD;
did not exhibit. Beyond this, the difference&#xD;
was too subtle to be expressed - it was&#xD;
only to be felt. Most of us have seen forged&#xD;
handwriting in our time, and most of us,&#xD;
therefore, will have recognized what Now-&#xD;
dl recognized then-i. e., the undoubted&#xD;
fact that every thing on this strange earth&#xD;
of ours possesses a soul as well as a body,&#xD;
and that the soul of reality is invariably ab-&#xD;
sent in writing meant to simulate another&#xD;
hand than that of the person who guides the&#xD;
pen. It is like some poetry we have read-&#xD;
some statuary we have seen-some music&#xD;
we have heard-a body, which may per-&#xD;
haps be a very beautiful body, but is none&#xD;
the less a body without a soul. Newell had&#xD;
not the faintest leaning toward metaphysics,&#xD;
or any thing connected with it, so he did&#xD;
&#xD;
not put this thought into words-much less&#xD;
pause to follow it out in all its bearings. He&#xD;
simply accepted a fact as he found it; and&#xD;
the fact here stared him in the face, that&#xD;
the letter which purported to have been&#xD;
written by Mabel, bore upon it the stamp&#xD;
of unreality. Further than this he could&#xD;
not go, for, from the first word to the last,&#xD;
there was not a line or a dot which afforded&#xD;
him even the slightest clew.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Father Lawrence, turning to&#xD;
Constance, asked if she had told her mother&#xD;
any thing of this new turn of affairs. She&#xD;
shook her head.&#xD;
"No," she said. "I did not doubt the&#xD;
letter myself-I did not think for a moment&#xD;
of its being forged-but still I had a vague&#xD;
misgiving, and I felt that it was wisest not&#xD;
to tell her. It would have been such a&#xD;
cruel blow-nh! father, such a cruel blow&#xD;
to learn that it was false."&#xD;
"It was wisest to have left her in igno-&#xD;
rance," he answered, gently. And yet he&#xD;
felt that it was not on Mrs. Lee that the&#xD;
cruel blow had fallen-that hope had come&#xD;
for one moment, to be dashed by despair the&#xD;
next-and his heart ached for the piteous&#xD;
eyes uplifted to his face. He looked half&#xD;
appealingly at Conway, and Conway came&#xD;
forward and spoke.&#xD;
"Take comfort, Miss Lee," he said. "If&#xD;
your cousin is right-and I firmly believe&#xD;
that he is-in pronouncing that letter a for-&#xD;
gery, it goes to prove that out' search has&#xD;
in some way struck nearer the truth than&#xD;
we ourselves had dared to hope. If it is a&#xD;
forgery, it is meant, as he says, to call off&#xD;
inquiry; and therefore it proves conclusive-&#xD;
ly that inquiry has become dangerous."&#xD;
"It does even more," added Father. Law-&#xD;
rence. "It gives a clew that may prove a&#xD;
very valuable aid to search."&#xD;
Conway shook his head.&#xD;
"I am not sanguine of that," he said.&#xD;
"The man who could forge such a letter&#xD;
as this would consider well all possible&#xD;
chances of detection, and avoid them."&#xD;
"But have you examkied? Have you&#xD;
looked at the post-mark, for instance ~&#xD;
"I have," said Constance, as Conway&#xD;
took up the envelope, which lay on the ta-&#xD;
ble. "It tells nothing."&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="112 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8069-00000058"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
"No," said Conway, "for it i~ ~ at&#xD;
Edgerton; and Edgerton is a point where&#xD;
so many different points of travel converge,&#xD;
that ~ny one in passing might drop a letter,&#xD;
and safely defy detection. Besides, it is&#xD;
only sixty miles distant from here."&#xD;
"The seal, then?"&#xD;
"The seal is certainly Mabel's," said&#xD;
Constance. "it is a device of which she&#xD;
was very fond, and always wore on her&#xD;
chatelaine . It is hers-I am sure of that."&#xD;
Conway looked at the seal-he, too, rec-&#xD;
ognized the device-and, while he looked,&#xD;
Noweil came back to the table.&#xD;
"I never saw a better imitation of a&#xD;
handwriting," the latter said,* with obvious&#xD;
reference to the letter in his hand. "There&#xD;
is not a stroke to betray the forgery; and&#xD;
yet, on the fact that i~ is forged, I would be&#xD;
willing to stake my life.-Constance, if you&#xD;
take my advice, you will say nothing to my&#xD;
aunt about this."&#xD;
"I bad not thought of saying any thing,&#xD;
Francis."&#xD;
"And I will take the letter with me to&#xD;
my office. Perhaps, by dint of hard study,&#xD;
I may find some clew in it. Where is the&#xD;
envelope?"&#xD;
Conway handed it to him, and he took&#xD;
it with a cold bend of the head, by way of&#xD;
acknowledgment. Having refolded and&#xD;
replaced the letter, he put it in his pocket,&#xD;
and left the room after a general good-morn-&#xD;
ing. But lie had hardly vanished from&#xD;
sight, when his cousin started forward, and&#xD;
followed him to the front door.&#xD;
"Francis," she said, hastily, as he turned&#xD;
at the' sound of her step behind him, "I&#xD;
want to beg one favor-don't keep any&#xD;
thing from me. If-if you do find a clew, for&#xD;
Heaven's sake let me know of it. I can&#xD;
bear any thing better than a thought of se-&#xD;
crecy. Promise me this!"&#xD;
He looked at her intently before he re-&#xD;
plied; and even he was touched by her&#xD;
pleading eyes and quivering features, so&#xD;
that when he answered it was almost&#xD;
gently.&#xD;
"yes, I promise. But I have little or&#xD;
no hope of finding any thing. There!&#xD;
don't keep me. I must go."&#xD;
"One moment! Tell me what you&#xD;
&#xD;
think. Does this prove that-that she is&#xD;
alive?"&#xD;
"I have never doubted her being alive;&#xD;
and, if it proves any thing, it certainly goes&#xD;
to prove that," He hesitated a moment,&#xD;
then went on quickly: "Keep heart, Con-&#xD;
stance. Remember this-if she is on the&#xD;
earth, I will find her."&#xD;
She looked up at him gratefuhly-ah! so&#xD;
grateully-~nd still followed him with her&#xD;
eyes after he strode away. He was rough,&#xD;
and harsh, and bitter, but she wondered&#xD;
now it she had ever before been conscious&#xD;
of his inestimable value; ever before recog-&#xD;
nized the sterling gold that made the foun-&#xD;
dation of his character; ever before realized&#xD;
how entirely he was that best of all things&#xD;
on this earth of ours-a sure and steadfast&#xD;
help in time of need; a very tower of&#xD;
strength, on whom the weak and helpless&#xD;
could lean; and in whom they could put&#xD;
trust, sure that it would never be betrayed.&#xD;
When she went back into the sitting-&#xD;
room, she found that Father Lawrence had&#xD;
gone up to see Mrs. Lee, who, during all&#xD;
these weeks, had never left her chamber,&#xD;
andthat Conway was sitting in an attitude&#xD;
of profound despondency by the centre-&#xD;
table, his arms supported on it, and his head&#xD;
buried in his hands. He did not hear her&#xD;
step as she entered, and the sound of her&#xD;
voice at his side was the first thing that&#xD;
roused him, Then he looked up with ,a&#xD;
face that quite startled her by its pallor and&#xD;
haggardness.&#xD;
"Did you speak to me?" he said~ "I&#xD;
beg pardon, I did not hear you."&#xD;
"I only called your name," she an-&#xD;
swered. "I only wanted to say to you&#xD;
what Francis said to me a moment ago-&#xD;
Keep heart. 0 Mr. Conway, God 'is very&#xD;
good. He will never be cruel enough to&#xD;
take her from us forever'&#xD;
The cloud on his face did not lift, but&#xD;
rather darkened, and the pale lips com-&#xD;
pressed themselves like steel. When he re-&#xD;
plied, it was slowly and laboredly, ~s one&#xD;
who speaks under the pressure of some&#xD;
stern self-control.&#xD;

weeks, and I-am here!"&#xD;
She could not say any thing to comfort&#xD;
him. She stood too sadly in need of com-&#xD;
fort herself to be able to speak words of&#xD;
hope and cheer. She could not again bid him&#xD;
"keep heart," for, alas! her own heart was&#xD;
failing, and her own courage sinking with&#xD;
every moment. She could only lay her thin&#xD;
white hand-a shadowy hand it had grown&#xD;
in these six weeks~down upon his, and re-&#xD;
peat once more, as if the words had been a&#xD;
talisman:&#xD;
"God is very good to us!" Then she&#xD;
added, softly, "His will be done."&#xD;
He looked up impatiently, almost fiercely&#xD;
-who shall say with what reply trembling&#xD;
on his lips ?-but the pale, worn face, the&#xD;
large, sad eyes, hushed and rebuked him.&#xD;
This woman had suffered more than he; this&#xD;
woman's desolation was deeper than his;&#xD;
but she could say that-.-she could feel that&#xD;
-while his heart was one seething caldron&#xD;
of bitterness against the Omnipotent, as&#xD;
well as against the perpetrators of the crime&#xD;
which had outraged him! He could not&#xD;
imitate her faith, though it seemed to him&#xD;
8.&#xD;
&#xD;
at the moment almost sublime; for he had&#xD;
flung his human strength against the mighty&#xD;
strength of God's fiat, and had yet to learn&#xD;
that the end of this unequal conflict is only&#xD;
weariness and defeat. But he felt awed and&#xD;
silenced, as we have all felt in the presence&#xD;
of something which is as far above us as the&#xD;
everlasting heavens are above the earth.&#xD;
"I hope He will be good to you," he&#xD;
said. "I hope you may never feel one hun-&#xD;
dredth part of what I feel at this moment.&#xD;
If you ever should, then He can at least&#xD;
pity you. I think I had better go now. It is&#xD;
growing late, and I have yet to learn what&#xD;
the mail brought to Seyton House."&#xD;
"Do you think it is likely to have&#xD;
brought you a letter like-like that one?"&#xD;
"No, I don't think so. Either it is&#xD;
their policy to ignore me, or else the forger&#xD;
or forgers do not know of my existence.&#xD;
But I do expect, I have been expecting&#xD;
daily, news from one of my agents."&#xD;
"You have agents at work, then?"&#xD;
He laughed bitterly.&#xD;
"Do you think I have been idle all this&#xD;
time? I have my suspicions-I have had&#xD;
them from the first-but they were vague&#xD;
and needed proof. I could not prosecute&#xD;
the search for this proof myself, because to&#xD;
do so would have been to excite alarm, but&#xD;
I have put a safe detective on the track,&#xD;
and I wait-that is all."&#xD;
"And when-"&#xD;
She stopped short. Her quick ear caught&#xD;
the click of the front gate, and the sound of&#xD;
a man's tread on the gravel-walk that led to&#xD;
the house. She turned hastily, thinking&#xD;
that Newell might have ceme hack; but in-&#xD;
stead of Nowell it was Anderson who ap-&#xD;
peared. He walked into the hall, and then&#xD;
stood still, hesitating evidently whether to&#xD;
knock on one side of the open door, or to&#xD;
pass through to the kitchen. While he hesi-&#xD;
tated, Constance went forward, startling&#xD;
him very much by suddenly appearing, 1ik~,&#xD;
a white apparition, in the sitting-room door.&#xD;
"What is it, Anderson?" she asked.&#xD;
Anderson started, but touched his hat,.&#xD;
and answered promptly. " It's only M~s&#xD;
Phil I'm looking for, ma'am. Is he herq? ',~&#xD;
"Yes, he is here., Have you any thing&#xD;
for him?"&#xD;

changed only a few short sentences with the&#xD;
servant,~ and then went back to Constance.&#xD;
"My uncle has sent for me," he said.&#xD;
"Like a fool, I think it may mean some-&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
N&#xD;
4 LOST TiiIxKnT.&#xD;
DiSMOuNTING at the door of Seyton&#xD;
House, Conway tossed his rein to a servant&#xD;
who came fovwttrd at the moment, walked&#xD;
haet~ly round, and entered the library by&#xD;
one of its windows.&#xD;
his As he expected, he found Mr. Sexton in&#xD;
usual place-the deep arm-chair that&#xD;
was wheeled just before Mabel's portrait.&#xD;
H~ had broken terribly in these six weeks,&#xD;
had grown wan and weak of aspect, falter-&#xD;
ing of speech, and altogether more like a&#xD;
quavering old man than like the elegant&#xD;
gentleman, whose courtly beauty and court-&#xD;
ly refinement had been a proverb all his&#xD;
life-but he looked up now with some ring&#xD;
of the old self, both in voice and manner.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, Phil," he said.&#xD;
"You must forgive me for sending after&#xD;
you, ~nd startling you, no doubt; 'but these&#xD;
eame~ and I could not restrain my impa-&#xD;
tie~e to hear what was in them."&#xD;
~ X~e pointed to the table, and Conway,&#xD;
~d~rancIng, saw two letters lying there. The&#xD;
young man took them up eagerly. They&#xD;
were both directed to himself, by the same&#xD;
h~nd, aiidbothlxrethe same post-mark. He&#xD;
4latieedatthern; and then looked up at his&#xD;
uncle.&#xD;
are from Atkins," he said, tear-&#xD;
hag one of them open as he spoke. "I won-&#xD;
&#xD;
der you did not see this, and read them,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"I did aee, or rather take for granted,&#xD;
that they were from him," Mr. Seyton an-&#xD;
swered. "But it did not occur to me to&#xD;
read what was not directed to me. Indeed,&#xD;
I don't think I should have done so if it had&#xD;
occurred to me. Make haste, Philip. Tell&#xD;
me what he says."&#xD;
"I can't tell yet," Conway replied, run-&#xD;
ning his eye hastily down the page before&#xD;
him. "I-but perhaps the shortest way&#xD;
will be to read it aloud."&#xD;
He read aloud, therefore-rapidly, but&#xD;
distinctly-.-the letter which follows:&#xD;
"-VILLE, VmGINIA, .Aug~et 7, 15-.&#xD;
"Sin: I reached this point a week ago,&#xD;
and I should have let you hear from me be-&#xD;
fore now, if there had been any thing to&#xD;
tell you. But there has not been. I have&#xD;
been looking about and feeling my ground,&#xD;
but I have not discovered any thing yet.&#xD;
According to your instructions, I send you&#xD;
an account of all I have found out up to this&#xD;
time, which, as you will see for yo1~rself, is&#xD;
very little. Mr. Harding came directly&#xD;
from Ayre to this place, making no stop-&#xD;
pages by the way. I was with him all the&#xD;
time, and can vouch for this. When I say&#xD;
that I was with him all the time, I mean&#xD;
that I was with him as much as possible&#xD;
without drawing his notice. You warned&#xD;
me to be particular about this, and I have&#xD;
been careful. I am sure that he has no idea&#xD;
that 1 am sent here to watch his movements.&#xD;
It was not until we reached Raleigh that he&#xD;
saw me, and then we fell into conve~s~tion,&#xD;
and I told him I was a commercial traveller&#xD;
in the hardware line. I did this because I&#xD;
knew it was not 1&amp;amp;i~ line, and he was not&#xD;
likely to find me opt. I have made ,a good&#xD;
many inquiries about him since I have been&#xD;
here, and I find him to be a man respected&#xD;
by everybody. Some people laugh at him,&#xD;
and say he is too religious and teo strict in&#xD;
his notions for a young man, but everybody&#xD;
is ready to take oath, if necessary, on his&#xD;
honesty. As far as I can see, he lea~~ as&#xD;
regular and open a life as any man ne~d t~.&#xD;
He is said to be studying for the ministry,&#xD;
and in cbnseqnence of this, as I suppose, lie&#xD;
&#xD;
spends mist of his time at home. But h&#xD;
walks every morning, and generally takes&#xD;
ride in the evening. He seems very fond 0:&#xD;
ladies' society, and attends regularly at al&#xD;
the Sunday-schools and Bible-classes of hi~&#xD;
church. I ~iave met him only once or twic&#xD;
singe I arrived herefor I took pains not tC&#xD;
throw myself in his way, but then we had&#xD;
some religious talk. This is all that I hav&#xD;
to say. I hope you willanot be discouraged&#xD;
because it is so little. If you are right in&#xD;
your suspicions, there is no hurry, and ne&#xD;
cause to be downhearted. Mr. Harding is&#xD;
bound to betray himself sooner or later, and&#xD;
I never~yet found that you landed a fish any&#xD;
the sooner for pulling him in too short. It&#xD;
is a tough job, but I think after a while we&#xD;
may clear it up.&#xD;
"Your ob't servant,&#xD;
"Ron'r ATKINs."&#xD;
When he finished, Conway laid the letter&#xD;
down quite silently, and Mr. Seyton was the&#xD;
first to make any comment.&#xD;
"He speaks very cautiously, Philip. He&#xD;
does not seem to entertain any hope," he&#xD;
said, doubtfully-wearily almost.,&#xD;
"He is a cautious fellow, sir," said Con-&#xD;
way, "and as for hope, he never deals with&#xD;
any thing less than absolute facts. We can&#xD;
depend on him for those-that is all that is&#xD;
necessary."&#xD;
"Ye-es."&#xD;
"And now we will see what he says in&#xD;
his other letter. Don't hope any thing,&#xD;
sir.&#xD;
"I'm not hoping."&#xD;
"Neither am I," said the young man;&#xD;
but, despite the assertion, he set his teeth,&#xD;
and his eye brightened as he tore open the&#xD;
second letter. When he unfolded it, there&#xD;
tumbled out on the table a small round&#xD;
something, which looked like a tiny wafer.&#xD;
"What is that?" asked Mr. Seyton, ea-&#xD;
gerly.&#xD;
"We'll see in a moment," Conway an-&#xD;
swered-and pushing it aside, so that it&#xD;
might not distract his attention, he dashed~&#xD;
once into the letter; It was dated a day&#xD;
later thanthe other, though, from some ir-&#xD;
r~n1arity of the mails; they had both ar-&#xD;
jIved at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
"-vxu~ Vracn~t&amp;amp;, Augz~.t8, 18-.&#xD;
"Sin: I wrote to you yesterday, giving&#xD;
f an account of how matters have progressed&#xD;
1 with me up to that time. Since I mailed&#xD;
my letter, something has occurred which&#xD;
may help to throw a little light on our way,&#xD;
and, according to your instructions, I at&#xD;
once forward you an account of it. Whenl*&#xD;
finished my letter yesterday, I took it to the&#xD;
post-office, and as I was stepping into the&#xD;
post-office, I met Mr. Harding coming out.&#xD;
We exchanged a good-day and a few words&#xD;
about the weather, and then he went on,&#xD;
and I walked in to mail my letter~ After&#xD;
handing it to the postmaster, I started out,&#xD;
when, just as I turned, I happened to eee&#xD;
something on the floor which looked like a&#xD;
piece of money, a~nd I stooped and picked it&#xD;
up. After I picked it up I saw that it was&#xD;
not a piece of money, but a seal set in gold.&#xD;
I was about to hand it to the postmaster&#xD;
and tell him to keep it~ till the owner called&#xD;
for it, when something about it put me in&#xD;
mind of one I had noticed on Mr. Harding's&#xD;
watch-chain when he stood talking to me a&#xD;
day or two before. I had noticed it be-&#xD;
cause it comes natural to me to notice little&#xD;
things, and because it looked like a lady's&#xD;
seal, and partly because it looked v~rypret-&#xD;
ty. I am quite sure that this was the same&#xD;
one, and I slipped it in my pocket, thinking&#xD;
I would have a look at it before returning&#xD;
it. On my way back to the hotel, I met ~&#xD;
little negro coming along at a trot. I knew&#xD;
him in a minute, for I had taken pains to&#xD;
find out who the Harding servants were,&#xD;
and to establish a sort of nodding acquaint.&#xD;
ance with all of them. This little fellow&#xD;
was one who generally went on errands. I&#xD;
asked him if any thing was the matter at&#xD;
home, as lie seemed tobe inahu&#xD;
said nothing was the matter, only Is Masse&#xD;
Cyril had lost a seal, and thought~ ha:d&#xD;
lost it in the post-offie~j~iidiuid eent~ him&#xD;
to look for it, and he eiiil&amp;amp;1 by asking siieAf&#xD;
I had seen it. I did not want to tell a&#xD;
downright lie, so I answered that I had&#xD;
not looked for it, 'and the little scamp trot~&#xD;
ted on. But I felt almost aS If I was steal&#xD;

&#xD;
MABEL LEE'&#xD;
&#xD;
ammed it, and found it to be a white stone,&#xD;
with a device of a bird carrying a letter,&#xD;
and some words round it which I cannot&#xD;
make out. I send you a wax impression of&#xD;
it, and you will be able to tell better by&#xD;
that than by my description. It is a lady's&#xD;
seal-there is no doubt about that. But&#xD;
there was nothing suspicious about it that I&#xD;
could see, and Iliad just made, up my mind&#xD;
to g~ and returii it to Mr. Harding, when I&#xD;
happened to look at the inside, which had a&#xD;
gold plate over it, and there I saw two in-&#xD;
itials scratched with a pin, or some other&#xD;
sharp instrument, and making the letters&#xD;
;NE. L. When I saw that, I gave up all&#xD;
thought of returning it until I heard from&#xD;
you. Of course, as far as I know, it may&#xD;
have come into his possession fairly. The&#xD;
young lady may have given it to him. But&#xD;
~tiil, he being under suspicion, a~id this be-&#xD;
ing a puspicious sort of circumstance, I had&#xD;
no notion ofputting out of my hands what&#xD;
might be an important proof. So I locked&#xD;
it up in my trunk, and went out to finish&#xD;
m~ walk. The first person I paw when I&#xD;
got in the street was Mr. Harding. He said&#xD;
he was very glad to meet me, as I was the&#xD;
person who was in the post-office just after&#xD;
he left it, and he wanted to ask me if I had&#xD;
b4ppened to find a small seal which he&#xD;
thought he had dropped in there. I was&#xD;
obliged to tell him I had not seen it, and I&#xD;
asked him why he thought he had dropped&#xD;
it there, and remarked that he might have&#xD;
dropped it in the street. He said no, he did&#xD;
not think so, that he remembered touching&#xD;
it with his hand the minute before he went&#xD;
into the office, and that he could not recol-&#xD;
lect any thing about it afterward, and he,&#xD;
missed it just before he got home. He said&#xD;
he haLted to lose it, and:he looked quite con-&#xD;
fusedI thought, and turned i~ery red. And&#xD;
thenhe said the reason why he did not like to&#xD;
losp ~t was that jt was a present from a lady&#xD;
friend of his, We had got to the post-office&#xD;
by this time, and I walked along in with&#xD;
him, to hear if any thing, elpe would turn up&#xD;
about it. The postmaster did not know&#xD;
any thing t~bout it, of course, ,and Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing described it to him very particularly,&#xD;
and made him band out the letter he had&#xD;
put in the office at the time that he lost th~&#xD;
&#xD;
seal, to show him the impression of it. lie&#xD;
showed it tome too, and when I had looked&#xD;
at the seal and was returning the letter, I&#xD;
took the liberty of looking at the name on&#xD;
the back. It was Miss Livinia Crane, Ed-&#xD;
gerton. I have been careful to give you a&#xD;
full account of this, though it may seem a&#xD;
little thing. I shall keep the seal till I hear&#xD;
from you, which I hope will be soon.&#xD;
"YQur ob4t servant,&#xD;
"Ilon'T ATKINs."&#xD;
Conway put the letter down, and took&#xD;
the seal. Before doino. so he felt con-&#xD;
up&#xD;
fident that it would substantiate all he sus-&#xD;
pected from the first; and he was not even&#xD;
faintly surprised when he saw the same im-&#xD;
pression that he had seen scarcely an hour&#xD;
before on the back of Mabel's letter. He&#xD;
gave only one glance, and held it out for&#xD;
Mr. Seyton's inspection.&#xD;
"Look at it, sir," he said. "Do you&#xD;
recognize it?"&#xD;
Mr. Sexton looked, and a single glance&#xD;
was enough for him also. His eyes lingered&#xD;
only one instant on the device, and then&#xD;
raised themselves to the pale, set face of his&#xD;
nephew.&#xD;
"Yes," he answered. "It is Mabel's.&#xD;
She has worn it on her chatelaine for a year&#xD;
or more; and the "-his voice faltered slight-&#xD;
ly-" the last note I received from her was&#xD;
sealed with it. Still," he went ou quickly,&#xD;
"this is not absolute proof of any thing&#xD;
against Cyril. Remember, it may have come&#xD;
into his possession quite fairly, and-"&#xD;
"Stop one moment, sir," Conway inter-&#xD;
rupted. "Before you proceed any further,&#xD;
let me tell you that something later than&#xD;
the note of which you speak, later than any&#xD;
thing which Mabel wrote in her own home,&#xD;
has been sealed with that impression. The&#xD;
same mail which brought these, letters to&#xD;
me, brought to Miss Constance a letter pur-&#xD;
porting to come from her sister."&#xD;
"A letter I-purporting to come from*&#xD;
her sister!"&#xD;
Mr. Sexton's amazement was greater&#xD;
than that of any one else bad been, and hip&#xD;
ezoitement i~iuch more apparent. ]?reoo-&#xD;
eupied as Conway was, he could not help&#xD;
but being struck by the change that had&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A LOST&#xD;
&#xD;
come over the face at which he gazed-the&#xD;
face that a moment before had been listless&#xD;
with the weary listlessness of hope deferred,&#xD;
but that now quivered and glowed with&#xD;
sudden emotion, whose eyes brightened,&#xD;
and into whose sunken cheeks there flamed&#xD;
a crimson color that made the young man&#xD;
regret having spoken with too much haste.&#xD;
"Yes, a letter," he said. "But don't&#xD;
hope any thing, sir. It was a forgery.&#xD;
Both Kowell and myself clearly recognized&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"A forgery!"&#xD;
"Yes, a forgery."&#xD;
"'And-and sealed with this seal ?"&#xD;
"Sealed with that seal."&#xD;
The color faded from Mr. Seyton's face,&#xD;
and the li~ht from his eyes-instead of that&#xD;
I,&#xD;
light there came into the latter a look of&#xD;
horror-stricken amaze. lie looked at his&#xD;
nephew for a minute before he spoke again,&#xD;
very slowly:&#xD;
"You are sure of this, Phili~~"&#xD;
"I am as sure as that I stand here, sir.&#xD;
Miss Lee identified the seal at once."&#xD;
"As-don't wonder if I am slow to com-&#xD;
prehend-as the same with this?"&#xD;
"As identically the same."&#xD;
My God I"&#xD;
He sank back in his chair, and covered&#xD;
his face with his hands. After that, there&#xD;
was silence in the room for several minutes.&#xD;
Conway did not share his uncle's.feelings in&#xD;
the least degree-l~e could hardly, indeed,&#xD;
realize the horror that came upon this gal-&#xD;
lant gentleman with the appalling thought&#xD;
that the traitor had been of his own house-&#xD;
hold and his own blood; but he recognized&#xD;
the existence of these feelings, and respected&#xD;
them sufficiently to keep silent. Taking up&#xD;
Atkins's letter, he occupied himself in read-&#xD;
ing it over-this time slowly and attentively&#xD;
~~and, when he came to the end, Mr. Seyton&#xD;
looked up and spoke.&#xD;
"Tell me about it-every thing," lie said,&#xD;
hoarsely.&#xD;
"There is not much to tefl," Conway&#xD;
answered. But he went over the whole&#xD;
statement concisely, while his uncle listened&#xD;
without interruption, until he mentioned&#xD;
the post-mark of the letter. Then he point-&#xD;
ed to the missive, lying on the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
TRINKET.&#xD;
"Does not he speak of Edgerton?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
Conway replied, by reading aloud that&#xD;
portion of Atkins's story which related to the&#xD;
better he had seen in the post-office. "Miss&#xD;
Lavinia Crane, Edgerton," he read; andthen&#xD;
looked up at his uncle. "It wilibe easy to&#xD;
substantiate this," he said, "by simply in-&#xD;
quiring whether or not Miss Crane was in&#xD;
Edgerton at the time."&#xD;
"But you surely don't-you surely can't&#xD;
-suspect her of complicity in such a mat-&#xD;
ter?"&#xD;
"Suspect her 1" said Conway, firing&#xD;
into the ~uddeu passionate energy which&#xD;
had broken out once before that day. "I&#xD;
would suspect my own brother-my own&#xD;
sister-if proof went against them, sir? In&#xD;
a matter of this kind, we cannot stop to&#xD;
consider probability, or to weigh the re-&#xD;
spectability of any one toward whom the&#xD;
evidence may point. We must follow out a&#xD;
clew exactly as it is given to us; and accept&#xD;
the conclusion presented, let it implicate&#xD;
whom it will. I should be a fool, if I allowed&#xD;
myself to be brought to a halt here, because&#xD;
Miss Crane becomes involved."&#xD;
"But it is simply impossible! What&#xD;
motive could she have?"&#xD;
"That is more than I can tell you-&#xD;
more, indeed, than I care to consider. She&#xD;
may have a motive of which we know&#xD;
nothing, or she may only be a blind instru-&#xD;
ment. In either case, our nest means of&#xD;
prosecuting the search is through her."&#xD;
"And what will you do?"&#xD;
"I cannot say, until I go to Ayre and&#xD;
see 1{owell."&#xD;
"See li~Towell! But he-"&#xD;
"Would quite as soon care to see the&#xD;
devil," answered the young man, bitterly;&#xD;
"but I cannot stop to consider his feelings.&#xD;
He has a right to be informed of this; arid, as&#xD;
a lawyer, lie will be able to judge what our&#xD;
next step ought to be, better than I can."&#xD;
"And he is safe," said Mr. Seyton, in ~&#xD;
low voice. It was significant of the man's&#xD;
nature, that although he, too, was in a&#xD;
measure possessed by the reckless detective&#xD;
fever and passionate readiness to suspect&#xD;
anybody and everybody, which had taken&#xD;
absolute control of Conway, yet he still&#xD;

all his lifetime had been dearer to hin&#xD;

watch which Conway proposed establish&#xD;
irig oi'er Cyril Harding, he had only don&#xD;
so 'en condition of its profound secrecy&#xD;
A~id now-now, when he felt more swayed&#xD;
than ever before toward Conway's belief,&#xD;
lie had still a thought for the name which&#xD;
had never been tarnished, and over which&#xD;
there hung this black cloud of positive dis-&#xD;
grace. "He is safe," he said, alluding to&#xD;
I~Towell, and then he spoke warmly to his&#xD;
nePhew., "I~on't be rash or precipitate,&#xD;
Philip. Remember you may do incalculable&#xD;
harm if your suspicions are well founded,&#xD;
and you betray them too soon~7~&#xD;
"Trust me for that, sir," Conway re-&#xD;
plied, as he folded Atkins's letter and placed&#xD;
it in his* pocket. "I will follow the trail&#xD;
like a~bloodhound; but you need not fear&#xD;

'thing. I shall go.to Ayre now, and I can-&#xD;
not tell how long I may be detained there.&#xD;
Doi~'t wait dinner for me, if I am not back&#xD;
In time."&#xD;
He took his whip from the table where&#xD;
he had 'thrown it' on his entrance, and&#xD;
turned to leave the room. Mr. Seyton looked&#xD;
wistfully at the retreating figure, hut made&#xD;
ho effort to detain him; and, a moment af-&#xD;
terward, Mazeppa's hoofs were heard clat-&#xD;
tering' down the avenue, and dying away in&#xD;
'the distance.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
ALL AT SEA.&#xD;
"Is your master in his office?"&#xD;
- Conway reined up at the sidewalk, and&#xD;
asked this question of a half-grown negro&#xD;
who was lounging at the doorstep of Now-&#xD;
ell'soffice, and who started and touched his&#xD;
hat as he replied:&#xD;
"My master? No, sir: he's just left&#xD;
"Left town!" This unexpected informa-&#xD;
tion took the interlocutor so completely by'&#xD;
surprise, that' he could only stare for a mo-&#xD;
~ngnt. "Left town-~you must be mistaken."&#xD;
&#xD;
The boy~grinned a little, apparently at&#xD;
the idea of being mistaken.&#xD;
'%No, sir," he repeated. "He's left&#xD;
- town, and I'm to lock up the office and take&#xD;
the key to Mr.' Bradford; and if you're on&#xD;
business "&#xD;
"I'm not on business. When did he&#xD;
go?"&#xD;
"'Bout an hour ago, air.~~&#xD;
*    "Gone into the country, you mean-not&#xD;
* far, surely."&#xD;
"He didn't say where he was gem', sir;&#xD;
but I think he was goin' pretty fur. He&#xD;
made me pack his valise, and he said as how&#xD;
he specterd to ketch the stage at R ."&#xD;
"And did he leave no message for any-&#xD;
body?"&#xD;
"He lef' a note for Miss Constance Lee,&#xD;
sir, and I took it and give it to her as soon&#xD;
as he was gone. If you're on business,&#xD;
sir-"&#xD;
"I'm not on' business," repeated Con-&#xD;
way, this time quite sharply; and then he&#xD;
turned and rode away. It was like his luck,&#xD;
he thought, impatiently. And yet it was&#xD;
wonderful how soon he forgot the incon-&#xD;
venience and vexation to himself, in trying&#xD;
to conjecture where Kowell could have&#xD;
gone, and wha~ could possibly have taken&#xD;
him away from Ayre at such a time as this.&#xD;
He had left an hour ago, the boy said-and&#xD;
it had not been quite two hours since they&#xD;
parted in Mrs. Lee's house. Could the letter&#xD;
have furnished him with any information,&#xD;
any clew which had taken him away? But&#xD;
that was clearly impossible. 1~owell had&#xD;
none of his own newly-acquired light upon&#xD;
the letter; and he could not~ have discovered&#xD;
any thing for himself. It was impossible;&#xD;
and yet, it was very strange. The more he&#xD;
thought of it, the more strange it appeared,&#xD;
until at last he tried to shake off the grow-&#xD;
ing interest and curiosity which beset him.&#xD;
Might not some professional business have&#xD;
called the young lawyer away? But in a&#xD;
moment he saw how impossible that sup.&#xD;
position was. :Not to make his fortune a&#xD;
dozen times over would l~owell have left&#xD;
Ayre on professional business at such a ti~ne&#xD;
as this-a time when the cloud over his&#xD;
Qousin's fate had never seemed deeper or&#xD;
darker; and when something which might,&#xD;
&#xD;
perhaps, prove an important clew, had un-&#xD;
expectedly been placed in their hands. Con-&#xD;
way gave an impatient jerk at Mazeppa's&#xD;
rein, as he realized how wide of the mark&#xD;
his conjectures were; and then the thought&#xD;
that, after all, Constance might know every&#xD;
thing about the matter, seemed to quicken&#xD;
his pace so materially that in a few minutes&#xD;
lie had again dismounted at Mrs. Lee's gate.&#xD;
It was Nancy who answered his knock&#xD;
at the door; but he had not long to wait&#xD;
until Constance came down. She scarcely&#xD;
gave him time for any explanation before&#xD;
she spoke hurriedly.&#xD;
"I am very glad you have come. Per-&#xD;
haps you can tell me-or at least help me to&#xD;
comprehend- the meaning of this."&#xD;
She extended a folded paper as she spoke.&#xD;
Taking itl he opened it without a word. A&#xD;
few hasty lines in pencil were all it con-&#xD;
tamed:&#xD;
"DBAu CONsTANCE: I have found a clew&#xD;
which may, or may not, prove of value; but&#xD;
I start at once to follow it up. I tell you&#xD;
this, because you desired me not to keep&#xD;
you in ignorance of any thing which might&#xD;
occur, and not because I wish you to indulge&#xD;
%hopes that may not be realized. The clew is&#xD;
so slight that I entertain little or no expec-&#xD;
tation of success; but I shall try to trace it&#xD;
out. I do not tell you where I am going,&#xD;
for I hardly know myself. Besides, I do&#xD;
not wish your friend Mr. Conway enlight-&#xD;
ened on the subject; and. I know that, if I&#xD;
told you, you would tell him. If I make&#xD;
any discovery, you shall hear from me; but&#xD;
once more let me repeat-hope nothing.&#xD;
"Truly, etc.,&#xD;
FRANciS NewELL."&#xD;
Conway read this brief and most unsat-&#xD;
isfactory document twice over, before he&#xD;
raised his eyes and met the eager, passion-&#xD;
ate gaze fixed on him-met it with a great&#xD;
deal of unconscious pity in 14s own.&#xD;
"I am sorry that I can tell you noth-&#xD;
ing," he said. "But this is as sudden, as&#xD;
incomprehensible, to m&amp;amp; as tc~ you. I heard&#xD;
only-a moroent ago that your cousinj~ad&#xD;
left town; and I came here.hopiug that you&#xD;
knew why he had done so."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I know nothing more than that," she&#xD;
answered, "and, ever since it ~came, I have&#xD;
been vainly trying to imagine what the clew&#xD;
~to which he alludes can be. I believe I&#xD;
should not have showed it to you," she&#xD;
went on hastily, "but I forget every thing&#xD;
now except the one absorbing subject. Try&#xD;
to forgive him, Mr. Conway. He is very&#xD;
unjust, but he means well."&#xD;
"There is nothing to forgive," said Con-&#xD;
way, quietly. "Mr. Newell has been fo~h&#xD;
ish enough to let judgment wait upon&#xD;
prejudice; but if he held me twice as guilty&#xD;
as he does I could not feel any resentment&#xD;
against him. We are both working for the&#xD;
same end-that is a bond of good feeling,&#xD;
little as he thinks so. Now, let us consider&#xD;
this matter. What clew do you think he&#xD;
can possibly have found?"&#xD;
Constance shook her head with an air&#xD;
of very hopeless despondency.&#xD;
"I cannot even conjecture. It must be&#xD;
connected with the letter; and yet the let-&#xD;
ter seemed barren of clew."&#xD;
"Did he return it?"&#xD;
"Yes, it was enclosed with this. He&#xD;
might have told me, if only to prevent the&#xD;
perpetual torment which this effort to din-&#xD;
cover will prove," she went on; '~ but it is&#xD;
~hike Francis-like him, as I have always&#xD;
known him-to act so. Mr. Conway, look&#xD;
at the matter-think of it. Surely you&#xD;
must be able to tell what it is!"&#xD;
She gazed at him, with a world oi~ en-&#xD;
treaty in her eyes, which he found it very&#xD;
hard to meet, very hard to answer with the&#xD;
hopeless negative which was all he had to&#xD;
give in reply. But the matter was even&#xD;
more mysterious to him 'than to her; and it&#xD;
was necessary to say as much. He' did say&#xD;
so, after a moment, and then he asked if&#xD;
it was not possible that Father Lawrence&#xD;
might be better informed.&#xD;
"No," she replied. "Father Lawrence&#xD;
was still here when Francis's note arrived,&#xD;
and his surprise was equal to&#xD;
"Thenote came immediately after 17 left,&#xD;
did it not?"&#xD;
"In about a quarter of an hour after-&#xD;
.ward."&#xD;
"I don't understand it," he niutteredto&#xD;
himself. Then, catching Constanee'.s auz-&#xD;

MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ious glance, he added aloud: "The matter&#xD;
eeems strange enough to you, but it is ren-&#xD;
dered doubly strange to me, by a letter&#xD;
which I found awaiting me at Seyton, and&#xD;
which I brought at once to Ayre to show to&#xD;
your cousin. A. letter "-he paused a mo-&#xD;
ment -" a letter which certainly does&#xD;
afford a&#xD;
"Mr. Conway!&#xD;
It was a gasp which she gave-a gasp&#xD;
that, together with her increasing paleness,&#xD;
so much alarmed him that he moved has-&#xD;
tily toward her. But she recovered herself&#xD;
almost immediately, and, by the time he&#xD;
gained her side, looked up at him with a&#xD;
faint.smile.&#xD;
"Never mind about me. It was only&#xD;
the surprise. Tell me-what is the cl~w?"&#xD;
"You are sure you can stand any more?"&#xD;
lie asked? anxiously. "It seems to me that&#xD;
I have lost all sense, all judgment, or 1&#xD;
would never have shocked you so."&#xD;
"You did not shock me; and the best&#xD;
thing you can do now is to tell me-tell me&#xD;
all about it."&#xD;
He perceived that himself; so, drawing&#xD;
Atkins's letter from his pocket, he opened&#xD;
it and showed her the seal. She recognized&#xD;
it at odc~, as she felt confident she would.&#xD;
"It is Mabel's,"she said. "It is identi-&#xD;
cal with the one on the envelope."&#xD;
"Will you get the envelope, and let us&#xD;
compare them?"&#xD;
"Yes, certainly."&#xD;
She started to leave the room; then, as&#xD;
If struck by a sudden thought1 turned back,&#xD;
"I quite forgot," she said, "Francis re-&#xD;
turned the letter, but not the envelope."&#xD;
'~ What I-he did not return the enve-&#xD;
lope?"&#xD;
"No, and the omission only occurred to&#xD;
me at this moment."&#xD;
"Then you may rest assured that the&#xD;
envelope has given him his clew," said&#xD;
Conway, eagerly. "But how could it be?"&#xD;
He looked at her, almost as passionately&#xD;
as she had looked at him not many minutes&#xD;
before-looked se if he would, by sheer&#xD;
force of will, master the secret which eluded&#xD;
him. But aftel' a moment another, aspect&#xD;
of the ~ffair occurred to him, and a dark,&#xD;
troubled cloud came into his eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
"He has carried away' a most important&#xD;
proof," he said; "and he has literally tied&#xD;
my hands until it can be recovered."&#xD;
"How ?-what is it?"&#xD;
He answered her by handing her the&#xD;
detective's letter, and bidding her read it.&#xD;
She did so, eagerly; and, when she finished,&#xD;
looked at him with amazement and incre-&#xD;
dulity struggling together on her face.&#xD;
£~ ~ don't understand," she said. "What&#xD;
does it mean?"&#xD;
He explained to her in a few brief but&#xD;
forcible words his own view of what it&#xD;
meant; and, although she was quick enough&#xD;
to understand him, she was plainly not pre-&#xD;
pared to accept his conclusions.&#xD;
"I cannot believe it," she cried. "I&#xD;
cannot believe that Mr. Harding is impli-&#xD;
cated in such a terrible crime; and as for&#xD;
Lavinia Crane-goodHeavens! Mr. Conway,&#xD;
what motive could she have?"&#xD;
"What difference does it make about&#xD;
her motive, or want of motive?" inquired&#xD;
Conway, almost impatiently. "We mutt&#xD;
deal with facts, not with probabilities. For&#xD;
my part, I should walk on straight to my&#xD;
goal over a hundred Lavinia Cranes. You&#xD;
agree with me that this seal is an important&#xD;
link of proof?"&#xD;
"Yes; I see that clearly."&#xD;
"Then the next thing is to follow the&#xD;
track of inquiry which it opens. Can you&#xD;
tell me whether or not Miss Crane has been&#xD;
in Edgerton?"&#xD;
"She has been away from home-i&#xD;
chance to know that much. Mrs. Crane&#xD;
sends every day to inquire about mamma;&#xD;
and she sent this morning. The servant&#xD;
also brought a basket of fruit; so I had to&#xD;
see her, and return a message of acknowl-&#xD;
edgment. When I asked about the family,&#xD;
she said they were all well except Lavinia,&#xD;
who got home late last night, and was feel-&#xD;
ing badly from travelling,"&#xD;
"Travelling from where?"&#xD;
"She did not say, and I did not inquire."&#xD;
"How can I find out? It is important&#xD;
that I should know."&#xD;
Constance thought a moment, and then&#xD;
said: "Perhaps Nancy can tell. Ser~axtts&#xD;
are such gossips, that shemay have hoa~L'&#xD;
"Will you call her and inquire ~"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ALL AT SEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, no," she said, after a second's&#xD;
consideration. "That might excite her sns-&#xD;
picions. I think I had better go and find&#xD;
out in an informal way whether she knows&#xD;
or not."&#xD;
"Go, by all means."&#xD;
She went, and returned in a few min-&#xD;
utes, with not a little suppressed excitement&#xD;
in her face. Before she spoke, Conway saw&#xD;
that the detective fever had begun to take&#xD;
possession of her also.&#xD;
"Nancy says that the servant told her&#xD;
that Lavinia had been to Edgerton," she&#xD;
said, "and also hinted that it was likely she&#xD;
would be married soon-to Mr. Harding.&#xD;
Stop! Don't think you have gained an im-&#xD;
portant step "-for Conway made an excla-&#xD;
mation-" I have just remembered some-&#xD;
thing whVch overthrows your whole ground-&#xD;
work of proof. Lavinia and Mabel had&#xD;
seals exactly alike."&#xD;
"You cannot be in earnest."&#xD;
"I am, though-entirely in earnest. I&#xD;
remember distinctly the day Mabel bought&#xD;
that seal, and, as it chanced, Lavinia came&#xD;
into the shop while she was doing so.&#xD;
There were only two of them, and she&#xD;
bought the other."&#xD;
"But is it likely that her seal would&#xD;
have Mabel's initials on it?"&#xD;
"..Ah, I had forgotten that! No, of&#xD;
course not."&#xD;
"And if she had really no share in the&#xD;
matter, her seal will be still in her own pos-&#xD;
5~55j~fl*~~&#xD;
"But how are we to find out whether&#xD;
ornotitis?"&#xD;
"Easily enough-by sending and asking&#xD;
to borrow it. You can do so on almost any&#xD;
pretext, or by means of the truth, if you&#xD;
prefer it. Write a note; tell her you have&#xD;
received a letter professing to come from&#xD;
Mabel, and wish to identify the seal. Un-&#xD;
der those circumstances, she cannot refuse&#xD;
to lend hers, if she has It."&#xD;
Constance was that rare pearl among her&#xD;
sex-a woman who never wasted words.&#xD;
There was a writing-desk on a side-table,&#xD;
and she went to it at once. In five minutes&#xD;
the ucla was written and dispatched, It&#xD;
wa~ helfan hour at least before an answer&#xD;
wairattw~ed. Then Nancy came in with a&#xD;
&#xD;
note which Constance opened hurriedly.&#xD;
Having done so, she found that this waswhat&#xD;
it had taken Miss Crane half an hour to&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"DEAR CONsTANcE: I regret very much&#xD;
that I have not the seal you wish to borrow.&#xD;
I gave it to a friend some weeks ago, but&#xD;
perhaps you are not aware that only a&#xD;
day or two before Mabel "-['disappeared'&#xD;
scratched out, and 'left home' substituted]&#xD;
-"I exchanged seals with her, she liking&#xD;
best the setting of mine, and I much prefer-&#xD;
ring the setting of hers. You may remem~.&#xD;
ber that there was a difference between&#xD;
them in this respect, and, by referring to the&#xD;
impression of which you speak, you can ea-&#xD;
sily tell whether it was made by my seal-&#xD;
that is, the one which is hers now-for the&#xD;
rim of it had sharp points, while hers was&#xD;
quite plain. I am very sorry to hear that&#xD;
the letter to which you allude is not genu-&#xD;
ine. It would be such a relief to Mrs. Lee&#xD;
and myself, and indeed to all of us, if we&#xD;
could only hear some reliable news of our&#xD;
dear Mabel. With kindest regards tp your&#xD;
mother,&#xD;
"I am sincerely,&#xD;
"LAvmIA CRANE.&#xD;
"P. S.-Perhaps, to avoid any misun-&#xD;
derstanding, I had better say that the friend&#xD;
to whom I gave the seal was Mr. Harding.&#xD;
He always admired the device very much,&#xD;
and desired to use it in sealing his letters to&#xD;
me. The last letter I had from him (re-&#xD;
ceived while 1 was in Edgerton) was sealed&#xD;
with it."&#xD;
Constance had read the note aloud; and&#xD;
now, laying it down, she looked at her com-&#xD;
panion. "Well," she said, "have we gained&#xD;
any thing?"&#xD;
"We have gained the knowledge that if&#xD;
Miss Crane is acting at all in the business,&#xD;
she is acting as a blind instrument) or else&#xD;
that she is playing a very deep game," he&#xD;
answered, dryly.&#xD;
"Why do you think so?"&#xD;
"I think so mainly because of this note,&#xD;
It is too candid, and goes to~ much into de-&#xD;
tail. Perhaps I am morbidly prone to sus-&#xD;
picion-I am perfectly aware that my mind&#xD;

is' not in a condition to judge fairly just&#xD;
now-but it looks badly to me."&#xD;
"' But, if your -suspicions were well&#xD;
founded, would she have mentioned the let-&#xD;
ter she-received from Mr. Harding while she&#xD;
was in Edgerton?"'&#xD;
- "Not if she had been wise, undoubtedly.&#xD;
It isprebable, however, that 'she' may have&#xD;
suspected our knowledge of it, and wished&#xD;
by this means to threw us off the scent."&#xD;
"0 Mr.' Conway! "-Constance fairly&#xD;
shrank-" remember, before you say such&#xD;
things that she may be-that there is every&#xD;
reason to believe she is-as innocent as you&#xD;
or I."&#xD;
"If she is innocent, our suspicions will&#xD;
not harm her," said Conway, coolly. "If&#xD;
she is guilty, in any 'degree, let her look to&#xD;
it. As I told you before, we cannot stop to&#xD;
-weigh individual-trustworthiness in such a&#xD;
matter as this. Any detective will tell you&#xD;
that in these cases they generally find the&#xD;
criminal among those who are least sus-&#xD;
pected, who are most held above suspicion;"&#xD;
- "How horrible!"&#xD;
"Yes, horrible, but true. Now, do you&#xD;
see what our next step should be?"&#xD;
"An examination of the seal on the let-&#xD;
ter, of course."&#xD;
"Yes, an examination of the seal on the&#xD;
letter. Until that is done, we cannot move&#xD;
a step farther."&#xD;
"And that cannot be done until we hear&#xD;
from Francis."&#xD;
"No. So it is that, with the best pos-&#xD;
sible motives, Mr. Nowell has made himself&#xD;
a hindrance instead of a help to search.&#xD;
Sorely against my inclination, I will wait&#xD;
one week for that envelope. If, at the end&#xD;
of that time, he has not returned, and is not&#xD;
beard from, I shall start for Virginia."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
nuoxux nowir.&#xD;
Tn~ sun of a hot August day was fast&#xD;
sinking to its rest, when a very tired and&#xD;
dusty traveller entered a small Virginia&#xD;
village, and, instead of proceeding to the&#xD;
hotel which swung a conspicuous sigiQ~oss&#xD;
&#xD;
the principal street, stopped to ask a passer-&#xD;
by where he would find the residence of the&#xD;
Rev. :Nfr. Harding; and, after receiving the&#xD;
information, rode away in that direction.&#xD;
It proved to be a substantial house of red&#xD;
brick, situated in a grove of elms, in the&#xD;
suburbs of the town-with a clean gravel-&#xD;
walk leading up to the front doot, a bright&#xD;
brass plate and' knocker, and a general air&#xD;
of respectability and comfort. The traveller&#xD;
left his horse at the gate, went up the walk,&#xD;
knocked at the door, and found his knock&#xD;
almost immediately answered by a lady in&#xD;
*a black-silk dress and white-lace cap, who&#xD;
came rustling down the passage toward him&#xD;
-a lady whom he inlmediately identified as&#xD;
a certain sombre terror of his childhood.&#xD;
"Is Mr. Harding-Mr. Cyril Harding, I&#xD;
mean-at home, madam?" he asked, un-&#xD;
covering at her approach.&#xD;
A pair of stony eyes viewed him with&#xD;
evident suspicion and luAdng recognition-&#xD;
while a stony voice answered, coldly:&#xD;
"My son is not at home at present. He&#xD;
has gone out. But if you will leave your&#xD;
name, or call again in the course of an hour&#xD;
or two-"&#xD;
"Pardon me," interrupted the stranger&#xD;
quickly; "but if you will allow me, I should&#xD;
prefer to wait for him. Is he likely to be&#xD;
long in coming?"&#xD;
"I cannot say. Is your business with&#xD;
him important?"&#xD;
"Very important."&#xD;
* "In that case, I may be able to assist&#xD;
you. I am his mother, sir."&#xD;
"I am happy to make your acquaint-&#xD;
ance," said the gentleman, with a bow and&#xD;
a smile; "but my business is with your son&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
"He may not return for some time."&#xD;
"Still, if you will allow me, I will wait&#xD;
for him."&#xD;
Mrs. Harding drew back, slightly discom-&#xD;
fited. This impenetrable courtesy and&#xD;
steady determination were too much for her.&#xD;
She opened a door on one side.&#xD;
"You Oan wait here," she s~id icily-~-&#xD;
and closed it en him.&#xD;
Warm as the day was, and h~a~ he&#xD;
had been, he absolutely shivered in~l~~epld,&#xD;
vault-like atmosphere that rushed ever 14w,&#xD;
&#xD;
when he entered the room-a room, the&#xD;
blinds of which were all closed, the sashes&#xD;
down, the furniture mulled up in linen, and&#xD;
the general appearance one of cold, sepul-&#xD;
chral solemnity. He looked round him'&#xD;
silently, and had only noted this much when&#xD;
the door opened again, and the stony face&#xD;
looked in.&#xD;
"When my son comes, who shall I tell&#xD;
him is waiting?" Mrs. Harding asked, in the&#xD;
same forbidding voice, and with the same&#xD;
forbidding manner.&#xD;
"An old acquaintance, if you please,"&#xD;
the other answered.&#xD;
"Nothing more?"&#xD;
"Nothing more."&#xD;
The door closed again-this time with a&#xD;
perceptible bang-and then an angry rustle&#xD;
of skirts *as heard retreating down the pas-&#xD;
sage.&#xD;
At least three-quarters of an hour elapsed&#xD;
before it opened again, and this time Cyril&#xD;
Harding himself stood on the threshold. He&#xD;
looked a little disturbed-for it is not, at&#xD;
any time, an encouraging thing to hear that&#xD;
a stranger, who declines to give his name,&#xD;
is waiting for one-but this slight uncer-&#xD;
tainty and trepidation changed to downright&#xD;
startled astonishment when he saw who&#xD;
that stranger was.&#xD;
"Good Heavens! " he said. "Conway!&#xD;
-Isityon?" ' -&#xD;
"Yes, it is I," answered the other.&#xD;
"You did not expect me, I dare say. Shut&#xD;
the deer and come in. I have something to&#xD;
say to you."        -&#xD;
- "But what has brought-"&#xD;
"Shut the door, and you shall soon hear&#xD;
enough~ What I have to say is not to be&#xD;
said for the benefit of the house."&#xD;
The tone of command was not to be dis-&#xD;
obeyed, excepting by stronger nerves than&#xD;
those of Mr. Harding. He looked a little&#xD;
apprehensively over his shoulder-muttered&#xD;
a word or two, it seemed-and came in;&#xD;
closing the door behind him. His cousin&#xD;
met him in the middle of the floor, but,&#xD;
instead of touching the hand he extended,&#xD;
threw an open letter down on the centre-&#xD;
table which stood between them. -&#xD;
"Don't offer to shake hands with me,"&#xD;
he said. "Read that."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What-what is it?"&#xD;
"Read it, and you wrn see."&#xD;
Apparently lost in surprise, Mr. Harding&#xD;
took it up, and Conway watched him nar-&#xD;
rowly as he read the forged letter. When&#xD;
he came to the last word, he folded the&#xD;
sheet, and laid it down again. The first&#xD;
shock was ever, and his usual formality of&#xD;
speech and bearing had returned to him.&#xD;
"I am very glad to hear this news. It&#xD;
is truly gratifying," he said. "I congratu-&#xD;
late my uncle, and the family of the young&#xD;
lady-I suppose I should also congratulate&#xD;
yourself.' But I am at a loss to know how&#xD;
the matter concerns me."&#xD;
"Perhaps you will know when I tell you&#xD;
that the day for this simulation is over,"&#xD;
said Conway, sternly. "I don't impugn&#xD;
your wisdom in writing, or causing that let-&#xD;
ter to be written, Mr. Harding; but I do&#xD;
wonder that you did not take more pains&#xD;
to guard against detection than you have&#xD;
done."&#xD;
"I write 1-I cause to be written !-..-M~&#xD;
Conway, you had better take care what ypu&#xD;
are saying."&#xD;
"Bali!" said Conway, with the sneer&#xD;
which Mr. Blake specially detested' and&#xD;
called "the captain's own"~-" bab I do' you&#xD;
think to intimidate me? You might know&#xD;
better by this time4 There is no gQod in&#xD;
losing temper, Mr. Harding. I- have come&#xD;
here for information: and I mean to have&#xD;
it-if I have to drag it out of your throat!&#xD;
If you were not the person directly con-&#xD;
cerned in the abduction of :Mabel Lee, you&#xD;
had a share in it; and I am here to give-you&#xD;
warning that it will be your best polloy- to&#xD;
acknowledge every thing at once. If she&#xD;
is still unharmed, and you can assist us to&#xD;
rescue her, I am empowered by my uncle to&#xD;
promise that there will be no legal prosecu-&#xD;
tion. But if you refuse__"&#xD;
"I will not hear another word!" 'cried&#xD;
Mr. Harding, losing all his formality in the&#xD;
excitement and passion of the moment. "I&#xD;
will not hear another word! How do&#xD;
you dare to come here to my own, home,&#xD;
and insult me in this manner? I have only&#xD;
one answer for you-leave the house!"&#xD;
"I will leave it when I have finished&#xD;
what I have to say~" ajiswered Conway.&#xD;

"You had better hear me out, and count&#xD;
the consequences of refusal, before you do&#xD;
refuse. I caii assure you of one thing-it&#xD;
will go hard with you if I leave this house&#xD;
without that for which I came into it.&#xD;
Understand clearly, that I only apply to&#xD;
you, as a means of saving time. The clew&#xD;
is in my bands, and you know me well&#xD;
enough to be sure that I will follow it up&#xD;
like a blood-hound~ I will never weary-&#xD;
I will never give up, until I have found her.&#xD;
And when I do-mark my words, Cyril&#xD;
Hardiri~-when I do, you shall be called to&#xD;
a reckoning such as you never even dreamed&#xD;
of! Now do you comprehend the choice&#xD;
offered you ?-and will you tell me your de-&#xD;
cision?"&#xD;
"In all my life," said Mr. Harding, "I&#xD;
'-I never heard any thing to equal this!&#xD;
Do y6u know that such language is action-&#xD;
able, Mr. Conway? I can bear a great, deal&#xD;
-my Christian profession obliges me to bear&#xD;
a great deal-but to be deliberately accused&#xD;
of abducting a young lady for whom I have&#xD;
the highest esteem; and of forging letters&#xD;
-this is more than even Christianity de-&#xD;
mands that I should endure. Once more I&#xD;
must request you to leave the house."&#xD;
"You have decided, then?" said Con-&#xD;
way. "Stop !-I give you five minutes&#xD;
more. For your own sake, you had better&#xD;
think again."&#xD;
"I will not think a moment. Leave the&#xD;
house!"&#xD;
"You absolutely refuse to giv~ me any&#xD;
information about Mabel Lee?"&#xD;
"I hav~e no information to give-not a&#xD;
word. 'I knon~ nothing about her. I have&#xD;
no doubt the letter is genuine. I have no&#xD;
doubt but 'that she has eloped- Don't,&#xD;
Conway! Don't touch me, or I shall call&#xD;
assistance."&#xD;
He retreated backward, and his voice&#xD;
rose into a cry, at the last words, for, almost&#xD;
i.m'consciously, Conway' had made a step&#xD;
toward him,' with a flash of the eye that&#xD;
plainly meant mischief. In a moment-be-&#xD;
fore the latter could speak-the door was&#xD;
burst wide open; and Mrs. Harding rushed&#xD;
mW the room, and threw her arms about&#xD;
her sOn.&#xD;
"Leave the house this instant!" she&#xD;
&#xD;
cried, addressing Conway over her shoulder.&#xD;
"How dare you come here to threaten and&#xD;
attack my son? Is it not enough that you&#xD;
have injured him already by your scheming,&#xD;
and made my brother deprive him of his&#xD;
rightful inheritance, to give it to you-you,&#xD;
an adventurer, a swindler, a murderer, I&#xD;
dare say, if the truth were only known, you&#xD;
have made away with the girl yourself-that&#xD;
is the truth of the matter-and you have&#xD;
come here to charge my son, my honorable,&#xD;
high-minded son, with your own crime!&#xD;
Leave the house-or I shall call the servants&#xD;
toputyonout!" I&#xD;
"Call them, by all means, madam," said&#xD;
Conway. "They will be excellent witnesses&#xD;
of the charge I make against your honor-&#xD;
able, high-minded son. I did not know&#xD;
that he had stationed you at the key-hole,&#xD;
or I might have assured him sooner that I&#xD;
have not the least intention of personal&#xD;
violence. Since you have assisted at the&#xD;
entire interview, I suppose I need not give&#xD;
you any explanation of the business that has&#xD;
brought me here."&#xD;
"I know that if I had been in my son's&#xD;
place, I would have made you leave the&#xD;
house, before you had said five words."&#xD;
He bowed-smiling slightly.&#xD;
"Allow me to acknowledge your kind&#xD;
consideration. I will not intrude upon your&#xD;
hospitality any longer than to repeat the&#xD;
warning I have already given. My uncle,&#xD;
outraged as his feelings have been, is averse,&#xD;
for the sake of his family honor, to making&#xD;
a public scandal of the matter, by instituting&#xD;
legal proceedings against your son-if this&#xD;
course can be avoided. If you 'desire either&#xD;
his personal safety, or honorable reputation;&#xD;
you had better counsel him to regard-"&#xD;
He was interrupted here by his listener;&#xD;
who, forsaking her son for a moment,&#xD;
rushed to the door, and sent her voice echo-&#xD;
ing through the house.&#xD;
"Mr. Harding - Mr. Harding!" she&#xD;
'cried; "come here this instant!"&#xD;
The' words were like a spell.. Before the&#xD;
instant had elapsed, 'a pair of slippers&#xD;
shuffled hastily down the passage, and an&#xD;
elderly edition o~ Cyril Harding, in dress-&#xD;
ing-gown and wl4te hair, stood in the door.&#xD;
Plainly, Mr. Harding, senior, had beentrained~&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
in a good school of prompt marital obe-&#xD;
dience.&#xD;
"You called me, my dear?" he said,&#xD;
peering through his spectacles at the group&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
"Certainly I called you," the lady an-&#xD;
swered, sharply. "If you had any ears, Mr.&#xD;
Harding, you would not have needed to be&#xD;
called! If you had any spirit, you would&#xD;
not have stayed in your study writing, while&#xD;
your son was being murdered, and your&#xD;
wife insulted!',&#xD;
"Murdered !-insulted! " said Mr. Hard-&#xD;
ing, gazing, in a state of bewilderment,&#xD;
from his son, who 'seemed in excellent pres-&#xD;
ervationto his wife, who was evidently in&#xD;
a towering passion. "My dear, what do&#xD;
you mean? I knew nothing-my study-door&#xD;
was closed-and, though I heard your voice,&#xD;
I thought you were only reproving one of&#xD;
the servants, as usual, and-"&#xD;
"And I might have been insulted or any&#xD;
thing else, for all you knew to the contrary!&#xD;
So long as you are left in peace, you care&#xD;
nothing- Do you know who that is? Just&#xD;
answer me-do you know who that is?"&#xD;
"No, my dear,." replied the reverend&#xD;
gentleman, hesitatingly, a~ he looked at&#xD;
Conway, toward whom his wife pointed.&#xD;
"The room is so dark that I cannot see dis-&#xD;
tinctly; but I do not think I am acquainted&#xD;
with the gentleman."&#xD;
"Let me tell you, then, that, while you&#xD;
were mooning over your sermon, your son&#xD;
might have been killed if I-I, a weak wom-&#xD;
an-had not come to his defence. Oh, you&#xD;
need not look at me in that way! It is true&#xD;
-as true as that this man standing here is&#xD;
Philip Conway."&#xD;
At the sound of that name, Mr. Harding&#xD;
recoiled, as if a loaded pistol had been pre-&#xD;
sented at his head.&#xD;
"God bless my soul!" he gasped. "Is&#xD;
this true?"&#xD;
He looked at Conway, and Conway&#xD;
bowed, as he had bowed before in acknowl-&#xD;
edgment of Mrs. Harding's 'desire to see&#xD;
him put out of the house.&#xD;
"That is my. name, sir," he said. "But&#xD;
there~is really no necessity for you to look&#xD;
so alarmed. I do not intend to blow up&#xD;
your house; and-although I regret the no-&#xD;
&#xD;
cessity of contradicting a lady-I have had&#xD;
no intention of murdering your son, or in-&#xD;
sulting your wife. I am"glad to give you&#xD;
this personal assurance, and I amalso glad&#xD;
to see you for another reason. No doubt&#xD;
you have heard of the abduction of Miss&#xD;
Lee, which took place during your son's&#xD;
visit at Seyton House. Are you aware that&#xD;
he rests under a grave suspicion of being&#xD;
implicated in it?"&#xD;
"Who? My son ?-Cyril? You must&#xD;
be mad, sir!"&#xD;
"My madness has excellent method in it&#xD;
then-as he will learn."&#xD;
But-good Heavens !-Oyril, you never&#xD;
mentioned this to me. Who suspects you&#xD;
of such a thing?"&#xD;
"You will have to ask Mr. Conway&#xD;
that," answered Cyril, with as much dig-&#xD;
nity as a man can be expected to possess&#xD;
who is penned in a corner, and mounted&#xD;
guard over, by a ponderous black silk; "I&#xD;
know nothing about it, excepting that he&#xD;
has come here in this unexpected manner,&#xD;
and insulted me by the most groundless&#xD;
charges, and outrageous threats."&#xD;
"Perhaps Mr. Conway will explain him-&#xD;
self?" said the father, turning rpund.&#xD;
"With pleasure, sir," answered Conway.&#xD;
" As a first step to doing so, will you oblige&#xD;
me by reading this?"&#xD;
He extended the forged letter as he&#xD;
spoke, and Mr. Harding was about to take&#xD;
it, when his wife interfered-shortly and&#xD;
sharply.&#xD;
"Are you going to listen to charges like&#xD;
this, Mr. Harding? Are you going to read&#xD;
a vile thing of that sort, with your inno-&#xD;
cent, slandered son standing by? Tear the&#xD;
letter up before his face, and turn him out&#xD;
of the house!"&#xD;
"But, my dear," expostula~ed the hus-&#xD;
band, "if I don't read the lette~', how am I&#xD;
to know what Cyril is accused of?"&#xD;
"What do you want to know for? Af-&#xD;
ter his uncle's mind has been p~$isoned&#xD;
against him, and he has been turned out of'&#xD;
his lawful rights, are you going to let th~&#xD;
same viper poison your mind too?"&#xD;
"Sir," said the viper in question~ "I be-&#xD;
lieve I heard you mention your st~4y. If&#xD;
you will allow me. to' accompany you there,&#xD;

&#xD;
I may succeed better in placing the matter&#xD;
before you."&#xD;
"Accompany him there !-~accompany&#xD;
him there indeed! ~ cried Mrs. Harding,&#xD;
*hose voice rose higher every moment.&#xD;
"What do you think Jiim, that he should'&#xD;
take you oft! in secret, to hear slanders&#xD;
against his son?"&#xD;
"What I think him, madam, is not of the&#xD;
least importance," Conway said. "But I&#xD;
perceive that I have little chance of being&#xD;
heard."&#xD;
Before Mrs. Harding could reply, her son&#xD;
gave his first and only indication of manly&#xD;
courage, by putting. her aside and stepping&#xD;
forward.&#xD;
"This matter concerns me," he said,&#xD;
with his usual pomposity, but also with a&#xD;
touch of dignity quite unusual. "I am per.&#xD;
feetly willing that Mr. Conway should lay&#xD;
it, in all its bearii~gs, before my father. It&#xD;
wrn be strange if he has found one proof&#xD;
against me half as strong as the many that&#xD;
were brought against him, before I left&#xD;
Sexton House.~-Hush, mother! let him&#xD;
speak."&#xD;
Turning to the father, Mr. Conway spoke&#xD;
accordingly. His language was forcible,&#xD;
and colored necessarily, though uliiconscious-&#xD;
ly, by his own convictions. He began with&#xD;
* Mr. Harding's own confession that he had&#xD;
overheard the declaration on the island,&#xD;
which (according to general belief) de-&#xD;
stroyed his hopes of the inheritance. This&#xD;
link in the chain of evidence seemed very&#xD;
slight, he said, but it weighed heavily when&#xD;
* taken in connection with after - events.&#xD;
Then came the history of 1~hose after-&#xD;
events: the mysterious disappearance of&#xD;
Mabel; the fact that Mr. Harding alone had&#xD;
been absent on that afternoon; the testi-&#xD;
mony of the man who affirmed that he had&#xD;
met one of the Seyton House trio of geDtle-&#xD;
men with Mabel on the river; and, lastly, the&#xD;
forged letter, and the seal which her sister&#xD;
at once identified as Mabel's1 and which a&#xD;
witness (he did notsay who) was prepared&#xD;
to prove had been in Mr. Harding's posses-&#xD;
sion at the verytime. the letter was written.&#xD;
It was, on the whole, a poor array of&#xD;
evidence-for of course the subtler part of&#xD;
it, the acts,. and words, and tones, that had&#xD;
&#xD;
weighed the most with Mr. Seyton, and&#xD;
even with Conway himself; could have no&#xD;
place in this cold re'sum6 of facts. Regarded&#xD;
from an entirely dispassionate point of view,&#xD;
the most unprejudiced parents alive migbt&#xD;
have been excused if they had listened as&#xD;
incredulously as Mr. and Mrs, Harding did.&#xD;
"Apparently your evidence can be&#xD;
summed up very briefly," said the former.&#xD;
"My son chanced to take a ride on the af-&#xD;
ternoon of the young lady's disappearance,&#xD;
and, on the strength of that accidental ab-&#xD;
sence, you identify him with an unknown&#xD;
man who was seen on the river. As for&#xD;
the letter, it appears that you charge him&#xD;
with forging that, merely because the im-&#xD;
pression on its seal bore some real or fan-&#xD;
cied resemblance to another seal whieh (as&#xD;
he has told you) was given him by another&#xD;
young lady. Really, Mr. Conway, if you&#xD;
have come two hundred miles to tell this&#xD;
story, I am only~ sorry that you should have&#xD;
taken so much trouble for nothing?'&#xD;
Conway took up the open letter, folded&#xD;
and returned it to his pocket, before he an-&#xD;
swered. Then he spoke very quietly:&#xD;
"The array of evidence looks very slight&#xD;
to you, sir, of course, and equally, of course,&#xD;
your feeling is all with your son. I have&#xD;
done my part, in placing the matter before&#xD;
you. Once more-" and he turned to his&#xD;
cousin, as he spoke-" do you refuse to&#xD;
make a compromise, while there is yet time?&#xD;
Remember that, after I have crossed this&#xD;
threshold, your opportunity is past. After&#xD;
to-day, I shall speak by the law, if the law&#xD;
will reach you. If not, by another and even&#xD;
surer means."&#xD;
He looked keenly into the face before&#xD;
him, but he read there not even so much as&#xD;
one token of yielding, It was very white,&#xD;
and the lips quivered a little, as if from&#xD;
physical fear; but that was all. Evidently,&#xD;
if this man were possessed of the secret, he&#xD;
felt so secure of the absence of any serious&#xD;
proof against him that it would be neces-&#xD;
sary to wring it from him by a sterner&#xD;
method than this had been.&#xD;
"You are resolved?" Conway asked,&#xD;
without removing his eyes,&#xD;
And the answer came, exactly likethose&#xD;
answers that had gone before.&#xD;

norant of every thing you wish to know.&#xD;
As for your accusations and threats, I leave&#xD;
them to fall back on your own head, when&#xD;
you learn their injustice."&#xD;
Conway smiled bitterly.&#xD;
"That is a degree of Christian charity&#xD;
worthy of so eminent a follower of the&#xD;
Pharisees. Hear my wish now: that when&#xD;
the bolt of discovery falls-as it will fall,&#xD;
sooner or later-it may blight every human&#xD;

All the passion within him-the passion&#xD;
he had curbed so steadily throughout the&#xD;

I think it would puzzle the best detective in&#xD;
the Paris force. There is one thing, out of&#xD;
all the mist, which I see clearly-my own&#xD;

It was undoubtedly his determination,&#xD;
but none the less he felt, to the very core of&#xD;
his heart, that the clew had suddenly and&#xD;
entirely broken down in 1)18 hands.&#xD;

&#xD;
ease. A French name was lettered over&#xD;
the door and when :N~owell entered he saw&#xD;
that it was a French face whose bright&#xD;
brown eyes looked up at him from behind&#xD;
the counter. The face belonged to a short,&#xD;
stout figure, and would have been extreme-&#xD;
ly yo~mthful' in appearance if the white hair&#xD;
surrounding it had not imparted something&#xD;
of the aspect of age. The fresh, rosy com-&#xD;
plexion contrasted with this very well, how-&#xD;
ever, and a beanilug smile seconded the&#xD;
wdnderfully perfect courtesy of his nation,&#xD;
as the little man crossed his hands one over&#xD;
the other and bowed deeply.&#xD;
"Votre servant, sare," he said, in very&#xD;
broken English. "Vat may I haf ze honor&#xD;
to show you, sar?"&#xD;
Nowell glanced round him in some per-&#xD;
plexity-he had come so little prepared for&#xD;
his part, that he did not even possess a&#xD;
ready-made want~&#xD;
"I would like to see some writing-&#xD;
paper," he said, after a pause, "and-and&#xD;
envelopes, if you please."&#xD;
"Papaire and envelopes," repeated the&#xD;
little man. "Oui, oui; I haf zem, sare, and&#xD;
of ze best. Will you haf zem to mach?"&#xD;
"To do what? " asked Nowell, in some&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"To mach-is not that what you would&#xD;
say? To be alike-to suit."&#xD;
"Oh, to match~ Yes--no-that is, I&#xD;
would prefer them like this." And he laid&#xD;
down on the counter the envelope in which&#xD;
the forged letter had been enclosed, but&#xD;
whichhe had not returned with that letter.&#xD;
The Frenchman bent his head to exam-&#xD;
ine it, an4 thea looked up again~&#xD;
he said, "I haf plenty like dat,&#xD;
flat corned from my stock."&#xD;
"Yes, I know it did. I saw your mark&#xD;
on it. And have you more of the same&#xD;
sort?"&#xD;
"Plenty," repeated the little stationer~&#xD;
with a sigh. "I haf no moock custom, sare.&#xD;
Zese peoples zey likes bigger shops zan&#xD;
mine; and yet, m'sieur, zey finds no such&#xD;
papaire elsewhere as what I keeps; for I&#xD;
brought it viz me from Paris."&#xD;
"You are lately from Paris, then?"&#xD;
asked Newell, who had his own reasons for&#xD;
desiring to make the small foreigner as&#xD;
&#xD;
communicative as possible. The bright&#xD;
brown eyes looked up at him, sadly enough&#xD;
in reply.&#xD;
"Oni, m'sianr, I an~ vaire lately from&#xD;
Paris. I vas in trouble dere, and one kind&#xD;
good countryman of yours, he lends me ze&#xD;
money for to come way, and I comes here&#xD;
where he lifs and can help me. Are nose&#xD;
no envelopes, sare?"&#xD;
"Yes, these are the ones," said Nowell,&#xD;
comparing the envelope in his hand with&#xD;
the contents of a box which the Frenchman&#xD;
placed before him. "These are the ones.&#xD;
You can put me up two packages. The box&#xD;
seems quite full; so I suppose you have not&#xD;
sold any of them before."&#xD;
"Vaire few, saire-vaire few. Zese peo-&#xD;
pbs zey know noting whatevare about good&#xD;
stationerie. Zey minds noting about how&#xD;
zey writes zero lettaire-nor what zey&#xD;
writes zem on. Va! So zey can be reads,&#xD;
nat is all zey cares. Now, zese are vairo&#xD;
fine envelopes, sare."&#xD;
"Yes," said Nowell. "I don't know&#xD;
much about such things, but I can see that&#xD;
they are fine."&#xD;
"Well, sare, you may not believe me,&#xD;
but I haf sold them to but one person before&#xD;
you comed-but one person, sare."&#xD;
"And who was that?" asked Newell,&#xD;
eagerly, for the next winding of the clew&#xD;
seemed almost within his grasp-far nearer&#xD;
than he had dared to hope it would be.&#xD;
"Zat person," said the little Frenchman,&#xD;
busily tying up the bundle of envelopes, as&#xD;
he spoke, "nat person, sare, was my goot&#xD;
front vat helped me here-my front vat&#xD;
help me yet all the time. Is nis all sure?&#xD;
You said papaire, did you not?"&#xD;
"Paper, yes," answered Nowell, has-&#xD;
tily~ "The finest you have. This will&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"No, Bare; zat will not do," said the&#xD;
stationer, removing from under his hand&#xD;
some paper that had been lying on the count-&#xD;
er. "You zay you want no finest I haf,&#xD;
Zat am not ne finest I haf, sare. I haf oder&#xD;
much finer, sure."&#xD;
So Newell stood by, possessed with the&#xD;
very spirit of impatience, while he opened&#xD;
and shut drawers innun~orable, sha14x~g. his&#xD;
head over each. "Non," he went on ~y-&#xD;

ON THE TRACK.&#xD;

&#xD;
ing. "Zis not de finest," until at last ti&#xD;
scant patience of his customer gave way.&#xD;
"That will do," he said. "Any will d(&#xD;
I assure you. I am in haste. I really cci&#xD;
not wait-"&#xD;
"Ab, here it is!" exclaimed the othei&#xD;
who was not paying the least attention t&#xD;
him, but had suddenly jerked out a drawei&#xD;
and found what he wanted. "Here it ii&#xD;
sare!" he said, bringing forward som&#xD;
creamy-tinted paper, which bore the fines&#xD;
Paris niark, and looked as if it was mean&#xD;
for nothing but billet-dour purposes. Now&#xD;
oil had 'about as much use for it as he woul&#xD;
have had for the pen from a pigeon's wing&#xD;
and the violet-colored ink which shoul&#xD;
properly. have accompanied it. But h&#xD;
bought largely, nevertheless, and then feli&#xD;
at liberty to bring the conversation bacb&#xD;
to the question which was tormenting&#xD;
him. ~&#xD;
"Your friend, who helped you to come&#xD;
over from Paris, must be a very kind per-&#xD;
son," he said. "Is he a Charlestonian?"&#xD;
"Oni, in'siour," said the little man, with&#xD;
a grateful moisture shimmering at once over&#xD;
his eyes. "He is a Sharlostonian. He lifs&#xD;
here, and ho is vairo goot-vaire, vaire goot,&#xD;
ni&#xD;
"Perhaps I know him. You would not&#xD;
mind telling me his name, would you?"&#xD;
"Non, m'siour. Vhy should I mind?&#xD;
Efory one mnst know him to be a goot man.&#xD;
Lo hon Dieu knows it, I am nure. He is&#xD;
not-"&#xD;
"But I thought you wor&amp;amp; going to tell&#xD;
me his name?"&#xD;
"Oni; and so 1 am. His name is Mon-&#xD;
sieur Ainslie."&#xD;
"1 knew it," said Nowoll, half aloud.&#xD;
And, strange to say, he felt that he had&#xD;
known it all along-known that the poor&#xD;
little foreigner's generous patron could only&#xD;
bethe man whom he had met as Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton's guest, and Philip Conway's friefid.&#xD;
Yet, now that the confirmation of this&#xD;
knowledge placed the next winding of the&#xD;
clew in his hands, he saw, with bitter dis-&#xD;
appointment, how far he was from time end.&#xD;
Aizislie! He could not, by any stretch of.&#xD;
imagination, connect Mabel's disappearance&#xD;
with Aim: Ever since he entered the shop,&#xD;
.9&#xD;
&#xD;
'e he had expected to hear of him; and yet,&#xD;
now that he had done so, he felt that it was&#xD;
)~ impossible to accept the conollialon pre-&#xD;
i~ rented. Despite his being Conway's friend,&#xD;
he had liked him cordially, and trustedhim&#xD;
~, entirely; and he could not bring himself to&#xD;
o believe-what he would have suspected&#xD;
quickly enough of any other man-that he&#xD;
,, had any share in the abduction. The en-&#xD;
e velope might have passed from his posses-&#xD;
t sion to that of his friend, in the most natu-&#xD;
t ral manner possible. And yet, perhaps, it&#xD;
- was his duty to follow out the clew as it&#xD;
I was presented to him; or, in other words,&#xD;
to track Ainslie down, as a means of un-&#xD;
I masking the friend for whom he might be&#xD;
acting. He hesitated only a moment over&#xD;
this doubt; then he turned round to the lit-&#xD;
tle shopkeeper with a good deal of the&#xD;
brusque sharpness that, young as ho was,&#xD;
made witnesses tremble before his cross-&#xD;
examinations.&#xD;
*    "I know Mr. Ainslie well," he said&#xD;
"and I am anxious to see him. Can you&#xD;
give me his address?"&#xD;
"Oui, m'sieur, viz plasir. But, if you&#xD;
vish to see him vaire soon, ze club might&#xD;
be-"&#xD;
"I wish to see him privately. I don't&#xD;
care~ to go to the club. Where does he&#xD;
live?"&#xD;
"He lifs, m'sieur, at No. -, Rootledge&#xD;
Street. You will find him zere most times,&#xD;
vhen he is not at the club."&#xD;
Newell made his acknowledgments,&#xD;
and, pocketing his paper, left the shop. As&#xD;
lie walked slowly and meditatively down&#xD;
King Street, he resolved in his mind what&#xD;
his best course of action would be. He&#xD;
must see Ainslie-there wa~ no question as&#xD;
to that. One critical examination of the&#xD;
man's face would enable him, he doubted&#xD;
not, to judge whether he was guilty of the&#xD;
complicity in Conway's ~irime, which cir-&#xD;
cumstances seemed to indicate. Satisfied&#xD;
on this point, his way was clear beforeliho;&#xD;
but at present he fell; m6re hopelessly per-&#xD;
plexed than ever before, dark as the affair&#xD;
had been from the first. Yeshe must sec&#xD;
Ainshie-but how? Call on him?-..-and up.&#xD;
on wbatpretence ?L Seek aud question him&#xD;
with an abrupt directness that might so&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8069-00000068"/>&#xD;
130                          MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON THE TRACK.                       131&#xD;
&#xD;
take him by surprise as to make his counte-&#xD;
nauc? betray him? Caution said no ; "the&#xD;
slightest manifestation of suspicion would&#xD;
be putting him on his guard. Call on him&#xD;
in 'n~i~e social way, as being accidentally&#xD;
in~to~ji upon business, and unable to deny&#xD;
hi~nself the pleasure of renewing so agreea-&#xD;
ble an acquaintance as that of Mr. Ainslie?&#xD;
He dismissed this thought at once, as un-&#xD;
worthy. No, social treason for him; he left&#xD;
that for Conway &amp;amp; Co., if Ainslie made one&#xD;
of such a. firm.. No, he thought, he must&#xD;
meet the man upon neutral ground; meet&#xD;
him apparently by accident; and meantime&#xD;
he would obtain all possible information&#xD;
concerning him; what was his character-&#xD;
what his manner of life. He had now been&#xD;
so absorbed in reverie as to pass, without&#xD;
notice, the street which he ought to have&#xD;
taken on his way back to the Charleston&#xD;
Hotel. 'Becoming suddenly awake to his&#xD;
surroundings, he perceived that he had&#xD;
reachedd the point at which King is inter-&#xD;
sected by Broad Street. He turned into the&#xD;
last named, and, not wishing again to lose&#xD;
his way and his time by forgetfulness, was&#xD;
careful to keep his thoughts about him, as&#xD;
he traversed the square between King and&#xD;
Meeting Streets, and turned up toward the&#xD;
hotel. His eyes being open accordingly, he&#xD;
had not taken three steps after turning the&#xD;
corner, ere his, attention was attracted by&#xD;
the figure of a gentleman who made one of&#xD;
a group standing on the pavement just in&#xD;
front of Hibernian Hall. When his eye&#xD;
first fell upon the man (whose back was&#xD;
that way), he absolutely started, thinking&#xD;
that rlAll~ Conway was before him; but a&#xD;
second glance showed him his mistake.&#xD;
The hair was brown,, instead of black, and&#xD;
the form, though of the same height and&#xD;
gex~eral appearance, lacked the grace and&#xD;
syminetryso remarkable in that of his hated&#xD;
rival. It was Ainslie h~e saw. His late ab-&#xD;
sence ~f mind, in bringing ~him several&#xD;
squares out of hi~ way, had given him the&#xD;
accidental meeting for which he was at that&#xD;
very moment wishing.&#xD;
Slackening his pace, he had ample time&#xD;
to regaixi the composure of countenance&#xD;
which the first sight of Ainslie had some-&#xD;
what disturbed; and was fully prepared for.&#xD;
&#xD;
the interview, not only with imperturbable&#xD;
self-possession on his own, part, but also t'y&#xD;
note carefully the effect which his unex-&#xD;
pected appearance would produce upon the&#xD;
other. When he was within a few yards of&#xD;
the group, it suddenly separated, t~iree of&#xD;
the four gentlemen of which it consisted&#xD;
passing down the street, and of course&#xD;
meeting him, while the fourth, Ainslie him-&#xD;
self; went on in the opposite direction. But&#xD;
he had scarcely parted from the others, be-&#xD;
fore he turned suddenly to speak to them&#xD;
again; and he started violently, as Nowell&#xD;
could not but remark, when he saw the&#xD;
young lawyer. That astute observer ac-&#xD;
knowledged to himself; however, that, if the&#xD;
start was caused by any thing save surprise,&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie was wonderfully quick in recov-&#xD;
ering himself. He advanced at once in the&#xD;
easiest, most graceful manner, expressing,&#xD;
in terms which, though cordial in the ex-&#xD;
treme, did not sound exaggerated, his pleas-&#xD;
ure at so unlooked-for a meeting. And all&#xD;
the while he spoke, while asking about&#xD;
Nowell himself; and then inquiring after his&#xD;
other friends and acquaintances in the up-&#xD;
country, there was in his air, his voice, his&#xD;
looks, a certain respectful sadness, which,&#xD;
much more eloquently than any words he&#xD;
could have uttered, expressed his recollec-&#xD;
tion of the last days he had spent in the up-&#xD;
country, and his sympathy with the grief&#xD;
of those days. Newell was particularly&#xD;
pleased by the tact with which he avoided&#xD;
the mention of Conway's name; and, thaw-&#xD;
ing a little from his ordinary fl~edness of&#xD;
manner, he with perfect sincerity assured&#xD;
Mr. Ainslie that he was very glad to see&#xD;
him.&#xD;
They had walked on together while ex-&#xD;
changing these first greetings; and now&#xD;
Ainslie said, with apologetic 'hesitation of&#xD;
manner:&#xD;
"I hope, Mr. Newell, you will not think&#xD;
I take too great a liberty in asking if you&#xD;
have made any discovery yet about Miss&#xD;
Lee's disappearance?"&#xD;
Newell shook his head. "None what-&#xD;
ever." After a rapid mental consideration&#xD;
as to the expediency of mentioning tha let-&#xD;
ter, he added: "My cousin was very nmeh&#xD;
excited a day or two before I left honte, by&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
receiving a letter which purported to I&#xD;
from her sister. I saw at once that it w~&#xD;
a forgery, and so Constance perceived,&#xD;
soon as the fact was suggested to her."&#xD;
"A forgery?&#xD;
"A forgery without doubt."&#xD;
"That isatrange," said Ainslie, though:&#xD;
fully; "very strange I"&#xD;
"Not more so than all that preceded it,&#xD;
answered Newell, compelling himself by&#xD;
great effort to continue, or at least not t&#xD;
decline, discussing the subject - bitterly&#xD;
painful as the slightest allusion to it was t&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"And did the letter afford no clew b;&#xD;
which to detect the writer-the post-marl~&#xD;
for instance I"&#xD;
"It would be a bungler, indeed, .wh4&#xD;
would betray himself by voluntarily putting~&#xD;
any thing which could afford a clew into on:&#xD;
hands. The post-mark-no. Like the let.&#xD;
ter itself; it was clearly intended to bliuc&#xD;
inquiry. It is that of Edgerton. Of course~&#xD;
the letter was mailed there on purpose tc&#xD;
gi*~e~ a false clew, if we had been so simple m&#xD;
to fall into the trap."&#xD;
"And you have not even written te&#xD;
make inquiries of the postmaster? I can't&#xD;
but think-pardon me-that it might be&#xD;
well to do that."&#xD;
"I promised my cousin that I would sift&#xD;
the thing to the bottom, on my return home,&#xD;
if nothing had in the mean time been dis-&#xD;
covered. But no information can be gained,&#xD;
I am sure, through the medium of the post-&#xD;
office." He paused. "I am sorry I must&#xD;
say good-morning here, Mr. Ainslie. I am&#xD;
just returning to my room "-he motioned&#xD;
toward the Charleston Hotel, opposite to&#xD;
which they were standing-" t~ prepare a&#xD;
business paper, and am engaged for the&#xD;
Whole day; so that I shall notprobablyhave&#xD;
the pleasure of seeing. you again. But I am&#xD;
glad to have met you."&#xD;
"But you are not leaving town at once,&#xD;
I suppose? Can't you dine with me? I&#xD;
shall he delighted' to see you at my house,&#xD;
No. -RutledgeStreet, at any hour most con-&#xD;
venierit toyon, from three to eight o'clock,&#xD;
or Iater% if you prefer~" he added, laughingly.&#xD;
"Thank you.. I am sorry to say that it&#xD;
is impossible. I am extremely anxious to&#xD;
&#xD;
)e get back to Ayre; and, the moment that I&#xD;
~s have concluded the business which brought&#xD;
m me here, I shall leava-to-morrow morning,&#xD;
or it may be to-night."&#xD;
Ainslie expressed his regret, seeming&#xD;
really, as he said, much disappointed at see-&#xD;
I- ing so little of Mr. Nowell. He even endeav-&#xD;
ored to alter the decision of that gentleman&#xD;
" with regard to declining his invitation to&#xD;
a dinner. But Newell was immovable. Re-&#xD;
o eating his assurance that he had an impor-&#xD;
y tant business paper to wri1~e, and several&#xD;
o engagements afterward that would occupy&#xD;
him all day, he shook hands, in very friendly&#xD;
y spirit, apparently, and, crossing the street,&#xD;
., entered the hotel.&#xD;
Ainslie stood still, looking after him,&#xD;
' until he vanished within the open portal,&#xD;
~ then muttering, half alou~I, "I am sorry he&#xD;
t' would not dine with me," he sauntered on&#xD;
- up the street.&#xD;
I Newell went to his room, took out his&#xD;
writing-materials, and sat down to the table&#xD;
to go to work. But he seemed in no hurry&#xD;
to commence his task. Leaning his head on&#xD;
his hand, he went over in his mind every&#xD;
look and word of Ainslie-weighing each one /&#xD;
deliberately, and then regarding them col-&#xD;
lectively. "Did any thing in the face or&#xD;
manner look like guilt?" he asked himself.&#xD;
And he could remember hut one thing which&#xD;
had the faintest appearance of it-that first&#xD;
start upon seeing him. Yet, as he had&#xD;
thought at the time, that might have been&#xD;
caused by surprise only. But why, suggest-&#xD;
ed Suspicion, should the mere unexpected&#xD;
sight of a stranger have excited a degree of&#xD;
surprise amounting at the moment to posi-&#xD;
tive emotion? It was singular, assuredly,&#xD;
but not impossible, Reason answered. On&#xD;
the whole, the wished-for meeting had not&#xD;
done much to settle his opinion-had done&#xD;
nothing, in fact, for he was just as much in&#xD;
doubt now as, he had been before.&#xD;
With something like a groan he lifted&#xD;
his head, and suffered his hand to fall p~s-&#xD;
sively to the table. But he soon roused&#xD;
himself from this unaccustomed mood ~f&#xD;
dejectiou~ and began to write, gradually re-&#xD;
,gaining, as he went on, his habitual energy&#xD;
and intentness of purpose. He was making&#xD;
out a concise statement of the circumstances&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
Two H~AD5 A~E BETTER THAN oxz.&#xD;
Hu had finished a rough draft of his&#xD;
statement, and was reading it over, striking&#xD;
out a good many superfluous words, and al-&#xD;
tering or adding a few, 'when he was inter-&#xD;
rupted'by a knock at his door.&#xD;
"Come in," he said, in no very gracious&#xD;
tone; and lie muttered an exclamation of&#xD;
annoyance, w~ndering who his visitor could&#xD;
be as the door opened, and a servant ad-&#xD;
vanced with - a card.. He had plenty of ac-&#xD;
quaintdnces and 'friends in Charleston; but&#xD;
h~ supposed that most or all of them were&#xD;
out of town at this season, and, even if they&#xD;
were in town, how should "they know that&#xD;
he was there? . Surely it was net Ainslie.&#xD;
The man extended the card at the mo-&#xD;
ment. He took it, glanced at the aalue with&#xD;
a surprise obviously not pleasurablexand&#xD;
looked up.&#xD;
"An old gentlemafi?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Yes, sir an oldish-looking gentle-&#xD;
man."&#xD;
LI Show him up.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
-"Vexatious!" he exclaimed, as soon as&#xD;
the door closed on the man's exit. And&#xD;
then he colored slightly, as if ashamed of&#xD;
his petulance, and pushed his tapers to-&#xD;
gether, thrusting out of sight the sheet he&#xD;
had- been writing. While doing thi~, he&#xD;
suddenly thoughtt him that he ought to&#xD;
have gone down himself to meet his visitor,&#xD;
instead of sending the servant, and he&#xD;
hastened to repair his incivility by going at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
At .the head of the stairs he was met by&#xD;
an elderly gentleman, whose warm greeting&#xD;
&#xD;
made him yet more ashamed of the annoy-&#xD;
ance he felt at the idea of being inter-&#xD;
rupted.&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Lyndsay, I am heartily&#xD;
glad to see you!" he exclaimed, with gen-&#xD;
uine cordiality. "I did not know you were&#xD;
on this side of the Atlantic. You must have&#xD;
arrived very lately."&#xD;
"Yes; a week or ten days ago. I left&#xD;
my family in Virginia, at the White Sulphur&#xD;
Springs1 and came down for a day or two&#xD;
to take a look at the old town and attend to&#xD;
some business. You passed through the&#xD;
portico a moment ago, as I stood there, and,&#xD;
something in your appearance striking me&#xD;
as familiar, I inquired your name, looked in&#xD;
the register, and, finding you were from&#xD;
Ayre, took it for granted that you must be&#xD;
my old friend Hal's son-the little Francis&#xD;
who was in jackets the last time I saw&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I remember it, and remember you&#xD;
perfectly. You have not changed percepti-&#xD;
bly. I need not ask how you are~ you are&#xD;
lookingso remarkably welL"&#xD;
"I am sorry I can't return the compli-&#xD;
ment," said Mr. Lyndsay, gravely.&#xD;
I~Towell smiled and then laughed at the&#xD;
frankly critical scrutiny with which ~he old&#xD;
gentleman's eye was travelling over his per-&#xD;
son from head to foot.&#xD;
"I don't resemble my father, I have&#xD;
been told," he remarked.&#xD;
"Not much," answered Mr. Lyndsay, sit-&#xD;
ting down and taking off his gloves, for they&#xD;
were by this time in Nowell's room. "When&#xD;
you smile, your face has the expression of&#xD;
his; 1~ut the features are different. And I'm&#xD;
sorry ~to see that you are overworking&#xD;
yourself, my young friend." He shook his&#xD;
head. "Bad policy, believe me. You look&#xD;
ten years old~r than you are. You clever.&#xD;
men generally want to go up-hill too fast.&#xD;
Now, take my advice, which would be your&#xD;
father's if he were living, and pull up for a&#xD;
while in the race you are running. You&#xD;
will reach the goal all the sooner, and not&#xD;
be out of breath when you get there."&#xD;
Nowell laughed again, bu1~ his old friend&#xD;
stopped short the disclaimer he was about&#xD;
to taske. "Oh, I know all that you would&#xD;
say," he went on, with a silencin~'rnotion&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
TWO HEADS ARE. BETTER THAN ONE.&#xD;
&#xD;
of the hand; "but I am not speaking merel&#xD;
from the impression which your appearance&#xD;
gives me, though that would be enough.&#xD;
have heard of you frequently. Last year.&#xD;
met young Tom Rutledge in Paris, and 114&#xD;
told me that you were one of the mos&#xD;
rising men in the State, both in your pro&#xD;
session and in politics; but that you wer~&#xD;
working yourself to death."&#xD;
"Tom was mistaken. 1 have never hun&#xD;
myself working too hard. I'm not looking~&#xD;
well just now-"&#xD;
"Well! You are looking about as badl3&#xD;
as a man could. . Thin andhaggard-"&#xD;
He paused, struck, it seemed, by som&#xD;
sudden thought, and, drawing his chair closc&#xD;
to Nowell's, laid his hand on the youn~&#xD;
man's arm, saying earnestly: "Boy, youi&#xD;
father was ~he dearest friend I ever had.&#xD;
We loved each other as brothers. If you&#xD;
are in any trouble, tell me what it is frankly.&#xD;
I may be able to help you out of it; at least&#xD;
I will try. Come, make a clean breast of&#xD;
it! What is the matter?"&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Lyndsay, I am in trouble,&#xD;
in very great trouble," said Nowell, whose&#xD;
eyes had grown strangely moist and bright&#xD;
while his father's friend spoke. "I will tell&#xD;
you what it is directly1 but first I want to&#xD;
ask a question or two.- Are you acquaint-&#xD;
ed with ~ young man - a native Charlesto-&#xD;
nian, I think-Ainshie by name?"&#xD;
"Ainshie?" repeated the other, with the&#xD;
puzzled look of one who is endeavoring to&#xD;
grasp a thought that is playing at hide-and-&#xD;
seek in his men~iory. "Ainslie! That&#xD;
name certainly-O-h!" and his chin elevat-&#xD;
ed itself several inches in the air, and came&#xD;
down a gain, in the emphasis of that ejacula-&#xD;
tion. "I recollect now! I have no person-&#xD;
al acquaintance with him, but I know who&#xD;
you mean. Hum-hum! "he said to himself,&#xD;
looking at Nowell with a very singular ex-&#xD;
pression on his face. "Go on. What of&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"You don't know, then, any thing about&#xD;
his character ?-whether he is a man of&#xD;
Mr. Lyndsay smiled a very peculiar&#xD;
sn~ile. "I know, absolutely ~nothing about&#xD;
him or, his character, excepting that he is'-&#xD;
the son of the most unmitigated rascal I&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
y ever met with in the whole course of my&#xD;
e life."&#xD;
".Ah! "&#xD;
"You were too young at the time of&#xD;
s your uncle Lee's death to have understood&#xD;
t much about it, but I suppose you have heard&#xD;
- all the circumstances since?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Nowehl, a vague ap-&#xD;
prehension beginning to dawn upon him.&#xD;
"Well, Covington - the man who in-&#xD;
veigled Lee and a gooA many others into a&#xD;
bubble speculation which ruined them all-&#xD;
was the father of this Ainslie, as you call him.&#xD;
The thing was manifestly a swindle, for,.&#xD;
while his friends were broken all to pieces,&#xD;
it was universally believed that he himself&#xD;
made an immense fortune by the transaction.&#xD;
A very strong feeling was excited against&#xD;
him, particularly when Lee's death occurred&#xD;
* in the manner it did. He thought it pru-&#xD;
dent to decamp for a while until the storm of&#xD;
public indignation should blow over; and so&#xD;
he went to Europe, and stayed several years.&#xD;
On his return, he changed his name to Ains-.&#xD;
lie, asserting that he did so in consequence&#xD;
of having inherited a large property from a&#xD;
relative of that name in England,' who made&#xD;
it a condition of the inheritance that he&#xD;
should assume his (the legator's) patronymic.&#xD;
-Nobody gave the least credit to his story.&#xD;
He did not recover the social status which&#xD;
he had forfeited, and did not long enjoy his&#xD;
fraudulent gains, dying very shortly after&#xD;
his return."&#xD;
"And Ainslie is ~his son?"&#xD;
"Yes. Has he been playing the same&#xD;
game over again? and induced you to in-&#xD;
volve yourself in some pecuniary venture&#xD;
with him?"&#xD;
Nowell shook his head. "It is no money&#xD;
affair," he replied. "Whether he has any&#xD;
thingto do with it is the point on which I&#xD;
am in doubt, and which I am now trying to&#xD;
ascertain. But you shall hear all about it."&#xD;
He. recounted briefly, but clearly, the&#xD;
history of Mabel's mysterious disappearance,&#xD;
mentioning his own, suspicion of Conway-&#xD;
a suspicion entertained, he said, by the com-&#xD;
munity at. large-gave a detail of the unsuc-&#xD;
cessful search, of the receipt of the letter,&#xD;
of his conviction that it was a forgery; his&#xD;
discovery about the envelope, and finally of&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8069-00000070"/>&#xD;
the uncertainty he felt as to whether Ains-&#xD;
lie was or was not the agent of Philip Con-&#xD;
way in the abduction of his cousin.&#xD;
Mr. Lyndsay listened with the most ea-&#xD;
ger attention and interest, ~iot interrupting&#xD;
him by a word. When h~ finished speak-&#xD;
ing, the old gentleman was silent for a mo-&#xD;
ment, thinking deeply. Then he said:&#xD;
"Yen seem fully persuaded of Conway's&#xD;
guilt."&#xD;
"I am as firmly convinced of it as I am&#xD;
of my own existence."&#xD;
"Yet, you say, he was engaged to your&#xD;
00U5in."&#xD;
"He says so. Well, yes-I concede that&#xD;
he was engaged to her."&#xD;
"Then what possible motive could have&#xD;
induced hhn to such a course as this?"&#xD;
"I can't tell, unless it was that he de-&#xD;
spaired~of obtaining his unole's consent to&#xD;
the affair, and wished to get Mabel into his&#xD;
powei', and so force his own terms. Seyton&#xD;
is her godfather, and regards her as his own&#xD;
child. Conway acknowledged that he was&#xD;
aware of his uncle's disapproval of his pre~&#xD;
tensions."&#xD;
"But, if he has any sense, he could not&#xD;
expect to obtain Seyton's consent by the&#xD;
perpetration of such an outrage as this. Is&#xD;
he' a fool?"&#xD;
"No. He is not very brilliant intellect-&#xD;
ually, but he's not a fool."&#xD;
"And does Seyton suspect him?"&#xD;
Nowell smiled bitterly. "Seyton re-&#xD;
sents the mere suspicion 'of his guilt as an&#xD;
Insult to himself. He has even, on the&#xD;
strength of his partisanship, declared the&#xD;
scoundt~al his heir."&#xD;
"And the motl~er and sister of your&#xD;
cousin-which side do they take?"&#xD;
"My aunt is a weak woman, who has&#xD;
no settled opinion on the subject. She be- I&#xD;
* thieves every thing and nothing by turns.&#xD;
Constance, her daughter, is as much infatn-&#xD;
Med about Conway as his uncle is. But&#xD;
they two are' his only partisans in the whole&#xD;
country. 'Everybody else believes him to&#xD;
be guilty. lie was very nearly mobbed the&#xD;
day I loft ~Ayre, so intense is the indigna-&#xD;
tion that exists against him."&#xD;
"Set me down as a 'third partisan for&#xD;
him~ I can't believe that any man, oompos&#xD;
&#xD;
mentia, would 'have acted as you think he&#xD;
has. And now let me tell you what you&#xD;
must do, Francis. I think you said you&#xD;
told Ainslie that you might leave town this&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
"Yes," answered Nowell with a twinge&#xD;
of conscience, for he was not in the habit of&#xD;
deviating in the least degree from the strict&#xD;
spirit of truth. "Yes; I spoke on the im-&#xD;
pulse of the moment, to excuse myself from&#xD;
dining with him. In fact, I spoke sincerely;&#xD;
for, really, while I was talking to him, I&#xD;
could not believe him capable of such infa-&#xD;
mous treachery. If he is not an honest&#xD;
man, he is the most accomplished dissimu-&#xD;
lator that it has ever been my chance to&#xD;
stumble upon.~~&#xD;
"Well, he may be honest. It would be&#xD;
hard to condemn a man as a scoundrel be-&#xD;
cause his father was one. But this very&#xD;
fair-seeming which you describe looks mon-&#xD;
strously suspicious to me; it is so much&#xD;
like his father. Of all plausible rogues that&#xD;
I ever saw, Covington was the most plausi-&#xD;
ble. However, we'll give him the benefit&#xD;
of a doubt, both ways. We won't condemn&#xD;
him without proof, and we'll take evety&#xD;
me~ins to obtain proof. And now, to return&#xD;
to the point. It is very well you did tell&#xD;
him you expected to leave, and you must&#xD;
keep your word-go off this evening. Stop&#xD;
-hear me out, before you begin to protest!&#xD;
You intended to apply to the police; well,&#xD;
give me the statement you have made out,&#xD;
and I wrn set them to work. Fortunately,&#xD;
Ikuow the chief very well, and I'll get him&#xD;
to detail me a man for this special service.&#xD;
I know the very man that will do; an hon-&#xD;
est, faithful fellow, and shrewd, too, for&#xD;
whom I once did a little kindness which he&#xD;
has never forgotten. I will obtain leave of&#xD;
absence for him, put him in plain clothes,&#xD;
and set him to watch Ainslie's movements;&#xD;
and I myself can easily find out all about&#xD;
his character and habits. You, meanwhile,&#xD;
will take the Augusta train this evening~&#xD;
but, instead of going home, you will rui~&#xD;
down to Savannah, and come over in the&#xD;
next boat. If Ainslie is in this business,&#xD;
either as principal or accomplice, he will of&#xD;
course be alarmed at seeing you here. Your&#xD;
having mentioned the letter to him,' and&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed unsuspicious, may throw him off his&#xD;
guard; bat it will be safest to take every&#xD;
precaution to do so. If you leave as you&#xD;
said, without having exhibited any signs of&#xD;
suspicion, or made any inquiries, he will&#xD;
naturally suppose that your business here&#xD;
was professional-and that you have re-&#xD;
turned home in haste to investigate the&#xD;
affair of the letter. He is sure to keep his&#xD;
eye on you, and will ascertain whether you&#xD;
leave or not; and it is very likely that he&#xD;
may be on the lookout for some days to saG&#xD;
whether you return. If so, he will expect&#xD;
you ~by train. Coming by the boat, you&#xD;
may' escape observation. I will get all the&#xD;
information I can by the time of your ar-&#xD;
rival. tet me see; the next boat-"&#xD;
"But," interposed Nowell, "you said&#xD;
you were hire for a day or two. I can-&#xD;
not think, my dear sir, of detaining&#xD;
you.-"&#xD;
"I came to stay a day or two, but that&#xD;
makes no difference. I will write to my&#xD;
wife not to expect me until she sees me,&#xD;
and I think that, with patience, we shall be&#xD;
able to discover whether this man has had&#xD;
any connection with the outrage."&#xD;
"But why should you take all this&#xD;
trouble and inconvenience, my dear Mr.&#xD;
Lyndsay, when I can-"&#xD;
"Pooh, pooh! I would take five times&#xD;
as much, with pleasure, for little Francis&#xD;
himself;" said Mr. Lyndsay, laughing," and&#xD;
ten times as mueb for his father's son.&#xD;
Come, we'll walk down to Staples's office,&#xD;
and you can stay there a while, then return&#xD;
to dinner, and be off on the Augusta train.&#xD;
Where is the paper?"&#xD;
Nowell drew it forth from where he had&#xD;
placed it, saying, "I must make a clean&#xD;
copy."&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Lyndsay, smiling, as he&#xD;
glanced at the illegible-looking page; "I&#xD;
think you had better do so. I will go at&#xD;
once and see the chief of police, and will&#xD;
then meet you at Staples's office. You know&#xD;
his law-office, I suppose?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes."&#xD;
"It is now just twelve o'clock "-he&#xD;
looked athis watch-." when you have fin-&#xD;
ished writing, come down, and, if I am not&#xD;
at the office, wait for me."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE DOUBLE SEAL O~ BLOOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
WITH a sensation of positive wonder at&#xD;
the strangeness of the position in which he&#xD;
had been placed by the events of the day,'&#xD;
Nowell found himself, late that afternoon,&#xD;
whirling away from Charleston as fast as&#xD;
steam could carry him. He had consented&#xD;
somewhat reluctantly to Mr. Lyndsay's&#xD;
scheme,'and now he began to doubt whether&#xD;
he had not committed a great blunder in&#xD;
consenting at all. Young as he was, he had&#xD;
been accustomed for years to judge exclu-&#xD;
sively for himself; and the habit had natu-&#xD;
rally produced a certain degree of seif-confi-&#xD;
deuce, as well as self-reliance. He was now&#xD;
acting under the direction of another-&#xD;
rather in opposition to, than in accordance&#xD;
with, his own judgment. That spirit of self-&#xD;
accusation, which is always strongest in con-&#xD;
scientious natures, began to exhibit syxnp-&#xD;
toms of becoming a very unpleasant travel-&#xD;
ling companion-suggesting various, reasons&#xD;
why he ought not to have yielded to per-&#xD;
suasion instead of conviction, and number-&#xD;
less objections to the plan which he was&#xD;
~pursuing. 'But he was not a vain man; his&#xD;
mind was open to reason. So lie silenced&#xD;
the reproaching voice by addressing himself&#xD;
to a thoroughly impartial examination of&#xD;
the question, and it resulted in his entire&#xD;
approval of Mr. Lyndsay's views in the ma1~-&#xD;
ter, and perfect satisfaction with himself for&#xD;
having acceded to those views. Nor was he&#xD;
shaken in this opinion, when accident&#xD;
caused a considerable detention on his way&#xD;
-the train on which he traveled having&#xD;
been brought toa stand-still aboutfifty miles&#xD;
from Savannah, until the c~bri. of two&#xD;
trains-a freight and a gravel-.-~which had&#xD;
collided half an hour before, could be re-&#xD;
moved from the road.&#xD;
It was a work requiring severs1~. hours&#xD;
for its accomplishment, and theconsequenc~&#xD;
was, that the train was that much behind&#xD;
time, and the boat was gone when they&#xD;
finally reached Savannah.&#xD;
It was an annoying ehancO, and~ N6Well&#xD;
chafed not a little athis aliforced ina6tivity';&#xD;

&#xD;
but there was nothing for it but to wait fo&#xD;
the next boat. And this he did with whs&#xD;
patience he could command.&#xD;
Very glad he was when at last h&#xD;
stepped on board the Medora, and sti]&#xD;
more glad when he stepped upon the whar:&#xD;
at Charleston. Almost as he did so, hi&#xD;
arm was touched by a servant, who said in&#xD;
terrogatively, "Mr. Kowell?"&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
"Carriage waiting for you, sir, to brin!&#xD;
you to Mr. Lyndsay's. Where shall I fim&#xD;
your luggage, sir?"&#xD;
Nowell pointed to a valise which one ol&#xD;
the boat-hands was bringing after him.&#xD;
Driving hastily through the city to om&#xD;
of the suburbs, the carriage stopped befor&#xD;
a stately old house in a fine shrubbery-&#xD;
garden. Nowell was met at the front doo:&#xD;
by his host, with outstretched hand and&#xD;
words of warmest Welcome.&#xD;
'~ Any news for me?" cried the young&#xD;
man, as they shook hands heartily.&#xD;
"Nothing definite, but something cu-&#xD;
rious at least, in Ainslie's habits. Are you&#xD;
ready for breakfast, or will y~ou go to your&#xD;
room first?"&#xD;
"Thank you, I breakfasted on the boat.&#xD;
I hope you have not waited for me."&#xD;
"Yes; but no matter. Come in and&#xD;
keep me company in a cup of coffee; at&#xD;
least, aad I will tell you all that I have dis-&#xD;
covered. It is not much-it may be noth-&#xD;
ing-but I think it is something. The first&#xD;
thing I did after parting from you," con-&#xD;
tinued Mr. Lyndsay, as they sat down to&#xD;
the breakfast-table, "was to find out what&#xD;
I could. about Ainslie. My inquiries, of&#xD;
course, were conducted cautiously, and all&#xD;
that I learned of his character and habits&#xD;
looked fair enough. lie has been here but&#xD;
a short time, and does not intend to remain&#xD;
much longer; is much engaged with his&#xD;
man of business, making arrangements for&#xD;
a long absence in Europe and the East; is&#xD;
convivial, but not dissipated; very popular&#xD;
among the men he associates with; of good&#xD;
~ling at the club; very liberal in opin-&#xD;
ion,~ ~s ~the phrase goes; that is (as I have&#xD;
since ascertained), openly, even ostenta-&#xD;
tionsly, amnaterialist. On the whole, though&#xD;
the last item of information did not give me&#xD;
&#xD;
r much respect for his sense, there was noth-&#xD;
~t ing that would warrant a suspicion of his&#xD;
honor as a man of the world. I was disap-&#xD;
e pointed, I confess, and came home feeling a&#xD;
LI little crestfallen: rather inclined to the be-&#xD;
r lief thatihad sent you~onafool's errand,&#xD;
s and was engaged in the same myself. I&#xD;
- found my policeman waiting for me, having&#xD;
been detailed for special service by his&#xD;
chief, who put him at my command.&#xD;
"'Well, Mike,' said I,' I've got ajob of&#xD;
I work in your line on hand; and I asked&#xD;
your chief to let me have your services, be-&#xD;
cause I know you'll take trouble and do it&#xD;
well for me.' 'That I will, yer honor, de-&#xD;
pind upon it,' said he, and he listened very&#xD;
attentively while I gave him an outline of&#xD;
- your story, and explained what it was that&#xD;
I wanted him to do. I thought it best to&#xD;
make this expoai for two reasons: In the&#xD;
first place, if a man is trustworthy, it is well&#xD;
to let him see that you place confidence in&#xD;
him-he will work with much more zeal&#xD;
* and good-will, and he can, of course, work&#xD;
* much more intelligently, if he knows wh~it&#xD;
he is about, than if led blindfold; and,&#xD;
secondly, a gentleman who interests him-&#xD;
self in another gentleman's private habits&#xD;
ought to have a very good reason to allege&#xD;
for that interest. Mike listened very atten-&#xD;
tively and without comment, until I men-&#xD;
tioned Ainslie's name, lie looked surprised&#xD;
at that. 'What! do you know any thing&#xD;
about him?' I inquired. 'I see him going&#xD;
to mass every morning , yer honor. Sure&#xD;
and he's not the blaggard yer honor suspects&#xD;
of this villany?' 'You must be mistaken,&#xD;
Mike,' said I. 'The man I'm talking of&#xD;
don't go to mass, I'm sure*' But, onques-&#xD;
tioning him, I found that he was right It&#xD;
seems that he is on his beat, which includes&#xD;
part of Broad Street, in the neighborhood&#xD;
of the cathedral, at the hour of early mass&#xD;
every morning; and he says that for the&#xD;
last fortnight he has seen this man go regu-&#xD;
larly to mass when the weather was good.&#xD;
He noticed him first as 'a stranger who had&#xD;
the purtiest big brown eyes he ever saw"'&#xD;
-howell's glance lightened suddenly here&#xD;
-" and so much was the honest fellow&#xD;
struck with those eyes, and the apparent&#xD;
devotion of their owner, that he took the&#xD;

MABEL LEE. '&#xD;
&#xD;
trouble to inquire one day. of an acquaint-&#xD;
ance, when Ainslie was passing him on the&#xD;
street, 'who that gentleman was.' 'A Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie who lives in Rutledge Street,' he&#xD;
was informed. Mike was evidently as-&#xD;
tonished when I told him to attend mass&#xD;
himself the next morning, watch Ainslie&#xD;
carefully, and discover what he was there&#xD;
for. 'Why, av course. yer honor, hers there&#xD;
for what everybody else goes for, to say his&#xD;
prayers.' 'No, he's one of the gentry that&#xD;
don't believe in saying prayers, Mike. You&#xD;
watch him well to-morrow morning, and&#xD;
you'll find he don't go there to say his pray-&#xD;
ers, and, as soon as he leaves the cathedral,&#xD;
come and report to me.~&#xD;
"I waited, as you may suppose, very im-&#xD;
patiently for his appearance the next morn-&#xD;
ing. 'Yer, right,' were his first&#xD;
words; 'he don't go to mass to say his&#xD;
prayers.' As I had suspected, there was a&#xD;
lady in the case, but-don't fly off with the&#xD;
idea that this lady is your cousin, Francis!"&#xD;
he exclaimed, as Kowell started convulsive-&#xD;
ly, and changed color. "It may be-I hope&#xD;
it is Miss Lee-but there is no positive&#xD;
ground for the belief in the information ac-&#xD;
quired so far. Let me go on with my story,&#xD;
and keep quiet until you hear me out.&#xD;
Well, Mike went to mass the next morning&#xD;
-it was the day after you left, Saturday-&#xD;
and Ainslie duly made his appearance just&#xD;
before the second mass commenced. He&#xD;
placed himself in an obscure position that&#xD;
commanded a view of the door, and, a min-&#xD;
ute afterward, two ladies entered. Ainslie&#xD;
watched them as closely as Mike watched&#xD;
him, but did not approach them. When&#xD;
they left the cathedral, he did not follow&#xD;
them, but went at once to the Charleston&#xD;
Hotel, where he usually breakfasts and reads&#xD;
the papers, it appears-and Mike came to&#xD;
me. I asked if he had noticed the ladies.&#xD;
Of course he had. lie had seen all that was&#xD;
to be seen about them, which was not much,&#xD;
as both wore thick veils. But he was pret-&#xD;
ty sure that one was middle-aged, and the&#xD;
other young. I directed him to follow them&#xD;
the next morning and find out where they&#xD;
lived; and then dismissed hini in haste, so&#xD;
thaiPhe should not relax in his espionage&#xD;
upon Ainslie. He caught that personage&#xD;
&#xD;
with his eye, as he issued from the hotel,&#xD;
after breakfast, and dogged him successfully&#xD;
all day; saw him lounging in Russell's for&#xD;
some time; then he spent an hour or two&#xD;
in an artist's studio after which he took&#xD;
luncheon at an~eating-house, and went from&#xD;
there to the office of his man of business,&#xD;
where he stayed until he went to his club to&#xD;
dinner. After dinner he went~ to his own&#xD;
house, to dress for the evening, probably;&#xD;
and an hour or two before sunset he came&#xD;
out, and walked to a house in Legar~ Street.&#xD;
lie remained there only about half an hour,&#xD;
returning to Rutledge Street, where a horse&#xD;
was waiting for him. lie mounted, and&#xD;
rode off for a canter, apparently. Mike lost&#xD;
sight of him, of course; but learned that he&#xD;
rides every afternoon, lie returned at&#xD;
dusk, and entertained a party of gentlemen&#xD;
that evening. The next morning the weath-&#xD;
er was bad. There had been a rain during&#xD;
the night, and it was still cloudy and threat-&#xD;
ening. Either Ainslie nor the ladies ap-&#xD;
peared at early mass, but, as the day became&#xD;
clear immediately after breakfast, Mike&#xD;
hoped that they might attend high mass.&#xD;
He was disappointed in his expectation,&#xD;
however. Either they were not there, or&#xD;
he could not distinguish them in the crowd;&#xD;
and he failed to catch a glimpse of Ainslie&#xD;
during the whole of that day, though he pa-&#xD;
trolled Rutledge, Legar6, King, and Meet-&#xD;
ing Streets diligently. On Monday morn-&#xD;
ing he came to me jubilant, his game in&#xD;
view again-all three at the cathedral-he,&#xD;
had seen the younger lady's face as she&#xD;
crossed herself, and he had traced them out&#xD;
to the house in Legar~ Street. He described&#xD;
the lady's face as beautiful-"&#xD;
"Did ho mention the color of her eyes&#xD;
and hair?" demanded howell, eagerly.&#xD;
"She has blue eyes, he says. lie did&#xD;
not notice the color of her hair. I made&#xD;
him precede me to the street, and point out&#xD;
the house, which I know very wefl, as hav-&#xD;
ing been on lease for a good many years&#xD;
past. It belongs to a minor. I easily dis.-&#xD;
covered the name of the agent who has it in&#xD;
charge, and from him I learned that his ten-&#xD;
ant is, or calls himself, a Mr. Garland, who&#xD;
applied to him some time about the first of&#xD;
the month of June, to rent this house, say-&#xD;

MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing that he was in very ill-bealth-he's a&#xD;
sickly-looking man, the agent says-and had&#xD;
teen. recommended by his physicians to try&#xD;
sea-air. lie came to Charleston because he&#xD;
would have the benefit of a mild climate&#xD;
and good medical attendance~ as well as sea-&#xD;
air; expected to spend the fall and winter&#xD;
here, if the climate agreed with him; but,&#xD;
as he was not sure that it would, he pre-&#xD;
ferred to take the house by the quarter-of-&#xD;
fered to pay the rent in advance, and did&#xD;
not stickle at the price. It was a straight-&#xD;
enough story, and, as the house had been&#xD;
unoccupied for some time, the agent caught&#xD;
at the id~a of what promised him a good&#xD;
tenant. As a matter of form, he inquired if&#xD;
Mr. Garland would give him a city refer-&#xD;
once, etc., and Mr. Garland immediately re-&#xD;
ferred him to Ainslie's man of business,&#xD;
who, in reply to the agent's inquiries, stated&#xD;
that he had been instructed by Mr. Ainslie&#xD;
to render any attention and service in his&#xD;
pow4.~r to Mr. Garland, a particular friend&#xD;
of his (Ainslie's), and that, if the agent de-&#xD;
sired it, he would stand Mr. Garland's se-&#xD;
curity for the payment of the rent. The&#xD;
agent was' satisfied, the bargain struck, and&#xD;
upholsterers were set to work at once to&#xD;
furnish a few rooms, Mr. Garland explaining&#xD;
that his family was small, consisting of him..&#xD;
self, his wife, and an orphan niece. A&#xD;
couple of Irish servants were engaged- 1&#xD;
cook and housemaid-and put in charge of&#xD;
the establishment; and Mr. Garland, who&#xD;
remained in town for several days to en-&#xD;
perintend these arrangements, then left to I&#xD;
bring down his wife and niece, he said.&#xD;
The serva~its were to have every thing in&#xD;
readiness for their arrival about the middle&#xD;
of June, and at the time appointed, some-&#xD;
where about the middle of June, the agent I&#xD;
did not remember the precise date, the fain- ~&#xD;
ily made their appearance, and had proved t&#xD;
to be very quiet, respectable people. That I&#xD;
was all the information which he could af- f&#xD;
ford me. I asked him if the man was a gen- c&#xD;
tieman. He hemmed a little over the ques- c&#xD;
tion, and replied that really he couldn't say z&#xD;
as to that; he supposed Mr. Garland might e&#xD;
be considered a gentleman; he was, at all t&#xD;
events, a very gentlemanly man. t&#xD;
* "' My curiosity about his tenant evident-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly excited uneasiness in the agent's mind,&#xD;
which I dissipated by some excuse not worth&#xD;
repeating, obtaining from him a promise&#xD;
that he would not mention my having spok-&#xD;
en to him on the subject; and I think he&#xD;
will keep his promise. Mike has managed&#xD;
to gather up, from various sources, a few&#xD;
additional items of information as to the&#xD;
habits of the family, which are singular, un-&#xD;
questionably, Mr. Garland himself is a pro-&#xD;
fessed invalid, who never leaves the house,&#xD;
yet he has not called in medical attendance;&#xD;
the two ladies go out to church only, and&#xD;
generally to take a drive late in the after-&#xD;
noon; and do not see Ainslie when he calls&#xD;
at the house, he being the only visitor who&#xD;
does call, one of the servants told Mike, yet&#xD;
he haunts their movements at a distance.&#xD;
Decidedly suspicious all this looks, it seems&#xD;
to me. What do you think?"&#xD;
"That it looks sufficiently suspicious to&#xD;
justify me in taking out a search-warrant,&#xD;
and ascertaining by sight whether the young&#xD;
lady is not my cousin." He started up, as&#xD;
he spoke.&#xD;
"Stop, stop!" cried Mr. Lyndsay. "Sit&#xD;
down again, Francis, and listen to me. You&#xD;
must not be so precipitate. Before taking&#xD;
the extreme measure of bringing in the law,&#xD;
we must stand upon surer ground than we&#xD;
do at present. We must ascertain to a cer-&#xD;
tainty that it i8 your cousin; and then we&#xD;
3an proceed with the search-warrant."&#xD;
"But, meanwhile, Ainslie may take the&#xD;
miarm, and spirit her away a second&#xD;
~irne."&#xD;
"No danger of that. I have laid all the&#xD;
circumstances of the case before the chief of&#xD;
olice, and he has taken measures to pre-&#xD;
,lude the possibility of any further difficulty.&#xD;
?or two days past we have waited only for&#xD;
rour arrival, in order that you may identify&#xD;
he lady, If your cousin. In your name, I&#xD;
inve obtained the issue of warrants-one&#xD;
~a' searching the house, if necessary, the&#xD;
dhers for the arrest of Ainslie and his ac-&#xD;
ompilces. The house is watched day and&#xD;
Light by a police force competent for any&#xD;
emergency, and, at the first sign of flight,&#xD;
he warrants will be served and all the par-&#xD;
les detained."&#xD;
Newell leaned across the table, and, tak-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing Mr. Lyndsay's hand, wrung it hard.&#xD;
"How can I thank you?"&#xD;
"That ceremony is not needed between&#xD;
friends," interrupted Mr. Lyndsay, smil-&#xD;
ing; "so we won't waste time at it. There&#xD;
is one other circumstance which I have not&#xD;
mentioned. On Tuesday morning I went&#xD;
myself to the cathedral, and saw the young&#xD;
lady; and either imagination is deluding me,&#xD;
or she bears a striking resemblance to your&#xD;
uncle Lee. I knew him very well; and,&#xD;
though it is now about twenty years since&#xD;
he died~ the one glimpse which I obtained of&#xD;
that young lady's countenance has recalled&#xD;
his face to me as vividly as if I had seen&#xD;
it only yesterday. Nor is it the face alone;&#xD;
there is something in the general appearance&#xD;
which looks to me unmistakable-a family&#xD;
resemblance~ in figure, air, and movement.&#xD;
Still," he said, quickly, as he saw the eager-&#xD;
ness of Nowell, "I may be mistaken. The&#xD;
likeness may be merely imaginary, or it&#xD;
may be accidental. Such strange coinci-&#xD;
dences frequently occur, that I am afraid to&#xD;
indulge the hope that this terrible mystery&#xD;
is about to~be solved. The whole tissue of&#xD;
circumstances looks to me, I must say,&#xD;
extremely suspicious. Yet it is possible, it&#xD;
is even probable, that they can be account-&#xD;
ed for simply and reasonably. The man&#xD;
Garland may really be what he represents&#xD;
himself and there may be some love-affair&#xD;
between Ainslie and the young lady, which&#xD;
causes this apparent mystery."&#xD;
"But how do you account for the en-&#xD;
velope?" said Newell.&#xD;
Mr. Lyndsay shook his head. "That is&#xD;
the strongest point against Ainslie; the only&#xD;
one which, to all appearance, might not he&#xD;
explained away. And we cannot tell, even&#xD;
that-"&#xD;
"No! "exclaimed Nowell, "that cannot&#xD;
be explained away. The other circum-&#xD;
stances, taken alone, would scarcely be&#xD;
worth a moment's consideration; but, re-&#xD;
garded in connection with this, they make a&#xD;
case which I should not be. afraid to take&#xD;
before any court that ever sat."&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Lyndany, "contain&#xD;
your impatience for ten, or at most twen~&#xD;
ty-f~iir hours longer, and the mystery is&#xD;
solved." And he went on to explain the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DOUBLE&#xD;
&#xD;
~EAI~ OF BLOOD.                    ~139&#xD;
plan which had been decided upon by him-&#xD;
self and the police, for effecting this object.&#xD;
Nowell suggested a few alterations in the&#xD;
programme of proceedings, which were&#xD;
adopted, and then he was obliged to contain&#xD;
his impatience, as Mr. Lyndsay had advised,&#xD;
through hours that seemed.to him intermi-&#xD;
nable-the long, long hours of that long,&#xD;
long August day.&#xD;
The sun had set, and the short summer&#xD;
twilight was deepening ovei~ the earth, when&#xD;
a carriage stopped before a house in Legar6&#xD;
Street, almost in front of which two gentle-&#xD;
men had met, seemingly by accident, a few&#xD;
minutes before, and now stood talking to-&#xD;
gether in a low tone. They moved~ a little&#xD;
aside, without suspending their conversation,&#xD;
and, as it chanced, placed themselves very&#xD;
near the curb-stone. The driver having de-&#xD;
scended and opened the carriage-door, ex-&#xD;
tended his arm for the occupants to alight,&#xD;
and then one of the gentlemen, whose face&#xD;
was turned that way, for the first time&#xD;
glanced up. He saw a lady of middle age&#xD;
descend, and, standing upon the curb-stone,&#xD;
turn anxiously and offer her hand to an-&#xD;
other lady who was following her.&#xD;
"Thank you, but I can do very well&#xD;
with John's arm," said a sweet, clear voice,&#xD;
the first tone of which made Newell's heart&#xD;
give a bound that almost suffocated him.&#xD;
Before she spoke, before she had half&#xD;
emerged from the carriage-doe; lie recog-&#xD;
nized her! And if a shadow of doubt had&#xD;
still existed in his mind as to her iden-&#xD;
tity, it would have vanished when, on reach-&#xD;
ing the pavement, she threw hack her veil,&#xD;
and, the door of the house having been&#xD;
opened that moment by a servant from&#xD;
within, a broad glare of light fell full upon&#xD;
the face of Mabel Lee!&#xD;
Newell's arm was held in a vice-like&#xD;
grasp by his companion, and he was walk-&#xD;
ing rapidly down the street, when the mo-&#xD;
mentary rush of almost overpowering emo-&#xD;
tion ebbed sufficiently for bim to be conscious&#xD;
of what he was doing. They were near the&#xD;
corner of a street, and at the corner a man&#xD;
in plain clothes stood, who, slightly touching&#xD;
his hat, said, in a quiet tone:&#xD;
"Ready, yer honor I"&#xD;
"Ready," responded Mr. Lyndsay. He&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8069-00000073"/>&#xD;
140                          MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DOUBLE SEAL OF BLOOD.                141&#xD;
&#xD;
turned himself and Nowell, and they retraced&#xD;
at wore leisurely pace the two squares which&#xD;
they had just traversed so 'quickly.&#xD;
"You are confident of her 'identity ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Lyndsay, as they approached the&#xD;
house once more, speaking for the first time&#xD;
since they had seen Mabel's face. "Itwould&#xD;
not do to make a mistake, you know."&#xD;
"There can be no mistake," answered&#xD;
Nowell, with a composure which reassured&#xD;
Mr. Lyndsay as to his capacity of self-control&#xD;
in the coming interview. "It is my cousin?&#xD;
Mabel Lee."&#xD;
"Here we are. For God's sake, keep&#xD;
cool now, Francis, whatever occurs!"&#xD;
"Trust me, I will."&#xD;
They mounted the steps, and Nowell&#xD;
rang the bell.&#xD;
Some little time elapsed, and the sum-&#xD;
mons remained unheeded. Nowell rang&#xD;
again, this time with more energy than be-&#xD;
fore.. Still there was no indication of life&#xD;
within the house-no sign that any atten-&#xD;
tion would be accorded to their request for&#xD;
admittance. They heard the far-off tinkle&#xD;
of the bell, and knew that it must have been&#xD;
audible from cellar to attic of ~he house;&#xD;
but no other sound broke the stillness. Now-&#xD;
eli had extended his hand to ring for the&#xD;
third time, when the echo of rapid footsteps&#xD;
was heard descending the stairs, and coming&#xD;
toward the door. A bar was removed, and&#xD;
the door cautiously opened, rendering ap-&#xD;
parent the fact that there was no light in the&#xD;
hall; and a servant-girl demanded, in rath-&#xD;
er a scared tone of voice, what they want-&#xD;
ed. On hearing that they wished to see&#xD;
her master, she said he was sick-not well&#xD;
enough to receive any one; she knew he&#xD;
could not see them.&#xD;
"Tell him, my good girl, that two gen~&#xD;
tlemen wish to see him on very important&#xD;
business-bu~iness which cannot be put&#xD;
off," said Mr. Lyndsay.&#xD;
The girl hesitated, and wanted to argue&#xD;
the point; but Mr. Lyndsay'~ "We must see&#xD;
him," finally silenced her. She shut and&#xD;
locked the door, and they heard her run&#xD;
stumblingly up-stairs. She soon returned&#xD;
with the message that her master was par-&#xD;
ticularly unwell that evening, and could not&#xD;
possibly be disturbed. She was about to&#xD;
&#xD;
shut the door after saying this; but a strong&#xD;
shoulder forced it wide open, and a strong&#xD;
hand caught her arm, detaining her from the&#xD;
precipitate flight which she would have made.&#xD;
"list! not a word, Mary," whispered a&#xD;
voice which seemed not strange to her.&#xD;
"We don't mane to hurt you, my girl; but&#xD;
no noise, if you plase, or I shall have to put&#xD;
me hand over yer mouth." The speaker&#xD;
suited the action to the word.&#xD;
The girl struggled violently, but ineffect-&#xD;
ually, and, while she struggled, the door was&#xD;
shut quietly, and the next moment a stream&#xD;
of light was thrown along the hall and stair-&#xD;
case from a bull's-eye lantern , and she saw a&#xD;
group of men, the number of whom her ter-&#xD;
rified vision magnified indefinitely, mount-&#xD;
ing the steps, some in plain clothes, but most&#xD;
of them wearing the police badge. They&#xD;
moved noiselessly up the stairs, guided by&#xD;
the narrow path of light which their leader&#xD;
flashed ahead of him, until they reached&#xD;
the floor to which they were ascending.&#xD;
There the man who went in front paused for&#xD;
an instant and shut his lantern, ere he had&#xD;
advanced to a line of light that gleamed just&#xD;
before them, under a closed door. Opening&#xD;
this door, he entered, followed by Mr. Lynd-&#xD;
say, Nowell, and several policemen.&#xD;
The apartment, thus unceremoniously in-&#xD;
vaded, contained but two occnpants.;-a ca~&#xD;
daverous-looking man in dressing-gown and&#xD;
slippers, and the elder of the two ladies&#xD;
who had returned from driving a few mm-&#xD;
utes before., She was engaged in pouring&#xD;
out tea at a small table near which the man&#xD;
was sitting, or rather reclining, in an arm-&#xD;
chair. Both man and woman seemed star-&#xD;
tled, even terrified, at sight of the party be-&#xD;
fore them. The sallow face of the former&#xD;
became almost white, and his eyes had a&#xD;
glistening, staring look, very unpleasant to&#xD;
behold; while the latter dropped her hands&#xD;
to her lap, and sat, pale, trembling, and si-&#xD;
lent, with an expression of hopeless misery&#xD;
in her face.&#xD;
"Mr. Garland, I believe," said the officer&#xD;
of the party, advancing to the side of the&#xD;
man, who, at the sound of his name,'made a&#xD;
not altogether unsuccessful effort to recover&#xD;
himself, and replied, with an assumption of&#xD;
dignity:&#xD;
&#xD;
"That is my name. What is the mean-&#xD;
ing of this intrusion, may I ask?"&#xD;
"I have a search-warrant," answered&#xD;
the officer; "also a warrant for your arrest&#xD;
as an accomplice in the crime of abduction.&#xD;
This gentleman "-he pointed to Nowell-&#xD;
"has testified to his belief that the young&#xD;
lady who resides in this house, in character&#xD;
of your niece, is his cousin, Mabel Lee by&#xD;
name, who was forcibly abducted from her&#xD;
home on the afternoon of the 22d day of&#xD;
June last. You will produce the young lady&#xD;
at once, that his accusation may be either&#xD;
~substantiated or dismissed."&#xD;
The man's face twitched and worked&#xD;
convulsively, as he listened to this speech;&#xD;
and he seemed absolutely incapable of reply.&#xD;
He opened and shut his mouth once or twice&#xD;
in the effoitt to articulate, but no sound is-&#xD;
sued from the quivering lips. The officer&#xD;
waited patiently until he saw that there was&#xD;
no probability otT obtaIning an answer from&#xD;
him; and then, turning to the woman, was&#xD;
about to address her, when his attention,&#xD;
and that of all present, was attracted to the&#xD;
door, which had been shut after the entrance&#xD;
of the party, but which was now opened by&#xD;
the young lady, the object of their search.&#xD;
As if responding to the demand made a mo-&#xD;
ment before for her appearance, she advanced&#xD;
into the room, apparently without at first&#xD;
perceiving the goodly company gathered&#xD;
there, for, when she had proceeded but a few&#xD;
steps within the threshold, she stopped sud-&#xD;
denly, and regarded the group of men with&#xD;
an astonished and frightened look~ As she&#xD;
paused, Mrs. Garland started up, and, hur-&#xD;
rying to her, said, in a soothing tone:&#xD;
"Don't be alarmed, my dear. These&#xD;
gentlemen will not hurt you. Come with&#xD;
me and sit down."&#xD;
The girl caught the hand held out to&#xD;
her, and the two '~vere moving toward a&#xD;
sofa that stood in n recess behind the tea-&#xD;
table, when Nowell, who had been gazing&#xD;
steadily at her whom he believed to be his&#xD;
cousin, waiting for the moment when she&#xD;
would Bee and recognize him, planted him-&#xD;
self before them, barring their way.&#xD;
" Mabel," he said, "Mabel Lee!" and he&#xD;
put his hand on her shoulder, looking in-&#xD;
teutly, almost sternly, in her face.&#xD;
&#xD;
With a slight cry of surprise and alarm,&#xD;
she shrink from his touch, as from that of a&#xD;
stranger, lifted her eyes to his for an in-&#xD;
stant without a sign of recognition, and&#xD;
~then drew closer to her companion, on whom&#xD;
she turned a pitiably imploring glance, which&#xD;
seemed to ask what the meaning of all this&#xD;
was.&#xD;
Newell stood confounded. Mr. Lynd-&#xD;
say thought, "Humphl he has been mis-&#xD;
taken as to her identity. A fine business&#xD;
we~ve made of it! "-and the policemen&#xD;
were of the same opinion. The silence was&#xD;
broken by a sound something between a&#xD;
chuckle and a cough from the sick man who&#xD;
sat by the table.&#xD;
"I hope the gentleman is satisfied! " he&#xD;
cried, in a tone of undisguised triumph.&#xD;
"I hope he is satisfied! His cousin seems&#xD;
very glad to see him!"&#xD;
"Silence 1" exclaimed Nowell, turning&#xD;
with a look nuder which the man literally&#xD;
cowered. "Sir," he continued, addressing&#xD;
the officer, "there is some trickery here.&#xD;
This lady is my cousin, Mabel Lee__~'&#xD;
He stopped short-a quick shiver ran&#xD;
over his form-his face became perfectly&#xD;
colorless, and an expression of horror set-&#xD;
tled upon it. Sudden as a flash, while he&#xD;
Was speaking, and gazing at the averted face&#xD;
before him, the fearful truth burst on 'his&#xD;
apprehension. It~ was the face, the form,&#xD;
the personality of Mabel Lee which he&#xD;
looked upon; but the mind-it was not&#xD;
there!&#xD;
Nowell had entered this house prepared&#xD;
for any revelation 'which might await him;&#xD;
and, though he staggered for a moment 'un-&#xD;
der a blow so unexpected and so awful as&#xD;
the discovery of his cousin's 'condition was&#xD;
to him, he riillied' almost instantly. The&#xD;
'very intensity of the shock dnlled sensibil-&#xD;
ity for the time. He moved a little, so as&#xD;
to stand full before tho woman to whom&#xD;
Mabel was clinging.&#xD;
"How lon~g has she been insane?" he&#xD;
asked, in the tone of an ordinary question.&#xD;
"From the very~first,'.' she answered,&#xD;
without any attempt' to maintain a further&#xD;
dissimulation.&#xD;
"You mean from the day of her ab-&#xD;
duction?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8069-00000074"/>&#xD;
142                          MABEL LEE.                                                           THE DOUBLII~ SEAL OF BLOOD.                 l4~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Let her sit down."&#xD;
The woman led Mabel to the sofa, an&#xD;
liowell, following, stood before her, an&#xD;
again tried to make her recognize him.&#xD;
"Mabel," he said, very gently, "do yo~&#xD;
not know me ?...-.me, your cousin Francis I"&#xD;
She looked up at him with a painfa&#xD;
expression of bewilderment.&#xD;
"Will you not come with me to Con&#xD;
stance I"&#xD;
Something like a troubled ray of rec&#xD;
collection shone in her eye for an instant&#xD;
but faded then. She looked with the s~im~&#xD;
imploring glance as before to Mrs. Garland&#xD;
who had sat down on the sofa beside her.&#xD;
liowell drew a deep breath that sounded&#xD;
almost like a hiss. "Mabel," he said, witi&#xD;
an heroic effort of selI~compulsion-~--" Mabel&#xD;
have you forgotten Philip Conway?"&#xD;
At .that name, sudden life and light&#xD;
flashed into the blankly-bewildered face.&#xD;
"Philip!" she cried, springing to her&#xD;
feet, and extending both hands toward&#xD;
howell-" my Philip!" and she flung her-&#xD;
/ self into his arms with sobs of joy. "0 Phil-&#xD;
ip, have you come at last? 0 Philip, I&#xD;
never meant to leave you-did you think I&#xD;
meant to leave you ?-are you angry with&#xD;
me for going? I could not help it, Philip."&#xD;
Still clinging to ~his bosom, she lifted&#xD;
her face, all smiles and tears, to his; but,&#xD;
when she saw the countenance bending&#xD;
over her, she shrieked, tore herself from&#xD;
his encircling arms, and, hastily placing&#xD;
herself on the other side of Mrs. Garland,&#xD;
crouched against her, as if for protection.&#xD;
"It is~not Philip," she whispered, in&#xD;
an accent of heart-breajdng disappointment.&#xD;
"Philip! Philip! Oh, will ho neve~' come?"&#xD;
As. that cry of anguish pierced his ear,&#xD;
howell forgot his own anguish, and the&#xD;
bitter jealousy that was gnawing at his&#xD;
heart; he, cold man, usually so reticent of&#xD;
the least expression of commonest emotion,&#xD;
forgot the many and strangeyes that were&#xD;
regarding the scene with pitying interest;&#xD;
* and,. kneeling before the shrinking form of&#xD;
the sobbing girl, he gently laid his hajads on&#xD;
one of the arms which clasped those of Mrs.&#xD;
Garland.&#xD;
"Mabel," he said, in a tone sorrowful&#xD;
&#xD;
as her own had been, "Mabel, if you will&#xD;
come with me, I will take you to Philip&#xD;
Conway."&#xD;
The face which was pressed behind the&#xD;
shoulder of her protectress lifted itself&#xD;
eagerly, and she looked at him for a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Come with me, and I will take you to&#xD;
Philip Conway," he repeated.&#xD;
She shook her head. "He promised to&#xD;
take me to Philip," she said, with a shiver,&#xD;
"and he brought me here where Philip&#xD;
never comes."&#xD;
howell's quick eye caught sight of a lit-&#xD;
tle rosary and crucifix that hung from her&#xD;
girdle. He lifted it in his hand, and held&#xD;
it up to view, as he asked~&#xD;
"He did not, promise on this, did he?"&#xD;
" lie,~~ she said.&#xD;
"See, then-" he lifted the beads, and,&#xD;
bending his head, touched his lips to the&#xD;
silvercrucifix-"see! Ipromiseyouonthis,&#xD;
that I will take you to Philip Conway."&#xD;
Her face grew radiant. "I will go with&#xD;
you!" she cried, joyfully; and, as howell&#xD;
rose to his feet, she, too, started up eagerly,&#xD;
and then suddenly turned to Mrs. Garland,&#xD;
~who remained seated, saying, "You must&#xD;
come too "-repeating, as she looked again&#xD;
to howell, "she must come too. She is&#xD;
very kind to me," she added, with touching&#xD;
simplicity.&#xD;
Mrs. Garland burst into passionate weep-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have tried to be kind to her, God&#xD;
knows," she sobbed. Oh, sir," she went on,&#xD;
looking up at Nowell, with streaming eyes,&#xD;
"it was sorely against my will that I have&#xD;
had any thing to do with this wickedness.&#xD;
It was not my fault-and it was not so much&#xD;
my husband's as-"&#xD;
"Hush!" screamed her husband, in a&#xD;
tone of shrill rage and alarm. "Hush, you&#xD;
miserable fool! You have betrayed' your-&#xD;
self and me-take care that you don't go&#xD;
any farther. Don't answer a word-what-&#xD;
ever they ask you."&#xD;
"If it is Mr. Ainslie's safety you are&#xD;
thinking about," said the officer, with a sig-&#xD;
nificant smile, "your concern is unnecessary.&#xD;
We are perfectly aware that he was th~&#xD;
principal in the business; it was by watch-&#xD;
&#xD;
lag his movements that the whereabouts of&#xD;
the young lady was discovered. He is in&#xD;
custody by this time, and I will trouble you&#xD;
to come with us now. Here is the warrant&#xD;
for your arrest." He unfolded a paper, in&#xD;
a business-like manner, and laid it on the&#xD;
table beside Mr. Garland, who, at the words&#xD;
"he is in custody by this time," had thrown&#xD;
himself against the back of his chair with a&#xD;
gesture of despair, and shut his eyes; not&#xD;
noticing the remainder of the sentence. The&#xD;
officer, after waiting a moment, touched his&#xD;
shoulder, and said again, "I must trouble&#xD;
you to come with me, sir.&#xD;
The miserable man opened his eyes, and&#xD;
rose from his seat without a word, sullen&#xD;
and defiant in manner, though he trembled&#xD;
from head to foot. His wife, who, at how-&#xD;
ell's request~, was just leading Mabel from&#xD;
a scene which seemed to trouble and be-&#xD;
wilder her, left her charge and started for-&#xD;
ward, as she heard the last words, and saw&#xD;
her husband stand up.&#xD;
"For the love of mercy-for the love of&#xD;
God, spare him, sir," she cried, seizing the&#xD;
officer's arm with both her hands. "He is&#xD;
very ill-not able to go out. Leave a po-&#xD;
liceman here to guard him, and let him&#xD;
stay."&#xD;
"I am sorry for your sake, madam, that&#xD;
I cannot comply with your request," he an-&#xD;
swered civilly; "but my duty is plain-"&#xD;
"But he is very ill-indeed, indeed, he&#xD;
is very ill!" pleaded she, in an agony of&#xD;
entreaty. "He will make no attempt to&#xD;
escape. Leave him here at least till to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
"Hush!" said her husband, harshly.-&#xD;
"I suppose you do not object to my putting&#xD;
on my coat and boots I" ho said, looking at&#xD;
the officer with a sneer on his lip.&#xD;
"ho; put them on," was the reply.&#xD;
~b Will you come up-stairs?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Garland, in a tearful voice, going to his side,&#xD;
and trying gently to make him sit down&#xD;
again, "or shall I bring them to you here?"&#xD;
Bring them here.~~&#xD;
As she was leaving the room to do his&#xD;
bidding, she encountered howell in the&#xD;
passage just outside the door; and, suddenly&#xD;
remembering Mabel, looked inquiringly tow~&#xD;
ard him.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
"The servant has taken her to her&#xD;
chamber," he said in reply to her look.&#xD;
"Oh, sir, speak for my husband! "~ she&#xD;
exclaimed, in broken accents. "If he is&#xD;
taken out and has to go through all this&#xD;
excitement, it will kill him. The doctors&#xD;
have always told him to avoid excitement-&#xD;
he is subject to hsemorrhages-..and "&#xD;
Her voice was choked in sobs. howell&#xD;
remembered Mabel's artless testimony to&#xD;
this woman's kindness; he thought that&#xD;
every thing about her betokened sincerity,&#xD;
and he believed that she had spoken the&#xD;
truth when she affirmed that she had not&#xD;
willingly been concerned in the abduction.&#xD;
So he answered that he would try and&#xD;
induce the officer to allow her husband to&#xD;
remain in his own house, under guard, for&#xD;
this night; and, while she went on up-stairs,&#xD;
he joined Mr. Lyndany and the officer, who&#xD;
were talking together, and preferred his re-&#xD;
quest-explaining his reasons for making it.&#xD;
The policeman was not very easily af-&#xD;
fected by the woes of criminals' wives. He&#xD;
was accustomed to tears and protestations&#xD;
of innocence from such "parties," as he&#xD;
called them; he rather wondered at how..&#xD;
eli's credulity about the woman; and as&#xD;
to the man's ghastly looks, and reputed&#xD;
hannorrhages, he mentally pronounced that&#xD;
"all gammon." But, as Mr. Lyndsay sec-&#xD;
onded I'Towell's wishes, he condescended t~&#xD;
concede the point that the man should not&#xD;
be removed that night.&#xD;
"I'll just wait till German comes, and&#xD;
leave him in charge," he said. "He ought&#xD;
to have been here before this. I told him&#xD;
to come and let me know, as soon as our&#xD;
other bird was caged. Ah! there he i~&#xD;
now-" he looked toward the open door at&#xD;
which a policeman appeared, and beckoned&#xD;
with his hand. "Why, where's German?"&#xD;
he asked,, as the man approached and sa-&#xD;
luted. "I told him to come himself. You've&#xD;
secured the prisoner, I hope?"&#xD;
"He's safe~ answered the new.eomer~&#xD;
grimly, "but not just in the way we ex~&#xD;
pected. He resisted his arrest, drawled a&#xD;
pistol on German, and it went. oft' in the&#xD;
icuffie, and lodged a ball in his own lungs&#xD;
~or his pains."&#xD;
"Killed him?"&#xD;

MABEL LEE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, he's alive-but-"&#xD;
"What is that y~u say?" demanded a&#xD;
voice so close at the man's elbow that the&#xD;
latter gave a violent start, as he turned to&#xD;
the speaker, who had approached unob-&#xD;
served by any of the group. "What is that&#xD;
you say?" repeated Mr. Garland-for it&#xD;
was he-" who are you talking ~&#xD;
"About your friend Mr. Ainslie," re-&#xD;
plied the officer. "He was flourishing a&#xD;
pistol at my men who were sent to arrest&#xD;
him, and by its accidental discharge-you&#xD;
say, Davis-got shot himself?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, that was the way of it. We&#xD;
found him at his own house, at dinner with&#xD;
a party of gentlemen; and he came out to&#xD;
us, and, when Gorman showed him the war-&#xD;
rant, he turned a little white, but took it&#xD;
cool, and asked all about it, and said with a&#xD;
sort of a laugh that he supposed he couldn't&#xD;
refuse sich a pressing' invitation, but he must&#xD;
go up-stairs and change his dress, and that&#xD;
when ho came down he would 'pologize to&#xD;
his friends for leavin' 'em to finish dinner&#xD;
without him. Gorman went up-stalrs with&#xD;
him, and stood at the door while he pre-&#xD;
tended to be dressing ; but instead of that he&#xD;
was loading' a pistol and preparing' to jump&#xD;
out of the winder and cut for it. Gorman&#xD;
thought his motions was a little suspicious,&#xD;
and, when he seed him put out the light that&#xD;
was in the room, Gorman he run in and&#xD;
grabbed the bird, jest as he was about to&#xD;
~et himself down from the winder. He had&#xD;
a sheet tied to the iron hinge of the setter,&#xD;
~nd there's no doubt he mout have got away,&#xD;
if Gorman hadn't a bin too quick for him.&#xD;
He fout desperately and gev Gorman sich a&#xD;
squeeze of the windpipe as almost knocked&#xD;
him up. But the pistol it we~off in the&#xD;
tussle, and me, heerin' the report, run up&#xD;
and found him layin' in a heap, bleeding' like&#xD;
a beef, and quite insensible; and Gorman&#xD;
almost as bad off as he was,' and not able to&#xD;
speak a word by' reason of havin' bin&#xD;
choked half to death. He *as a gamecock,&#xD;
he was, that Mr. Ainslie, and no mistake."&#xD;
"Gorman is not actually disabled, is he?"&#xD;
"Well, no, sir. He sent me on to say&#xD;
he'd be here, shortly. Here he is now, I ex-&#xD;
poet. I hear somebody comm' up-stairs."&#xD;
The next moment another policeman&#xD;
&#xD;
halted at the door; and then, at a signal&#xD;
,from his superior, advanced.&#xD;
"Well, Gorman. You are not hurt, I&#xD;
hope?"&#xD;
"Not much, sir. But the job turned&#xD;
out different from what I could have wished,&#xD;
sir, and I did my duty faithfully; but Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie chose to make a~ fool of himself by&#xD;
resisting. He fought like a 'devil; and the&#xD;
end of it was that he's done for himself; as&#xD;
I suppose Davis told you."&#xD;
"Is he dead?"&#xD;
"Not yet. At least he was alive when&#xD;
I left; but the doctors think he won't live&#xD;
till morning.".&#xD;
Mr. Garland, who had stood with parted&#xD;
lips, and eyes distended by horror, turned&#xD;
as he heard the last words, as if with the&#xD;
intention of going back to his seat; but,&#xD;
before he had proceeded three steps, he&#xD;
stopped, reeled, and fell heavily to the fioor~&#xD;
They raised him quickly, and, perceiving&#xD;
that blood was gushing from his mouth, laid&#xD;
him down on his back upon the carpet,&#xD;
while one of the policemen ran for salt to&#xD;
,stop the hLemorrhage, and another for a phy-&#xD;
sician-those who remained busying them-&#xD;
selves opening his clothes, and rendering all&#xD;
the assistance they could. But the friendly&#xD;
aid, medical skill, the frantic grief of the&#xD;
poor wife, who came shrieking, and threw&#xD;
herself on the' floor beside the still form-all&#xD;
availed naught. The man was dead.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
THE WAGES OF SEN.&#xD;
Binur time had elapsed between the mo-&#xD;
ment when Nowell and Mr. Lyndsay, ac-&#xD;
coinpanied by the police, had presented&#xD;
themselves so unexpectedly in the drawing-&#xD;
room of Mr. and Mrs. Garland, and tht~t in&#xD;
which 'they had recrossed the 'threshold,&#xD;
leaving for the moment, as again its only oc-&#xD;
cupants, the man and his wife-the dead&#xD;
man and his wildly-sorrowing wife. The&#xD;
presence of death claims, from all but the&#xD;
thoroughly imbruted nature, a certain trib-&#xD;
ute of respect; and the party descended&#xD;
the broad staircase to the now well-lighted&#xD;
&#xD;
hail, with steps as noiseless, if not as&#xD;
stealthy, as those with which they had&#xD;
passed, not more than half an hour before,&#xD;
to the interview that terminated so tragi-&#xD;
cally.&#xD;
The work of the police was over. The&#xD;
facts of Mabel's presence and identity had&#xD;
been established, and there was no danger&#xD;
of further conspiracy against her safety, the&#xD;
wretched accomplice of Ainslie being dead,&#xD;
and Ainslie himself reported dying. The&#xD;
functionaries of the law left the house,&#xD;
therefore, encountering at the dooi~ the per-&#xD;
sons who had been sent by the physician&#xD;
to render the necessary services to the dead,&#xD;
while Mr. Lyndsay and Nowell paused&#xD;
under the hall chandelier, to hold a consul-&#xD;
tation as to the best means of proceeding&#xD;
now, with regard to Mabel. So impatient&#xD;
was Nowell to remove her at once from&#xD;
this house, that the united influence of Mr.&#xD;
Lyndsay's arguments, and the assurances of&#xD;
the maid (who had been summoned to as-&#xD;
sist at the discussion), that he might "fright-&#xD;
en the young lady into spasms if he showed&#xD;
himself to her again that night, much less&#xD;
asked her to go away with him," scarcely&#xD;
availed to prevent his making the attempt to&#xD;
persuade her to accompany him thence. In&#xD;
addition to the repugnance which he natu-&#xD;
rally felt to her remaining a moment longer&#xD;
under that roof; he feared what the effect&#xD;
upon her would be, if she became aware of&#xD;
the death of her pseudo4incle; and he was&#xD;
apprehensive that it might not be possible&#xD;
to conceal the fact from her. The maid,&#xD;
who seemed to be an honest and intelligent&#xD;
girl, thought it would not be difficult to&#xD;
do s~o. The young lady was not in the&#xD;
habit of seeing Mr. Garland often, she said;&#xD;
sometimes he did not leave his chamber for&#xD;
days at a time; there was no danger of her&#xD;
finding it out herself; and, of course, nobody&#xD;
would tell her; no-~she was not likely to&#xD;
be disturbed by the moving about which&#xD;
was then going on up-stairs; she slept a&#xD;
good deal, and very soundly, and had re-&#xD;
tired to bed at her maid's recommendation,&#xD;
immediately on returning to her chamber&#xD;
when she left the drawing-room.&#xD;
see nothing for it but to let her&#xD;
remain here to-night," said Mr. Lyndsay.&#xD;

"As she has gone to bed, rousing her again&#xD;
is not to be thought of. We will stay our-&#xD;
selves, Francis.-I dare say, my girl, you&#xD;
can show us a room on this floor, where we&#xD;
can remain without disturbing the house-&#xD;
hold in any way?"&#xD;
The maid courtesied, and opened the&#xD;
door near by. "Here is the dining-room,&#xD;
sir. I'm sure Mrs. Garland, poor lady,&#xD;
would make you welcome to stay."&#xD;
She took a box of matches' from her&#xD;
pocket, went in, lighted the chandelier, and,&#xD;
pointing out two sofas to the gentlemen,&#xD;
who had followed her, offered to bring&#xD;
pillows and coverings if they would please&#xD;
to sleep there. But Nowell would not&#xD;
listen to Mr. Lyndsay's proposal of remain-&#xD;
ing. He would stay himself; he said-he&#xD;
had several letters to write, and he could&#xD;
occupy himself with them, and get them&#xD;
off his hands that night. Mr. Lyndsay, he&#xD;
insisted, must go home.&#xD;
"If you have letters to write, it may be&#xD;
as well for me to leave you," said that&#xD;
gentleman. "I will return early 'in the&#xD;
morning, and we can breakfast together.-&#xD;
By-the-way, Mike is here yet, is he not?"&#xD;
he asked of the maid, who still waited.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"He had better stay, so that if you want&#xD;
any thing, Francis, he will be at hand."&#xD;
"I want something this moment," re-.&#xD;
plied :N~owell, "some writing-materials. It&#xD;
is a lucky chance that he happens to be&#xD;
here-I can send him out for them.-Tell&#xD;
him to come to me, will you, my good&#xD;
girl?"&#xD;
The maid disappeared, and Mr. Lyndsay,&#xD;
again promising to return early the next&#xD;
day, shook hands and departed.'&#xD;
The night was not very far advanced&#xD;
when Nowell sat down to write. His first&#xD;
letter was to Constance, and it was brief;&#xD;
giving her no definite information-scarcely&#xD;
a definite hope of the success of his search.&#xD;
He wished to preare her somewhat fbrhear-&#xD;
ing of that which h'e Imew she, like himself,&#xD;
would regard as a worse calamity than&#xD;
death itself-Mabel's insanity. "Do not,"&#xD;
he wrote, "be too sanguine of a happy re-&#xD;
sult to my search when I tell you that I&#xD;
have undoubtedly 'traced Mabel to this&#xD;

place; and do not be disappointed because&#xD;
I cannot now enter into particulars. Be&#xD;
satisfied for the present with knowing that&#xD;
I have made three certain discoveries,: First,&#xD;
that Mabel is here in Charleston; secondly,&#xD;
that she was forcibly abducted; thirdly,&#xD;
that I was mistaken in having suspected&#xD;
I'hilip Conway of being concerned, either&#xD;
directly or indirectly, in the nefarious busi-&#xD;
ness. Tell hir~z t4iis-and say that 1 am&#xD;
heartily sorry for having judged him so un-&#xD;
justly; and that I make the only reparation&#xD;
in my power, by asking him to join me here&#xD;
immediately. His presence wrn be of mate-&#xD;
rial assistance in the further prosecution of&#xD;
this affair; for I will not conceal from you,&#xD;
Constance, that there are still serious diffi-&#xD;
culties to be overcome. Accompany him&#xD;
yourself; but do not permit either my aunt&#xD;
or Mr. Seyton to come. Make what expla-&#xD;
nation and excuses you think best; but re-&#xD;
member, they must not come. And I en-&#xD;
treat that Mr. Conway and yourself will not&#xD;
be a moment in setting out. I will write&#xD;
by the next mail to Father Lawrence.&#xD;
"Your cousin,&#xD;
"FRANcIs NewELL."&#xD;
He did not wait until the next mail, but&#xD;
wrote at once to the priest, detailing at&#xD;
length what had occurred, as cautiously as&#xD;
possible, the deplorable truth, and above&#xD;
all, to expedite the departure for Charles-&#xD;
ton of his cousin and Conway.&#xD;
After sealing and addressing the letters,&#xD;
he went noiselessly to the head of the stair-&#xD;
case, as he had done many times before,&#xD;
since hin watch commenced, to hear if all&#xD;
/ was quiet on the floor upon which Mabel's&#xD;
chamber was situated. As he paused, lis-&#xD;
*      tending, the drawing-room door opened, and&#xD;
Mrs. Garland stood before him, and spoke&#xD;
*     in a subdued but calm voice.&#xD;
"I was in her chamber a few minutes&#xD;
ago, and she is sleeping as quietly as an in-&#xD;
Eant. Will you come in here, sir. ~ I wish&#xD;
to speak to you. Or, no-I will go down&#xD;
to the dining-room, if you don't object."&#xD;
"Certainly not, madam," answered&#xD;
Newell, though he was not a little surprised.&#xD;
lIe descended the stairs, and she followed.&#xD;
Newell placed a chair for her near the&#xD;
&#xD;
'table at which he had been writing, and sat&#xD;
down himself opposite. lie almost started&#xD;
when he looked at her face, now that the&#xD;
brilliant light of the chandelier shone full&#xD;
upon it, so worn and so ghastly did it ap-&#xD;
pear. l3ut she seemed perfectly composed&#xD;
in manner, and her eyes, though sunken&#xD;
and feverish-looking, were tearless.&#xD;
"You are surprised td see rae, sir," she&#xD;
* said, as soon as she had sunk wearily into&#xD;
the large chair that almost engulfedher thin&#xD;
figure. "You wonder that I can wish to&#xD;
talk to a stranger at such a time as this. I&#xD;
thought you would be anxious to hear all&#xD;
the particulars of-about your cousin; and&#xD;
-and-"&#xD;
Her lips quivered, and her face took an&#xD;
expression of such utter wretchedness, that&#xD;
Nowell withdrew his eyes from the sight&#xD;
with a sense of actual pain, wishing most&#xD;
devoutly that she had left him to his solita-&#xD;
ry watch, and adopted some other means of&#xD;
giving him the information which unques-&#xD;
tionably he was very anxious to obtain.&#xD;
Perhaps she divined this thought, for she&#xD;
controlled herself, and spoke in a firmer&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"I have been trying for the last hour to&#xD;
write what I wished you to know; liut I&#xD;
could not write. Have a little patience&#xD;
with me. I will be as short as possible. It&#xD;
is because I must do what poor justice 1 can&#xD;
to my husband that I make this explanation,&#xD;
sir. Ho was not as guilty as he seemed.&#xD;
When that man-oh, may God's curse light&#xD;
upon him!' she exclaimedwith rightful&#xD;
vehemence. "May-"&#xD;
"Stop, madam! " cried Nowell, hastily,&#xD;
with something like a shudder. He had&#xD;
been cursing Ainslie in his own heart, and&#xD;
as bitterly; but such words sounded to him&#xD;
horrible on the lips of a woman. "You do&#xD;
not know that the man is dying, dead by&#xD;
this time, in all probability."&#xD;
She stared at him incredulously.&#xD;
"It is true," he said, and explained&#xD;
briefly the circumstances of the case.&#xD;
Mrs. Garland was silent for a monwut.&#xD;
She leaned back and closed her eyes, ~nd a&#xD;
world of bitter thought was reflected on her&#xD;
sorrow-sharpened face. When sh~ spoke&#xD;
again, it was more gently.&#xD;
&#xD;
THEW&#xD;
"You were shocked at hearing me cur&#xD;
this man, but ahi if you knew what can&#xD;
I have to hate him, you would not wond&#xD;
at it. He, and his father before him, we&#xD;
the curse and ruin of my husband's lii&#xD;
Covington (Ainslie's father) persuaded hi&#xD;
to risk all his fortune in some speculate&#xD;
that turned out a failure. We were well 0:&#xD;
before that-almost rich-but my husband&#xD;
lost every thing, and had to go to elerkir&#xD;
for a support. He did not like it, and tli&#xD;
life did not agree with his health. W&#xD;
moved away from Charleston, and he trie&#xD;
one thing after another, without succeeding&#xD;
at any thing; moving about from place t&#xD;
place, very poor, and constantly g~ttin&#xD;
deeper and deeper in debt. Our children&#xD;
died one after another, and we ourselves&#xD;
were often on the verge of starvation. Bu&#xD;
still my husband was an honest man, an&#xD;
we were not altogether unhappy. It wen&#xD;
very hard with nie to remember that all on&#xD;
trouble was caused by the dishonesty ol&#xD;
Covington; for, though my husband neve&#xD;
would hear of it, I always believed, lik&#xD;
everybody else, that his speculation was&#xD;
cheat, and he himself a villain. Last Apri&#xD;
we were in Richmond, Yirginia, in ver~&#xD;
poor circumstances. My husband's health&#xD;
which had been bad for a long time, wa~&#xD;
getting worse every day; he was very mud&#xD;
depressed in mind; was out of employment&#xD;
and had not much hope of getting any worl~&#xD;
that he would be able to do. One day when&#xD;
he had been out hunting for a place, he&#xD;
came home looking in such high spirits that&#xD;
I was astonished. lie had his pocket-book&#xD;
in his hand, and he opened it and took out&#xD;
a paper which he held for me to look at.&#xD;
It was a check for five thousand dollars.&#xD;
When I asked him where in the world he got&#xD;
it, he told me that he had accidentally met&#xD;
young Covington-I mean Ainslie-on the&#xD;
street that morning, and, recognizing him,&#xD;
went up and spoke to him. Ainslie seemed&#xD;
very glad to see him, and invited him to&#xD;
dine with him at his hotel, and after dinner&#xD;
be questioned my husband, found out all his&#xD;
debts and ~diftlculties, and made him accept&#xD;
this cheek, which he said he considered 'a&#xD;
debt~.i~for that it was by his father's mis-~&#xD;
fortune, as lie called it, that 'Mr. Garland&#xD;

14'I&#xD;
&#xD;
se had fallen into these difficulties. He came&#xD;
se several times to see my husband, and per.&#xD;
er shaded him to move to Charleston again-&#xD;
re gave him a letter of introduction to his law-&#xD;
:e. yer, told him to take a holiday and recruit&#xD;
m his health for a while, and that when he&#xD;
)n himself came to Charleston he would find&#xD;
if' some place or some business for him. We&#xD;
id came here and went into a boarding-house,&#xD;
ig and, my husband's mind being at rest for the&#xD;
ie first time in many years, I~is health improved&#xD;
e rapidly, until he was almost well. I think&#xD;
4 it was some time in the latter part of May&#xD;
g that he received a letter from Ainslie, which&#xD;
;o was the beginning of all this sin and misery.&#xD;
g The letter commenced by saying that my&#xD;
n husband could do him a very' great fav~r-&#xD;
a confer an obligation on him for which he&#xD;
t would be everlastingly grateful; that ho&#xD;
ci and a young lady in Ayre had fallen in love&#xD;
t with one another~ but that her family would'&#xD;
r not consent to the match because they&#xD;
wanted her to marry her cousin, which she&#xD;
r was not willing to do. As her family&#xD;
a seemed determined to force her to it, she&#xD;
~ had agreed to elope with Mr. Ainslie; and&#xD;
1 what he asked of my husband was that he&#xD;
and myself would go and meet the young&#xD;
lady, and bring her to Charleston, where&#xD;
the marriage could take place. He wanted&#xD;
to do every thing in the most proper. man-&#xD;
ner; and Ire would like for the yonn~ lady&#xD;
to have a chaperone until they eoribi~be&#xD;
married. My husband saw no, hgm in&#xD;
the proposal. He said that if the young&#xD;
lady's family wanted to force her to marry&#xD;
against her will, why, that they deserved&#xD;
for her to run away; that they were fools&#xD;
not to agree to her marrying Mr. Ainslie,&#xD;
who was very wealthy, and the cleverest&#xD;
fellow that ever breathed. He agreed at&#xD;
once to do all he could, and insisted on my&#xD;
consenting to my part-though I was op-&#xD;
posed to it from the first. I never believed&#xD;
in runaway matches, for I never knew one&#xD;
that did not turn out badly. Several letters&#xD;
were exchanged, and my husband, at Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie's request, took this house and fur-&#xD;
nished it at his expense-..and, at the time&#xD;
appointed, we went in a carriage to meet&#xD;
him and the young lady. They were to&#xD;
come down the river in a skiff; and, sure&#xD;

&#xD;
enough, at a place called Morford's Landing,&#xD;
t think it was, we met them. The first I&#xD;
saw of thent, '~s I sat in the carriage on. the&#xD;
bank of the river, they were talking and&#xD;
laughing; and this did not give me a very&#xD;
high opinion of the young lady, for I&#xD;
thought that it must be a very frivolous girl&#xD;
who could be laughing in that way at such&#xD;
a timed While I was watching them, the&#xD;
skiff stopped at th~ landing, and then I no-&#xD;
ticed that the young lady looked surprised.&#xD;
We were not near enough to hear any of&#xD;
the cowitersation that followed, but I under-&#xD;
stood very well afterward what was the&#xD;
meaning of the strange motions she made.&#xD;
Once it looked as if she was trying to throw&#xD;
herself into the river. I began to be uneasy,&#xD;
and directed my husband's attention to the&#xD;
singular manner in which she was acting;&#xD;
but he only laughed, and said it was all af-~&#xD;
fectation-that she was oniy shilly-shallying&#xD;
to tease Mr. Ainslie. While he had been&#xD;
speaking, I looked ~away from the skiff, and&#xD;
when I turned to it again, I saw Mr. Ains-&#xD;
lie step on shore with the young lady in his&#xD;
arms. lie brought her to the carriage, and&#xD;
then I 'perceived that she had fainted. I&#xD;
was dreadfully alarmed, but Mr. Ainslie&#xD;
made light of it. H~ gave me a smelling-&#xD;
bottle, and told the driver to bring some&#xD;
water from the river with which he bathed&#xD;
her face. 'It is nothing serious,' he~ said.&#xD;
'She Isonly a little nervous. Her pulse is&#xD;
all right. Just get into the carriage, Gar-&#xD;
land, and drive off. I must hurry back, for&#xD;
I don't want to be missed.' All in a hurry,&#xD;
and, before I had time to think, we were&#xD;
"driving 6ff as fast as the horses could go.&#xD;
I was so much engaged in trying to recover&#xD;
the young lady, that I did not have my&#xD;
sen~ea fairly about me; But if I had them,&#xD;
lain afraid it would have done no good. I&#xD;
had no power to stop the carriage, or to do&#xD;
any tiling but reproach my husband." Her&#xD;
voice faltered here. "I am afraid I spoke&#xD;
very au~grily; but stillhe affected to think&#xD;
that there was nothing wrong. But, when&#xD;
the young lady continued insensible for&#xD;
morb titan a~ hour, he. grew very much&#xD;
alawxned~ too. He 'called to the driver to&#xD;
stop; 'but the driver did not hear,'or pre-&#xD;
tended that'h&amp;amp;did not. At last the poor&#xD;
&#xD;
girl moved, and drew a deep breath. I was&#xD;
rejoiced, and spoke to her, asking her how&#xD;
she was. But she did not answer. She lay&#xD;
in my arms and moaned; and once I heard&#xD;
her say 'Philip' in such &amp;amp; strange tone,&#xD;
that it made a cold chill run over me. I&#xD;
would have taken her back to her home;&#xD;
but my husband would not beau of this.&#xD;
Indeed, if he had been willing, we did not&#xD;
know what direction Ayre was. We must&#xD;
have driven ten miles when the carriage&#xD;
stopped again by the river, and we heard&#xD;
the sound of voices. One of them asked the&#xD;
driver if all was right, and he answered yes.,&#xD;
'Drive in, then,' said the first voice, and the&#xD;
next moment the carriage was driven into a&#xD;
fiat-boat, and we were going down the river.&#xD;
We had started from the place where the&#xD;
young lady was put into the carriage, just&#xD;
before dusk; and it was some hours into&#xD;
the night when we got on the boat. It was&#xD;
the most miserable night I had ever spent.&#xD;
I was sure that there had been some de-&#xD;
ception on the part of Mr. Ainslie; and I&#xD;
begged and implored n~y husband to sf~op&#xD;
the boat, and return to Ayre with the poor&#xD;
girl who lay moaning in my arms. He has&#xD;
since told me that he would have done this,&#xD;
if it had been possible-but that neither&#xD;
the driver nor the boatmen would have&#xD;
obeyed him, if he had ordered them to re-&#xD;
turn.. They had received their directions&#xD;
from Ainslie, and would not have listened&#xD;
to-"&#xD;
"One moment, madam, if you please,"&#xD;
said Nowell. "Were the ioatmen white or&#xD;
blacid"&#xD;
"They were white men. The driver&#xD;
was black-one of Ainslie's own servants."&#xD;
"Thank you."&#xD;
"All night "-resumed Mra. Garland,&#xD;
who spoke as if she were very much ex-&#xD;
hausted-" we were going down. the river&#xD;
'with the current. It was light enough for&#xD;
me to see thiS, though only the stars were&#xD;
out. At daylight, we left the boat, and&#xD;
drove to the house about a mile from the&#xD;
river, where breakfast was ready for us.&#xD;
When. we stopped, and poor Mabul was&#xD;
lifted out'of the carriage, she opened her&#xD;
eyes for the first time; and then. I s~lw that&#xD;
she was deranged. I nearly went deranged1&#xD;
&#xD;
myself I was so terribly shocked. So was&#xD;
my husband; but he made up his mind, by&#xD;
this time, that the thing had gone too far&#xD;
for us to turn back. I reproached him al-&#xD;
most franti ~a1ly; and he at last lost his&#xD;
temper, and answered me very harshly."&#xD;
She burst into tears. "In all our troubles,,~&#xD;
she continued, "we never had any serious&#xD;
disagreement. Kever-had he spoken to me&#xD;
as-as you heard him speak.to.night. But&#xD;
he seemed altogether changed, from that&#xD;
night. lie grew irritable and gloomy; al-&#xD;
ways ready to find fault with any thing I&#xD;
did. Sometimes he would be like himself&#xD;
for a little while; and he would then admit&#xD;
that he was as miserable as a man could be.&#xD;
lie suffered the most intense remorse. And&#xD;
yet, strange to say, he did not seem to feel any&#xD;
resentment, against Ainslie. I never could&#xD;
understand how it was that Ainslie acquired&#xD;
such an influence over him. It was not al-&#xD;
together gratitude for the assistance he had&#xD;
given-by which my husband was enabled&#xD;
to pay his debts, and feel, as he expressed&#xD;
it, a free man once more. lie seemed posi-&#xD;
tively to love this base, wicked creature. I&#xD;
believe the wretch himself was shocked&#xD;
when he came to Charleston, and found&#xD;
that his villanous plan of compelling Mabel&#xD;
to marry him could not be carried out.~&#xD;
lie never saw her but once in this house-&#xD;
the day he came first. Though he was told&#xD;
that she was insane, he insisted on seeing&#xD;
her; and I brought her down~ She shrieked&#xD;
and fainted at sight ot~ him; and I declared&#xD;
then solemnly to himself and my husband,&#xD;
that, if he came into her presence again, I&#xD;
would make a public confession of the&#xD;

which my husband told me, that he in-&#xD;
dulged the hope Qf her ultimate recovery,&#xD;
and expected to make her his wife. Hue&#xD;
plan was, that we should remain. in Charles-&#xD;

"~to. I am very anxious to call in&#xD;
&#xD;

of risking a discovery, that he would not&#xD;
have one for himself-though he has needed&#xD;
one," she added, sorrowfully. "1 have told&#xD;
you all this, sir, in the hope that it will&#xD;
make you think more charitably of my poor&#xD;
husband. Excepting in. this one instance,&#xD;
he never in his whole life wronged man or&#xD;
woman. He was a good man and an honest&#xD;
man. until this wretch that you think I&#xD;
ought not to curse led him astray; and the&#xD;
remorse which he suffered has, I believe,&#xD;
been the cause of his death. Oh&#xD;
would think as well as you can. of him! "h'-&#xD;
she clasped her hands passionately-.--" if&#xD;
you could forgive him!"&#xD;
"I will try to do so," said Nowell,&#xD;
gravely, "for your sake, madam. I thank&#xD;
you for the kindness you have shown my&#xD;
unfortunate cousin. Had she been with&#xD;
one who dealt less gently with her, she&#xD;
would have suffered even more than she&#xD;
has. And now you will be adding to this&#xD;
kindness, if you tell me what her precise&#xD;
condition of mind is. I have written for&#xD;
her sister, and-and the 'Philip' for whom&#xD;
she mistook me; hut they cannot be here&#xD;
for several days-"&#xD;
"Pray let her remain. with me until her&#xD;
sister arrives!" Mrs. Garland exclaimed,&#xD;
earnestly. "She is very much attached to&#xD;
me, and very docile to all my wishes. I-"&#xD;
"But," said Nowell, "at such a time as&#xD;
this-"&#xD;
"My husband is dead," she replied, in a&#xD;
hopeless tone. "If I can do the least thing&#xD;
in. repairing the sin into whlch he wan led,&#xD;
oh, give me the consolation, of doing It!"&#xD;
"But may not the discovery of-of what&#xD;
has occurred-be injurious to h~r V" he&#xD;
asked, hesitatingly.&#xD;
"She shall not knowit. Mary, the niai&amp;amp;&#xD;
you saw, is a good, trustworthy girl. When&#xD;
1 cannot be with her myself, Mary shall&#xD;
stay in her room."&#xD;
"Thank yQu~.~-.thank you heartily.-.-"'&#xD;
She did not wait for him torgnon with&#xD;
what he was abont to say, butt rose f~ebly,&#xD;

&#xD;
she bad furnished, he found ample matter&#xD;
for thought during the rest of the night.&#xD;
the Shortly after dawn, Mike appeared with&#xD;
information that "if his honor would&#xD;
stip up-stairs, he would find some water&#xD;
and towels that Mary had put for his hon- I&#xD;
or's use in the spare chamber, and cook&#xD;
was-" Nowell stopped him, when he had&#xD;
proceeded so far, and declined the hospi -1&#xD;
table attentions proffered, with an excuse&#xD;
that he was going out at once.&#xD;
He gave Mr. Lyndsay, while he break-&#xD;
fasted, a summary of Mrs. Garland's story;&#xD;
and they were about to rise from the table,&#xD;
when a servant announced that a messen-&#xD;
ger wished to speak immediately with Mr.&#xD;
Newell.&#xD;
"Show him in," said Mr. Lyndsay, while&#xD;
Newell's heart gave one bound, and then&#xD;
stopped still-for he thought of Mabel. But&#xD;
before he had time to start from his seat,&#xD;
a' respectable-looking servant entered- a&#xD;
negro man-who, notwithstanding his well-&#xD;
bred efforts to speak with conventional&#xD;
composure, was evidently out of breath.&#xD;
"I bring a message from my master, Mr.&#xD;
Ainslie, to Mr. Nowell," he said, looking&#xD;
from one to the other of the gentlemen.&#xD;
"What, is that scoundrel not dead yet?"&#xD;
cried Nowell, with all his natural brusque-&#xD;
ness. "What can he want to say to me?"&#xD;
He regretted having spoken so, as he&#xD;
saw the man's eyes fill with tears that were&#xD;
dried the next instant by a flash of indig-&#xD;
nant anger~ Scoundrel, Ainslie undoubted-&#xD;
ly was-but certainly he had the faculty of&#xD;
strongly attaching to him the affection of&#xD;
those about him.&#xD;
Without noticing Nowell's remarks, the&#xD;
man 'continued, coldly: "My master told 1&#xD;
me to say to Mr. Newell that he is dying, I&#xD;
and wishes very much to see Mr. Newell&#xD;
immediately."&#xD;
The two gentlemen exchanged glances.&#xD;
"Mr. Ainslie's carriage is at the door to t&#xD;
take Mr. Newell as quick as possible," said i&#xD;
the servant; and there was the very slight- ~&#xD;
est intonation of entreaty in his voice. But 1&#xD;
Newell's face had become hard and cold. t&#xD;
"He told 'me to be sure and bring lou, sir.' t&#xD;
He wants to see you very much," said the a&#xD;
man, addressing Nowell directly for the first,&#xD;
&#xD;
time, and openly brushing away the tears&#xD;
that again welled up into his eyes. The&#xD;
words were simple; but the tone. in which&#xD;
they were spoken made them persuasive.&#xD;
"I will go," said the young man-but&#xD;
very coldly. "What is the number of the&#xD;
home?"&#xD;
The carriage is waiting-"&#xD;
"I will walk."&#xD;
"No, no, * Francis!" interposed Mr.&#xD;
Lyndsay. "Take the carriage by all means;&#xD;
and go at once. He may have something&#xD;
&amp;amp;f importance to say to you. Don't lose&#xD;
time!"&#xD;
"At a gallop!" was the brief order&#xD;
given to the driver by the servant who had&#xD;
summoned Newell, as he sprang up behind&#xD;
the carriage. And his order was obeyed&#xD;
liberally. Very few minutes passed before&#xD;
the equipage dashed up to the door of&#xD;
Ainslie's house in Rutledge Street. The&#xD;
servant jerked open the door, tore down the&#xD;
steps, and rapidly preceded Newell into a&#xD;
large and lofty hall, up a broad stone stair-&#xD;
case, along a wide sky-lighted passage-way7&#xD;
through an open door, into a handsome and&#xD;
airy apartment that had, at first glance,&#xD;
nothing of the appearance of a death-cham-&#xD;
ber. The windows were all wide open;&#xD;
even the cobweb lace curtains-their only&#xD;
drapery-were drawn entirely aside to let&#xD;
the fresh air of the morning enter freely;&#xD;
end the sunshine poured in golden streams&#xD;
upon the India matting that covered the&#xD;
floor. Near one side of the bed was placed&#xD;
s small table, covered with scattered writ-&#xD;
ing-materials and a lighted taper, and at it&#xD;
i dried-up looking man sat folding and seal-&#xD;
a thick paper which needed no great&#xD;
~erspicacity to divine to be the dying man's&#xD;
ast will and testament. Two gentlemen, phy-&#xD;
~icians evidently, stood at the window most&#xD;
distant from the bed, talking in low tones.&#xD;
Newell paused one moment upon the&#xD;
lireshold, and then, his step attuning itself&#xD;
voluntarily to the stillness around, he ad-&#xD;
~anced to' the 'foot of the bed, and stood&#xD;
cooking down upon the man whose hand-&#xD;
he traitor-hand that had dealt him so bit-&#xD;
er a wrong !-he had grasped not a week&#xD;
go, in friendly greeting.&#xD;
There was nothing of the fearfulness of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
TIHE WAGES OF SIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
death in Ainslie's aspect; none of the pain-&#xD;
ful, often revolting ghastliness which dis-&#xD;
ease seldom fails to impress upon the poor&#xD;
clay of humanity. His face was very pale;&#xD;
and the brilliant eyes, that had made its soli-&#xD;
tary attraction, were closed; but the features&#xD;
were not sunken, and there was no disorder&#xD;
of garb, or disarrangement of the bed. He&#xD;
still wore the dress in which he sat down&#xD;
to dine the evening before, the removal of&#xD;
which had not been considered unavoidable,&#xD;
as the physicians had not believed it pos-&#xD;
sible that he could live an hour when they&#xD;
saw him first. And when he had tempora-&#xD;
rily recovered his sense, under the torture&#xD;
of being raised from the floor, while a band-&#xD;
age was passed around his waist, he had&#xD;
forbidden that his dress should be touched.&#xD;
They had l~id him on the bed, with a few&#xD;
folds of linen drapery thrown over the mid-&#xD;
dle part of his figure; and there he remained&#xD;
unmoving-sunk in a heavy stupor during&#xD;
the night, but rousing to full consciousness&#xD;
with the first rays of the morning sun.&#xD;
Very calmly he addressed himself to the&#xD;
task of setting his house in order. His law-&#xD;
yer was summoned, his will made, and then&#xD;
he expressed a wish to see Nowell.&#xD;
A strange wish Nowell thought it, as&#xD;
* he gazed at the impassive face for mm-&#xD;
utes before there was any change in it.&#xD;
But suddenly the eyes enclosed themselves&#xD;
-and his gaze was returned. And it was&#xD;
singular that the expression in the eyes of&#xD;
the two men, as their glances met, was iden-&#xD;
tical; bold, speculative, solemn, it spoke the&#xD;
thought which was in the mind of each-&#xD;
"Stricken by God!"&#xD;
Stricken by God. The bitter sense of&#xD;
wrong-the passionate desire for vengeance&#xD;
-which had been burning so fiercely in&#xD;
I'~owell's heart, ever since he had admitted&#xD;
the belief of Ainslie's guilt, seemed to&#xD;
shrivel and turn to ashes. He had thirsted&#xD;
for this man's blood: he had only refrained&#xD;
from spilling it, because he preferred the&#xD;
refinement of revenge which the disgrace of&#xD;
the legal penalty for his crime would in-&#xD;
flict upon Ainslie.&#xD;
And now!-&#xD;
It was in a tone more quiet than cold&#xD;
that he said, "You wished to see me?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes; I wishedtoseeyou.~~&#xD;
The voice did not seem changed-a lit-&#xD;
tle weak, perhaps-and there was a slight&#xD;
catching of the breath but its tones were&#xD;
natural. He turned his eyes from Newell's&#xD;
face, to the servant who was now standing&#xD;
close at the side of the bed opposite the&#xD;
table, and made a motion with his right&#xD;
hand, which was answered by the servant's&#xD;
bringing a goblet of ice-water from a mar-&#xD;
ble stand near by. Tenderly raising his&#xD;
master's head, the man held the water to&#xD;
his lips, and he drank. It refreshed him.&#xD;
His glance returned to Newell, and he&#xD;
spoke again.&#xD;
"Francis Newell, I sent for you to ask&#xD;
if you will grant a favor to a dying man V'&#xD;
"Say ~&#xD;
"Garland was my blind agent at first&#xD;
-imposed upon by a deception on my part.&#xD;
After lie discovered the nature of the act in&#xD;
which he was participating, his weakness&#xD;
of character, and partly his attachment to&#xD;
me, bound him to my services But in will,&#xD;
he is innocent. 'What I ask of you is, that&#xD;
you will not prosecute him-or permit him&#xD;
to be prosecuted."&#xD;
Newell did not reply. He was gazing&#xD;
intently into the eyes that met his own'&#xD;
steadily-and marvelling at the incompre-&#xD;
hensible character of the man who could&#xD;
remorselessly lead another into crime, and&#xD;
yet, at the hour of his own extremity, was&#xD;
capable of the generous desire to save him.&#xD;
He could not understand so contradictory a&#xD;
nature.&#xD;
Ainslie misinterpreted his silence:&#xD;
"You~ will not promise?" he said.&#xD;
"You have put aside the natural im-&#xD;
pulse for vengeance so far as to come at my&#xD;
call, and to hold your hand from anticipat-&#xD;
ing death's stroke upon me-and yet-.&#xD;
But perhaps you came to gloat over the&#xD;
spectacle of my miserable end?&#xD;
"No-I did not come for that."&#xD;
"For what, then?"&#xD;
" Because you requested my pres-&#xD;
ence."&#xD;
"Francis Newell, you call yourself a&#xD;
Christian man!"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I have never been a Christian. I&#xD;

have acknowledged no God save my owi&#xD;
will But now, In this moment when I&#xD;
stand upon the thre~hoJd of eternity, I be&#xD;
lieve that there is a God..-the God whoix&#xD;
you profess to worship!" He was silent&#xD;
for a minute-the catching in his VOiCE&#xD;
having become more frequent and audible&#xD;
"Do not think I make this declaration te&#xD;
buy off from the devil. I am sufficient.&#xD;
iy acquainted with the teachings of your&#xD;
priests ~to know that hypocrisy is not con-&#xD;
trition. I speak sincerely: I believe that&#xD;
there is a God 1-and 1 adjure you, in the&#xD;
name, 9nd by the precepts of that God, for-&#xD;
give this man!"&#xD;
"Jie shall not be prosecuted."&#xD;
Almost involuntarily, Kowell spoke&#xD;
thus. The dying man's solemn appeal had&#xD;
affeot@d and softened him. He would not,&#xD;
he thought, add one more pang to the bit-&#xD;
terness of death; he would be mercifully&#xD;
silent respecting Garland.&#xD;
Ainslie did not speak in reply-but&#xD;
those marvelously beautiful eyes grew&#xD;
bright and soft with a gleam of gratitude&#xD;
and pleasure; and, then he closed them&#xD;
wearily, as if exhausted. But he said,&#xD;
fai~4ly:&#xD;
In a little time he opened his eyes again,&#xD;
and joked uneasily, to 8ee if L{owell was&#xD;
still there. Observing this, the servant&#xD;
brpu~ht a chair, and Nowell sat down.&#xD;
B~t r~rte~ passed in dead silence; and he&#xD;
was beginning to feel vague apprehensions&#xD;
about Mabel-doubts whether it was right&#xD;
for him to risk remaining any longer from&#xD;
her. lie looked at Ainslie's face. Per-&#xD;
haps he b&amp;amp;d again sunk into stupor. The&#xD;
breath, he perceived, was now very short.&#xD;
H~ had ql~nost decided that to wait longer&#xD;
wa~ sqperfluous-that he wonld at least&#xD;
c~psiilt tl~.a physicians, who were still ii&#xD;
the reom, whether it wa~ probable that&#xD;
ther* would be a further rallying of the obvi-&#xD;
ou~1y failing spark of life. As he thought&#xD;
~hi~ there's was a slight quivering of the&#xD;
eyelids, and they liftedalowly, and the eyes&#xD;
p~ioe .ought his face.&#xD;
"There was more-that I wished to say&#xD;
-but---."&#xD;
Re paused, t~nd rested for a moment&#xD;
&#xD;
-his voice had become very weak and un.&#xD;
certain, When he resumed, he spoke slowly,&#xD;
and with long pauses.&#xD;
"I am not so remorseless a villain-as&#xD;
you perhaps think. Sinful my life has been&#xD;
-but never dishonorable, in a worldly sense&#xD;
-until this crime stained it-I loved her-&#xD;
and she was the first-who ever resisted&#xD;
my power-to attract. It was a gift with&#xD;
me-the power of fascinating whom I would&#xD;
-man or woman. Even yourself-while&#xD;
you hated Conway, you almost liked me.&#xD;
She alone defied me-~and I swore to con-&#xD;
quer her. But I failed-and, step by step-&#xD;
my passion led me on-until it finally cul-&#xD;
minated-in this outrage. Perhaps you&#xD;
would-not believe me-if I told you that&#xD;
the remorse-which I have suffered-in see-&#xD;
ing her as she is-"&#xD;
He closed his eyes. An expression of&#xD;
intolerable pain convulsed his face. "And&#xD;
Conway-if he had not said-that he could&#xD;
not ask her to be, his wife-I would not&#xD;
have wronged him so."&#xD;
Again the lids sank heavily; and thee.&#xD;
was a silence of some minutes. Then, with&#xD;
a last effort, he looked up.&#xD;
"Tell, Conway-I-am-sorry."&#xD;
The light went suddenly out of the&#xD;
brown eyes. The erring soul was gone.&#xD;
-4.----&#xD;
CEAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
THE EVIL THAT MEN DO LiVES AFTEE&#xD;
THEM.&#xD;
Tnn sensation which Nowell's letter.&#xD;
caused ii~ Ayre, was something almost be-&#xD;
yond description, and quite beyond prece-&#xD;
dent. Never before had any thing occurred&#xD;
which so profou~d4y shocked and interested&#xD;
the whole eomm~nity-as, indeed, it might&#xD;
have shocked a much larger colninunity,&#xD;
seeh~g that the day of sensational horrors&#xD;
had not yet 4aw~ied upon that quiet region&#xD;
of country. Then, of all people, ~abel Lee&#xD;
was nearest the popular heart, and that she&#xD;
should have been singled out for such a fate&#xD;
seemed to Ayre aitnost too hard an4 ter~&#xD;
rible for l~elief. Not that they knew ranch&#xD;
&#xD;
about her as yet. Mr. Seyton and Con-&#xD;
stance had left immediately on the recep-&#xD;
tion of Nowell's letter, and Mrs. Lee had&#xD;
followed as soon as she was able to travel;&#xD;
the immediate friends of the family were re-&#xD;
ticent, and the newspapers seemed to be&#xD;
muzzled. Altogether, Ayre was in a state&#xD;
of uncomfortably indefinite and seething cu-&#xD;
riosity, which did not improve or obtain&#xD;
much gratification as the days went by.&#xD;
A good many of these days had gone by,&#xD;
when, having taken dinner, Mr. Blake sat&#xD;
down on his piazza one afternoon to smoke&#xD;
a pipe of rather gloomy contemplation. His&#xD;
thoughts were, of course, full of the topic&#xD;
which filled all thoughts just then, when&#xD;
the whoops of two or three little negroes&#xD;
caused him to look up, and he saw a horse-&#xD;
man enterin~ the gate. Something in the&#xD;
figure, and something in the horse~, took him&#xD;
baek at once to the May afternoon when he&#xD;
first met Philip Conway at the cross-roads&#xD;
-then in another moment he saw that it&#xD;
was Conway himself. With something of a&#xD;
stdrt, he took the pipe from his mouth, and&#xD;
walked toward the steps. By the time he&#xD;
reached them, the other had cantered for-&#xD;
ward, and they met face to face. Their greet-&#xD;
ings were usually formal; but, for the first&#xD;
time, Blake held out his hand voluntarily.&#xD;
"How are you, Mr. Conway?" he said.&#xD;
"I'm glad to see you back-but, good Heav-&#xD;
ens, sir, how badly you look!"&#xD;
"Do I?" said Conway, shortly. "There's&#xD;
reason enough for it, since I have ridden al-&#xD;
most constantly-sparing neithermyself nor&#xD;
my horse-since I received my uncle's let-&#xD;
ter. Will you have him looked after, if you&#xD;
please? lam very sorry to have been forced&#xD;
totreat him so.~&#xD;
Mr. Blake gave a low whistle as he&#xD;
looked at the horse, who 'stood by the steps,&#xD;
with his head down, his nostrils distended,&#xD;
his flanks still quivering from prolonged ex-&#xD;
ertion, and his whole air one of spent ex-&#xD;
haustion.&#xD;
"You must have ridden like the devil,&#xD;
sir," he said.&#xD;
"I felt like the devil," was the curt re-&#xD;
ply. "But I am sorry for Ma~eppa. Poor&#xD;
~ollow, he did his best. Will you have him~&#xD;
put up, and furnish me another mount?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Another one? You surely are not&#xD;
thinking of going on this afternoon, sir?"&#xD;
"I an~going on in en hour, Send over&#xD;
to the House for Black Tom. He has a bet-&#xD;
ter bottom than any other horse on the plan-&#xD;
tation, I believe. In the mean time, I will&#xD;
be glad if you wrn give me something to&#xD;
eat."&#xD;
"Certainly, sir. But won't you have a&#xD;
drop or two of brandy first?"&#xD;
"I never travel without it, and I have&#xD;
a flask half full in my pocket now."&#xD;
"Takeaseat, then, sir, while Isee about&#xD;
the horse. You look dreadfully fagged!"&#xD;
lie pushed a chair forward as he speke,&#xD;
and, almost unconsciously, Conway sank in~&#xD;
to it. After Mazeppa had been led away,&#xD;
and Mr. Blake himself was gone, he still sat~&#xD;
quite motionless-the relaxation of intense&#xD;
fatigue in every limb, but something beyond&#xD;
fatigue, something which still had power to&#xD;
goad the sinking body into action, burn-&#xD;
ing in his eyes. Even during this brief rest,&#xD;
the desire to be moving toward his goal&#xD;
was apparent. Even while the body was&#xD;
sunk in this deep inertia, the will was urg-&#xD;
ing to action, and torturing with the thought&#xD;
of all that was yet to be done. More than&#xD;
once the slight, muscular hands clinched&#xD;
themselves as if they were already on a hu-&#xD;
man throat, and the black brows knitted&#xD;
into ominous frowns. Can you wonder?&#xD;
There are some wrongs that rend away, like&#xD;
flimsy veils, all the conventionalities with&#xD;
which it has pleased civilization to drape the&#xD;
life of man, leaving bare the naked human&#xD;
nature with all its savage instincts, which&#xD;
may be tolerably well repressed, but have&#xD;
never yet been uprooted. And it was a&#xD;
wrong of this sort that Conway was smart-&#xD;
ing under noW-a wrong that might have&#xD;
made the very meekest turn in deadly&#xD;
wrath; and a wrong that left n~ hope of&#xD;
redress, or thought of consolation, save only&#xD;
that bitter-sweet ~no of revenge. The rob-&#xD;
bery was deep enough, and black eRe~gb,&#xD;
in itself; but jime betrayal which ~ccorn.-&#xD;
panied it was, if anything, even worse: ~4&#xD;
between the twe, his heart war a e.sId~~n 4&#xD;
such fierce passion as it would fare ill with&#xD;
the most of us if we could even imagine.&#xD;
Fortunately, not many of us can-fortunate-&#xD;

&#xD;
ly, such provocation is not often-given, even&#xD;
on this wicked earth-but, if it were, we&#xD;
too might learn that sometimes, at least, the&#xD;
divine~pr~oept of forgiveness is spoken pnto&#xD;
deaf ears.&#xD;
After a while, Mr. Blake came back, and&#xD;
found his guest in precisely the same posi-&#xD;
tion in which he had left him.&#xD;
"I have sent -to the House for Black&#xD;
Tom, air," he said; "and he will be here&#xD;
shortly. I have been seeing them rub down&#xD;
the chestnut, and he seems a good deal bet-&#xD;
ter already. Dinner is ready: will you&#xD;
walk in?"&#xD;
During dinner, Conway made his first&#xD;
and only approach to the subject of which&#xD;
- -    both their thoughts were full, by asking if&#xD;
any thing had been heard from ~Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
Blake shook !iis head.&#xD;
"Nothing whatever, sir. Mrs. Lee went&#xD;
*   down - the other day; but I suppose you&#xD;
have heard that?"&#xD;
"No; how should I? I passed through&#xD;
Ayre, it is true; but I had no disposition to&#xD;
ask questions. Who went down with her?"&#xD;
" Father Lawrence, sir.~,&#xD;
And that was literally all that was said.&#xD;
After dinner Black Tom was brought out,&#xD;
declining the longer rest which his host&#xD;
urged, Conway took his departure. They&#xD;
had shaken hands, and he was in the saddle,&#xD;
when Blake stopped him and spoke ab-&#xD;
ruptly.&#xD;
" One moment, Mr. Conway. I must do&#xD;
one thing, sir, before we part-I must beg&#xD;
your pardon for all the suspicion I have felt&#xD;
against you. I never liked you from the&#xD;
start, sfr, and I was only too ready to believe&#xD;
any wrong of you. I see how mistaken I&#xD;
was. And I-I beg your pardon. It's all I&#xD;
can do."&#xD;
"It is more than enough," said Conway.&#xD;
"Pahaw, man !-do you think I minded&#xD;
your ~us~ieion ?-you spoke it out honestly,&#xD;
and I 1ieverre~eiited it' twen' f~r amo~nent.&#xD;
Indeed, I rather liked you the better for it,&#xD;
since it showed your love for her. If that&#xD;
i~all-youihave to say, don't keep me here to&#xD;
sayit now."&#xD;
"It isn't all," said Blake, catching at his&#xD;
bridle ~s he was turning away, I'm an old&#xD;
man, sir, and I've loved her longer than you&#xD;
&#xD;
have, so I have a right to say this: Take&#xD;
care what you do. Wrong was never yet&#xD;
mended by wrong, and-"&#xD;
"Let me go 1" said Conway, between&#xD;
his teeth. "Do you think I can wait here&#xD;
to be preached to on a subject like this?&#xD;
No, wrong was never yet mended, but it&#xD;
can be avenged-and that is what it shall&#xD;
be! Stand out of the way."&#xD;
Blake stood out of the way sorrowfully&#xD;
enough, and watched him ride out of sight.&#xD;
Then he drew his hand slowly across his&#xD;
eyes, and went back into the house, mutter-&#xD;
ing a verse that came to his memory with&#xD;
sudden force:&#xD;
"'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith&#xD;
the Lord.'"&#xD;
When Conway reached Charleston, the&#xD;
first person whom he met was Mr. Sexton;&#xD;
Blake had given him the name of the hotel&#xD;
where the latter was to be found; and, going&#xD;
there, he was shown at once to his room.&#xD;
It was vacant, but he had not long to wait&#xD;
before its occupant came in.&#xD;
"Phil! my dear boy," he said, holding&#xD;
out his hand to the travel-stained figure&#xD;
who rose to meet him. "I did not expect&#xD;
you for some days yet. How quickly you&#xD;
have come!"&#xD;
"I have travelled almost without draw-&#xD;
ing rein," Conway answered, "and Iha~e&#xD;
not heard a word of news. Sir-how is&#xD;
she?"    -       -&#xD;
Mr. Seyton shook his head sadly.&#xD;
"There is no change, my boy-they give&#xD;
us no hope of any. She is perfectly mild&#xD;
and gentle, but absolutely insane. She asks&#xD;
for you constantly, and sometimes takes even&#xD;
me for you. Will you go to her now?"&#xD;
Pale as Conway had been before, he&#xD;
grew yet paler at that request, and raised&#xD;
his hand with a quick gesture of silence and&#xD;
refusal.&#xD;
"I could not bear it," he said, huskily.&#xD;
"I dare not-..-yet. If I saw her first, I&#xD;
should not be a man but a tiger, and I have&#xD;
something to do which must be done within&#xD;
conventional bounds, at least. Sir, don't&#xD;
speak to me of her, but tell me at once&#xD;
where lie "-~the dark brows met, and the&#xD;
dark eyes quivered and glowed-" is to be&#xD;
found!"&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Seyton started, and looked at him&#xD;
for a moment before he spoke.&#xD;
"Do you mean Ainslie?" he asked, at&#xD;
last.&#xD;
"Whom else should I mean?" answered&#xD;
the other, fiercely. "Tell me, sir-tell me&#xD;
at once. I am on fire till I have seen him,&#xD;
and taken revenge!"&#xD;
Mr. Seyton came a step nearer, and laid&#xD;
his hand down on the shoulder that shook&#xD;
with passion beneath his touch.&#xD;
"That has been moved out of your&#xD;
hands," he said, solemnly. "Ainslie is&#xD;
dead."&#xD;
"Come in," said Constance, gently, as&#xD;
Mr. Seyton paused at the door of her sitting-&#xD;
room, with Conway beside him. "She is&#xD;
sleeping now, but I will waken her. Come&#xD;
m.&#xD;
'KNo-don't waken her," said Conway,&#xD;
coming forward; and then he suddenly&#xD;
stopped-for there, on a low couch beneath&#xD;
one of the windows, Mabel lay before him.&#xD;
She had apparently fallen asleep in the&#xD;
midst of some trifling employment, for one&#xD;
hand still held a piece of needle-work; but&#xD;
her attitude was that of profound repose,&#xD;
as well as perfect grace. H&amp;amp;r head was&#xD;
somewhat thrown back, and the light&#xD;
streamed down softly through the green&#xD;
blinds, over her upturned face-the face&#xD;
whose bloom was almost as bright as on the&#xD;
morning when he told her that she looked&#xD;
more like Aurora than Titania. Her fair&#xD;
arms and neck gleamed like marble through&#xD;
the thin muslin which covered them; and&#xD;
her rich golden curls lay in glittering pro-&#xD;
fusion over the dark sofa-cushions. Some-&#xD;
thing in the attitude and scene-different&#xD;
though both were-reminded Conway of&#xD;
the night when he had seen her thrown into&#xD;
mesmeric slumber; and he turned to Con-&#xD;
stance, who had risen and stood near him.&#xD;
"You are sure it is a natural sleep?" he&#xD;
said. "She looks almost as if she were mag- I&#xD;
netized." s&#xD;
"It is entirely natural," Constance an-&#xD;
swered. "Speak to her, if you wish to&#xD;
know-she wakes very easily."          r&#xD;
lie approached the sofa and knelt down s&#xD;
by it. She looked so saint-like, in her v&#xD;
youth and beauty, that for a moment he .1&#xD;
&#xD;
Jill Ii1VJ~ Ai~i'I~d6 T1ii~M.       155&#xD;
held his breath before he spoke. Then he&#xD;
uttered only one word-&#xD;
"Mabel!"&#xD;
Instantly she opened her eyes. For a&#xD;
moment she looked at him, as if h~ilf uncer-&#xD;
tain who or what he was. Then the mist&#xD;
of doubt cleared away. A smile came to&#xD;
her lips-a sweet, bright smile-but no ex-&#xD;
clamation broke from them. She only held&#xD;
out her hand, and, as he clasped it in both&#xD;
his own, she said, quietly:&#xD;
"You have come ~at last! I knew you&#xD;
would-but, 0 Philip, what a long time&#xD;
it has been!"&#xD;
"Very long, my love, very long!" he&#xD;
murmured, brokenly. "But it shall never&#xD;
be again. I am with you now-now and&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
"Forever! "she repeated, with the same&#xD;
smile, but with a wandering in her eyes,&#xD;
that showed at once her malady. "Forever&#xD;
.-.ah, yes, I know. We said that long ago,&#xD;
down by the river, did we not? I have not&#xD;
forgotten my lesson, Philip. I have been&#xD;
waiting for you, to say it to you. The other&#xD;
Philip-there was another Philip, was there&#xD;
not?" she asked, with a troubled look com-&#xD;
ing over the brightness of her face. "lie&#xD;
has not been here in a long time, either.&#xD;
But 4here was another Philip, was there&#xD;
not? "&#xD;
"Yes, yes," he said, hastily-" there&#xD;
was another. But you were talking of me.&#xD;
What was it you want ~d to say to me ~"&#xD;
"My lesson," she repeated. "I have&#xD;
aever forgotten it-never~ The ether Phil-&#xD;
ip was very kind and good to me, but he&#xD;
sras not you; and I would not say it to him.&#xD;
said it to myself; though, all the time; and&#xD;
[know it now. Must I say it to you?"&#xD;
"Yes," he answered; "say it to me."&#xD;
She smiled and drew nearer to him.&#xD;
"Put your arms around me, then," she&#xD;
aid. "That is the way, you know. l~ow&#xD;
et me lay my head down-so. If I forget&#xD;
ome of it, yen will not mind?"&#xD;
"Na, no."&#xD;
"Listen, then." And with his arms&#xD;
ound her, and her head resting on his&#xD;
shoulder, she began in a soft, low voice the&#xD;
erses he had repeated long before, in that&#xD;
une twilight on the river:&#xD;

When she finiiAhed, she glanced up into&#xD;
his face, but he was speechless. The sweet-&#xD;
ness of the past, and the anguish of the&#xD;
present, were too much for him. He drew&#xD;
in his breath with a quick, gasping sound,&#xD;
but he uttered not a word; and, after a mo-&#xD;
ment, she spoke again.&#xD;
"Are you not going to praise me, Phil-&#xD;
ip?" she asked, half reproachfully. "I&#xD;
have said it-.-ah, so often 1-to myself! and&#xD;
I thought you would be sure to tell me you&#xD;
were glad. I hiive never said it to any one&#xD;
but you-never."&#xD;
lie looked up at Constance, who stood&#xD;
behind the sofa.&#xD;
"My God! How will I ever bear it?"&#xD;
he asked.&#xD;
"Bear it as I have done-for her sake,"&#xD;
she answered, in her quiet voice. "See!&#xD;
she is pained that you do not answer.&#xD;
Speak to her."&#xD;
He bent his head down then, and spoke&#xD;
to her. What he said neither of the others&#xD;
heard, but it seemed to satisfy her entirely.&#xD;
She leaned back on her cushions with a&#xD;
smile, and scarcely heeded that he bent his&#xD;
face down in her loose masses of hair, while&#xD;
his whole frame shook with convulsive emo-&#xD;
* tion that seemed caused by the strong heaves&#xD;
of the heart throbbing so mightily in its&#xD;
love auddespair. Despite this, Mabel wan-&#xD;
* dared on with astreain of talk; and after a&#xD;
while be grew composed enQugh to answer&#xD;
her, and strive to discover how far her mind&#xD;
was sane, and how fa~ overthrown. But&#xD;
he made little progress. Questions that she&#xD;
could not answer troubled her; and he .wa~'&#xD;
forced at last to see for himself; whatothera&#xD;
had seen before him, that the very milduesa&#xD;
of the malady made it the more hopeless of&#xD;
cure~ Save in her recollection of one or&#xD;
two people, the past was all a blank to her;&#xD;
and he found that the endeavor to lead her&#xD;
mind baek to any portion of it was utterly&#xD;
fruitless. Plainly, indeed, the effort did&#xD;
&#xD;
more harm than good; and when he rose at&#xD;
last to go, it was with a .heart sorer by&#xD;
much than when he had entered.&#xD;
"Come again, Philip-come again, very&#xD;
soon. Don't stay away long," were Mabel's&#xD;
last words; and the pleading look which ac-&#xD;
companied them followed him all the way&#xD;
to his hotel.&#xD;
When he reached there, the first piece&#xD;
of information he received was that a gen-&#xD;
tleman had called, and was waiting for him.&#xD;
The gentleman himself coming forward, he&#xD;
was surprised to see an absolute stranger-&#xD;
a dapper little man, very carefully and pre-&#xD;
cisely dressed, who bowed in acknowledg-&#xD;
ment of his interrogative glance.&#xD;
"Mr. Conway, I presume?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Conway," Philip answered.&#xD;
"I have called on private business," said&#xD;
the other. "If you will show me to your&#xD;
own room, I will explain it."&#xD;
Conway felt too thoroughly indifferent&#xD;
to trouble himself with a single conjecture&#xD;
*about the nature of the business thus unex-&#xD;
pectedly announced, but led the way at&#xD;
once to hig room. After they entered, the&#xD;
stranger declined a chair, and, drawing some&#xD;
papers from his pocket, laid them on the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
"I had the honor to be the lawyer of&#xD;
the late Mr. Ainslie, sir," he said, "and his&#xD;
last instructions were deposited in my&#xD;
hands. Among others, was a letter for&#xD;
yourself; which I thought it beet to deliver&#xD;
,in person."&#xD;
More was said, but Conway had a very&#xD;
faint idea at the time, and a still fainter re-&#xD;
membrance afterward, of what it was. When&#xD;
at last the man took a ceremonious depart-&#xD;
ure, h~ was glad to sit. dowi?, for he felt&#xD;
strangely confused and giddy. Events had&#xD;
succeeded each other so rapidly that the&#xD;
pewer of realizing them seemed to have&#xD;
passed from him. Even with the dead&#xD;
man's letter before him, he could not bring&#xD;
himself to a realization of all that had hap~&#xD;
pened, It was a long time before be could&#xD;
fnrqe himself to take up the sheet of paper&#xD;
-business-looking paper, covered with a&#xD;
lawyer'a smooth handwriting.-..-and open it.&#xD;
When he did so, lie saw that It began~ very&#xD;
abruptly, thus:&#xD;

&#xD;
THE EVIL THAT MEN K&#xD;
"CoNwAY: When this letter is placed&#xD;
in your hands, you can afford to read it,&#xD;
since I shall then be beyond the reach of&#xD;
your resentment or your forgiveness. The&#xD;
doctors tell me that I cannot live more than&#xD;
a few hours, and my own sensations assure&#xD;
me that I have not even that much of life to&#xD;
reckon confidently upon. Don't misunder-&#xD;
stand me. Don't think I write this t9 ask&#xD;
forgiveness, or to plead for any more kindly&#xD;
remembrance than you would have given if&#xD;
I had gone down to the grave with my lips&#xD;
closed. In your place, I should never par-&#xD;
don such an offence as the one you have&#xD;
suffered; and I know you well enough to&#xD;
ho sure that I will be as much the object of&#xD;
your execration at the rust moment of your&#xD;
life as I am now. Understanding this, you&#xD;
will believe that I write solely to make an&#xD;
explanation which you could never other-&#xD;
wise hear; and to speak the truth-not for&#xD;
my own sake, but for that of another-as a&#xD;
dying man may be supposed to speak it.&#xD;
It may' be unnecessary, as far as you are&#xD;
concerned, but, for the benefit of the evil-&#xD;
speaking world, I once for all solemnly af-&#xD;
firm that no one, save myself and my paid&#xD;
agents, was concerned in the abduction of&#xD;
Mabel Lee. She was utterly powerless and&#xD;
passive-as I will hereafter explain. Before&#xD;
doing so, however, I must go back briefly to&#xD;
my first meeting with her. You may re-&#xD;
member how much I was struck by her&#xD;
beauty; but of course you could not even&#xD;
have suspected that, from that hour, I deter-&#xD;
mined to win her; and, notwithstanding her&#xD;
instantaneous attraction toward yourself, I&#xD;
did not despair of doing ~o. Ugly as I am,&#xD;
I had tested my powers of fascination often&#xD;
enough to be sure that I might easily dis-&#xD;
tance you in a fair race. On my honor, I&#xD;
thought nothing besides this, until the mes-&#xD;
meric experiment. When I saw the aver-&#xD;
sion she seemed, in consequence of that, to&#xD;
conceive toward me, I could not but hesi-&#xD;
tate in my purpose. I hesitated especially&#xD;
about the portrait-painting, on which hinged&#xD;
all else-for, necessarily, if I had abandoned&#xD;
that, I should* have had no excuse for re-&#xD;
maining at Seyton House. Doubting. my&#xD;
own judgment very much, I consulted her&#xD;
sister. She encouraged me~ to hope that the&#xD;
&#xD;
DO LIVES AFTER THEM.&#xD;
dislike was only transient, and would pass&#xD;
away in time. So I remained-and you&#xD;
know the rest, almost as well asldo. You&#xD;
saw how her dislike faded away, and how&#xD;
day by day her manner to me grew more&#xD;
cordial. Of course, I was fully aware of her&#xD;
preoccupation with yourself; and I did not&#xD;
think for a moment that this change meant&#xD;
any faint weakening of love. But I did be-&#xD;
lieve, and I do still believe, thatifl could have&#xD;
removed her from your influence, I could&#xD;
soon have made her mine of her own free&#xD;
will and choice. Acting on this belief, I&#xD;
gradually conceived the idea of an abduc-&#xD;
tion. It was the only means of compassing&#xD;
the desired end in the desired manner; it&#xD;
was the only means of proving that I could&#xD;
make her far more in love with me, than&#xD;
she was in love with you then. Yet I pur~&#xD;
posely sounded you beforehand, honestly&#xD;
meaning to relinquish the project if I found&#xD;
you deeply attached to her. And what.did&#xD;
I hear? Only the careless jargon of the&#xD;
day; the flippant talk of convenience and&#xD;
bon~lage; the mere bubble froth of a fancy,&#xD;
which the next new toy would replace. I&#xD;
could not harm you by depriving you of&#xD;
any thing which you treated so lightly,&#xD;
I thought; and, even for her own sake, 1&#xD;
would do better to give her such love as&#xD;
mine-love that would have faced fire and&#xD;
sword for her-rather than a shallow fancy&#xD;
for her pretty face, like yours. After that,&#xD;
my last hesitation was at an end; and I laid&#xD;
my plans. The island ball gave me the op-&#xD;
portunity I desired, and I determined that,&#xD;
if possible, she should be carried off that&#xD;
night. It proved impossible; and was ne-&#xD;
cessarily postponed until the next day. You&#xD;
may remember how Fortune favored me&#xD;
then. Mr. Sexton kept you engaged, and&#xD;
Harding went off alone. I wasintheterrace,&#xD;
and it was easy to go down the face of the&#xD;
bluff-the boat was moored at the foot. I&#xD;
got in, kept along the shore, and, quite un-&#xD;
seen, reached Mrs. Lee's garden. There&#xD;
again Fortune favored me, for I found Mabel&#xD;
alone. After a good deal of persuasion, I&#xD;
induced her to take "a short row's with&#xD;
me. Once in the boat, I rowed rapidly&#xD;
down the stream, to a place where, accord-&#xD;
ing to my instructions, a carriage was to&#xD;

Mrs. Garland had given to Nowell was sul&#xD;
stantially repeated. Then the writer spob&#xD;
of the shock which Mabel's insanity ha&#xD;
been to him. "I had heard of her father,&#xD;
he said, "and the result of the mesmeric e~&#xD;
periment proved how highly strung was hc&#xD;
own nervous organization, but I never for&#xD;
moment dreaded, or in the least degre&#xD;
anticipated, such a conclusion to my schem&#xD;
as this. I did not appreciate, in even th&#xD;
least degree, what such a shock to such&#xD;
mind would inevitably cause. I intended t&#xD;
take her to Europe, and see what the phy&#xD;
sicians of France and Germany could do fo&#xD;
her; but business arrangements delayed m&#xD;
-and this is the end. Perhaps it is bette&#xD;
so; perhaps my dream was only a dream&#xD;

how long I would have toiled and suffered&#xD;
for one tithe of the love she gives to you-&#xD;
and let the remembrance teach you some-&#xD;
thing of her value.&#xD;
"Now I have finished. Now you know&#xD;
the whole story. Once more, as at the be.&#xD;

ask your forgiveness; and also that I never&#xD;

ship stirred suddenly at his heart. The&#xD;
thought that, with all its faults and all its&#xD;
virtues, this soul stood now before the bar&#xD;
of God, hushed on his lips any thing like&#xD;
those execrations of which the letter spoke.&#xD;
On the contrary, he laid his hand down up-&#xD;
on the open page, and bent his head over it&#xD;
reverently.&#xD;
"God forgive him!" he said, half aloud.&#xD;
"God forgive him-as I do!"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXYIII.&#xD;
INTO THE SUNLIGHT.&#xD;

t&#xD;
I&#xD;
e&#xD;
]&#xD;
&#xD;
:- "PHIL," said Mr. Seyton, as they walked&#xD;
r slowly along the street, a day or two after-&#xD;
a ward, "Phil, the doctors here give no hope&#xD;
e whatever of Mabel's recovery; but I have&#xD;
e determined not to rest satisfied with their&#xD;
e decision."&#xD;
a Conway started out of a fit of abstrac-&#xD;
o tion, and looked at his uncle. Hope had so&#xD;
entirely deserted him, that he could not&#xD;
r conceive how Mr. Seyton still ~lung to it;&#xD;
a but then it was not his part to echo the&#xD;
L' opinion of the doctors, so be only asked,&#xD;
with a sort of weary indifference-&#xD;
"What do you mean to do, sir?"&#xD;
"I have been thinking about it," said&#xD;
* Mr. Seyton. "I mean to take her where&#xD;
the best science of the world is to be found&#xD;
-in other words, to Paris."&#xD;
"You mean to take her there I"&#xD;
*    "Yes. If her mother will consent-and&#xD;
* I don't think there is any doubt of that-I&#xD;
will take her as soon as possible."&#xD;
Conway shook his head.&#xD;
"I can't see the good of it," he said.&#xD;
"Believe me, sir, the doctors in Paris will&#xD;
tell you exactly what the doctors in Charles-&#xD;
ton have done."&#xD;
"Then I will go to Germany, or to Lon-&#xD;
don, or to anywhere else, where a medical&#xD;
faculty exists," said Mr. Seyton, firmly. "If&#xD;
all else fail, I shall even follow Dr. R-'s&#xD;
advice, and see if mesmerism, which crazed,&#xD;
cannot also, by judicious application, cure&#xD;
her. You may be sure of one thing, Phil-.-&#xD;
I shall never give up trying. It was you&#xD;
who said that, when she was lost, and I&#xD;
despaired of her return: now our positions&#xD;
are reversed. :Now, you despair, and I&#xD;
hope-I, by God's help, yet mean to accom-&#xD;
plish that for which I hope."&#xD;
"Even so, sir," said Conway. "I can-&#xD;
not think you will succeed, hut God's help&#xD;
be with yqu!"&#xD;
So it 1.iras settled. Mrs. Lee readily&#xD;
eon~ented to any thing which held out the&#xD;
faintest promise of ultimate cure; and it&#xD;
was decided that she should return to Ayre,&#xD;
&#xD;
with Kowell, while Mr. Seyton sailed for&#xD;
Europe with Constance and MabeL For a&#xD;
while, Conway made arrangements to ac-&#xD;
company them; but the only one of the&#xD;
doctors who gave any encouragement to the&#xD;
project negative that at once. "I have&#xD;
not much hope in the medical science on&#xD;
the other side of the water," he said; "but&#xD;
change of scene, and entire separation from&#xD;
all the associations connected with her&#xD;
malady, may perhaps right her mind in&#xD;
time. There is no telling; but, at least, if&#xD;
the experiment is made at all, it should be&#xD;
fairly tested. Now, you are one of these&#xD;
associations, Mr. Conway; and your pres-&#xD;
ence must necessarily recall a great deal she&#xD;
had better forget, since you are interwoven&#xD;
with all the events that have ended so dis-&#xD;
astrously. Therefore, once for all, you&#xD;
must not accompany her to Europe. You&#xD;
must stay in America, or go to Asia or&#xD;
Africa, if you desire, but you must not&#xD;
cross her path until she is entirely recov-&#xD;
ered-if indeed recovery is possible. Un-&#xD;
derstand that this is final." It was not&#xD;
so final but that Conway stoutly rebelled&#xD;
against it, though he was at last overruled.&#xD;
"No, you must stay,~~ said Mr. Seyton.&#xD;
"The doctor is right-I can fully appreciate&#xD;
that. If she recovers at all, it will be with&#xD;
those whom she has known all her life, and&#xD;
who are not prominently associated with&#xD;
these things of which the doctor speaks.&#xD;
Not another word, Phil !-you must stay."&#xD;
Conway looked at Constance; but he&#xD;
found no encouragement there. Her stead-&#xD;
fast gray eyes met his with the same re-&#xD;
solve in them. "You must stay," she said.&#xD;
"Think for a moment of the harm your&#xD;
presence might do, and then you will see&#xD;
the necessity as plainly as we. You must&#xD;
stay."&#xD;
"But I might go, and be within reach,&#xD;
,seehg her."&#xD;
"Impossible. You would end by seeing&#xD;
her, and perhaps undoing any good that&#xD;
might have been done. No, the risk should&#xD;
not be run and the Atlantic had better be&#xD;
between you.~~&#xD;
"It must be between them," said Mr.&#xD;
Seyton.-" Don't let me hear any more of&#xD;
this, Phil. Go down to Seyton House, and&#xD;
&#xD;
take care of things while I am absent. You&#xD;
owe me that, I think; and you ought to&#xD;
grow accustomed to your duties before they&#xD;
are thrown for good and for all on your&#xD;
shoulders. I have only one request to make&#xD;
-don't quarrel with Blake."&#xD;
"I think you may tr~ist me, sir. In my&#xD;
present mood, he might burn the house&#xD;
over my head, and I should not question&#xD;
the expediency of doing so."&#xD;
"You will get over that,~~ said Mr. Sey-&#xD;
ton; "especially if we tire able to send yen&#xD;
cheering news. I am glad Adela is in Paris.&#xD;
She will be able to assist us materially.&#xD;
When we return, I shall bring her back&#xD;
with me-for good."&#xD;
The young man's eyes suddenly softened&#xD;
and moistened in a peculiar way they had.&#xD;
"My poor mother!" he said. "She will&#xD;
be overjoyed to see you, sir; and pray tell&#xD;
her every thing. She has wonderful brains&#xD;
for a woman, and can help you, I am sure.&#xD;
As for me, if I must stay behind, like a use-&#xD;
less log, I must-that is all."&#xD;
After this, preparations were hurried&#xD;
forward, and in a few days the outward-&#xD;
bound trio were quite ready. It was only&#xD;
at the last moment that Mabel was told that&#xD;
she was going. She made no difficulty, as&#xD;
they had half feared she would; but only&#xD;
looked up at Conway with a smile. "Are&#xD;
you going, too?" she asked.&#xD;
"Not now," he answered, with a sharp&#xD;
pang; "but you will not be gone very long;&#xD;
and, when you come back, I shall be waiting&#xD;
for you. You must try and get well. The&#xD;
sooner you get well, the sooner we shall&#xD;
meet again. Remember that."&#xD;
"But am I not well, now? What is the&#xD;
matter with me?"&#xD;
"The carriage is ready," said Mr. Seyton,&#xD;
breaking in abruptly; and, without answer-&#xD;
ing her question, Conway led her down.&#xD;
An hour or two later, he stood on the&#xD;
dock watching the steamer that bore her,&#xD;
as it steamed out of the harbor. The last&#xD;
face he saw distinctly was hers-still turned&#xD;
toward him, and the land where he re-&#xD;
mained, as she was carried faster and faster&#xD;
away.&#xD;
When he turned round, he was surprised&#xD;
to see Nowell behind him. They had met&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8069-00000084"/>&#xD;
160                         MABEL LEE.                                                            INTO THE SUNLIGHT.                     1@1&#xD;
&#xD;
before, but not cordially; and there was&#xD;
ground for hisastonishment when the latter&#xD;
said, "I have put my aunt in the carriage,&#xD;
and sent her oIf Mr. Conway; if you have&#xD;
no objection, we will walk back together."&#xD;
"Certainlj," said Conway; and, with&#xD;
one last glance at the vanishing steamer,&#xD;
they turned away from the dock, and set&#xD;
their faces cityward. They walked on for&#xD;
some time in silence, and then Nowell spoke&#xD;
abruptly-spoke very~ much as Mr. Blake&#xD;
had spoken before him.&#xD;
"I atn not a man who knows very well&#xD;
how to do a graceful thing, Mr. Conway;&#xD;
but at least I hope I know how to do an&#xD;
honest one. Now, it has been on my mind&#xD;
for some time to retract a good many offen-&#xD;
sive things I said to you. Of course I dis-&#xD;
covered long since that my suspicions were&#xD;
entirely unfounded. Ton bore my charges&#xD;
more patiently than might have been ex~&#xD;
pected; and I now apologize for them, fully&#xD;
and freely. If, after this, you wish to re-&#xD;
sent them, I am at your service. If not, we&#xD;
are never likely to be friends, but at least&#xD;
we need not be enemies."&#xD;
"I have not the least desire to resent&#xD;
them, I assure you," said Conway, smiling,&#xD;
for the fire-eating proclivities of the other&#xD;
rather amused him. "They were very nat-&#xD;
ural, I thi~k; only for once you let preju-&#xD;
dine weigh more than proof. In your place,&#xD;
I might have done the same; and, if you had&#xD;
charged me with the blackest crime in the&#xD;
decalogue, I am sure I could forgive it&#xD;
heartily, for I am not likely to forget that it&#xD;
~was you, not I, who found her."&#xD;
* Nowell bent his head.&#xD;
"Yes, I found her," he said, and there&#xD;
was no little bitterness in th~ tone. "I&#xD;
found her-for you."&#xD;
"God only knows that," said the other;&#xD;
"for Tie only knows whether or not she&#xD;
will ever be herself again. We can only&#xD;
hope; and meanwhile-I am sorry to hear&#xD;
you say that we are never likely to be&#xD;
friends. Why not?"&#xD;
"For a good many reasons," answered&#xD;
Nowell, as coldly as ever. "We have noth-&#xD;
ing in common, for one. But, as I said be-&#xD;
fore, we need not be enemies and we can&#xD;
at least respect each other."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am determined that we shall do more&#xD;
than that; I am determined that we shall&#xD;
also like each other."&#xD;
Nowell smiled faintly in his dry, cold&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"You will accomplish a prodigy then,"&#xD;
he said. "It was a wise man who said first&#xD;
that nothing isimpossible, however; twenty&#xD;
years hence, we . may like each other. In&#xD;
the mean time, my duty is done, and I must&#xD;
leave you, for I have business here. Good-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
'He stopped as he spoke, in front of a&#xD;
lawyer's office, and, be fore Cenway could do&#xD;
more than echo his salutation, vanished.&#xD;
"His duty done," repeated the latter, as&#xD;
he pursued his way. "I congratulate him on&#xD;
that, for mine is yet to come. I must write&#xD;
at once and make the amende 1ionora1~le to&#xD;
poor Cyril. I wonder if he will ever forgive&#xD;
me I-and yet the fault was not mine. How&#xD;
far astray we all went!"&#xD;
How far, indeed; and yet already the&#xD;
dawn of the brighter day appeared; already&#xD;
the clouds of suspicion fled back into the&#xD;
past -forsaking even that lonely grave&#xD;
where, under the bloom of the magnolias,&#xD;
Ainslie slept.&#xD;
Months ~rolled by, and still the Seyton&#xD;
party remained abroad, sending many bulle-&#xD;
tins home, yet speaking guardedly and cau-&#xD;
tiously of Mabel in all of them. The medi-&#xD;
cal men gave very little hope, they said, but&#xD;
still did not absolutely declare the malady&#xD;
incurable. They prescribed perfect rest,&#xD;
and entire absence from any associations&#xD;
recalling the past. But of the future they&#xD;
were absolutely reticent, and promised&#xD;
nothing. She might recover, or she might&#xD;
not; the case was a singular one, and there&#xD;
was little experience bearing upon it. In&#xD;
Mabel herself there was scarcely any change&#xD;
reported, even when six months had gone&#xD;
by. She was still as gentle and passive&#xD;
as ever, and still asked incessantly for&#xD;
"Philip "-that was, all. At the end of the&#xD;
year, Mr. Seyton left her and Constance in&#xD;
Paris with Mrs. Conway, and came over for&#xD;
Mrs. Lee. Then, once more, Conway pe-&#xD;
titioned eagerly to accompany them back;&#xD;
but his uncle would not listen to it. "We&#xD;
&#xD;
hope and trust she is somewhat better," he&#xD;
said. "She has ceased to mention, and&#xD;
~eems to have forgotten you-which the&#xD;
doctors think a good sign. We must not&#xD;
tamper with her by any risk. Stay where&#xD;
you are." So once more the ehafing, impa-&#xD;
tient heart was left behind in its enfQrced&#xD;
quietude, while the others sailed away-far&#xD;
away, toward the distant city where Mabel&#xD;
sojourned.&#xD;
In the course of the next few months,&#xD;
the letters grew more encouraging in their&#xD;
tone. The doctors began to give more de-&#xD;
cided leave for hope. Mabel's mind seemed&#xD;
to be gradually clearing of its mist, and ac-&#xD;
quiring something of the vigor of health.&#xD;
She took interest in her old occupations,&#xD;
and entered into amusements and pleasures&#xD;
with some faint shade of appreciation.&#xD;
She began4d recall very distinctly the things&#xD;
and people of her past life-always ex-&#xD;
cepting the period which commenced with&#xD;
Conway's arrival at Seyton House, and&#xD;
ended with her own coming to Paris. When&#xD;
the second, summer of her absence came&#xD;
round, Mr. Seyton wrote that the doctors&#xD;
prescribed travel and change of scene; so&#xD;
the whole party were going to Switzerland,&#xD;
and thence to any place Mabel might desire.&#xD;
From Switzerland the news grew even more&#xD;
cheering. "These glorious mountain re-&#xD;
gions have seemed to do her more good than&#xD;
any thing else," 4Jor~tance wrote. "Her&#xD;
first reat intereet-by that, I mean interest&#xD;
which isnot inerelysimulatedtogive'us~Aeas-&#xD;
ure, butis born of her own sensationa-has&#xD;
beenshown here. Sheiseheerful always, and&#xD;
sometimes even gay; but occasionally that&#xD;
dark cloud of melancholy steals over her, and&#xD;
then I tremble. The danger is not past yet.&#xD;
But she can almost always be roused from&#xD;
her depression, which was not formerly the&#xD;
case; and she seems, at other times, to have&#xD;
recovered much of her old sunny disposition.&#xD;
Her physical. health is, thank God, entirely&#xD;
perfect."&#xD;
And so the summer passed, and, when&#xD;
the fall came, instead of turning their faces&#xD;
toward Paris again, they wenton into Italy,&#xD;
at Mabel's own request. The winter was&#xD;
spent in Rome, andy in the spring, they&#xD;
began for the first time to speak of return-&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
ing home. Mabel was quite her old self,&#xD;
the letters which announced this re~o1utio~&#xD;
said; had entirely recovered, save in the&#xD;
single respect of totallyforgetting the period&#xD;
of time before meutioued. The efforts to&#xD;
lead her memory hack to. this h~d felled&#xD;
utterly. It was a perfect :blaulc-,-a space&#xD;
that seemed to have lapsed out of' her life.&#xD;
This weakness, the ph~rsieians said, would&#xD;
never be cured; but otherwise they pro-&#xD;
nounced her mind to be once more perfectly&#xD;
healthy and well-balanced. So at laet~ tw~&#xD;
years and a half after she left Charleston,&#xD;
Mabel was coming back to her native place,&#xD;
and the people of Ayre rejoiced over the&#xD;
news as they might have rejoiced over the&#xD;
raising of one from the dead.&#xD;
The retu.rning party landed in May, and,&#xD;
strangely enough, it was on the same day&#xD;
of the month when Philip Conway had&#xD;
reached Seyton House three years before,&#xD;
that they entered Ayre. He who hadhorne&#xD;
this long separation so well, had been for-&#xD;
bidden to meet them, so he remained at the&#xD;
house, and was pacing the front portico&#xD;
with impatient steps, when a travelling-car-&#xD;
riage drove up. By the time he reached&#xD;
it, his uncle was handing out a lady,' and&#xD;
the next moment he was in h~s mother's&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
After the first greeting, his questions&#xD;
were all of Mabel. How had she borne it?&#xD;
How had she stood the test of return?&#xD;
"Admirably well," his mother ,said~&#xD;
"She remembered every thing perfectly;&#xD;
and, seemed deeply affected by the joy which&#xD;
every pue testified at seeing her. Despite&#xD;
all prohibitions, there was a perfect ev&amp;amp;ti~a&#xD;
of welcome, an~l, in the midst of it, they&#xD;
scarcely noticed me, who have not been&#xD;
here for twenty years or more."&#xD;
"Ah, but you went away very differ-&#xD;
ently, Adela," said Mr Seyton, with a sigh.&#xD;
"Yes, she has stood it better even than we&#xD;
dared to hope, but the test will be when she&#xD;
meets you, Phil. I tremble for the result.&#xD;
I almost fear we have done wrong to try&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"No," said Conway. "You have done&#xD;
right. If her miifd is perfectly reeLor.~~&#xD;
there will be no danger. If not, it is better&#xD;
to know it~ The question is, will she reeog-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
nize~ me, or shall I have to meet her as a&#xD;
stranger?"&#xD;
Both the others shook their heads. They&#xD;
could not tell that. Time would have to&#xD;
show; and meanwhile he must be patient a&#xD;
little longer. He could not see her that&#xD;
day; she had had excitement enough; ho&#xD;
must wait until the next.&#xD;
So the heart which had borne so much,&#xD;
bore also this last delay, which was perhaps&#xD;
the hardest of all. But the next morning&#xD;
early, a message was sent into the town to&#xD;
prepare Constance for his coming, and bid&#xD;
h~r arrange that he should meet. Mabel, ap-&#xD;
parently at least, alone. A little later he&#xD;
entered the boat, and rowed past the gar-&#xD;
dens where he had first met her, past the&#xD;
island where the midsummer-night pavilion&#xD;
yet stood, past the willow-edged banks by&#xD;
which they had fio~ted so often together,&#xD;
until he reached the well-known steps at the&#xD;
foot of Mrs. Lee's garden. Then, for the&#xD;
first time, his heart ~'ailed him. What if the&#xD;
experiment should, after all, i~esu1t disas-&#xD;
trously? What if the shock should bring&#xD;
back her insanity? He hesitated, faltered,&#xD;
almost turned back; might indeed have&#xD;
done so, if he had not heard a clear voice&#xD;
lilting a song he knew well-a song Mabel&#xD;
had often sung for him in the days that&#xD;
seemed so very far away. It was only a&#xD;
stanza that floated down ~to his ear, on the&#xD;
soft May air; but, when it ended, his irres-&#xD;
olution was gone.. He forgot the weary 1&#xD;
years of absence, the long estrangement, the&#xD;
cruel cloud, that had been between them;&#xD;
he only thought of her as he first saw her,&#xD;
hi the spring-tide freshness of her beauty&#xD;
&#xD;
and grace. 'The next moment he sprang up&#xD;
the steps, and walked along the garden-path.&#xD;
He had not gone far, before he stepped ab-&#xD;
ruptly-she was there !~&#xD;
Yes, she was there, sitting on a low seat&#xD;
beneath a rose-bush, as fair and fresh and&#xD;
lovely~ as his fancy had pictured her, five&#xD;
minutes before-sitting with the tender&#xD;
green of the foliage, and the tinted petals of&#xD;
the blossoms, all around her-a vision that&#xD;
might have stirred a heart of stone.&#xD;
He paused, but she had heard his step,&#xD;
and looked up. His heart seemed to make&#xD;
one bound, and then stand still, for on the&#xD;
next moment hinged every thing they hoped&#xD;
or feared. She gazed at him~for an instant,&#xD;
with half wonder, half-struggling recogni-&#xD;
tion in her eyes. And then she held out&#xD;
her hands with a cry. "Philip I" she said,&#xD;
and, when he sprang forward, she fell faint-&#xD;
ing into his arms.&#xD;
Instantly a group that had been am-&#xD;
bushed in the arbor-Constance, Mrs. Con-&#xD;
way, and Mr. Seyton-rushed forth, in wild&#xD;
alarm. But he beckoned them back,~ and&#xD;
bent over her, calling her name in every&#xD;
tender tone. The swoon was very slight,&#xD;
for, after a moment, she recovered sufficient-&#xD;
ly to open her eyes and look at him-won-&#xD;
deringly, it seemed.&#xD;
"My love, my love," he said, "do you not&#xD;
know me?" I promised to meet you, -and I&#xD;
am here-yours, youi~ only and forever!"&#xD;
Then a smile, bright as an angers, came&#xD;
over her face.&#xD;
"Philip!" she repeated; and that was&#xD;
all that she said, but it told every thing,&#xD;
and ended their fears forever.&#xD;

One volume, paper covers, with four Illustrations, price, $i.OO; cloth, $1.50.&#xD;
"'Morton House' proves to us that at last we have a writer who understands her&#xD;
public. The story is located in the South; yet there is not a word of glorification&#xD;
of lost institutions or lost causes. This species of rubbish is ~simply brushed aside,&#xD;
and we have society as it is-not a brawling debating club, but an assemblage of&#xD;
individuals concerned in the ordinary ways of life. The plot serves; is thoroughly&#xD;
sensational, and yet tolerably reasonable. The characterizations are good-the con-&#xD;
versation is excellent. Above all, the tone is healthy and unostentatiously American.&#xD;
For the sake of our literature, we trust that the author will not pause in her new&#xD;
career, which certainly opens with the bravest promise."~Henry Ward .L'eeclser'e&#xD;

"One of the most brilliant writers whom the South has produced, * * * There&#xD;
is intense power in many of the scenes."-N. Y~ Eveniz~q Mail.&#xD;
"A very readable story. The interest is sustained from the flr~t suggestion of&#xD;
mystery to the final dinogment."-Bogo,~ Ckri.,tian .Iegieler.&#xD;
"There is so much freshness in the tone, so much nature in the personages, and&#xD;
so much interest in the story, that 'Mortox~ House,' so neatly printed and well illus-&#xD;
trated, is one of the most attractive of Appleton &amp;amp; Co.'s standard novels. It has the&#xD;
topping merit of being very readable."-Boson 7i~anscript.&#xD;
"The plot and characterization of this~ story are more than good. They are&#xD;
marked by great force and~originality. Few finer specimens of manhood have ever&#xD;
been conceived than the two suitors of the heroine. The author has shown an&#xD;
elevation of sentiment and good taste, combined with an reflective style."-.-.PMIa.&#xD;

"A charming picture of life in the South."- Wilmington (N. 6'.) Star.&#xD;

graphic and true to nature. There is a fascination in all she writes, that betokens&#xD;
an original genius."-.&amp;amp;deimore American.&#xD;
"The author of 'Morton House' has the genuine dramatic perceptions which&#xD;
are indispensable to whoever would depict human character; and she is possessed&#xD;
of a literary style which is rarely found except in conjunction with other and higher&#xD;
mental qualities. In natural, easy, and graceful dialogue, we do not know a single&#xD;
living writer who surpasses her. Her books are interesting from beginning to end,&#xD;
and there are few pages which the zuost inveterate novel.reader will feel disposed to&#xD;
skip."-The Eclectic Magazine for J~znuary, 18'12.&#xD;
